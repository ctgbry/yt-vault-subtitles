[00:00]
okay I think I'm
live hello all right hello YouTube
LinkedIn X my regular camera is not
working so I've got my stupid webcam on
um it doesn't look great but I don't
know what else to do so we're just gonna
have to roll with it um gonna screen
anyway so it shouldn't be that big of a
deal but let me know in the comments if
you're in here because it's kind of I've
never scheduled a live stream
um anyone in
here weird because this is this is new
to me

[01:06]
I think we're okay hey
okay Matthew Micah J and North Texas
fairy said yeah there there's a okay
there's a there's a lag whatever my
camera's not working and my camera is my
iPhone I use iPhone on continuity camera
because I'm cheap I don't want to spend
$800 on a fancy camera um and it's just
not it's just not working so uh
whatever um this is my webcam but I'm
going to share my screen for most of the
time anyway so we're going to give it a
couple more minutes for people to come
in got 17 in here I mean a little but
that's kind of an an atth for me alltime
high if you uh all right video is choppy
that's good feedback let me see if I can
fix that um I think I

[02:02]
fix that um I think I
can uh let me look at the settings I'm
just gonna it's gonna be a little it's
gonna be a second let me
see like this um standard resolution so
I think I kind of have to have the video
crappy or else really bad um
[Music]
live
stream yeah it's it should be 1080p
that's the highest I can go but uh what
are you gonna do so we're GNA roll with
it uh um okay hey Lyla uh uhuh
Brian I'm just going to get started

[03:00]
Brian I'm just going to get started
because I hate being late and so I don't
like it when others are late and I don't
want this to take all day
so backing up so I sent an email to my
newsletter
saying which home service idea should I
validate and I gave
them I gave them these options dumpster
rental junk removal pressure washing
Landscaping tree trimming Roofing house
painting fencing eight options and
Landscaping was the least voted for
dumpster rental was the most um and then
second place was pressure washing then
fencing then junk removal and Roofing
were tied um then house painting then
tree trimming than Landscaping so my
thesis for picking these what seems to
be hot right now what do people seem to
be interested in right now what are some
are high ticket some are low ticket some
have high startup costs some don't I
just wanted a good mix um so dumpster
rental one with 304 votes so that's what
we're going to do so I've done a little
prep work today um I use outs scraper

[04:01]
prep work today um I use outs scraper
for everything um everything and I have
no affiliation with the company other
than I have an affiliate link and I make
like a dollar every time someone uses it
so I'm pretty clever if you go to use
outscar
docomo you to outscar doom and you will
get a discount and I will get a couple
bucks so um use outscar
docomo scrape stuff and it's super cheap
and it works really fast so I went ahead
and like I did the the old uh cooking
show Trick where I scraped stuff in
advance so we wouldn't have to wait for
it but I'll show you what I did and I'll
tell you how and why I did it um I just
I was trying to save time so uh here's
what I'm gonna
do I I randomly picked a state that I
hear around my house very often and
that's Ohio because for some reason my
kids always say skibby Ohio and I don't
what that mean I don't know what that
means but um Ohio gets a lot of crap for
whatever reason I don't think it's that
bad and so I just picked Ohio and Ohio
is also interesting because it has three
four or five cities that are like

[05:01]
four or five cities that are like
midsize by midsize I consider to be two
to 400,000 people so Columbus is the
biggest and then you've got Cincinnati
Cleveland Toledo Dayton okay so we are
going to be looking at six cities three
within Ohio and three outside of Ohio
but in neighboring is states and cities
of comparable sizes and so we're going
to look at Cleveland Cincinnati and
Toledo uh all of those have between two
and 400,000 people and then going to
look at Madison Wisconsin Grand Rapids
Michigan
and Fort Wayne Indiana okay and I'm
going to show you all this data and why
I thought to pull up this data so I'm
not going to look at the YouTube
questions that often because it gets
pretty distracting so I'm just going to
roll with it I'm gonna talk a ton and
then I'm gonna pause look at questions
answer them as best I can and then keep
going okay so we are trying to validate

[06:00]
going okay so we are trying to validate
if starting from scratch a dumpster
rental business in one of these three
Ohio cities is viable okay maybe you
live in Cleveland and you want to
measure um Cincinnati and Toledo maybe
you're saying hey I'm G to move to any
of those three cities because I'm going
all in on this business and I want to
pick the one that's best This research
will fit both of those scenarios and
they will fit any state and any home
service industry so just copy and paste
okay um all right I'm going to look at
some questions real quick and then I
will share my
screen
um okay all right here we go so I'm GNA
share my
screen presentation what is
that okay

[07:07]
all
right so I'm gonna get off
that all right you should be seeing my
screen right now and there's going to be
a delay so if you can see my screen just
let me know um once I see that I will
proceed
also if like if it's choppy or whatever
and it's hard to follow I'm going to I'm
going to be editing this and posting it
to YouTube and like the edit version
will look great because it's all
recording in quality just the live
stream isn't the best so everyone see my
screen
okay all right thank you Louis okay
here's here's what we're doing so here's
the poll this what I was talking about
okay cool just for proof um I'm not
trying to leave everyone towards

[08:00]
trying to leave everyone towards
dumpster Ral I have no affiliation with
any dumpster rental business I just like
every time I tweet about it people love
it and it's hot right now for whatever
reason which probably means it's going
to be pretty saturated in a year or two
so I'm G to close that window and I am
going to go to um this Google sheet that
I have so this is the Google sheet that
I started putting together um and let's
go ahead and bold the cities in
Ohio and then the unbold cities are
outside of Ohio but in nearby States so
these are the cities these are the
populations uh this is the percentage
real estate growth now I use chat GPT
for most of this um so I don't know if
this is over the last decade or what but
I wanted to look at real estate growth
because in my opinion that's going to
cor how well Home Service businesses do
in the area I also want to look at the
economic growth in that City I also want
to look at the average home value
because that's going to dictate how much
you can charge and then right here

[09:00]
you can charge and then right here
here um oh I think I accidentally hid uh
a row let me unhide
that one
sec what is going
on all right average household income um
home ownership rate and this really
surprised me and I double checked it to
be sure Fort Wayne Indiana has a 66%
home ownership rate apparently the the
nation white average is closer to 65% so
I don't know I'm surprised by how many
of these are low and then I want a zip
code for each area just for convenience
because I'm going to be using those
zip list and thumbtack and then these
are the cells that I have yet to fill in
that we're going to fill in together so
I'm going to go to outs scra and I'm
going to start uh fresh here so let me
close these extra

[10:03]
windows and so I've been doing other
scraping today for stuff outside of this
but if you look at these scrapes that
say dumpster rental service specifically
from
the this and it's going to make you
squirm a bit and I will share this
Google sheet with everyone um I'll put
it in like the comment or in the uh
description on YouTube this is going to
be a little tedious but bear with me
this is a live stream right tune me out
I don't care and I'm going to export
these and I'm going to paste them into
I'm going to consolidate
them so here's the thing I assume you
can still see this um when you scrape
things from outs scraper the phone
number is the gold this is what we're
here for okay and I like working with
stuff in Google Sheets that's just me I
don't know call me a millennial but when
you paste these phone numbers into
Google Sheets Direct ly it formats them

[11:01]
Google Sheets Direct ly it formats them
really weird um from Google sheet so I
always have to remove the plus one in
the space and then the dash and another
thing that that does is it um
standardizes them just to make the
data um yeah see the phone number it's
dumb so we're going to go in here and
I'm going to do I'm going to do this all
at once so
so I exported the bottom
one and now I'm just going to export all
of them
boom boom so there should be six cities
here six exports for all six
cities so let's go to this top one and
you know what I amum I don't need all
this
data I just want ah I might as well get
all of it
so let's do

[12:03]
so let's do
this ah so dumb
now I could have put all these cities in
here
um and scrape them at once but I wanted
you to see like this tedious process um
so this is Indiana we haven't done
Indiana yet just making sure this is
right

[13:03]
this seems to be
Cincinnati all right so I've got one
market let's see how many I've done done
these four plus the one that I started
with so let's go
here
and let's let's go here that was the
first one the second
one Toledo okay I think this will be all
of
them all right so now I'm going to sort
these by city name just to make sure
that I have everything that I
want okay Cincinnati Cleveland Fort
Wayne Grand Rapids Cincinnati Cleveland

[14:01]
Wayne Grand Rapids Cincinnati Cleveland
Fort Wayne Grand Rapids Madison uh
Toledo Cincinnati
Cleveland uh Fort Wayne Grand rapin
Madison Toledo all right we've got all
six cities here and then we have a bunch
of scrapes that did not have a city like
there was just not enough data on Google
and then we have a bunch of like
outlying uh suburbs that Google Maps
picked up that we can't really account
for okay and so we can get as granular
as you want but I don't want this to
take six hours so I'm going to keep this
simple the populations I pulled were
only from the actual cities not from
like the Greater Cincinnati area
so I'm all the data true and so I'm
going to assume this is an assumption
that there is a similar percentage of
blank entries on all of these cities I
could be wrong right if I were starting
a business I would get much more
granular with this but I'm not this is

[15:00]
granular with this but I'm not this is
for instructional purposes only and so I
I'm going to
delete all the ones that don't have a
city and I'm going to delete all of the
ones outside of the ones that I want um
and then
I'm uh well I'm not going to delete the
ones with a phone number and I'll tell
you why in a minute but I am going to
remove uh this other stuff so I'm doing
plus one space replace all with nothing
and then I'm going to do the dash
replace all with
nothing okay now the phone numbers are
standard U I want to remove duplicates
but I don't want to remove these so look
at all these duplicates okay but you
know what I don't actually want to
remove these for this purpose because
this is a
mult we want to account for that yes so
that's kind of a big player in um in
Cincinnati so I want to account for all

[16:00]
Cincinnati so I want to account for all
their businesses so a lot of times I
remove duplicates based on what I'm
doing for this I'm not
so we're going to go here and I don't
know what is up with Google Sheets
lately but it's has not been letting me
paste as values only
um I don't know what's going
on see it lets me paste them but then
there's always merged cells and it gets
really annoying so
whatever all right so here's our data
directly in Google Sheets I'm going to
pause real quick and hop over to YouTube
if you're streaming on LinkedIn I'm not
going to be able to look at your
questions um so head over to YouTube if
you want to ask
something all right right now okay um
back to the Google sheet okay so we can
do a pivot table we can get fancy with
this I'm not going to do that I'm just

[17:00]
this I'm not going to do that I'm just
going to Simply count by city so
Cincinnati has
17 okay and I'm just going to do a quick
like a look
[Music]
over ones but junk removal a lot of
garbage collection services offer um
dumpster rentals so I'm not going to
delete any of these um I'm just simply
going to put the counts in so Cincinnati
we've got 17 Cleveland we've got
11 let's make this
easy
17 11 Fort Wayne Grand
Rapids Fort
Wayne 7 Grand Rapids
7741 all right

[18:01]
okay so let's go ahead and get a
percentage okay now this isn't the best
percentage um but you can clearly
see okay
these are the cities um that are most or
least saturated so
Cincinnati if you go to Cincinnati it is
controlled and I will tell you I've
never done this before like I've done
this process but I've never done it
with this is actually really fascinating
um what is this company
again rumy so rumy has a pretty pretty

[19:01]
again rumy so rumy has a pretty pretty
strong foothold on this Market um so
Cincinnati has the
most and it's also the most saturated
Toledo um second most saturated and then
Madison
Wisconsin gez four dumpster Ral
companies now keep in mind these are
colder cities um you will have to deal
with seasonality to some extent um
there obviously aren't going to be as
many people building or needing
dumpsters uh if it's you know covered
with snow outside but this is
fascinating to me already right we're
only a few minutes into this but we I
mean Madison Wisconsin has a great
economy it's a it's a college town
University of Wisconsin uh
12 average home value highest by far
crime rate lowest by far um average
house income highest home ownership rate

[20:01]
house income highest home ownership rate
middle of the
pack uh and it only has four so this
could be misleading okay so now we're
gonna go we're gonna pull up Madison
Wisconsin I mean we could stop this
right now and this is kind of the 8020
we'll call
6040 let's look at
Madison
so I'm trying to see
so I mean all of these other five
examples are going to have their own
suburbs there's nothing over a 100,000
people here so immediately what this is
telling me is it's not like a
Minneapolis St Paul situation where
you've got two big cities right next to
each other Dallas Fort Worth Etc um in
fact the biggest suburb is only 36,000
which is a tenth of the population of

[21:01]
which is a tenth of the population of
Madison
um well an eighth so this is already
really promising this is looking good
for starting a dumpster rental business
in Madison Wisconsin but we're not done
we got to do more right we could unlock
something here in 20 30 minutes that
makes us want to steer clear so we're
going I'm going to show you Google LSA
so if you're unfamiliar with Google LSA
it is their answer to Thumbtack and
Angie's List they want to sell uh Home
Service leads or any business lead to um
business owners and they're doing a good
job of it and the leads are actually
really good we use them for our tree
business so I'm going to do this I'm
gonna go I did a little research this
morning on LSA and dumpster rental is
not a category so I'm GNA show you
this you go to Allen Texas Tree Service
um show
more and then you go more tree service
providers you got to kind of know where
to C
these are LSA

[22:01]
these are LSA
listings
um there's us that's us huh and then
here way down here are organic uh Tree
Service listings and so if I go look for
dumpster ryal it's not there uh Roofing
is there and so I can't really do this
LSA research um in a very clean way so
we're going to find a workaround so we
are going to say um
Madison Wisconsin dumpster rental
um we're going to look at more
businesses now okay this is Google
LSA Google will only show a maximum of
two LSA listings but we are learning
something here because there's only one
company in all of medison bidding on LSA

[23:00]
company in all of medison bidding on LSA
because if there were at least two then
it would list right here this is organic
this is paid because this is Google
guaranteed so we're gonna we're gonna go
with this okay and we're gonna add this
to our data um and we're going to go LSA
Madison okay now we're going to
say
so now this is sponsored so Google's
confusing because you can do Google ads
you can do Google LSA um you can do uh
performance ads you can do search ads
there's like six different ways you can
promote your home service business on
Google so this is what I'm looking at is
most likely um just like a Google ads
listing and not LSA because it doesn't
say Google guaranteed um let's try this
in a bigger Market to see how it looks
all right so this is exactly what I was

[24:01]
all right so this is exactly what I was
talking about it will only show you a
Max of two sponsored listings and so
we're going to we're going to go back
here we're still going to use
this and we're just going to call that
one then we're going to
go uh we're going to call that zero
because there's there's none so let's go
back here it's a little tedious um one
and then Cleveland is zero so now we
still got to do Fort Wayne Grand Rapid
and
Cincinnati
zero
okay okay so LSA in all of these markets
LSA is not it's just not very strong and
I'm not surprised because LSA is fairly
new they don't have a ton of market

[25:01]
new they don't have a ton of market
share yet Believe It or Not which means
it's an Arbitrage opportunity for you I
know people that have Home Service
businesses that wholly rely on Google
LSA they'll get a tree bid a tree lead
for $50 they close half of them um and
their average job is $800 so it's
basically $100 customer acquisition cost
you know 50% margins you're still making
about 300 bucks per job there are people
that just bid up all the areas and and
only rely on Google LSA so there is an
opportunity there but it doesn't give us
a lot for these markets um and we're
combining LSA and just normal Google
paid ads here so let's go to thumb teac
so I'm gonna open thumb teac and you
want to do this right because we're
doing research but we don't want these
businesses that we're researching to
have to spend money because of our
research so you have to do this the
right way if I were to type in dumpster
ryal Cleveland Ohio and then go through
like the process it would charge these

[26:00]
like the process it would charge these
businesses um just for like giving me a
quote a a good amount of money too
depends on like if it's Roofing could be
hundreds if it's a locksmith could be 20
bucks but I have no intent of actually
buying from these people so I don't want
I don't want them to have to pay money
and so we've got to do this a very
specific way um we're going to
say let me do this go back to
Thumbtack um
or like actually let's just do
this okay so this is basically thumb Tex
landing page for their services
where is dumpster

[27:01]
where is dumpster
ryal okay this is what I was going to do
okay let's go let's just do all this
alphabetically so let's go to Cincinnati
I'm going to get their zip
code uh
and okay so no one's been charged yet um
I haven't like requested a quote and I'm
only seeing one result so that's
Cleveland let's do it
here
two oh uh no one in that zip code let's
just I'm going to take a look at the ZIP
code make sure it is populated yeah okay
but but so a lot of this depends on like

[28:01]
but but so a lot of this depends on like
if these guys are bidding in that exact
they could be in the neighboring zip
code but I would think if this is
downtown um Fort Wayne then people would
be bidding on it but they're not um so
we're going to put a zero here Grand
rapin Madison and
Toledo two
zero 201 one
okay all right now
we're I'm going to close thumb
Tech and okay here's what we want to
okay we got to do Angie's List

[29:00]
okay we got to do Angie's List
differently so we're already on
Cleveland's page I pulled this up and we
want to see how many are on Angie's List
now Angie's List I'm
pretty so they will list everyone and if
and they the people that pay Angie's
List for leads they will put them at the
top but people that they just scrape
they will put them in the back that way
if someone for some reason goes to the
second or third page clicks on someone
then Angel list will reach out to that
person and say hey we've got a job for
you it incentivizes them to sign up for
Angie's List so we're just going to do
this we're going to go to the bottom of
this we want to go to the landing page
for dumpster rental in Cleveland and you
can Google it to get here and we just
want to know how many um
65 and I I went to the last page and
looked and like there they do a lot of
reaching right like um there's like on
the on the last page there's they're
pretty far out like some are like an
hour away but we're just going to keep
everything constant um

[30:02]
everything constant um
so let's go back
here so let's do
this Cincinnati Fort
Wayne pull that
up so we're just looking at the city
landing page um for Angie's List
Grand Rapids Grand Rapids Madison
Toledo all right so we've got all of
them pulled up Cincinnati now we got to
scroll down here and we got to find
dumpster Reynold

[31:04]
52 and we're done with that Fort
Wayne it's taking too
long 13 man man Fort Wayne like I've
never I'm not going to lie I've never
looked at Fort Wayne very
favorably but whatever here we are no
offense to anyone in Fort Wayne I mean
it's not
Gary 28 in Grand
Rapids wouldn't it be hilarious if there
were like 87 dumpster rental companies
in Madison Wisconsin by the end of this
month I would love that so much

[32:06]
all right internet's a little slow today
let's see 17 in Toledo
okay there's our
anges clean this up and you know what
I'm just going to delete the LSA column
because to me there's not enough data
there to really draw conclusion on it so
it's just it just looks messy right now
um and honestly Thumbtack H I don't know
I kind of just want to delete Thumbtack
too but I'll leave it I'll leave it
so let's do
this let's do this we're g to make we're
going to divide this by the number of

[33:01]
going to divide this by the number of
businesses in the area because that's
going to be a cleaner
percentage we're going to do the same
here
so well yeah and that's yeah it's going
to be a a triple digit percentage
because there's more on
Cincinnati is on Google Maps which is
because they're pulling from a wide area
but whatever we'll keep it the same
so we could also do the reverse what
percentage of um anges list businesses
are on Google Maps but
whatever
okay all right
so okay so what do we see here I'm going
to go to the comments and um see if
there's any questions or thoughts I'd
love to hear your thoughts like your
observations

[34:00]
all right I have no I have no questions
if they're on LinkedIn or Twitter I'm
not going to see them so YouTube If you
have any questions let me know um we're
going to go back we're going to close
that close that go back to our research
tab I'm just going to start observing
this in real time
so let's look at this so Cleveland
[Music]
in this sense the higher
percentage uh I guess it doesn't really
make a
difference okay
so if we look at this percentage which
is basically the saturation uh po per um
City
then once

[35:02]
again Madison I guess I should I should
have reverse this right because we want
green to be
good
okay Madison and Fort Wayne are
attractive but honestly Fort Wayne is
not as attractive because if you look at
the like not not bad crime rate if you
look at the real estate growth economic
growth uh what you know what I take it
back Fort Wayne is not is not that bad
I've been hating on Fort Wayne I don't
like the average home value of Cleveland
I really like to see that higher
but let's do this this is what we want
to do we want to call this the Google
percentage and the Angie percentage

[36:10]
and for some reason every time I paste
conditional formatting it doesn't it
just doesn't look right so yes I know
how to do that but it's just it just
doesn't work right for me um okay
so if you look at the Angie
percentage Fort Wayne is at the top
again um Toledo and Madison top
three Toledo is at the bottom as far as
Google is concerned
um okay so Thumbtack is there we're not
going to do that math I'm just going to
delete that people aren't using
Thumbtack um which you can see what is
that

[37:10]
that's not right I didn't do that
right I think I reverse that yeah yeah
yeah yeah I reverse that that's what it
is it's fun making these stupid mistakes
in real time and everyone's just
screaming at their computer I can hear
you oh yep and I screwed it up again
Muhammad edit this out because that is
Angie anyway you get the
point okay so so far we're seeing that
Madison and Fort Wayne look pretty dang
good now let's say I'm in Ohio and for
whatever sick reason I want to open a
business in Ohio um I'm gonna look at
these top
three home ownership rate all in the 40s
CME rate all

[38:00]
CME rate all
High real estate growth okay so Toledo
is the highest household income second
lowest home value middle of the pack
that best real estate
growth not that much on
Angie's I don't like this I want to do
this as a percentage of population
so once again Fort Wayne Toledo and
Madison are they're the least
saturated all green
there Toledo's a little more
saturated um should we give these guys a
call

[39:00]
okay Garrett asks is the real estate
growth economic growth crime Etc all
scrape from out scraper no actually I
asked CH GPT all of these and then I
kind of cherry-picked a couple to to
confirm and it was accurate because
sometimes it's not um so let's give
these guys a call because I want to know
are these guys swamped with business are
they not um I want to know what my
competitors look like am I going to
voicemail or answering service let's do
this so I'm gonna get my actual phone
and I'm gonna call them and I guess it's
a good thing I'm not using my phone as a
camera because I need to use it here
so I'm going to stop sharing my
screen
and I'm going to start calling some
people and you can hate this all you
want but I'm not going to talk to them
okay so yeah I'm going to waste their
time today for about 3 seconds I want to

[40:01]
time today for about 3 seconds I want to
know if they answer because that is the
litness test that I'm performing right
now um do they answer their phone and
I'm going to keep the variables constant
because I'm calling them all at the same
time um but we're not accounting for
maybe he's on the phone right then uh
maybe some oneoff variables are
happening so you can get a lot more
granular with this you could call them
you could call everyone once in the
morning afternoon and evening you know
on Monday Wednesday Wednesday Friday you
could get as granular as you want but uh
I just want to see right off the bat how
many people are picking up so we're only
going to look at these ones we're not
going to look at the ones in the
outlying
areas so I'm going
to let's see I'm just going to go down
the line
I don't I'm not going to call all these
but let's just see how it goes let's see

[41:00]
but let's just see how it goes let's see
how it
goes okay so if you see my
phone I just pasted it from my MacBook
to my phone and I'm GNA call him on
speaker and see if he
answers this reminds me of a scene in
the office I can't remember which one
hello and thank you for calling for a
dumpster PTY or if you're a home owner
press one if you're a bus or contractor
press two all right so that's an
answering service so I'm going to mark
that as answering service that was fast
enough we'll go to the next
one call
ended call
ended 419
451 yeah it's right there

[42:01]
it's not going
through well it's a good sign so
far let's go to the next
one Larry all right Larry answered sorry
Larry I'm going to get so many people
calling me
back okay another answer on the first
ring both of
them so I'm going let me count how many
of these there
are so we've got 57 I could probably
call all these

[43:02]
hey this is Donnie with Cincinnati
dumpsters sorry
this got to be the least exciting thing
you watch
today your call has forward to voicemail
that's a
no um I don't know if I'm going to call
all these so let me call more I want to
get a good uh like a Baseline and then I
want go straight to Madison I want to
see how companies are fairing in Madison

[44:17]
Wisconsin
okay stop
ringing I'm going to call that a no
oh I'm going to show you something here
in a minute you're going to like all
right stick with me here it's gonna get
a lot better Queen City dumpster all
right he
answered I'm going to finish
Cincinnati and then I'm going to text
some of these guys thank you for for
calling dumpster rental Solutions the
number one dumpster rental provider in

[45:01]
number one dumpster rental provider in
the Cincinnati
area I hope someone out there is already
doing this research in their own area
because you're that excited that's what
I'd be doing hello thank
you now okay in answering like I mean
they suck but it's not as good as
answering right away
thank you
for that's a
yes all right now all of these are the
same company so let's see what they do
it's got to be an answering service
right

[46:01]
if it was my company and I had all those
locations I would not have an answering
service there are ways to get it's an
800 number I mean yeah it's not even
ringing
so that's that's not a good
sign all right now this last one does
not have a phone number at all dumpster
tub let's I just want to do a little
research
there it
is huh they've got products like they
went they went through the effort of
putting this here but they don't have
their freaking phone number what do you
guys
doing
huh so we we're gonna call that a no
we're g to count any um
Madison I'm actually going to talk to

[47:00]
Madison I'm actually going to talk to
these
ones oh this is a recycling
center I just realized you can't see my
screen
okay so that is recycling center um I'm
going to share my screen again so you
can see
that so this is actually very
interesting because if we do get more
granular then we learned that one of the
four dumpster Ral companies in is not a
a recycling center so we're going to go

[48:00]
a recycling center so we're going to go
back to the research we're going to go
here to Madison we're going to change
that to three and look at those numbers
pop and so literally Cincinnati Ohio is
five times more saturated exactly than
Madison Wisconsin um so it's I guess
it's good that I called all of the ones
in Cincinnati because we're on both ends
of the spe Spectrum here um so we only
have three in Cincinnati let's give them
a
call um Kars dumpsters so since there's
only three let's do a little more
research yep I don't even need to click
that's dumpster
all tread lightly
dumpsters
rental this looks like it could be a
lead generation site um they just had
like a Madison Google

[49:03]
page I mean look at this Lakeland
Florida San
Bernardino contact
us okay this
gets that's grown using programmatic SEO
which is here's a secret this is what we
do as well we use programmatic SEO for
the same type of stuff um if you ever
want to do programmatic SEO email me by
the way Chris coof founders.com I can I
can help you out with that this is very
interesting these guys are just selling
leads um junk removal and dumpster
rental um very very
smart
yep completely different landing
page gez Louise okay so Madison like the
more research we do the better it gets
now of course we could go to the other
cities and do more research and we're
going to find similar things that would
bring the numbers down
but now we've got

[50:01]
two so we've got Kars Tad lightly that's
it um let's look
at all right I want to see how many
locations these guys have um
like this website it's ugly but it's
clean it's clear look at that picture
man that picture is like a Boomer's
dream okay so these guys look look like
they're using like a template I've seen
this template before um so they're
probably a little more sophisticated
they're not even like in
medicine
um let's see if we can do
this we're going to try to book

[51:04]
actually tied to their
inventory you know what we're just going
to call these two I don't think this is
going to be tied of their
inventory all right I'm going to YouTube
real quick I'm gonna take a
breather uh uh uh
um what am I learning from the company
calls validating if the business is real
great question um I want to know how
good they are at customer service um we
like we have a small business our tree
trimming business is a small business
and James my operating partner he always
answers the phone he just answers it if
he's talking to a customer quoting a job
like oh can you just give me a second he
just answers his phone because the
chance of getting a job like he knows
just just from a call that comes in cold
is like 30% and if he gets there in
person to quote it face to face it's
like 70% right and so let's say the

[52:01]
like 70% right and so let's say the
average job is $1,000 we have a 30%
chance of closing it that means that if
he misses that call he loses $300 right
and if our margins are 50% he loses $150
we lose $150 in net profit and so
answering the phone is the most simple
yet most important thing you can do so
that's what I want to know an answering
service that's friction that's oh it's a
big company oh they don't care about me
uh they're probably busy friction
friction friction
um and then surprisingly quite a few of
those just were bad numbers
altogether uh uh
uh using this example curious if you
recommend trying to buy an existing bus
instead of starting one um based on
everything I'm
learning I would not I would start a
business in Madison Wisconsin so all
right I want to call these two
businesses because we're down to two now
and I want to ask them if they have
availability to rent three dumpsters
this weekend why three because that will

[53:00]
this weekend why three because that will
give me a better idea of how busy they
are if yes and it's okay this is like
Prime construction season in Madison
Wisconsin I'm sure three dumpsters is is
quite a bit um this weekend is you know
four days away so if they say no then
it's like that tells me that they're
somewhat busy um and they'll also
probably tell me I can rent one not two
so that gives me an idea of exactly how
busy they are
like I'm expecting them to say no
because it's short notice so that
doesn't tell me a lot I would prefer if
they say yes they do have availability
to rent three dumpsters this weekend
because that's going to tell me that
they're not very busy and that's going
to be a red flag that that conflicts
with almost everything I'm learning
about the dumpster rental business in
Madison Wisconsin so I'm gonna call both
of them
and I'm gonna keep sharing my screen

[54:00]
like
thank you for calling tread lightly
Services is anyone surprised is anyone
surprised it went to voicemail guy's
busy that's my assumption uh let's call
the next one and then I'm gonna do a
little more research before we text any
of these guys so that was tread lightly
now we're going to go to Kars this is so
exciting I'm like a kid in a candy store
right now
all right I'm calling Kars and I like
pulling up their website as I talk to

[55:01]
pulling up their website as I talk to
them just so I sound like less of an
idiot hello this is K dumpsters how I
help you hey I was wondering if you have
availability for three uh 15 yard
rentals this
weekend um when were you thinking of
getting those dropped off uh it's
flexible maybe Saturday morning or or
Friday
afternoon we yeah Friday we we could do
Friday we could drop them off Friday um
we have 12 yards 20 yards and 30 yards
um I don't I don't see it being a
problem on Friday is that okay uh that
might be okay I'm just kind of doing
research right now are you are you
pretty busy this
weekend um we don't we don't deliver on
weekends oh okay are you pretty busy
this
week um no Friday's open that's Friday
Thursday and tomorrow sort of okay okay
well I'm just trying to call around
right now but I will give you a call
back if I decide to go that direction
all right have a great day sir thank you

[56:00]
all right have a great day sir thank you
all right so that was kind of
interesting not as busy as I would have
thought um now look at their website
compared to um tread
lightly tread lightly you can book
online um that's like the obvious you
don't have to build out a custom website
there's probably a theme or a package
you could buy for a couple hundred bucks
uh here
you you can't you got to call them it's
friction
so we're going to go we're going to look
them up on Google
Earth all right
okay so it looks like it I wonder if
this terara engineering business is
owned by the same person
a lot of times these dumpster rental

[57:00]
a lot of times these dumpster rental
companies start out as construction
businesses and then they you know buy
some dumpsters and then they start you
know loaning them out to other people in
the industry and next thing they know
they're in business so I'm not learning
a lot here other
than it looks like he might just be
piggybacking on another
business a bunch of dumpsters lined up
but that's just like a trash pile and
then look at Countrywide this Leen
Factory we could learn something from
these guys I bet you
anything okay what is this
address H they're not fitting many
dumpsters in there I wonder how they got
the hookup to validate their address on
um Google

[58:00]
um Google
Maps there's all kind of tricks of the
trade um so that's interesting 32
reviews just reading these reviews here
do you see any typos do you see any like
look at these names
Michaela win Hershey
abon Ashley
Williams I accessed the website this is
all AI written literally not any human
on this planet has ever said I went and
accessed your
website I bet you anything they have a
standard review and then they tell Chad
gbt write this 15 different ways and
they just swap out synonyms ends up
making no sense so these are all fake
reviews and the automation automat them
with AI
um very interesting very very we're

[59:01]
um very interesting very very we're
doing I I will admit we're doing
something similar not with dumpster not
anything near dumpster Reynold but a Le
genen service with programmatic SEO and
we're seeing some really really good
results from it so no shade but it's
just interesting seeing this for what it
is okay
so we've learned a lot especially about
Madison Wisconsin
and I am going to remove the ones with
blank phone numbers um I'm gonna take
this and let's close
that and I'm going to open a new
sheet and I'm going to remove duplicates

[1:00:06]
okay
so I just want their their phone numbers
here and I'm going to scrub these if
they're cell or
landline so I'm going to save this as a
CSV doesn't matter what I save it as and
then I'm going to go to this website
over here
s broadcast and they are happy to uh
validate these
lists uh and tell me if it is a
um what's it
called if they're sell or
landline so I'm G to upload this list
all I have in it are the phone numbers
save spits it out a

[1:01:01]
okay
let's go ahead and add a
header I don't care about the land lines
right now
I don't care about the unknowns I only
want the cell phone
numbers so I do want to remove the one I
just talked to because I just talked to
him and I know what's going on there
so that was Kars I believe
right
2565 yes all right so I'm going to
remove
that well I guess he wasn't in there
because that wasn't a cell phone so save

[1:02:02]
because that wasn't a cell phone so save
that list now I'm going to go to um
message media and I use quite a few
different texting platforms but this is
the one that I like uh for this type of
of outbound texting the most so this is
our co-founders account and we have a
few different phone numbers and I'm
going to go to contacts
list and create
list and then I'm going to
upload that list into that specific
list I only need their phone
numbers so once again this doesn't give
us data from people that are
using uh what's it called Lan lines or
unknown phone number numbers
um it just gives us data from people

[1:03:00]
um it just gives us data from people
that have cell phone numbers but it's
really quick and
easy so I'm going to use this list only
27 numbers and I'm going to
say that's it that's all I'm going to
say I don't need a personalization in
here um it's a very binary
question I'll do
this and I'm going to click Send and
it's not a big sample size
um but it's
something and now we wait so while we
wait for responses I'm going to go back
here
[Music]

[1:04:02]
no questions no questions anyone got any
questions all right well let's clean up
these
tabs and let's see if we have any
responses we got
one I wish we had like 200 uh because we
would get like a 10 to 30% response rate
right
away okay

[1:05:06]
how would you go to market if you decide
to launch a dumpster ryal well that is
uh that's a whole other live stream in
and of itself uh we can do that I'm
down let's
see we're not getting more responses I'm
surprised I kind of want to text more
let's see what could I do to text
more okay all right call me I don't like
that if I'm texting you I want you to
respond via text what
material fully booked okay that's
something 8826 I want to see where he's
at

[1:06:00]
Grand
Rapids
okay
5865 where's this guy
at
hoen Ohio
H oh that's not
right
Cincinnati
H that looks familiar

[1:07:03]
okay these guys are pretty busy
8091 Fort Wayne yeah Fort Wayne is a
good Market we're not surprised that
they're busy we already knew
that can you book
online book online imagine that
all right all going back to the
questions shot down the tools using for
SM I will put all the tools in the we're
going to edit this YouTube video and
then just post it as a non-live video
next week probably and I will put all
the links to all this stuff in that I
went with these LS because I've just
I've been doing this for 15 years and
trial and error um these are just these
are just what I've settled with they

[1:08:01]
are just what I've settled with they
work well they might not look pretty but
they're they're better than the other
options um okay my ADD is in full force
right now where was I all right there we
are let's see how many responses we got
27 texts and we got one two three four
five six
seven okay
um so 20 something percent response rate
right off the bat not bad
um it's too bad we didn't text more
people let's I want to look more into
this guy
8091 oh okay look at now this is legit
Blue Line bins all five star reviews

[1:09:00]
Blue Line bins all five star reviews
82 we got a big parking lot um I assume
that most of these spots normally have
dumpsters but it's mostly empty now
here's a little life hack the obviously
the uh the Google Street View that you
see will be different than the Google um
Earth view that you see
so you can get two different points in
time and then if you really want to get
granula with it oh this is
good okay so it looks like they just do
all kinds of
stuff you're gonna like this what I'm
about to show you this be
good H so it looks like it hasn't even
been there for that long this is May
2023 that was an autoedit place here
we're going to

[1:10:03]
do we're going
to take that
address we're not going to learn a lot
from this because it hasn't been in
business for that long but you get the
idea so I need to be able to zoom in
more uh no that's a bummer I can't zoom
in any more than that so forget I said
anything that doesn't work but I had the
right idea
um let's go back to
this we don't have 20 yards and our 11
yards are currently being
used okay so I don't like this guy dude
like come on
770 so these guys are busy I mean

[1:11:01]
770 so these guys are busy I mean
imagine how much you can learn just from
this just seeing how busy everyone is
demolition contractor just take it
llc.net
oh saying the phrase llc.net gives me an
aneurism that is painful
um so I don't think you can book online
but yeah whatever it's a website um okay
so what have we learned let's go back to
the research tab um it looks like there
needs to be this business in Madison and
or Toledo and or Fort Wayne uh we could
do a lot more research in these cities
uh because for all we know Grand Rapids
is a great place to open because maybe
uh it looks saturated on the surface but
if you call everyone and really dig in
and do your research uh and you find out
that they're all busy and there's room
for more or if you find out in the

[1:12:01]
for more or if you find out in the
northeast corner of the of the city
there's no one right um but be careful
with research because let's say you live
in Grand Rapids it's a great place and
you don't want to move and you really
want to start a a um a dumpster Ral
business then you're GNA have
confirmation bias everywhere you look
you're like well you know they're not
too busy but there's no one around the
corner well you know don't try to talk
yourself into doing this follow the data
right be unbiased follow the data or
else you'll get yourself in trouble so
what I like to do when doing this
research let's say you're not location
agnostic and you want to go to a
specific area be willing to do five
different businesses and do all this
research so we've only it's only taken
an hour to do this do all this research
for all five businesses and it will
scale right it won't take five hours to
do it it'll take two and a half hours
because you're studying the same cities
you're just swapping out the um the Home
Service
businesses don't get too attached to uh
industry or a city be flexible on both
but this is the 8020 or 9010 of finding

[1:13:01]
but this is the 8020 or 9010 of finding
out if specifically a home service
business could be VI viable in any given
area um you can get a lot more granular
with it you could text a lot more people
you could you could make pivot tables
you can make charts and graphs and yada
y yada but you're not going to learn
anything new than what we've already
learned right here so I will link to all
this stuff in the Youtube video um I
hope you enjoyed something hope you
learned something uh yeah
let me see if there are any questions
before we end this um if you're on once
again if you're on Twitter or LinkedIn
you got to hop over to YouTube Type in
the ker office you'll see this live and
hop in and ask a couple questions I will
stick around for a little bit to answer
um what question would you ask to gauge
demand if this was researching Roofing
instead of
dumpsters that's a good question Roofing
in my opinion is just like a home
service business in and of itself
because it is you know instead of being
a $200 pressure washing job or a $2,000

[1:14:00]
a $200 pressure washing job or a $2,000
tree job it's a $20,000 job which puts
it in a whole other category and that
also means that you know Roofing has
attracted a lot of sophisticated
operators um because they feel rightly
so to a degree that they could do the
same amount of work to get a $20,000 job
as they could get it to get a $2,000 job
and because the margins are also good in
Roofing you have a lot of people
spending a lot of money in marketing you
have a lot of agencies built up around
Roofing to compete there and so it is
hard to keep compete in Roofing um
because there's there's a lot of people
there for all of those reasons um any
other
questions any questions before we wrap
this
up I'm exhausted

[1:15:02]
if you haven't already I would love for
you to subscribe uh my newsletter I talk
about this stuff there's no ads in the
newsletter there's no cost I do it once
a week uh Chris J ker.com KO R NE R um

you probably already have a business and
I want you to grow your business or quit
your job um that's my goal uh would love
to see a sort of inverted version of
this what do you mean by that
Louis where you have an area you want to
be in and want to identify service
businesses that's a great idea I love it
