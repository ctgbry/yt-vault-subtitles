[00:00]
welcome to the ker office where we dive
deep on business ideas and business
models so a few months ago I posted this
tweet over here it went viral got over a
million views and I was just fascinated
about the concept of a Flyin
neighborhood this is pean plantation
which is about an hour south of Dallas
Fort Worth it has over 4,000 acres and
over 4,000 homes and it has two runways
better yet there are homes on the air
strip and then there are homes where you
can taxi to the air strip and this just
boggled my mind and I'm not even into AV
and so I just thought I have to talk to
the owner of this neighborhood happens
to be a company called patent properties
I talked to John Patton super helpful
and I just wanted to know what is
liability like what is Insurance like
what are noise complaints like if any
what is it like living in a neighborhood
that's almost fully encompassed by the
brazus river it's just a super
interesting business there's also a
actual Pecan Plantation on the property
and I'm just curious and I assume you
are as well so I thought you might want
to hear this

[01:00]
all right so we met each other because I
saw a pcan plantation and I thought it
was incredible and so I tweeted about it
and it went viral and now we got in
touch and it's like okay now I actually
want to learn about this because there's
something here so can you talk briefly
about like the history behind pcan
Plantation how it went from the original
owner's hands into your hands sure and
we're still partnered with the Anthony
Family the original owners but they be
began developing pcan Plantation way
back in the 1970s
it was initially a full-on pean
plantation and they still have a
headquarters there for their business
and they built a series of neighborhoods
typically a developer will try to sell
their inventory pre-development
preconstruction and then use some of
those funds to build the project out and
what separated them is they did it
completely opposite they completed it
put in the finished product and then
they sold it but again you know they
weren't necessarily land developers so
they developed a series of neighbor Hood

[02:00]
they developed a series of neighbor Hood
starting in the
1970s and the patriarch Mr Anthony who I
believe is 92 now decided he was at a
point in life where he wanted to uh
expedite the project finish up the
development and while this was going on
he lost one of his sons who was uh an
intricate part of the real estate side
of Pecan Plantation so they decided to
list it for
sale and a broker that we've done
business before with before uh brought
the project to us we did a couple site
visits did some homework on it met the
anthonies and it became apparent to us
that they were so entrenched not just
with the project but the community it
would be next to impossible for us to
just buy it and step into their shoes
and continue with what they were doing
so they came and they visited one of our
big Flagship projects north of the
woodlands Republican Texas Grand Ranch
and they saw our operation and figured
out pretty quickly I think that we were
the real deal

[03:00]
the real deal
and over several months we came up with
the idea for a partnership where the
anony would kind of stay in the deal
help out with the HOAs and you know some
of the day-to-day Affairs and we would
from day one come in take over the
development of the Lots we replaced put
our own people on site took over the
sales and the marketing and kind of the
daily operations and they helped us as
needed I believe we started in November
of 22 and since then we've sold 350 plus
properties for about $57 million in
sales wow so it's been a partnership
that's worked uh great for both of us
what percentage fully sold is the
property right now so that was another
unique thing about pan Plantation I
believe it had 3,400 existing homes when
we started okay we're going to add
probably the final thousand or so units
to the pro to the community but it's
essentially it's his own town I haven't

[04:00]
essentially it's his own town I haven't
seen much like it in my time working so
it's got that scarcity value that people
look for when they're trying to invest
their money or buy a piece of real
estate or whatever they're looking to do
yeah back to your original story I feel
like there's so many interesting
learnings in there like as a real estate
owner developer myself it's it's funny
how you started the conversation by
saying you bought these condos in
Florida and you had to convince the
banks you brought the developer with you
and you were creative to make it work
which you have to be sometimes and then
with this property you know over a
decade later you just brought them to
one of your existing comparable
properties and they were like oh wow
these guys know what they're doing right
so it's like two creative ways to get a
deal done both either end of the
spectrum right well established and not
established I also think it's
interesting as looking at pean
Plantation as a business a lot of times
as a business owner you want to build
your business to sell you don't want
things to be too intertwined with the
owner you want clean books and that's
generally good advice but when the
opposite is true there's still creative

[05:01]
opposite is true there's still creative
Partnerships that you can form like
that's what happened with you it was too
special of a place not to figure
something out in our business there's
this thing I call the sniff test you go
and you visit a site and would you live
there would you use it would you enjoy
it and within 45 seconds through the
front Gates absolutely this is a special
place so it was too nice and too special
not to figure out how to help the
anthonies get it completed all right so
about a, home sites left that what I
think is so that's what we started with
we probably were down to six to 700 okay
so six I think you said 350 so like 650
left or so yeah okay what's so unique
and interesting about the property is
how it's like almost fully encompassed
by the brazus river yeah right the
location it's you're surrounded by the
Brazos River granberry is a spectacular
small town it's got great history great
restaurant a very Scenic Lake it's but

[06:02]
restaurant a very Scenic Lake it's but
yet you're close to Fort Worth in Dallas
Fort Worth area and then you get to pan
Plantation and again it's a unique small
town within a town pean Plantation is
fairly self-sufficient has its own
grocery stores its own drug stores its
own country club its old kids parks it's
the whole deal there so just very rare
and special place yeah it reminds me of
a neighborhood that my family lived in
uh for about 6 months outside of Houston
it's 5,000 homes it's own grocery store
its own town and it was the that was the
best six months I had ever spent in any
home in my life it was kind of a unique
set of circumstances of why we had to
move there but I won't get into but you
can't overstate the community aspect and
how that affects one's quality of life
absolutely right I imagine there's like
walking trails and oh yeah no it's got
everything it's got It's got an
equestrian component to it's got a

[07:00]
equestrian component to it's got a
marina it's got uh place called The Pack
it's all the kids ball fields they got
two golf courses they got a clubhous
nice restaurants gym I mean it has
everything it's got its own Fire
Department EMS so it's pretty special
and how many acres is it again I don't
know the exact acreage off the top of my
head but it's a big place it's when
we're finished with it again it's going
to be 4500 uh homes probably the average
lot size when we get done with it it's
going to be close to an acre so it's a
big place wow tell me about the pecan
business like it sounds like there are
still thousands of pecan trees there is
that producing Revenue do you have any
role in that or we have zero role in
that I believe the Anthony kind of still
have it active they have a mail order
catalog I believe outside of that I've
tored it the pecans are delicious
they're you know they have chocolate
pecans and candied pecans and a lot of
the residents in there try to preserve
as many as pecan trees as possible that
gives it a little bit of its charm as
you drive through it but outside of that

[08:01]
you drive through it but outside of that
we're you know not any way involved in
their business and I know very little
about the pean business in general yeah
it's same I did a bunch of research on
flying communities in general and I just
like I'm not an aviation guy I know a
lot of people are I just find it
fascinating the aspect of a a landing
strip as an amenity in a community back
in the 70s according to my research
there was like 20 or 30 of them today
there's six or 700 of them I know a guy
developing two in Tennessee and like it
it just seems like it's a a very fast
growing asset class or type of real
estate yeah it's for sure it's an
interesting and successful Niche right
now what makes pan so successful again
are you surrounded by the amenities uh I
don't think there's really another Air
Park that has the amenities that pcan
Plantation has and pay $200 a month to
have access to a mall is unheard of holy
cow I I didn't realize the HOA was that

[09:00]
cow I I didn't realize the HOA was that
low yeah you know it's 200 for uh just
about every home site in there and then
if you're a member of the Air Park it's
another $55 a month but there's no other
place in the country where you can go
land your plane um have a hanger
adjoining or behind your house and then
have access to all those amenities for
little or no money so that's probably
why we've been so successful have you
ever done any market research or surveys
with your residents uh to ask them how
much the landing strip played into the
decision because I imagine a lot of
people move there and they don't really
care they just think it's an amazing
Community a lot of our customers that
purchase in the Air Park which is called
The Landings they're either current or
retired Pilots but the average lot size
there is about an acre and a half and
that gives somebody the ability to build
a oversized barn or hanger or whatever
and there's a lot of people with toys so
we do have a lot of our customers that
have come out and they have no interest
in Avi they have no airplanes but they

[10:01]
in Avi they have no airplanes but they
might be into RVs or they might be into
cars or they might be into toys that
require a lot of space and there are a
ton of options to accommodate that so we
have seen that as well but by and large
we do have a lot of Aviation enth
enthusiasts lots of current and retired
pilots in and around the DFW area that
love Pecan Plantation and love what you
get there is there a big difference in
Insurance costs not to the homeowners
but to you as the owner in a Flyin
neighborhood as opposed to a since it's
so well established the HOA covers most
of any insurance needs we really get
involved with everything's encumbered by
an HOA at this point we're just
developing and selling the remaining
approved home sites in them okay yeah I
imagine if it were a large line item it
would be top of mind for you but yeah
you've got Decades of you know of a
track record of safety for sure so I

[11:00]
track record of safety for sure so I
went back to my tweet and I tried to
look at a bunch of the top comments and
I just think it's funny cuz I tweet
about business ideas and neighborhoods
and real estates for a living and so I
start to see a lot of patterns in the
comments and people love to pick apart
things and one of my favorite quotes is
pessimists sound smart and optimists get
rich and absolutely a lot of people were
saying oh no no I don't want a plane
crashing into my house or oh noise like
my baby could never take a nap and I
just I just find it funny because they
really don't know that any of those
things are a real risk or not right
they're just like they're just keyboard
Warriors so is noise an issue at all I I
know it's you know 4,000 plus acres some
of the homes are far from the airst
strip but is that even a component to
the really no it's again of the 4500
homes that'll eventually be in there I
think we'll probably have under 200 in
The Landings and of that half to two
thirs or Pilots that might keep an

[12:00]
thirs or Pilots that might keep an
airplane so I've been there numerous
times noise has never really even
occurred to me mhm yeah we own an RV
park that's literally right next to an
airport a small airport but an airport
nonetheless and it's not we got a good
deal for it because of that it was
priced at a discount but it's never been
an issue to any one of our residents for
sure what about the deal so you kind of
had to partner with the Anthony family
is that a deal that you could replicate
elsewhere or was it pretty unique to
this property with the right person we
could replicate it it was unique because
it's a such a high quality product and
location and the Anthony family they're
they are very principled people are
Great Character so made it easy to
partner with them but it's definitely a
model if we found the right owners in
the right project that we could roll out
for sure it just happened to be a
perfect fit with the anon's we have done

[13:00]
perfect fit with the anon's we have done
JVS and Partnerships in the past and it
it takes some vetting but they do work
and it's something that we can roll out
if the right opportunity arises was
there a a unique component of the deal
that you found interesting everything
was unique about it again it Pecan
Plantation has the scarcity Factor those
type of highquality home sites with the
acreage you get with access to all those
amenities for such a small fee in a town
like Grand bberry Texas nothing else
like it exists all right if you are

there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there when we go into a market as a land
developer we never try to be the most

[14:02]
developer we never try to be the most
expensive we never try to be the least
expensive we always try to bring the
best value to the marketplace you know
price is what you pay value is what you
get at the end of the day so we pride
ourselves on being the best value in the
market place and spending an hour in pan
Plantation initially it hits you right
the face wow this is what you get here
this is the best value in the
marketplace it sounds like so you're
developing another Park north of Houston
how is that part going to be different
and did you I know you were developing
that one before this one but did you
learn anything from The Woodlands Air
Park that you're applying to this park
or vice versa The Woodlands is not a Air
Park it's just a development okay okay
lar lot development but yeah it's you
know it reminds you of a little bit of
Pecan Plantation we tend to do rather
low density type developments people
prefer larger Lots they prefer trees
they prefer to see see the nature they
prefer to build their own home not have

[15:01]
prefer to build their own home not have
to buy a cookie cutter type home and
when you drive through pan it's got all
those elements checked off beautiful
custom homes lots of pecan trees larger
Lots it kind of fit within our box
nicely where do you see other air Parks
going wrong that are popping up boy
again we don't do a ton of Air Park
development we happen to be a Land
Development company that is currently
doing an air Park but that's
not a field that we typically specialize
in ones I've seen available on the
marketplace that people are trying to
sell I would say location the property
might be nice the Air Park itself might
be nice or the land might be suitable
for an air Park but there's nothing
within a 30 plus minute drive and again
one of the big driving factors for
success of Pecan Plantation is you can
go out your door you've got a self-
sustained little town restaurants things
for your kids to do grocery stores gas

[16:02]
for your kids to do grocery stores gas
stations all that so I think that's my
two cents the challenge with the Air
Park industry right now will'll be
finding a suitable piece of property
that is close enough in to something for
people to do an area that people like
that the you can make all the numbers
make sense can you speak about the the
business side of the neighborhood
obviously you make money by selling lots
expanding the neighborhood are there any
ancillary Revenue lines that are
interesting or that you're looking at
developing in the future that might be
interesting a lot of the people that
listen to this are just total business
Geeks and they like seeing how things
work from the inside you know a
brokerage could always be an idea I
think since we've been at pan Plantation
the available inventory in the
neighborhood is vacillated between maybe
as little as 40 homes and as high as 120
or 130 homes so there's always going to
be a need for resales there so that's a
potential ancillary business from all
this
I think they just opened up a new Ace

[17:01]
I think they just opened up a new Ace
Hardware so there's probably
opportunities when the thing's fully
built out for more commercial I think
the Anthony own a little bit more
commercial land in there so that would
be an opportunity as pean Plantation
continues to grow and houses are built
and people move in for us our primary
focus is getting these neighborhoods
complete getting the Lots sold and
getting pan fully inhabited what would
you say is like the typical demographic
of a resident there I'm sure it's all
over the map it varies it's all over the
map so we've got our neighborhoods that
are smaller Lots tend to be a little bit
more entry level homes called The
Orchards I believe so that might lend
itself more to uh a starter family or a
couple that's looking a downsize but
then you drive into the air Park Lots
which again average probably about an
acre and a half and people build these
beautiful homes and beautiful hangers
and then we have a section called the
ranches and those lots are up to 7 Acres

[18:02]
ranches and those lots are up to 7 Acres
people buying those have an interest in
horses and are into equestrian so
they'll build nice little compounds
there so it's just it's it varies but at
the end of the day it's just the value
you get with all these amenities and the
location for 200 bucks a month is
unrivaled in my opinion what are the
price ranges of the lots that of the
remaining 650 how would you kind of
bucket them or 's neighborhoods and any
future neighborhoods that are similar to
that average lot size will probably
range between a third to a half an acre
and that's probably a $100,000 price
point our Air Park Lots we've got a new
release in two weeks we've got only two
Runway Lots left directly on the runway
and only 52 taxway Lots left those are
probably in the the taxiways or in the
low 200s the ones in the runway are
going to be more obviously because
they're direct M and our larger acreage

[19:02]
they're direct M and our larger acreage
lots for up to seven or eight Acres
those could go from the twos up to 4 or
500,000 depending on the right property
so you know we've got something for
everybody there it's which is not
necessarily the case in a lot of places
and what would you say the the ranges of
the homes that are currently existing
like on the seven acre lots are those
million dollar homes $3 million doll
homes I would say the price range you're
going to see it pan is going to range on
average from the mid to Upper 400,000 to
as high as the low two millions again
it's quite a range and there's some
older
neighborhoods that might not trade at
quite the premium as some of these newer
ones so it's there's a big Dynamic going
on there it's interesting because the
whole neighborhood just feels to me like
it's representative of the State of
Texas right you've got 4 ,000 homes $2

[20:00]
Texas right you've got 4 ,000 homes $2
million homes yeah you're surrounded by
a river you have natural beauty it's got
history you're close to DFW you can fly
in and out you have all the amenities
you have the community aspect like it's
the state of Texas in 4,000 Acres
absolutely something for everybody yeah
a lot of times you see these
neighborhoods that are one end of the
spectrum or another all starter homes or
all $3 million homes um it's nice it
adds a nice bit of diversity to the
gives a place character too yeah it's a
very special place and every
neighborhood in there is unique but
they're all nice in their own ways and
it's you know it everything's unique and
it's just it's a fantastic place if you
were to ever come across a deal similar
to this one is it something that your
company would do again oh absolutely
we've been blown away by the response
not just of pan Plantation in general
but The Landings in the Air Park Lots
it's been an absolutely incredible we've
got a new release this is one of our

[21:00]
got a new release this is one of our
final releases in two weeks and I
wouldn't be surprised if we sell four or
five of these things every week for the
rest of the year easily tell me what's
different about this new release
compared to what you've done in the past
if anything well these are all around
the second Air Park with a little bit of
the larger Runway that's where we
started back in November of 22 what's
different about this release is we've
got two lots directly on the runway
which we haven't always had so people
are literally right there and we have
some larger Lots upwards of two acres in
the new release but uh a lot of the
stuff is fairly similar to what we
started releasing uh back in November of
22 super high-end taxiways concrete
taxiways along the lot lines super
high-end concrete roads and what's going
up for vertical right now every single
house in there is way over the square
footage minimum and you can tell people
are taking Pride and what they're
building there so it just has a

[22:01]
building there so it just has a
tremendous feel when you drive through
the entrance of it that's awesome I
actually pulled up Google Earth time
lapse I don't know if you've ever done
that but I was kind of in a mesmerizing
way watch it watching it develop from
the 70s and it looks like there used to
be like a smaller air strip in the
central area and now the main one is is
kind of off to the east a little bit is
that right yeah and the smaller one
still gets uh traffic when you go to the
one of their signature courses there I
believe it's called The Nutcracker you
do see you know a little bit of activity
there but the new Landings Community
with the high-end roads and the taxiways
and everything we're doing to it if you
haven't been there it just blows you
away the first time you drive through it
it's there's nothing like it do you
allow other Pilots to to land and take
off from there that aren't residents we
do allow people to fly in that are
prospective buyers that much I know I
assume if you're a property owner there
and you have friends with a plan that
want to come visit we just built a brand

[23:01]
want to come visit we just built a brand
new 12,000g fuel tank and a brand new 1
acre parking area so it can accommodate
guests temporary guests you know people
coming in for fuel or whatever but it's
not like a a revenue line for you no no
no no no no this is more of a private
community in use for residents and
residents friends and that sort of a
thing okay hopping back to this property
as from an investment perspective how
has it performed according to your
performance originally pretty good I'd
say beat on most if not all metrics when
I initially visited it and I saw the
initial site plans the Anthony's put
together and their ideas for pricing uh
my first thoughts were wow this is cheap
probably too cheap and uh
so we when we opened up in
November uh the anony you know we're
sharing an office with them at the time
and our project manager there Steve guy

[24:01]
and our project manager there Steve guy
kind of reviewed my initial uh thoughts
and pricing on the first landing
slots and I got a call the next
day from Steve after he spent the day
with the Anthony saying boy you know
anon's might be a little concerned that
we're putting the air park lots a little
bit too high they would like to see the
prices reduced a little bit till we get
some sales momentum and I told them no
let's
go with what I put out and see what
happens and it was like somebody opened
the floodgates immediately and I forget
how many Lots we sold our first three
months but uh had to be 60 or 80 and we
were Off to the Races and the anthonies
were Believers after three
months it it's funny because whether
it's Land Development or a restaurant or
anything I feel like business owners are
much more likely to price their product
or service way too low yeah as opposed
to High I don't know if it's a their
self-concious
they don't want to offend people but own

[25:01]
they don't want to offend people but own
what you have own the value that you're
offering others yeah works hard finding
a good real estate deal is hard it is so
and I like I have massive respect for
people in in business or real estate
that are different than me just because
like I'm not much of a risk taker and
when we buy an RV park we like to drisk
it before we buy it as much as possible
like we'll post ads for the vacancies
before we even close as if we already
own it we'll do all kinds of tricks like
that and so to think of a land developer
buying or investing in thousands of
acres and then being patient enough
paying down those Bank notes which those
it's probably insane over years and
decades before that thing is full I
can't wrap my head around that so I just
have a lot of respect for people that
that do take those
risks Land Development is not for the
faint of heart no no what have I not
asked you that you think is interesting
about this property again this scarcity
Factor the quality of life you've got

[26:00]
Factor the quality of life you've got
everything at your fingertips yet if you
still want to go into the City and catch
a basketball game or something Dallas
Fort Worth area is not very far away
residents everybody that lives in there
by and large are all great people
everything is very clean you drive
around it's Peca maintained and the
amenities are first class they're super
nice to the golf courses the clubhouse
is really nice the what they call the
pack the fields for their kids just it's
it tremendous value and it's a place
where you if you drive through it you
could see yourself using it and being
happy there how many uh entry or exit
points are there since it is mostly
surrounded by the river yeah there there
are two main gates okay uh the front one
where our office is and then there's a
back gate by uh the marina in granberry
Lake okay so and it's they got like one
giant Loop and then there's a lot of

[27:01]
giant Loop and then there's a lot of
signage to tell you where you're going
uh so you can navigate the various
neighborhoods it looks like was it
Grandberry lake is kind of damned off
right at the entrance it is it is and
what's the story behind that well I
think the Anthony were instrumental they
they had to give some easen or something
I believe back in the day and I think I
want to say they have some of the only
slips right there on granberry lake so
they were instrumental in something and
it's just a beautiful Scenic Lake and
just a fun place yeah okay so two golf
courses two airst strips a river a lake
grocery store Ace Hardware what am I
missing if you were to list out all the
amenities walking trails oh you've got
the driving range you've got workout
facility your own hardware store your
own drug stores your own grocery store
doors gas station it's got an archery

[28:01]
doors gas station it's got an archery
range I believe it's got an equestrian
component with some stables for horses
it's got a horse trail it's you name it
it's got it what a beautiful property
it's just I would love to have a
property like this that could just be a
legacy in my family my great-grandfather
bought uh 640 acres in eastern Utah and
that was 98 years ago and it's still in
our family today I was just there two
weeks ago and it's just just it just
feels so nice to to pass on a legacy
like that seems like the Anthony should
be very proud yeah know I think they're
happy as can be and it's been a very
successful partnership and I see nothing
but continued success between the two of
us okay John well thank you thank you
for teaching me about pean plantation
and where can anyone find you if they'd
like to learn more pean Plantation
Texas we've got websites we for folks
that are out of state we do have the
ability to do virtual tours
so if you're in California Florida any
