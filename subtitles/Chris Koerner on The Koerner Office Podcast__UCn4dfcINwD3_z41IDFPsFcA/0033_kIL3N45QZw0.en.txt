we resell millions of dollars worth of
buy products every year more than anyone
on the planet and a lot of people ask me
why don't more people copy you it's so
easy you show up to the store you buy
Bucky stuff you mark it up a ton and
then you sell it I'll tell you why more
people don't copy us because this is
what they learn they start by slanging
beaver nuggets on eBay or Amazon making
a dollar per bag then they learn oo I
want a scale But first you have to learn
how do I find and negotiate a 10,000 ft
Warehouse lease how do I find and hire
and train and manage and motivate $12 an
hour employees how do I manage
expiration dates when I have 400
different food products how do I use and
manage warehouse management software
that cost $4,000 a month how do I manage
1,600 different SKS some apparel some
food some gift how do I afford
$250,000 worth of inventory and store
these freaking pool noodles during the
offseason cu no one buys them during the
winter it's a lot of stuff to learn
we've already figured it out it was hard
I wouldn't do it all over again if I had
the chance but now that we are we're
making millions of dollars a year
Topline and hoping to make a profit
