Most people go about starting a business
all wrong. They have what I call a if I
build it, they will come mentality,
which is wrong. If you build it, they
will probably not come. So ask them what
to build first. I'm going to show you
how to do that and then I'm going to
build it all live over the next minutes.
The bad news, I don't know how to code.
The good news, AI can show me how to
build stuff without knowing how to code
cuz I'm going to build a software tool
today. But how can I know what to build?
How can I pull the audience if I don't
have an audience? And that's the funny
thing because when I went to go make
this video, I almost just tweeted about
it or posted it to my Instagram story,
but then I thought, "No, that's not
applicable. How are people watching this
video going to be able to replicate that
if they don't have tons of people at
their disposal to answer a poll question
real quick?" So, I thought of a tool
that I've been using for years to poll
any business owner or any person. This
company did not sponsor this video, but
it's super helpful, so I'm going to show
it. It's called Pikfu. And with Pikfu,
you can pick the exact type of person to
vote on your poll or to respond to your
poll. In this case, I'm going to pick
business owners and I'm going to ask
them, "What feature do you wish that you

[01:02]
them, "What feature do you wish that you
had on your website? What feature is the
most critical to your website?"
Something like that.
So, I'm logged into Pikfu. I'm going to
click new poll. What one website feature
does your business need the most right
now that you would be willing to pay
for? That's the key part because a lot
of us need stuff all the time, but it
doesn't mean that we're willing to pay
for it. We're selling vitamins and not
painkillers. I want to sell painkillers.
Not literally. You get what I mean?
Okay. This is the important part.
Audience. I want 100. United States.
Target audience. Small business owner.
Yes. Okay. Now, I can pick three other
traits, but I don't want to. I don't
care what age they are. If they have
kids, it's irrelevant to me. I just want
business owners to answer this poll. Do
I need to pull a hundred of them? No. I
could probably know what I need to know
by pulling 20 of them. That would be a
little cheaper. But I want this data to
be pretty good. And hey, you don't have
to pay for this. You don't have to use
PF food. Just use my data. Use my poll

[02:00]
PF food. Just use my data. Use my poll
responses that I'm about to show you and
build the same thing for the same type
of business owner. But before I forget,
I have to add options for people to
choose when they answer this question.
So, let's say,
okay, appointment booking, contact
forms, testimonials, chatbot, pricing,
calculator. Those are the five options
that they can choose from. Now, I got to
pay a little extra because I'm only
showing this to business owners and I
got to pay per option. So, this is
getting a little pricey, but it's okay
because remember, you're going to be
able to use my data for yourself. So,
you don't need to go do this. And if
that's not proof that this isn't an ad
for Pickthrough, I don't know what is.
Preview and pay. And then they can even
explain their answer instead of just
choosing one of them. Boom. Order
complete. Continue. Now, it is 12:17 in
the afternoon right now. Let's see how
long it takes to get all these
responses. All right. Looks like I've
had 27 people respond to my Pikfu survey
so far. Let's go ahead and see what the
results show. Okay, so far we have 11
votes for appointment booking, two for
contact forms, six for testimonials, six

[03:02]
contact forms, six for testimonials, six
for chatbot, two for pricing calculator.
So if this is a representative sample
size, we can already see that
appointment booking is going to win.
Contact forms and pricing calculators
are solidly in last place tied and
testimonials and chatbot are exactly
tied for second place. So, using this
data, we're going to still get 73 more
responses, but we're going to assume
this data holds. We're going to start
building an appointment booking widget
for websites that we can sell to
businesses. And then at the end of the
video, I'll show what the survey results
show after all 100 responses come in,
and I'm going to show you what the AI
highlights show, what the demographics
are, because hopefully this data helps
someone start at least one business. But
if you look at this right here, like
there is a lot of feedback that these
people are submitting. They're not just
voting on something. They're adding
between one and 10 sentences of why
they're voting for what they're voting
for. So, at the end of this, I'm going
to take all of these responses, upload
them to ChatGpt, see what the findings
are, and see what else we can mine from

[04:01]
are, and see what else we can mine from
all that data to help us build some
website widgets or to help you build
some website widgets. All right, so I
keep hearing about this new vibe coding
app called Mocha. getmmocha.com and I'm
all about trying new vibe coding apps.
And in case you don't know what vibe
coding is, it's basically using your
natural language like I'm using now when
I'm speaking and asking AI to build apps
or software products for you. It's
basically coding for people that don't
know how to code with the help of AI.
So, I'm logged into Mocha. I'm paying
for the $20 a month account. And I'm
going to click create new app. Okay. All
right. I want to build a widget that
small businesses can easily add to their
websites that will enable potential
customers to book an appointment with
them. Maybe an appointment to get a
quote or to have a call, get a
doggroomed, etc. I want to try selling
this widget to several different
industries. So, make it seamless and
easy for me to swap out the branding,
colors, and name of the widget so my
marketing efforts are easier. Now, I'm
going to take this a step further. I'm
going to go to chat GPT and I'm going to

[05:00]
going to go to chat GPT and I'm going to
take this prompt and I'm going to say I
am using
Okay, so my prompt is probably fine. I
gave it some references like dog
grooming, book an appointment, get a
quote, etc., which is important, but
it's just me. It's just my brain. I
don't know how to write prompts
perfectly for vibe coding apps. So, I'm
asking Chad GBT to rewrite my prompt to
be better, right? Which is one of my
favorite frameworks for AI. Ask it what
to ask it. And I'm going to do that as
well. And then I said, if my prompt to
rewrite this prompt isn't good enough,
then ask me what to ask you to make it
better. And then I just pasted in the
prompt that I had before. So let's see
what it comes up with. Okay, here's what
it came up with. I'm not going to read
it all verbatim. You're welcome to pause
and read it yourself. It's pretty long.
But it basically tells Mocha what the
target users should be, what the core
experience should be for the website
visitors, basically how the app should
behave across different platforms or
devices, what the brand or the theme of
the app should look like, what the logic

[06:00]
the app should look like, what the logic
should be for the appointment and the
scheduling features, yada yada yada.
It's really long. And the downside to
prompts like this is it's probably going
to cost me more in credits, but I might
have to prompt it less to get the
desired result. That's kind of the
trade-off. and I don't yet know if it's
worth it or not, but let's go ahead and
see how it works. So, I'm going to copy
all that. I'm going to paste it into
Mocha. And because of the fact that my
prompt was so long, it automatically
created an attachment for it. So, I'm
just typing my prompt is attached. All
right. So, it's 9:37 right now. Let's
see how long it takes to see this app.
It says, "I'll build your multi-tenant
booking widget system." I'm breaking
this into phases. yada yada yada. Okay,
cool. All right. It took four minutes
and 47 seconds to make 12 changes and
deliver 10 files. Let's review. It's
going to call it Bookflow embeddible
widgets, yada yada yada. I'm going to
say, "Show me what it looks like."
Okay, we're going to go ahead and
publish it. bookflow.mmocha.app.

[07:00]
publish it. bookflow.mmocha.app.
Got the settings here and put it on a
custom domain here. All right, let's go
look at what we built. There it is.
Bookflow. Get started. Cool. I can log
in right there. Okay. Looking good so
far. Let's build it out a little more.
All right. And then you can see it right
here in the preview as well. Okay. As
promised, I have received all 100
responses to my poll. And it's kind of
surprising. If you remember when I
looked earlier, appointment booking was
clearly number one, but it ended as tied
for first with a chatbot, which is kind
of surprising. Pricing calculator was
third, testimonials fourth, and contact
forms fifth. Now, what would be really
interesting is building an appointment
booking widget and a chatbot and then
using ads to try to sell these to a
specific industry. If we look at the
demographics of the people that
completed this survey, it's pretty much
50/50. But I want to see what Chad GPT
thinks about all of these responses cuz
there's a hundred different thoughtout

[08:00]
there's a hundred different thoughtout
responses in addition to them just
choosing an option. This guy's saying
Donald Trump has ruined the economy.
Okay? Like, bro, it's just a survey.
It's not It's not that deep. So, we're
gonna go back to Chad GPT. We're gonna
open a new chat. We're gonna say, "All
right, so I told Chad GPT, I posted a
survey to business owners asking what
features they would pay to have on their
website. Below are their written
responses, and attached are the vote
totals. What can I learn from this that
will help me make money?" The single
clearest signal is that appointment
booking is the only feature that cuts
across almost every business type. Even
people who ranked it second said things
like, "I need clients to see my
calendar. This is how my company runs
fast. I do tarot readings and need
scheduling handled for me." Translation:
If you sell a dead simple booking widget
that works everywhere, people will buy
it. It solves an actual pain they have
right now. The second big signal,
contact forms show up strong, but for a
different reason. They're not actually
excited about forms. What they hate is

[09:00]
excited about forms. What they hate is
messy email. They want structure. They
want reliable lead flow, but they think
most of these forms should be free. That
means you don't sell forms standalone.
Instead, you bundle it inside your main
product so it feels included. That is
genius. Half of people think chat bots
are annoying. The other half think that
they're magic. But the real pattern is
that people think chat bots are the
hardest thing to build. Because of that,
they believe it must be expensive. This
is why they rank it first. even when
they don't truly want it. So even though
chat bots didn't win, there's a signal
that the people that ranked it first are
the most willing not just to pay, but to
pay a lot for it because it's implied
that it's probably a lot of work to
build a chatbot. So this is incredibly
interesting. If we just take the data at
face value, we might build an
appointment booking widget. But if we
dig in deeper through the help of JGBT,
then we can build what people will
actually pay for. Because what people
want the most and what people are
willing to pay for are not always the
same thing. In fact, Henry Ford is

[10:00]
same thing. In fact, Henry Ford is
famous for saying, "If I would have
asked my customers what they wanted,
they would have told me a faster horse."
But instead, he invented the Model T.
Nobody will pay for testimonials. It
says, "All in all, your widget should do
this. One, appointment booking. Two,
contact form intake. three, price
calculator builder. And then you add a
simple chatbot layer that answers
questions using the website's pages, not
because they all need it, but because it
makes your offer feel powerful and
expensive. You're basically selling the
last widget your business ever needs.
This is so good. But the top of the
funnel ad should always pitch
scheduling. That's where the strongest
pain point in is. Once they're inside,
you show the other modules. This is
actually much much better than I thought
it would be. Okay, now I'm going to take
ChatGpt's analysis of this data and add
it to Mocha and say I want something
kind of like a super widget app. I want
the widget to have a lot more features
based on the analysis below. And then I
pasted in what Chad GPT gave me. Says
I'll expand BookFlow into a multiode

[11:02]
I'll expand BookFlow into a multiode
widget system based on this analysis.
It's going to do it in phases. Awesome.
Cool. We got appointment booking, smart
contact forms, pricing calculators. So,
this looks like it built the website to
sell the widgets for, which is great.
Let's scale it back a little bit. Just
make one really good appointment booking
widget for dog groomers and nothing
else. Okay, that's a wrap. It took about
18 minutes flat. Here's what we're
looking at. So, it gave me this website
that was basically a website to sell
widgets to home service businesses. So,
I was like, "Okay, this is awesome, but
I want to see the actual widget, like a
functioning prototype. What did it do?"
Oh, and I said, "Specifically for dog
rumors." So, what did it do? It made me
a demo, a working demo. I didn't give it
any details. And this is what it came up
with. It chose basic bath and brush 60
minutes, 45 bucks. Full groom package 75
bucks, 90 minutes, or nail trim only, 15
bucks, and 15 minutes. I'm just going to
pick basic bath and brush. It has a
little calendar, a drop down where I can

[12:00]
little calendar, a drop down where I can
choose the date. Then I can choose the
time. I can put in my name. I can put in
my email, phone, pet name, breed, size,
and special notes. I didn't ask it to do
any of this. It just kind of like
discerned what I might want in a booking
widget for pet groomers. Book
appointment. Done. Okay. Couple prompts
to get to the overall website that sells
all these widgets. And then one more
prompt to get a workable appointment
setting app for dog groomers. And if I
wanted to make this an appointment
setting app for tree trimming companies,
one prompt and I'm done. Super happy
with this result, especially since it
took about 20 minutes, if not less. This
is the world we live in now, right? Just
a few years ago, if you wanted to get
something like this done as simply as I
just showed you, you'd have to hire a
development team. If you hire them here
in the States, it's going to cost you at
least $10,000. Overseas, like the
Philippines or Ukraine, at least $5,000.
And it's going to take weeks back and
forth tweaking, yada yada yada. This
took a few prompts, which just blows my
mind. Think about what this means for

[13:00]
mind. Think about what this means for
speed to market. You can have an idea at
9:00 a.m. and have a working product
ready to sell by noon, by lunch. From
poll to prototype in 16 minutes. Poll,
build, launch. Sell it before you have
it. Ready, fire, aim. That is how you do
business. No more analysis paralysis.
Just start prompting. And if you don't
feel comfortable about your prompt, if
you're insecure about it, then go ask
Chad GPT to make you a better prompt.
The barrier to entry just disappeared.
And you don't have to pay Pikfu hundreds
of dollars to run a poll. Ask your
friends and family. Go to Twitter, go to
Reddit, go to a Facebook group,
anything. And just start asking around.
Remember, this is not a hypothetical
thing that I just built. This is
something that real business owners just
told me that they want and that they
would pay for. That was part of my
question. Super happy with how Mocha
performed. Do me a favor and check out
Mocha at the link below. They are
friends of the pod. Remember, this video
is cool, but it's only cool in so far as
you actually do something about it. So,
go build. Go launch and thank you for
hanging out on the Kerner
