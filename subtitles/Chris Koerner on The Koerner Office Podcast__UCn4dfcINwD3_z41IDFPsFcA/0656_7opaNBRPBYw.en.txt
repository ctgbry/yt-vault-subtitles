[00:00]
this is a very finite time you got to
learn how to develop apps gold rush but
you know what now you can do it with AI
e-commerce is like Shopify has been
around for 15 years but 16 cents of
every dollar are spent online you're
still early the thing that I would say
is maybe too late is Drop Shipping from
Alibaba to shop of that got
oversaturated and it's hard to make that
work totally agree the three categories
I'm most bullish on when it comes to
e-commerce in general for 2025 are
it's kind of crazy to me that picture
2007 okay Steve Jobs announces the
iPhone and I was I mean I was 20 years
old then I was on a mission in Hungary
so I wasn't anywhere near all this I
didn't know the iPhone was a thing until
the next year but you know a lot of
smart people in Silicon Valley on the
coast were like okay there's going to be
a new ecosystem they're going to call it
the App Store all right now you got to
learn how to be a developer you can
launch apps you can be the first and
like I distinctly remember going to eBay
in like 2009

[01:00]
in like 2009
and for whatever reason I searched for
apps for sale on eBay like businesses
for sale and there was a farting app on
eBay for sale for a million dollars and
it was like the first fart app and you
just press a big red button and it would
make fart noises and you could change
the noises and a million dollars okay
and I'm just sure that back then the the
feeling in the air was this is a very
finite time you got to learn how to
develop apps there's only 10,000 apps in
the app app store you got to I want to
be the first to have an app that can you
know act as a level or a flashlight okay
cool cool and it was this gold rush but
you know what it's now been 18 years
since then 18 years and the the level of
opportunity to launch an app in the app
store is still insanely high like you
can still build an app and launch an app
now you can do it with AI there's
millions of apps in the App Store and
it's more competitive but

[02:00]
it's more competitive but
lots of people are still winning every
single day so it's like the charts
change every single week too yes I love
the framework that like you're never too
late for anything like we're we're still
early for e-commerce we're still early
for Amazon we're still early for Bitcoin
for launching apps in the App Store like
you only know that you were late once
it's over you know like if Bitcoin ended
today or tomorrow then you would
literally be late if you bought Bitcoin
today but if it's going to be around for
a hundred years you're very early to buy
Bitcoin right e e-commerce is like
Shopify has been around for 15 years but
like 16 cents of every dollar are spent
online you're still early I I also think
that on that too it's you feel late to
the party but you realize that like the
place at which the party has changed a
little bit that's really what you're
saying too like there there's the
element of like right like e-commerce is
still growing and like eventually when
it eclips 51 cents of the dollar for
every dollar SP spent on transactional

[03:01]
every dollar SP spent on transactional
Commerce then you can be like okay maybe
we're not in the first Innings anymore
whatever but even today we're very much
just still in the first Innings I think
as far
as as far as like starting new companies
if you're thinking like there are
already
500,000 there's nowhere near that many
there are already 10,000 roofing
companies in the United States here
today I'm too late to that all the good
roofing companies are already built and
in the market like you're right that
that like supply and demand for roofing
companies is probably somewhat equal
right now and like you coming into the
market in a new market you'll probably
Drive pricing down very very marginally
but where you're probably wrong is that
I bet every roofing company on the
planet uses a paper Ledger isn't willing
to do quotes over the phone they want to
see the property first and don't know
how to use Google Maps measuring
probably aren't willing to like you know
use AI to search up County records and

[04:00]
use AI to search up County records and
understand what the last roof was built
based on a permit pole um or also
probably aren't willing to like use AI
from an assistant so they pay the
$75,000 a year assistant and you can use
somebody else right so like are you late
to a roofing company yeah can you still
compete because you are early to the
modernday roofing company version
absolutely and I feel like that's that's
kind of like the other way to look at
all of that yeah and I would even take
it a step further and say let's say
we're late to Roofing late as compared
to what so let's say you do want to
start a roofing company okay I'm going
to take 30 roofing contractors in my
area 30 phone numbers and then let's
just pick a tangential industry let's do
landscaping and then let's do pool
installers that's 90 phone numbers I'm
going to call all 90 of them okay five
people answered the phone in Roofing 23
people answered in the other two okay
like we're late on all three of those
but it really seems like the supply and
demand imbalance is in my favor if I'm

[05:01]
demand imbalance is in my favor if I'm
launching a roofing business because
they're not even answering which tells
me either they suck or they're so busy
they don't need to answer their phone
right so it's like late as relative to
what is is also a relevant question to
ask that's a great Point too just in
terms of quality yeah so with the same
argument of you know millions of apps in
the App Store I see AI agents as
something very similar and we were
speaking on your podcast yesterday and
you brought up an idea that gave me
another idea you were asking about the
the YouTube play buttons and the Shopify
yeah yeah buttons tropies yeah so right
and so it's like let's say just like
we're still launching apps in the App
Store we're going to be launching and
selling agents in 20 years with
different random very specified use
cases okay there's millions of options
so as one random idea like this is an
agent that probably won't get built for
five years that I'm about to say but it
could work today okay and maybe this

[06:00]
could work today okay and maybe this
will put it out into the atmosphere and
it'll get built tomorrow because someone
heard this but let's say you had an
agent and all the tech is available to
build this today well let me back up
would you agree Connor that it's not too
late to start a YouTube channel and it's
not too late to start a Shopify store
completely agree that's still great
opportunities okay so those are
represented to put my money where my
mouth is doing both additional on this
year so yeah so so very very much so
agreed well and that carries more weight
coming from you because you've had a
Shopify store for years and a lot of
times when you're in that industry
you're biased and you're like oh it's
saturated everyone's doing it because
you it's proximity bias right but for
you to say the opposite carries even
more weight so so here's yeah I'm
literally starting a new e-commerce
brand this year we maybe talk about that
on a later know yeah we can chat about
it a little bit more yeah I've got some
interesting things in play the thing
that I would say is maybe too late is
just like latent Drop Shipping from

[07:03]
just like latent Drop Shipping from
Alibaba to Shopify like this is this is
where it's like the game has changed
like like if you're take if you're
saying from e-commerce standpoint like I
don't know do people not want to buy
things anymore oh they still want to buy
things okay cool you're still good then
like you're you're not too late whereas
I think the knockoff stuff like if
you're competing on low margin products
back in 2012 you could make a freaking
killing selling next to anything and the
product can be bad and you could still
make money here I will say that I think
the types of products you can do well
with in e-commerce has changed uh a
decent amount but it's not too late to
sell things on a Shopify website
completely agree I look at drop shipping
within the framework of the more
effective a growth hack the shorter its
lifespan right call Drop Shipping an
Arbitrage growth hack and it was
extremely effective for a while but then
it got people caught on to it and then

[08:00]
it got people caught on to it and then
the cpms on the ads went way up and you
you can't drop ship without paid ads
right and your margins aren't great
because you don't own the thing you're
dropping it shipping it from some other
place and so that got oversaturated and
it's hard to make that work totally
agree I think the just for some little
game for people who are listening to
this right now the three categories I'm
most bullish on when it comes to
e-commerce in general for 2025 are
anything premium and luxury I I really
would not sell a low PRC product today
the idea of I mean I think tariffs are
getting implemented today so like that
might change some of the TR Chinese
chimu drop ship competitors but like for
for how long nobody knows so it would be
anything luxury where it's like all
right I'm paying for the brand somebody
might have the same exact widget but I
like your branding better and I believe
in your mission and so that's why I'm
buying it that's the first one second
would be anything custom really hard to
compete with that from a retail
standpoint and I also think that it

[09:00]
standpoint and I also think that it
drops the reverse Logistics returns
substantially and then the last one
would be anything food and beverage same
thing very like there are return rates
for sure much lower than the average
apparel category and it's consumable and
it's something that isn't going to get
competed with by Chinese competitors
those are the three categories that I'm
most bullish about and I'll add an
asterisk to your third category having
owned a company called send eats where
that's all we did was ship food for
other Shopify Brands you want it to be a
food product that is like preferably
under 16 ounces so you could ship it on
USPS first class preferably doesn't
perish for a long time preferably not
refrigerated preferably has a higher
price point so it justifies the shipping
cost that's what I but if all those are
true absolutely I agree with you that's
is the E I think I mean you've done this
more than I have so push back where I'm
wrong here really what you just
described as the easiest way to do it to
make sure that you're not having the
most returns I think that's also the

[10:01]
most returns I think that's also the
most competitive in that category
because if you look at a company like
butcherbox they exploded to like an $800
million a year brand bootstrapped in
five years which
is actually I I said those numbers are
loud that sounds way too high it's a lot
it was a it is a nine figure brand I
don't know if it's 800 million but it is
nine figures for sure and you have to
refrigerate this stuff with dry ice so I
do think that that could be a
competitive advant it works though
because the price point the price point
is higher right like because we used to
ship like meat pies and ice cream and
shpping ice cream
CRA like it's just the the unit
economics do not make sense like we
would take on customers household name
brands that you have heard of that you
see in the grocery store out and they're
shipping like 50 orders a month because
it it doesn't make sense financially no
I I agree with all that dude all right I
haven't even got to the agent idea so oh
sorry sorry yeah go no it's good you
brought up the what did you ask about
YouTube plaques and the Shopify well I

[11:00]
YouTube plaques and the Shopify well I
yesterday we were talking about the
company send a friend has a 1 million
plaque and I was like that's cool
anytime anytime I see that somebody has
a 1 million order Shopify plaque I ask
myself what can I do to get that like I
have one of those counters in my decor
for my living room that shows like total
number of orders and updates once a day
girlfriend hates it but it stays and so
that's that is my my little like trophy
that I've got currently yeah so imagine
an agent okay so I asked you the
question is it too late to launch a
Shopify store or a YouTube uh Channel no
okay so let's say you want to know what
to launch you're one of those many
people that want to launch a Shopify
store or YouTube channel you have an
agent that goes out there and it surfes
all of social media Reddit Twitter
everything and anytime someone posts a
picture and it just uses image
recognition image recognition software
very basic AI stuff anytime someone
posts a picture of their new plaque
either Shopify YouTube it triggers like

[12:01]
either Shopify YouTube it triggers like
another agent that goes and does
research it's like okay this channel
this YouTube channel called Joe's Tech
channel it's going to go do research how
long has it been around wow three months
okay how many videos has it put out how
many shorts how many of those
subscribers okay how many views per
short how many views per long and it
just has all this math and then it just
delivers a report in your inbox that
says this is how to reverse engineer
Joe's YouTube channel here's exactly
what he did his minutes are his videos
are three and a half minutes long he
leads with a hook he has background
music that's trending y y it's like if
you want to win at YouTube and you don't
mind being in the tech Niche then you
need to copy what Joe did he just put up
his plaque he got 100,000 subscribers in
three months right same thing with
Shopify what do you think I love it so
video is cool but you know what's better
long form audio via podcast and my
newsletter TKO pod.com go there to
subscribe for free to my newsletter it's
one email a week very tactical and then
go to my audio podcast three episodes a
week stuff like like this you're going
to love it all free no sleazy sales

[13:01]
to love it all free no sleazy sales
TKO pod.com I think I'm trying to
like slap a category on this as far as
like how can you like what's the
commercial value how to you do this for
other things whatever and what it got me
thinking of was this is going to unlock
so many more lead gen activity signals
so here's what I mean by that there are
a couple different I mean not even a
couple there are a ton of different lead
gen Services where you can download as
many many leads as you want free leads
whatever not not free leads paid leads
and one of the top high intent signals
that happens with with a company when
like every vendor on the planet hits
them up is they raised a round of
funding uhuh yep chis krer LLC just
closed a $50 million series a fantastic
Chris I'm Conor let me tell you
something like that's every single
company on the planet and that's because
all of the fundraising announcements are
public so now the question becomes
what's all the really hard get data the

[14:00]
what's all the really hard get data the
data that's like it doesn't go across
the newswire and therefore they're not a
relevant lead but like if I knew every
single YouTube channel that as soon as
they cross the $100,000 subscriber Mark
they're probably a good customer for me
and like you know right now YouTube it
has that I'm sure you can probably
scrape every channel that has 100,000
subscribers but what are the the
intangible things that you can't and so
is that like the example that comes to
mind I don't think you can necessarily
scrape Instagram but maybe I'm so WR on
that would be like every time that a
diamond ring is posted and somebody gets
engaged great now I am the not or
whatever the company is that like helps
plan weddings and it's you suddenly it's
suddenly great we scraped Instagram you
know Kelly and John are getting married
all right jump over what do we think
their emails are great we got their
emails now we're uploading it in a CRM
and we're automatically reaching out to
them with a cold email saying hey saw
that you might be getting married is

[15:00]
that you might be getting married is
there any chance that you would be
looking for us for a wedding planner
like and it would be a lot more like
visual based stuff that is not as easily
trackable yeah but can get you a ton of
information dude and it's here I did
this when I recorded my screen when I
had these 10 operators running at the
same time the 10th prompt was go to my
Instagram account because it's trained
to to what I want click on the my for
you page start watching reals if you
find a real that's about a business idea
that has over 500,000 views bookmarket
watch it and it did it and here's what I
did I went to Instagram I downloaded one
of those reels and it was I specifically
picked a reel that had no audio it had
background music but no one was saying
anything it was a video of some home
service workers resurfacing a pool
that's exactly what it was it was 15
seconds long I downloaded it to my
computer I named it something generic I
named it chat gbt video because I didn't
want it to know anything about this
video and I uploaded it to chat GPT not

[16:00]
video and I uploaded it to chat GPT not
the operator but the chat GPT 4.0 and I
said what is happening in this video and
it was like well you know would you like
us to do this I was like yes and it was
like okay we can analyze flame frames
per second we can tell we can use image
recognition technology do you want me to
do this yes okay well we can't really
here are five things happening in this
video and it listed out one through five
and they were all blank and I was like
there's nothing there what's happening
in this video and it was like well we
see on the screen it says customer
wanted a new pool which was true but but
that was that's all it could recognize
it couldn't actually tell me a guy had a
thing and he had black tar and he was
spreading it it couldn't tell me what
was happening but then when I went and
watched reals inside of operator I said
what what's happening in this video and
it told me and then I said how did you
know that what and I'm like did you use
the transcript and it was like no I just
watched it frame by frame and that was
what I was thinking I'm like if a video
is just a bunch of frames and it can
understand what's in picture why can't
it just understand a bunch of pictures

[17:00]
it just understand a bunch of pictures
stitched together and so operator did
watch a real for me and it literally and
it said all right I bookmarked it and
then I opened up Instagram on my phone
and it wasn't bookmarked I'm like no you
didn't you need to go into bookmarks and
there's one called all post and you need
to save it to the one called all posts
and then it did and it actually did it
for me so now it's like I can go to
sleep and if I want to do research for
reals to play in the background I can
just wake up to a bunch of bookmarks and
I'm paying my assistant in the
Philippines to do that today that's cool
not for your assistant in the
Philippines but that's
cool well it is cool for her because she
would rather be editing videos and that
means you can edit a lot more videos you
know and you have way more output then
you have then you beat everyone else yes
completely agree so what you're saying
like we could put that together today
find a diamond ring okay go cross
reference them with yeah here's me
trying to put my smart cap on and think
through like how this how this plays out
right so we're talking about the idea of

[18:00]
right so we're talking about the idea of
distribution being a leverage or a
larger Mo big competitor advantage and
that's what everyone's gonna be chasing
what's the number I mean I'll put the
ball in your coin you I'm sure you'll
answer your spot on what's the number
one way to get distribution today
content social media social media I was
GNA say I was say Facebook ads yeah
Facebook ads yeah like it's or at least
the easiest right you raise a big round
you don't need an audience anyone can
create an account yeah right face
Facebook gets 50% of every C back dollar
right because it's all funneling back
there bu metastock not Financial advice
but I would say the question then
becomes if Facebook is getting
overrun like let's play it out five
years Facebook gets overrun with a ton
of content because distribution is all
that matters and then therefore people's
willingness to click and engage with an
ad beacons to drop because everyone has
the best ad and therefore it's all not
working as well anymore you know what's
the next lever and is it probably like

[19:01]
the next lever and is it probably like
does nobody really does bis Dev for for
Consumer products because it's not
profitable you can't hire a sales and a
bdr team to hand reach out to everyone
and it's like not the way that the
buying Cycle Works typically unless it's
like an ultra Ultra Luxury product but
like will that change like it'll be
interesting to think with the increase
in demand from an advertisers side on
Facebook and like the messiness and the
busyness and of all of it and the
decreasing the cost to go direct to the
consumer via email as a Channel or via
phone calls or text messages messages as
a channel will you know marketing and
sales channels for consumer goods change
I think that's my that's my one smart
maybe maybe illogical thought of the day
but it it kind of raises the question I
think it's just going to make
humans ironically it's going to make
humans more important than ever and
having a community and a loyal following

[20:00]
having a community and a loyal following
as an actual human is going to be more
important than ever because right now
there's a ton of course Sellers and
that's another framework is like what
are the course sellers doing what are
the course sellers selling and like
that's kind of that's indicative of like
the broader economy right or or it's
indicative of first principles right and
today there are countless core sellers
selling faceless YouTube channel courses
it's faceless literally was like in no
one's vernacular two years ago and now
it's all about faceless why because we
want to have our cake and eat it too we
all want to be content creators and in
the media and we all want to have a
YouTube channel uh but we don't want to
show our face because I I just want I
don't I don't want to be out there like
that okay well you're GNA pay a price
for that like you're going to pay a
price because any AI in the world can
create a faceless YouTube channel that
has perfect editing viral breaking news
faster than any human could ever do it
okay so if you want if you want to
actually be real then you need to be
willing to to actually put your real
face uh in front of a camera I agree end

[21:02]
face uh in front of a camera I agree end
of St well so here's I agree then I also
had a completely different debate with
my girlfriend two nights ago arguing the
other side of that coin and so on on
what you just said I do think that the
human side of things is going to be
increasingly important but the debate I
had with my girlfriend the other night
was no that doesn't matter at all all
that actually matters is how
entertaining it can be and the most
entertaining thing is going to win and
my my final point of the argument where
I feel like I I wanton it was look at
Avatar it's like the highest freaking
grossing movie of all time or one of
them and it's like entirely CGI based
it's but it's because like it's a
cinematography Masterpiece and like I
don't know I I I really don't know where
like are is every movie 20 years from
now going to be with actors and
actresses that don't aren't real like
she loves that she loves seeing like
that guy in some other movie but also

[22:01]
that guy in some other movie but also
like at some point does it matter like
if the movie's better the movie has a
better plat line better story AR like
whatever and everyone in it happens to
be fake does that matter I I look at it
as no different like than like an
acoustic guitar versus an electric
guitar or EDM vers acoustic music like I
different styles it's just they just
coexist you know it's it's yeah I guess
I guess it's a good point like in the
same way that cartoons are a thing today
and animated movies are a thing today
but that doesn't mean that I'm not going
to still watch the same you know
realistic movie you know Fast and
Furious 11 when it comes out or it's
kind of like even processed foods you
know it's like the the pendulum swung
it's like wow we can manufacture these
Foods so cheaply there's no trade-offs
and then it's like oh we're all getting
cancer and fat yeah turns out there is a
trade-off I just want to eat a banana
picked off the banana tree myself right
yeah so it's like we probably will swing
in that direction where it's like this
is the amazing we don't need to we don't
need a100 million set in Hollywood we

[23:02]
need a100 million set in Hollywood we
can do it anywhere one guy on a MacBook
can make a feature film that makes a
billion dollars in the in movie theaters
and then it's going to be like H this
isn't very authentic I kind of like how
it was and it's not like we're gonna go
away from that they'll just like coexist
that's a good point yeah I all right
that s that solves my argument there I
don't know I could be wrong but is this
gonna be like are we expecting an AI
agent launch from you next year or you
just you know implementing them
throughout your entire company like
final final notes Here for this episode
what are you thinking dude I want to
launch so many things because there's
just so much to launch like I would love
to take all of my content and make uh a
business partner app where like I could
be your business partner for $5 a month
right in an iPhone app and you can just
Chris what would you do here Chris
here's my background what would you
start based on what you know it's like a
zero Equity $5 a month business partner
right that's one
idea there's there's a zillion ideas and
there's only so much time so I need to

[24:00]
there's only so much time so I need to
build some agents that can launch
businesses for me so I can just launch
whatever I want whenever I want so
interest interesting end question that I
was thinking earlier in this episode and
I want to get your take on it because I
feel like you and I think about
companies relatively in the same way I
think I think you've actually kind of
persuaded me a little bit more to look
at them more as like you know you build
them up you have fun with them you cash
to them and like if they go away they go
away type of thing like don't don't try
to hold on to something forever if it's
not meant to be in a in a way still you
know you have companies that you've had
for five plus years or even longer if
I'm not familiar with them so I guess my
question for you is right now almost
every business that I start I start with
two reasons in mind one want to make
money two it is a challenge to solve but
I don't necess like and I love the game
of solving a challenge but I don't
necessarily care always about the
challenge that I'm solving you know
almost every company that we have today
I enjoy problem solving but like so

[25:02]
I enjoy problem solving but like so
indifferent about the industries and
don't necessarily care about them a ton
whereas like somebody who is you know
passionate sushi maker and they love
sushi and they love the culture like
that's that's the sport for them my
question here is do you think there will
ever be a point sorry maybe before the
question but I will also see you know in
this Elon Musk era super inspiring stuff
of like their stuff's changing the world
and it looks really hard and I bet it
doesn't make money for the first 10
years and you got to raise a bunch of
cash and it's like big hairy audacious
goal Master Vision but it's really cool
too do you ever get jealous of those
guys and do you ever think that you'll
want to flip the scale to doing stuff
like that after a certain dollar
follower amount whatever or do you think
that no to you it's like I love the game
of like business like like running
companies and it doesn't have to change
the world from a tech standpoint that's
an amazing question
yes with with one caveat like I'm this

[26:02]
yes with with one caveat like I'm this
is gonna sound like the laziest thing
I've ever said but I would do that but I
don't want it to be like I don't want it
to be hard does that make sense like
everything Elon Musk has done has been
so hard and he's changing the world and
good for him but I I don't think you
have to do it's funny like I want my
hard things to be intentional and
deliberate like I'm going to go run an
ultra marathon okay but I don't want to
like try to change the world in a way
that's like that reduces my quality of
life and makes me an unhappy person at
the end of the day maybe that's the
better way of putting it is not hard but
like makes me unhappy and I don't love
what I'm doing one thing that I would
like to do is like you know I donated my
kidney to a stranger yes and I'm like
I'm a huge believer that more people
should do that that there's been zero
downside to my life my wife did it
there's been zero downside we don't even
remember it happened there's no pills
there's no dietary changes and lives are
saved you know so like I would love to
have like a nonprofit that petitions the

[27:01]
have like a nonprofit that petitions the
government to allow people to be paid to
donate their kidneys because other
countries do that and like it it's a
GameChanger like people people are
afraid of it because they think it'll be
abused and gamblers and addicts well
they'll just use it to make money and it
will exploit poor people but there are a
million guard rails you can put in place
and there's precedent of it happening
where that's not the case and it's a net
win and like you go from 5,000 people
dying a year from kidney disease to zero
like that's POS POS so I would to have
something that did like I'd enjoy it I
wouldn't make money from it and it would
change the world so yes but I don't want
to start like a rocket company because
that doesn't sound fun yeah so okay so I
think I think your answer back makes
sense where you don't have to invent
something that doesn't exist like maybe
you know you're you're causing a lot of
social change and social good for
Humanity and it's going to be hard to do
that so like just to you know play that
but like there's a path you know how to
do it versus just like I need to
configure a new form of technology that

[28:01]
configure a new form of technology that
does not exist yet and like let's spend
five years in a lab just doing that and
that's that sounds really daunting
whereas yours is more all right I know
who we have to talk to I know that the
incentives that we have to put in place
and it's not going to be easy but
there's a Playbook and we're gonna
follow that Playbook yep because what
you just described before that does not
sound fun you know like I think it's it
sounds I get jealous of it a little bit
from the headline standpoint when I'm
like oh that sounds really Co but I do
agree with you that it's the equivalent
of you know what was the the one guy
that just come out this week I think he
was working like a super sonic jet for
the last eight years so 10 nine years
whatever and they just launched it this
week but I've never heard of him for
eight or nine years and maybe all of his
friends and family he was like you know
heads down doing this thing and now that
he's launched it I'm like oh that
jealous of that that sounds fun but like
if I had known about the journey the
entire time I probably would have
thought oh that sounds really hard and
like good luck with that I'm going to go
you know online and and make money today

[29:02]
you know online and and make money today
yeah there's there's people out there
doing awesome stuff that I I'm not
willing to do yeah but happy that
they're out there yeah we need them cool
man all right cool love it all right
what you think please share it with a
friend and we'll see you next time on
the ker office
