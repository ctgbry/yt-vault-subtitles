his question and we'll just get right
after it cool hell yeah all
right all right Riley thank you for
joining so Riley before I have you talk
I'm going to introduce Noah Kagan Noah
Kagan has literally been blogging for a
quarter of a century it sounds a lot
longer than it is but 24 years right
2000 he is the co-founder of appsumo
employee number 30 at Facebook I've been
I have not been reading his blog since I
was 13 years old I've been reading it
probably since I was 23 though and it's
an amazing blog and he just wrote a book
called million dooll weekend and on one
hand I love the book because it's really
good and on the other hand I kind of
hate it because it's every in my head
and it's like kind of the book that I

[07:01]
and it's like kind of the book that I
wanted to write one day but he beat me
to the punch so now I have to think of
something else to write about we were
going to put your name on the cover it
was gonna be Chris Corner's presents
million dollar weekend written by Noah k
and t RZ I should have answered that
text man I'm really bad about that you
know how you gave me that voice memo
that was four hours long and then I
literally copied all of it into a book
into audible that's it so be careful
don't law sleepwalking and voice memoing
it's dangerous
anyway thank you for joining
Noah happy to be here we thanks all
right Riley you've got a just tell us
what you've got sure I'll try and keep
it simple um about a year ago I made a
big transition from owning an auto
detailing business to a startup in
finance and so it's been rewiring my
brain to learn how to Market a different
type of business so we are in the
financial services industry we to keep
it really simple we provide services to

[08:01]
it really simple we provide services to
wealth management firms to help with
their clients charitable giving um and
so technically their clients are our
customers but really who we're marketing
to is the financial advisers and we've
pretty well dialed in our offer it's
pretty compelling and the hurdle really
is trying to get in front of more people
and so we're growing but there's always
ways to improve and so my questions are
pertaining to one I guess one last bit
of context sales cycle is pretty long
our business is seasonal because most
people are doing all their charitable
giving towards the end of the year in Q4
so we could talk to someone in January
it would go really well but they're not
going to need our services until
December or November and so first
question is some tips on staying top of
mind with prospects and existing
relationships and then the second one
just looking for creative ideas for lead
genen we have a few different channels
um but I would love some ideas for cold

[09:01]
um but I would love some ideas for cold
Outreach or stimulating referrals and
yeah how so one you literally were
probably the first person ever who's
like I'm going to tell you simple and
you told it simple whenever someone does
that like I'm going to tell you it
really quickly I'm just like
okay like Well Done sir thank you thank
you how's this business versus the auto
detailing business um it's it's totally
different I love it because it's we
could we could work with anyone across
the country or across the world whereas
my detailing business it was in Boise
Idaho and it was hyper localized and so
the the things that I really excelled
that don't really apply to trying to
reach someone in New York City or or or
across the country and so but it's more
rewarding because we're growing a
company that could be huge compared to
what a local business would be so it's
totally different but it's stretching me
and so I love it good for you good for
good for you Live Your Dream yeah nice

[10:02]
good for you Live Your Dream yeah nice
man so a few just uh trying to few
questions to understand things so you
bought it or you started it I I just
joined the startup so I didn't start
this one I started the auto detailing
business it's called UI charitable
advisors I literally just saw a company
get funded for like a hundred million do
yesterday which has zero discouragement
it's just like oh what an interesting
space so you guys help wealth managers
facilitate Dao fiscal
sponsorship field of Interest funds yeah
primarily it's Donor advised funds or or
daffs and that's like 90% of what we do
so
it's I'm trying to make sure I
understand the problem so with these
wealth managers it's setting up a daf
for someone or executing their daf
getting them to use us to set up dafs
for their clients so the client a daf is
basically um like a health savings
account oh do you have one okay yeah
yeah it's your charitable savings

[11:00]
yeah it's your charitable savings
account and
so advisors are just a huge source of
referrals for that and what's unique
about us is that the advisor can
continue to manage the investment of the
assets and so they can manage it just
like they would the rest of the client's
portfolio charge their investment fee on
it if they want to make invest in a real
estate fund or or private Equity they
can do that which is unique in the daff
space and so advisers love us all right
hold on right so how big is the company
or sales so far Sorry by the way I don't
know how much time we have like we can
do more yeah you're good you're good
okay yeah we got a team of 12 we have
$350 million in daffs so we we're
growing really fast uh I mean compared
to our competitors though like Schwab
and Fidelity they're in the you know $40
billion so we're we're actually a pretty
small fish but we're growing fast and
yeah it was funny I was thinking last
night you know one of the best best
companies to kick their ass is Google

[12:02]
companies to kick their ass is Google
because they kind of like drag their ass
on some of these areas that I think are
opportuni like they gave up Google
Reader that is gone and I was I was just
thinking about other areas of their
business like they haven't updated Gmail
in forever right it's like the same
email thing for 10 years so I like the
idea you're going out because I did my
daf which for people I guess that don't
know sure you give you give stock and
then you get a tax write off on that
stock and then you can that stock NOW is
only used to donate money to charity
yep and so I did it through Schwab but
it's kind of a pain in the ass and then
I my wealth managers are facilitating it
through Schwab right so why would
someone do it through your stuff through
directly through their Schwab account
with their wealth manager because most
wealth managers use Vanguard or Schwab
or brokerages yeah so we offer a lot
more flexibility at at every step of the
way so we can accept more than just cash
and stock we do a lot of donations of
real estate or privately held business
interest crypto Fine Arts and
collectibles so we're much better at
anything complex um with how it's

[13:02]
anything complex um with how it's
managed the advisers can still use their
own custodian so if they use Schwab they
would still set up an account at Schwab
but instead of choosing from four
different mutual funds to invest the
money in the daff they can do anything
that they do in their normal course of
business and so it's much more flexible
from an investment standpoint and for a
user experience for their clients we
have a a much better portal and so it's
it is a better un user experience the
clients like it and it's the same price
as Schwab so there's no friction from a
a price point either Riley what does
your average client look like sure um
average account size well I guess our
average advisor is independent wealth
advisor so we don't work with big box
firms like Merl Lynch or Morgan Stanley
um so independent Wealth
Advisors um that's our our target
audience
and then how have by the way your guys

[14:01]
and then how have by the way your guys
about page looks like uh the perfect
family I've ever seen you know they are
in Provo Utah so yeah we're in Utah soy
life anyone go move to proo Utah real
content so I guess in marketing you guys
have it's Nots like you have a clear
Playbook and you're executing and it's
working so you know my my main answer
would just keep doing that okay I know
you're looking for something new but I
think something old is more successful
which is sounds like you have a you have
a play how do you guys get a hold of
these wealth managers currently sure um
kind of four main channels um and the
first one is hopefully going to be our
biggest one eventually but finding some
formal integration Partnerships which
could bring in a lot of inbound uh leads
to attending industry events so going to
conferences um in the wealth management
industry uh referrals from existing
advisors and then cold
Outreach and you know I think one of the
big things in marketing do you have a
clear go you you have a clear goal for
how many you know clients you're trying

[15:01]
how many you know clients you're trying
to see or is it the assets under
management you're trying to Target uh
both yeah and then are you guys on track
for your goal this year it's so it's so
hard to predict because most of the
business happens in November and
December so we in terms of generating
leads and having those meetings we are
on track but we we were on track last
year and didn't end up hitting our our
assets under management goals and so
even though we we were generating enough
leads we didn't close enough of those I
guess but then you guys can accurately
predict like hey we have this many leads
and here's how much they generated so
you know what the actual new number
should be this year it's it's just so
unpredictable because we could get you
know a $20 million daff coming the door
out of nowhere or it could be a bunch of
$50,000 defs and so trying to predict
the size and it it's been really tough
to predict Riley if it's a $20 million
defa what do you guys make on that and
how long do you expect that customer to
stick around sure with the big ones
those so we we charge the way that we

[16:01]
those so we we charge the way that we
make money is we charge an AUM fee so
it's based off what's in the account so
if they donated 20 million and then
immediately send it out to charity would
barely make anything um but most of the
the larger daffs so it's it starts at
0.6% or 60 basis points for the first
500,000 and then it works its way down
to 10 basis points the larger the daff
and so um I don't even know off the top
of my head what that would be on a $20
million da but um
yeah so a a assets under management fee
I think I'm kind of confused though so
you guys line up all these people but
someone like myself doesn't submit to my
daff until end of the
year that's just when that's just when
people end up making their donations at
least the the large bulk of them I don't
know if I'd buy
that because like yeah I think it's like
at the end of fiscal year so you want to
lock in the tax
benefits I think like is there a benefit
for me getting it in now
it would be the same benefit as doing it

[17:00]
it would be the same benefit as doing it
at the end of the year but I think the
reason why we see so much at the end is
because people are having their whatever
annual or quarterly meetings with their
advisers in September October and
they're looking at how much they made
this year looking at what their tax
burdens going to look like the next year
and then that's what's pushing them to
make a contribution before the end of
the year are you guys trying to get more
clients that are super rich like Chris
or like low rich like
me um we've seen the most success with
the higher net worth just because our
our offering is a white glove super
flexible lots of creative things that
people can do from a philanthropic
standpoint um it's it benefits people in
the lower income
brackets but it's more negligible to
compare us to Schwab if if it's a
smaller da but the benefits do really
show up with the high net worth people
what's high net
worth um I guess I would say over
500,000 in a daff there's you know
giving to International organizations we

[18:00]
giving to International organizations we
see people that will um instead of just
writing a check to a charity they could
issue a loan at no interest so it still
benefits the charity but you know just
more creative ways to fund philanthropic
Endeavors but it doesn't necessarily
make sense if if you don't have more
than 500 Grand in your death dude my I
think my death the two two pain points
for me is one my death is 12,000
so I donated all my Intel stock because
int's trash um but then secondly the
thing I was sucky about the way that it
worked for me is when I donated the
stock it converted it into some generic
like balanced fund is that how it works
in all Ds not with us so you could keep
it in Intel I mean we have people that
donate Bitcoin and keep it in Bitcoin um
it it can stay how you donated it if you
make an ink kind donation like that and
you can work with your adviser to invest
it exactly how you want to and that's
that's

[19:00]
that's
different so what can what do you want
what are you hoping to walk away with
from today really some some creative
ideas probably specifically with cold
Outreach what are what are some ways to
stand out um there's so much we we we do
a lot of email Outreach and it's hard to
get noticed hard to get someone's
attention once we have the conversations
it goes well but it's that getting that
first conversations that's the the
toughest I've got two ideas for you
Riley one is one is very boring one
might be a little sexy so I love this
business because if you have a million
dollar daff according to what you said
that's $6,000 a year that gross profit
to your company right y 60 basis points
so they might stay five years 10 years
so that's a that's a valuable customer
and that might not even be the biggest
customer that you could get and so to me
that that means you can spend a lot of
money to acquire them and when I say a
lot of money I mean like more
handholding and so the unsexy answer to
this is just a boiler room full of cold
cers in Provo Utah I don't know if

[20:00]
cers in Provo Utah I don't know if
you're calling geographically or not
like if a lot of your customers are in
the area because it's easier to sell to
the the the close customers um I just
think that would work and it's just a
numbers game and it's not sexy and it's
the most obvious thing but sometimes the
most you know the unsexy thing is the
best thing the sexy answer is research
what brex did with their growth hacking
techniques they sent bottles of
champagne um to corporate offices in in
San Francisco I think you should lean
into your geog being in Provo Utah like
the highest density of Mormons in the
world and like ship Diet Coke to these
customers and just just like a tongue
and cheek we're in Provo this is what we
do y y y a it'll be a lot cheaper than
champagne B it's just kind of funny and
it will stand out more it worked for
them and probably probably a similar LTV
brex and and you guys yeah I like that a
lot we definitely want to dominate Utah
um because it's just the most immediate
thing to to look look at and and we we
do pretty well in Utah and there's

[21:01]
do pretty well in Utah and there's
actually it's one of the highest
concentration of people that have we
giving a lot to charity and so it is a
pretty good target market that makes
sense because Chris did to I'm only
gonna give you one
idea let me just rip on a few thoughts
like I think the number one thing I've
always done in business is like how did
you guys get your existing best
customers and where did that come from
and how did you get those Partners or
customers and literally just do more of
that I I know it's like we wanted try a
lot of new things is fun but like you
probably got them through connections or
LinkedIn or like not cold sure yeah most
of it's from referrals the see like have
you really gone through every single
referral of the referral I think there's
probably a lot more on that bone every
everyone for everyone including myself
um two other ideas that I was kind of
just I don't know goofing around on one
is where else are those people doing
charity things so like does that make
sense like charity auctions H because I
think it's like where else are people
doing charity stuff where they're like

[22:00]
doing charity stuff where they're like
hey I'm this is a benefit tax-wise oh
there's other tax opportunities uh it's
more of an awareness thing so I think
that's one option that I think would be
cool to just a lot of times in marketing
do it in the same
medium the other thing I was thinking is
I think a lot of people maybe when
you're in the you know like Chris in the
you know nine figures but someone like
me six plus nine figures including four
decimal points decimal points yeah Chris
is European where it's like there's no
combos just dots the other idea there uh
that I was thinking about I think
there's a lot of information issue like
for me I I love tax
opportunities so I love them like if
anyone has some tax creative idea like
there's there's a few lately I just
think you need can you send people
postcard email letter uh that's like hey
do you know that you could save 50% in
your taxes or you could save $20,000
this year and then maybe make it a
little bit more Target in your Outreach
so like for appsumo we email Partners
saying hey can we send you us a $100,000
check they're like yes I'll talk to you

[23:02]
check they're like yes I'll talk to you
so what's the equivalent of that where
it's like hey do you know that you could
have saved so for me I had like a
$10,000 credit on my Intel stock and the
daap has actually grown even though I've
already been donating it so I think
there's an awareness opportunity for you
with very targeted people within your
network and then maybe uh I would
probably try to pattern match these
existing customers it might be Mormons
like Chris is
saying but I I think you know just
pattern match them and and then I would
be more targeted yeah absolutely that
makes
sense cool well thank you Riley thank
you have fun man have a good one see
y all right we've got we've got Brian
Summers next you
ready another sip of
tea you want to plug it a little bit to
sleep H yeah yeah let's do it man this
is fun it's interesting it's good to get
the brain juices flowing it is fun yeah
you never know what you never know who's
going to pop up next how'd you find

[24:01]
going to pop up next how'd you find
these people uh they just through my
website they just messag me questions oh
really yeah like I mean you get DMS too
right like hey can you help me with X Y
or Z and now I just have my assistant go
in and say fill out this form and come
on my show and I'll answer your
question so okay works out all right I'm
letting in
Brian Brian hello there how are you man
doing well thanks how are you guys doing
good good
good all right so you have you sell
loans to self-employed people yeah I I
started with a company and it's one of
the things we offer and a lot of places
don't and so I just uh I'm curious about
uh creative ways of finding uh
entrepreneurs and uh business owners and
self-employed people what are they use
these loans is that what the number one
thing you want us to talk about is these
loans are they mortgages yeah they're
mortgages is so uh most most loans they

[25:01]
mortgages is so uh most most loans they
have to go by what they uh by what they
claim on their taxes so if they ride off
a bunch of stuff they're screwed when
they go in to get the loan because they
have to go by what their taxes State um
but these loans were able to go by bank
statements so we can look at uh uh 12
months or 24 months of their bank
statements and then go by their revenue
if we can see that a lot of cash is
coming in then we can qualify them with
that
what do the rates look like oh sorry
Tris yeah go ahead it's loans for kind
of
entrepreneurs yeah exactly and
self-employed anybody that's
self-employed and then you know my
favorite question where do you find
where have you found your existing
customers so um mostly uh I've done a
different kind of loan mostly VA loans
uh working with
veterans and um so I was in a I was in a
company that specialized in that and
they would send out they would send out
mailers and we get calls

[26:03]
in how do your rates compare to a normal
loan or your fees so a bank statement
loan is going to be uh usually a point
higher than like a regular VA or a
conventional conventional
loan and the fees are
similar so the first thing that comes to
my head is I saw a tweet about this a
year or two ago and it was someone
complaining about how hard it is as an
entrepreneur to get a mortgage and I've
been self-employed forever and so I've
been there and it's it's the worst and
so I feel like you've got an amazing
pain Point here to solve one that it
seems like a lot of people either can't
solve or or are unwilling to solve
because they higher risk I feel like you
could go through like Guru business
micro influencers to talk about this are
you legally allowed to give referral
fees or affiliate fees on these loans
because I feel like that would be
sizable to someone with 10,000 business

[27:00]
sizable to someone with 10,000 business
followers in the home service Niche if
they were to sell five or 10 loans for
you that could be be a good amount of
income oh that's an excellent question
I'm not sure but I'll have to look in
and see if that's uh if that's allowed
under the current
laws it it doesn't seem like you would
be competing with a lot of other offers
like if you go watch YouTube influencers
of people like Noah um you're not going
to see them talking about this stuff
they're not promoting stuff like this
and so that's either a good thing
because you wouldn't be competing with
others or it's a bad thing because it's
been tried and and someone failed at it
right Chris is all of your advice come
from Twitter threads is that what you
do read Twitter all day long you're like
I saw a tweet that said send bottles I
saw a tweet that's you
do everything I know I learned from
Twitter I got dude I'm on Tik Tok Tik
tok's how I run appsumo okay uh who
should I hire Tik Tok uh
done ticket and it's done okay ticket

[28:02]
done ticket and it's done okay ticket
Brian so I I think this is like Brian
how are you not a
billionaire because all entrepreneurs
even including myself like I have a
company it's a C Corp it's like
officially stuff it's hard for me to get
loans you know so like how are you just
not printing you just got is this a new
unit you're just R ramping up it's a new
yeah it's a it's a new company I'm in
the last company I was in didn't offer
it and I didn't didn't even really know
about it in the old uh in The Old
Company and so it just seems like
there's a an untapped
Market I think what's what's challenging
is these are mortgage loans as Chris was
asking yeah it's like a very specific
time for a very specific
moment right so how do you find the
people it's like insurance right either
you have to have something bad or you
have to you know there's some things
that that trigger the the thought to
make a purchase right it's not like a
it's not food where you have to eat
three times a day or something like that
so I guess how do you connect when's the

[29:01]
so I guess how do you connect when's the
moment that an entrepreneur and where
are where do they go they're like hey
I'd like to to get a loan for a house
but maybe as an entrepreneur it's going
to be
tough right and so I guess what I'm
hoping is that I become known as the
entrepreneur the guy who can help
entrepreneurs so when that when that
time happens they know okay this is the
guy to call he's he can get you through
these uh through these Waters
so I
wonder there's a lot of real there's a
lot of like mortgage loans right
uhhuh but I I I guess would they want to
pass you guys the loans they don't take
for
entrepreneurs I I don't know I guess the
the areas that I'm thinking about is
when is someone thinking about getting a
house it's like they go to a mortgage
person right they go to a website which
that's expensive or they go to like try
to get a loan and they're the loan
person's like yeah I just can't do a
good loan for you but they may not want
to so one I think they could pass your
referrals but that's tough I think the

[30:00]
referrals but that's tough I think the
other thing I would be curious about
could you connect with more people that
have a lot of influence to solar
preneurs so specifically I was thinking
about are there
incubators are there accelerators are
there groups that have a lot of
Freelancers or self-employed people
making six figures probably or close to
six figures so they can even afford a
house nowadays but I think it's like how
do you get your your seed planted in
these these key areas so would this be
like uh would this be like local uh
local groups are you thinking or or
places on the
internet I think you you know one of the
groups I would think about is like you
know Dynamite Circle join Hampton's
entrepreneur organization YPO people
that honestly have money right because
the some of the the smaller groups it's
not that they're smaller but like I
think you could hit up incubators I
would try that as an approach okay
yeah even Brian what if you uh you just
bought ads on like lendingtree.com

[31:00]
bought ads on like lendingtree.com
right people go to apply for a mortgage
and they're pessimistic because they're
self-employed and then they see your ad
for the self-employed mortgage guy right
like that could be your name that could
be your brand and that's to me if if
it's such a problem which I believe it
is as soon as people just see your name
they're going to be interested before
they even see your content that's that's
what my back to Twitter I'm sorry sorry
no are you doing one more Twitter
reference I'm doing it I'm doing it like
when I first started on well when I
started on Twitter on my my newest
account I didn't start as Chris Kerner
because everyone wants no one wants to
read what Chris Kerner has to say
because they don't know who Chris Kerner
is but I started as the mobile home park
guy because I had just bought and sold
25 mobile home parks there were strip
mall guy there was Self Storage guy
there was no mobile home park guy so I
thought okay people are going to judge
me based on the fact that they're going
to assume that I know stuff about mobile
home parks not on the fact that I'm some
know name right and so if you go create
a Persona online people will read your

[32:00]
a Persona online people will read your
content through a positive filter they
they'll have positive confirmation bias
as they read your content assuming that
you'll know what you're talking about
and they'll be interested in you before
they even read a word of what you say
because of your name
yeah I would try that oh that's great
yeah thank
you anything else
Noah yeah there's a company
oo.com I don't yeah sometimes instead of
like making your own party go to where
the party is so oo has a lot of like
self-employed rich people it's software
for seiras and things like that like I
try to go to where the party is that has
my customers so I would sometimes it's
tough though because I hate kissing
people's ass I don't like people kissing
my ass it's a weird thing but oo has a
lot of SE Ira entrepreneurs people that
are financially minded that I'm assuming
one day might want to buy house even
though honestly real estate sucks I'm
selling all of my real estate it's only
like one place but I'm selling it I'm
tired of this [ __ ] it's
annoying uh it's a tool shed what's that

[33:03]
annoying uh it's a tool shed what's that
it's a tool shed in your backyard it's
dude it's just like H there's like a
lizard in my house or something people
were complaining last night um but I
think oo you know there's people there
and I would also try to think I don't
know if your your your your savviness is
in the marketing or the sales or what
area but you can also look at what
they're doing in their marketing area
maybe think if there's some playbooks in
there for you to replicate that's a good
idea yeah oo.com I think they're now
called uh carry
money.com I think ESPN the oo stole that
domain name from him it's a shame did he
no I think that day.com
you ever seen uh was it Dodgeball of
course nobody makes
me exactly well thanks for coming Brian
oh thanks so much this is a big help all
right see you later byebye all right I
think you'll like the next one Matt
Hannon he has how long I doing this I
think I committed to 230 yeah if you got
to go you got to go all right I'll do

[34:01]
to go you got to go all right I'll do
one more
for minutes you're like all the money
you you paid me I did I did in bitco are
you an Alabama fan Chris corner I I did
my undergrad there so so yes where'd you
do your grad uh TCU oh nice yeah dude I
was at I I was at an RV park uh on my
honeymoon a few weeks
ago yo these place are expensive these
people are and I'm like so what did you
guys do like I literally just parked
like it's expensive parking like
everything is like real estate and it's
it was interesting business it's like
very low maintenance and if you have
desirable locations like kind of
interesting exactly 30% expense ratio
it's a great business is it really dude
Mr I guess I don't know Mr but I'm tired
of the software stuff should I sell
appsumo and then go open RV parks
absolutely you should sell it to me at
100% seller financing I'll take good

[35:01]
100% seller financing I'll take good
care of it
no% yeah yeah I need some operating
Capital working capital you need this
there you
go all right talk and you your
consulting stuff with giving the free
business advice afterwards yeah let's
bro down let's just brow out for a
little bit and then you can bring on
Matt Hannon and you know give them crazy
Market every it's so interesting in
business right like we all want like
this like crazy marketing tactic
like you're going to probably see it on
Twitter what I don't know what you saw
on Twitter but whatever you see but it's
like as much as that shit's interesting
like the the the most of the stuff
doesn't need to be sexy to work like
that's the that's the point like we you
know at appsumo we have we do a half a
million dollars a month in our ads and
Performance Marketing so ads and
affiliate we can probably instead of
doing new things literally double our
business or maybe at least 20 to 40%
growth just improving that yeah but all
the time we're talking about like we
should should do a new thing let's send
influencer boxes like it's fun let's

[36:01]
influencer boxes like it's fun let's
change our logo you know like but
actually the meat of it is probably just
doing more of what's working better I
know and a lot of times the stuff that
works best is the stuff that's not fun
so people are looking for distractions
to not do the UN fun thing say that one
more time because that was just so damn
good if that was the whole show like put
that in I want to put that in a box I
mean my my first business we grew on
cold calls that's it and I could I could
start that business over again today
with cold and it wasn't sexy you had to
put your pride aside but it
worked yeah sexy is what works right
like that's the that's the kind of
interesting part of this is like sexy is
what works but I think what's appealing
is the idea of like this the fun part
which it can be fun
too but not always you know very it
should be fun but it you know sexy is
just like do the thing that works over
and over and eventually just have pay
someone else to do it yeah or pay
software to go do it
yeah

[37:01]
yeah
amen amen
dude you religious do you believe I'm
Mormon yeah what's up guys how's it
going what's that
mean you're Mormon yeah dude awesome I
got four
kids here's the thing
ier what's that you're lowy Les man less
man so here's one thing I am low te
that's true story who told you I thought
my doctor with the hip of [ __ ] so here's
here's like a thing yesterday you know
they say good old Christian boy I'm like
what a great brand no one says that good
old Jewish
boy that'd be a good domain name I need
to buy that someone Christian boy yeah
dude you know that would just sell they
would sell polos and Like Water for
Grand for old ladies like you just bring
them water and you help them cross they
could sell anything it doesn't matter
what they sell dude why are the Mormons
competing so hard with the Jews Like
Mormons and Jews are the same we're

[38:00]
Mormons and Jews are the same we're
identical you and me but everyone loves
you oh well yeah the people love the
Mormons teach the Jews I need you to
teach the Jews how do we get such good
branding like you guys you guys have
like the best brand of
religion oh geez I don't well I mean do
you send 70,000 people out every year to
knock doors that helps that's a good
sales
team no no there you go you you mostly
hear us complaining I think that's where
you hear a lot of the like oh look at
Zuckerberg he's a billionaire you know
Sergey and Larry Google bli like you
don't have us like doing the good stuff
you guys are doing the good stuff so we
need to send out salespeople number one
pay 10% of all of your net income to the
church so religious Jews do that the
Orthodox will generally do that Sate
like they'll they'll give
that what what are you waiting for I
think also you guys aren't partying hard
right like no you guys aren't out of
control you know what I mean like the

[39:00]
control you know what I mean like the
whole like not drinking no drugs like
some of the stuff it's like that means
that you're making rational decisions
consistently Jews smoke a lot of weed
they're doing weed they're like oh dude
let's make a movie oh Seinfeld okay you
know this is a microcosm of what our
first two callers were like they they
come on and they already know the answer
you know the answer like all you have to
do is donate 10% of your income send out
70 70,000 kids a year and what was the
third one oh yeah not smoke as much weed
and you're good to go then we'll be even
and then you can surpass us because
you've got the media locked down we just
have Salt
Lake you got I mean Utah I swear and I
won't swear
to thank you is the best one of the best
if not underrated
State uh we're losing I think we lost
you went got the worst freaking place in
the world yeah the Jews why did the Jews
take Hawaii the Jews should have taken

[40:00]
take Hawaii the Jews should have taken
Hawaii it's so much a better place we're
like let's get this little tiny Speck AC
like around in a
desert you know like why could we take
Florida just give us Florida but the
Mormons you're like yo we're Mormons
you're not going to like us we really
like just being homogeneous and you have
an awesome state I'm jealous it is a
cool it is a cool state but hear me out
Brigham Young could have kept going and
he would have landed in San Francisco
that could have been ours had perfect
weather too San Francisco is trash you
guys could because we didn't keep going
it wouldn't be TR trash if we kept
going dude if the Mormons ran California
I would move
back I would just I would leave Tech I
would literally get in a wagon and I
would go
back that's amazing dude you guys would
run California so well everyone would be
happy everyone be friendly it'd be super
clean you guys like like I'm sure
homeless the homeless are the happiest
in Utah sure he Mitt Romney fixed the
Olympics we could fix

[41:02]
California I like I got a haircut in
Utah friendly there's pinball my buddy
my favorite story of Utah ever is my
buddy Adam Gilbert he's he never drinks
I love drinking and we go and we're
drinking wine and he never drinks and
he's like dude I not getting drunk I
love Mormon wine and I'm like I don't
know how you're not drunk D we drank a
bottle me and you we shared a bottle
because Mormon wine is all maxed out at
4%
Mormon wine that's an oxymoron if I I've
ever heard one but do you know that the
limits the alcohol levels of wine is he
Mormon or no my buddy M Adam yeah no no
he's a j okay okay he just drinks the
alcohol in Utah got it no no no we were
on a a GU trip we do a annual uh trip
together and that was one of our trips
to Zion okay that's where my dude that's
where my honeymoon was it was in Utah
you're you're basically a Believer
you're halfway there you know when
people talk I just read the Bible
all Old Testament too what's that Old

[42:00]
all Old Testament too what's that Old
Testament as well it's the picture Bible
so I don't know which story you guys
have so there's so many books man like I
know it's it's a lot of books but I my
buddy sent me the picture Bible by
Robert
Crum from Jesus or from whoever and it's
just a lot of stories man it's like
crazy stories you know really wild so
it's like all these religions have great
stories I know we've got the best though
you got the best you the
best oh man so I feel like we've helped
everyone well we got Matt here Matt's
got a question hey guys what's going on
is Matt Mormon I don't know no I'm
Christian Evangelical hey we're we're
Christian too we're Christian too there
you go there you go that's fair that's
fair I like God can I join me too
absolutely you're welcome and even Jesus
dude guy sounds like a good dude he's
just trying to do good things
they killed
him y I don't understand H so why did

[43:01]
him y I don't understand H so why did
they kill him like he sounds like he was
doing nice to everybody and he wasn't
causing no
trouble they were intimidated they
didn't believe him they thought he was
Blasphemous yeah he's bold he was too
bold for
him yeah it's crazy he humbled himself
as a king right I mean that's that's
pretty legit right
there I don't know man if he let him do
his
thing I know dude do you think he could
have stayed alive or he would have like
if he didn't deliver his
message oh anyways wild stuff and I I
love all the religions I think it's
super cool it is Matt Matt how can we
help you today and then I I've gotta
go yeah okay so here's here's the
problem I have so I'm a dentist and um
yeah so I have this website my dental
advocate.com and so basically it's like
a a remote second opinion so anybody
could can log in upload their x-rays

[44:02]
could can log in upload their x-rays
fill out a brief questionnaire and then
I could review it and then get it back
to them within 48 hours just for like 47
bucks so I think the need like there's
great value in it I mean you go to the
dentist now and I literally got a rot
Canal estimate my third one on Tuesday
did you really oh man what was
it uh so there's two there's a a
Consulting Fe like let me pull it up
I'll just show you the bills okay I was
just
like I I'm not as price sensitive
because I want my teeth fixed sure make
sure it doesn't have any my personal
information on it so I don't know any I
just gave them money so there's like
that's the bill for the consultation it
was just a consult this is through an
Endodontics yeah 515 and then the actual
root canal thing ofama [ __ ] they're
saying is
$1,698 okay not Insurance That's not

[45:00]
$1,698 okay not Insurance That's not
including Insurance that's just like
what they're claiming so how do you feel
about that are you in pain or or why did
you need
it I haven't been able to chew on the
left side of my mouth for two years oh
wow okay okay so there's an issue so
you're wanting relief yeah okay so
sometimes right sometimes people go to
the dentist and they'll be like you need
you need three crowns right and they'd
be like I just went to the dentist like
two years ago and my dentist didn't say
anything about that like I'm a skeptical
and you know even just like friends and
family right like I I'll interact with
them at a party and they'll be like hey
you know what are your what are your
thoughts about this you know this tooth
I I'm just unsure about it and so it
seemed like I was just always answering
questions which is cool you know but I
was like man if if if friends and family
have questions why not just make it
available to anybody so you know I
started the website it's my wife
yeah it's all good you can keep going

[46:00]
yeah it's all good you can keep going
Matt yeah so I started the website and
basically was getting like 30 to 40,000
page views per month um just doing like
SEO traffic writing product review
articles blog posts and actually doing
pretty well just from like a a revenue
standpoint like Amazon affiliate was
paying like two or three grand a month
just from like product reviews so it's
actually like outpacing
like well out pasting just like the
second opinion stuff but like Google's
pretty broken right now I think so just
with the the March core update it just
really smashed like a lot of small
Publishers and um any kind of big media
site or like big company can rank but
it's harder to rank now so my question
yeah what's the question because I got
some ideas I'm dude you have probably
the coolest business I've seen today
okay sweet okay today and like probably
months this is such a sick business pun
in good let's let's figure out how we

[47:02]
in good let's let's figure out how we
can like make it known to people so
anyway my question is so what are what
are some cheap ways to get in front of
potential customers or like how should I
pivot what should I do different or what
should I continue doing just to get the
word out you know I know I could spend
like money for Google can I time you out
for just a second and I don't just give
me a sec is that okay to interrupt yeah
go for it go for it how what's the of
the site what's the revenue from like
the sales versus the
ads yeah so so Revenue so I'm not
spending anything on on ads basically
it's I mean I mean from the affiliate
stuff yeah so from affiliate site like
the Amazon Affiliates it brings in like
two to three grand a month um the
conso the so basically I just have to
pay about you know one to 200 bucks a
month just for like hosting some
software no no no how much do your
consults make a month
the consults only like I'm only getting
like two to five consults a month and

[48:02]
like two to five consults a month and
that's basically
because like I'm not targeting so like
the people that are landing on the site
they're landing on the site for the
product reviews right so I I don't think
the intention right the intention is not
there but I think if I can get in front
of people who actually
need the service they go for it you know
so it's so I'm getting traffic but
they're for product reviews it's not for
like people searching for like an online
second opinion all right I got two ideas
not even two one this is so so [ __ ]
rad oh you guys this is so freaking
rad this is like dude honestly such so
so cool man I'm like I'm so
impressed cool what do you got what do
you got so here's my two suggestions
number one I actually think you maybe
have built a platform for other medical
professionals I think that's almost as
as what you've done like instead of
thinking yourself as like the dental

[49:00]
thinking yourself as like the dental
person youve created a platform where
other dentists are doctors or it's just
in verticals you can now replicate this
business you know think of abso I could
create software or I can create the
platform that promotes software right
both can work but like when I have the
platform I don't really care so I think
there's something interesting to think
about where like maybe even go abroad
like there's Dental there's like doctor
and then maybe one or two other other
ones that are big verticals now here's
the other idea that I think is just as
interesting I I think you are have
your free question I think I would kill
all of it okay and it's only thing you
do is it's $100 a year and you can have
unlimited questions to your dentist to
this virtual dentist I don't I wouldn't
give him free I can contact you for free
are you freaking
crazy so it's a hundred bucks a year and
to me I'm kind of like my brother's a
doctor that does Insurance audits so he
does what you do but for the hospitals
helps people and he helps the hospitals

[50:00]
helps people and he helps the hospitals
fight their bills down with insurance
companies yeah so you're kind of that
for a consumer side I've actually been
telling my brother he needs to kind of
basically do this model he's not
ambitious like like you are right I I
got the ambitious Gene he got the I
don't know what Gene he got he's a good
researcher he's a really good
researcher but I think there's something
interesting about how do you position
away where someone like Chris who's rich
really
rich right like would Chris drop so
Chris let me ask you would you drop a
$100 today to have unlimited consults
around your dental bills and exams yeah
if I've got especially because I have
four kids and a wife we go twice a year
each right that's a great Roi yeah so
Chris would hold on Chris how come you
wouldn't sign up or will you sign up
today for my dental advocate.com I would
if he could convince me that i' have a
positive Roi all right so Matt I think
that's probably the disconnect of people
like me and Chris are like okay
insurance covers some and then we're
dummies or we're just we think it's it's

[51:00]
dummies or we're just we think it's it's
reasonable so otherwise it's not worth
someone like Chris who has a ton of
money like super rich
like doesn't want to pay so I think it
may not be a problem but maybe the
review stuff is the opportunity and you
focus it more on that and then the
question stuff is free and it's just a
Leen thing to your email list like if
you're not making money on I think what
people Miss in business and if you
haven't gotten a copy of million-dollar
weekend recommend it it's Chris wrote it
actually I did received zero dollars
from I am not rich for million dollar
weekend only from send those checks but
I think what people get stuck on is they
get stuck on like well I have to sell
these this this Consulting but no one
wants to pay for it but they're doing
over this so you might want to think
well how do we focus everything on the
thing that's working right and reduce
the distractions on the other part but
maybe you can get these people to pay
but if they're not okay I would get rid
of it and then Focus everything on the
thing that is working and double down on
it okay
that sounds good Chris you take over I

[52:00]
that sounds good Chris you take over I
gotta go take care of my wife okay
thanks for coming man appreciate it Matt
dude keep send me emails I'd love to
hear how you're doing what a cool
business cool man yeah I'll send you an
email yeah Chris thanks for having me on
yeah thanks for
coming Matt I think it'd be interesting
if you reached out to dentists directly
and and use them for referrals so they
give out a quote maybe the customer has
a little heartburn and the dentist can
be like listen if you want a second
opinion check out this website right and
if Assuming he's an honest person it's
not going to harm him to refer him out
to someone else that's only going to
charge them $47 only for that person to
come back and now want the $2,000 root
canal right yeah that makes sense have
you tried have you tried going through
dentists at all or are you treating them
kind of like a competitor no I'm I'm
treating it I'm kind of like the
advocate for the customer right because
I think like I still want to hold
dentistry in good light um and so I
don't want it to be like a you know pit
the pit the customer against the dentist

[53:02]
the pit the customer against the dentist
right like I'm trying to I just want
what the truth right and I think if any
with anything right when you take your
car into the shop right like you don't
know what they're suggesting right so
like there's got to be a trust Factor um
but but but again it's kind of relative
so like what you're saying is like or or
just thinking about it right if you need
one filling for a hundred bucks it may
not be the thing but if you need like
three crowns two crowns or easily you
know it it's it's well worth it you know
so yeah um I think that my only concern
if I'm going to dentist would be
like they may they may get a little may
think it's a little fishy or um maybe
skeptical regarding it but yeah I you
know I I was even thinking because I I I
love how you keep talking about like out
scraper and you know getting emails like

[54:00]
scraper and you know getting emails like
if I could just get it in front of the
people that need it right like hand hand
it you know hand a card to like
everybody walking out of a dentist
office type of thing I just need to
figure out how to you know how to find
that opportunity yeah it's tough because
you've got great SEO but this is a very
times sensitive decision that people are
searching for they're not going to
Google it on their phone in the waiting
room it and most people are just going
to get the quote and then buy it right
then just by nature of how this
transaction goes I think one thing you
could do to get more buyin from both a
dentist and consumers is to put some
testimonials front and center on their
on the site emphasizing the ROI right
like I paid $47 to save 4,700 or
something like that first name last name
picture maybe even a video or two video
testimonials perform super super well in
the landing page put it as close to the
top as you can because that's the most
valuable real estate so people don't
have to scroll I'm not seeing I'm sure
you have some sort of testimonials on

[55:00]
you have some sort of testimonials on
here yeah I see you have a tab those
need to go front and center okay and
then I definitely recommend using
something like outs scraper to try to
form some Partnerships with dentist even
just friends that you have and just say
hey is this even relevant would this
even come up in your everyday everyday
work and get some feedback and then see
if you can get them to refer I'm G shoot
give them half of the half of the
revenue right right right yeah I was
even thinking like even partnering with
like a a dental insurance right because
then you could potentially save you know
for them too um so it could be a cool
angle as well but um yeah I appreciate I
appreciate those recommendations so yeah
absolutely well thanks for coming on
Matt cool man all right we'll see you
all right see
y Brandon hey Chris how's it going good
how are you man on the show good how are
you course good so we've got one more

[56:00]
you course good so we've got one more
after you um sa I think that's how you
pronounce them and let's we're running
short on time so I understand that you
you're looking for something to
supplement your income that you can take
on before having to quit your job
correct that's correct yeah I'm uh
looking to build something up and then
maybe potentially leave the current job
that I'm in what is your current job so
I work a rotating shift schedule I'm an
operator in an oil Refinery so um I've
been Blue Collar my whole life um trying
to look to possibly make a transition
from being the worker to being the
business owner um I understand basically
it comes down to two things you either
have to have a lot of cash or a lot of
Sweat Equity um I think I have a little
bit of both that I'm willing to put
forward before making that leap um but
I'm having a hard
time getting to um
getting to like know what I actually
want to do or is profitable for me yeah

[57:02]
want to do or is profitable for me yeah
I honestly I don't think you need a lot
of cash or a lot of Sweat Equity I think
you just need the right idea I'm I'm on
this like framework recently that I
can't get out of my head where a lot of
people call me and say hey I have this
idea would this work and I always kind
of push back and turn it on them and say
is that the right idea because almost
any idea would work the pet rock worked
the pet rock worked like stupid ideas
work really comes down to the
distribution so question number one is
this the idea that I should pick maybe
spend more time thinking about the idea
and less time thinking about how to
execute the idea and then the second the
second question is how can I distribute
this product or service AKA how can I
sell it um okay do you like Home
Services um home services are are okay
um I my I used to actually be a plumbers
helper my my uncle owned his own
Plumbing business and when I was like
1920 in college I was helping him before
I went on and did my own thing um but it

[58:02]
I went on and did my own thing um but it
seemed to me like the stress of running
your own business he was he was running
his own business and doing the work
himself and it seemed like it wasn't
worth it because it just it seemed like
the business just consumed him all the
time he I don't think he like he didn't
really trust anybody to delegate his
work to yeah um no he did all the
accounting himself stuff like that so it
was really really hard on him and then
throw a marriage with a kid in it you
know it's just it's just too much at one
time so I was kind of dabbling in that I
guess but you know back back out of it
so I wouldn't recommend that just
because of the licensing that it
requires I feel like there's dozens of
other Home Services that you could
tackle that are as promising if not more
promising that don't require all that
licensing and training um okay usually
when people ask me your question they
already are floating some ideas in their
mind two or three ideas so real quick
what what ideas do you already have that
you're leaning towards um so you know

[59:01]
you're leaning towards um so you know
what I was thinking about um possibly
buying a woodworking machine and making
like Signs out of my garage because I
feel like that's something that I can
do um on my own time give you know I
could say hey the sign will be ready in
two weeks give me two weeks and I'll you
know make signs just like um you know
you ever walk into an Airbnb and it says
like Nashville and wood like a burnt
American flag or something kind of but
these would be like more Engravings I
guess you know so or like doing like
Live Edge for people or coasters or
whatever for their bar bar enjoy I do um
I've done it done a little bit of
carpentry actually too with my other
Uncle he was actually a carpenter he did
like uh he h cabinets for people and did
like kitchen remodels and stuff like
that okay um he was he was pretty
successful but another story you know
did all the work himself all the
accounting didn't really delegate anyone
you know so okay I so I think I have an

[1:00:02]
you know so okay I so I think I have an
idea I think you should you should go on
Facebook Marketplace and buy the tools
to do this right don't buy them new buy
them used try to get them at a discount
try to get them at a price to where you
could resell it the next day or the next
year because these things don't
depreciate that much for the same if not
more right because that at that point
you're you're dr- risked also buy um a
simple tripod I do you have an iPhone
iume I do yeah okay good buy a tripod
use your iPhone and just do me a favor
and film everything you do you might
never put it on YouTube or Instagram but
just having the content will be
incredibly valuable because that's how
you can take a business from you know
$330,000 a year to $3 million a year by
Distributing that content like okay I
forget the name Blacktail Studios um but
if you enjoy Woodworking and that's an
idea you already have it means you're
excited about it and I can give you an
idea but the chances of you latching
onto it immediately are very slim so I I

[1:01:00]
onto it immediately are very slim so I I
always lean towards your ideas right
whoever I'm talking to that's not like a
new idea which is that's a good thing
that's why I love it um right you can
sell them on you can sell them on
Facebook Marketplace in Facebook groups
local Facebook groups you can sell them
on it Etsy eBay Shopify I would just buy
a machine used make five or 10 things
experiment with it start posting it on
your personal social medias like just
not selling but just which do you like
best what do you think would sell best
what would you pay for this just getting
feedback and then these people in the
process of giving you feedback they're
going to want to support you and they
might become your buyers as well and
then you're not going to make a
full-time living off of selling to your
friends and family on Facebook and
Instagram but you're going to get really
really valuable feedback that will help
you scale this and you're also going to
learn without any risk because you're
going to be able to resell these if you
don't like it or if it doesn't work
you're going to be able to learn do you
like this because a lot of times when we
convert a hobby to a business we stop
liking it yeah that's something that

[1:02:02]
liking it yeah that's something that
most people don't see coming but it just
changes the whole dynamic it doesn't
always but sometimes it does so okay try
all right well yeah I appreciate the
feedback I think that I think it's
something that could work and just you
know it's a I feel like it's a low
barrier to entry type thing
um my original plan too was making
things for my friends for free honestly
and just saying hey man here's a
business card if someone if you have
people over whatever can you please just
absolutely I mean it's free marketing
hanging on the wall right right right I
mean shoot that's another idea you just
gave me is um start dming Airbnb owners
now you have to be careful I would
create a new Airbnb account because
Airbnb will ban your personal account if
you DM too many people ask me how I know
or don't ask me how I know well I mean
it's smart though why would you not do
that why would you not do that you know
and these short-term rental owners are
also they also congregate a lot on
Reddit and Facebook so go find those

[1:03:00]
Reddit and Facebook so go find those
groups offer to send them to people uh
for free um just for home decor with
some sort of like a QR code in the
corner directed to you right or to your
website and um it's just it's it's free
decor for them and it's free marketing
for you sure thanks for the information
Chris I really do appreciate it I know
you're short on time but that
information was super invaluable yeah
just promise me you'll follow up I will
maybe I'll send you a sign I would love
it all right man thanks Brandon all
right bye bye see
you all right well that is it for
episode 12 of the ker office thank you
to Noah Kagan for joining he just wrote
a book called million dooll weekend
which is really really good I read it
myself and it's a book that I wish I
would have written because it's more of
a guide than just a a novel or even a
non-fiction book it's a really good book
it teaches you how to start a business
