[00:00]
nothing all right well Brandon let's
hear from you you are the first speaker
in Ker's corner and this will be one of
one or one of many and it all depends on
you
Brandon sweet no pressure uh well I
appreciate it so um I am six months into
having bought a struggling street
sweeping business okay with my buddy and
we're in um we're in like Ventura
California so I just kind of was made
aware of of the issues of wildfires and
how many communities don't do street
sweeping so um nobody really advertises
that and I was
wondering how I
can I guess my plan is to
create awareness around the issue
already there and then
Supply the the means to fix it so if you
had any advice with that or or what to
do yeah so in other words you want to
invent the disease and sell the Cure

[01:01]
invent the disease and sell the Cure
because people don't know that this is a
disease
right yeah exactly all right you bought
the company six months ago you said
struggling it's struggling now or it was
struggling when you bought
it it was it was basically just an asset
sale with um maybe five or six customers
so uh it was struggling when we bought
it we just thought you know we could
always sell the assets for what we
bought it for and why not why not try
and turn it around okay um
um five or six customers who was your
customer is that M
municipality it was um some HOAs and
then the city or the county contract
that they had for the next like two
years um so we've added we've probably
doubled Revenue but um we're still like
in that growing phase but um yeah the
plan is just to make more communities
aare aware of this and then Supply our

[02:02]
aare aware of this and then Supply our
street sweeping okay can you talk about
like what your lifetime value is like
what is like an average ticket price you
paid by month or how does that
work yeah so we do hourly work so it's
one you're breaking up I believe you're
you're breaking up
there can you hear me I I can now you
broke up for a sec oh sorry um so yeah
we do hourly 185 for just people who
call
in for the
day we just try and base it off that
pricing and then we have um we have
County contracts HOAs at a certain price
per month with like multiple sweeps okay
is it like a weekly thing or a monthly
thing uh every is different

[03:02]
thing uh every is different
most hello ml is that you yep that's me
awesome welcome yeah great so um can you
guys hear me am I good to go I can hear
you perfectly okay great Chris um yeah
first off I want to I want to thank you
for for doing this this is awesome I
know you got like 100 businesses that
you run so I do appreciate it um so I've
been following your stuff for a while
now um on Twitter and just reading your
newsletter and everything like that so
the situation that I'm in currently is I
don't have a business of my own I
currently do a sales job and I I'm a
contractor so I don't get paid a salary
or anything anything like that but I do
get paid um a pretty healthy commission
I want to start a business but I'm sort
of like in this like paralysis by
analysis thing where I just don't know
where to I don't know where to start I
don't know if I should buy you know buy
a business and just like you know take
an SBA loan out out and just like start

[04:00]
an SBA loan out out and just like start
something that's already there or if I
should if I should start something off
the ground and just see how it goes like
I'm kind of I'm kind of in that place
right now so I have some hard and soft
skills but it's just like figure out the
next move to make and like where to
focus because there's just so much
opportunity out there and it's a hard to
figure out like kind of where to point
my energy you know yeah yeah so good
news and bad news bad news is analysis
by paralysis is like you know the
biggest the biggest deterrent to
starting a business so that sucks good
news is what I've notice is people that
have that before they start a business
usually end up being above average
business owners because you're in the
details you're in the analytics you're
obsessing over the the the metrics and
so I think your future is Bright Now
what type of money do you have to put
into either buying or starting something
right now like what what amount of money
do you feel comfortable using to buy or
start

[05:01]
start
um I mean I I I don't know it's hard to
say really um I guess it would just
depend on on the opportunity itself but
I mean I would I would be comfortable
investing somewhere from like 10 to
50,000 okay and what what ideas do you
already have like what do you find
yourself thinking
about well you know the thing is right
now like for the last four years I've
been working remotely right and and the
thing is I like working remotely but
what I also like is like getting out
there and and connecting with people so
I think there's something there with
customer service with connecting with
people and like selling in person so
it's just trying to figure out
um what that is now business-wise I mean
I've tossed around the idea of like
buying a service business like a
potential cleaning business or um you
know a tree trimming business or

[06:00]
know a tree trimming business or
something like that but I have no
experience in that space so it's like
hard to hard to say if that's the right
direction to go in yeah and where do you
live right now I'm actually a Texan
myself you're in Dallas I know but I'm
in Houston okay and what type of sales
do you do and how many hours per week
are you working realistically I mean I
would say like it's I I probably work
like 15 to 20 hours a week and I do like
advertising sales so I do a lot of my
selling through email and like Zoom
calls and so um I I primarily work with
a lot of companies that are like in the
financial space so um yeah and you feel
comfortable selling even in person yeah
in person in person and uh you know
virtually as well like on the phone or
emails or Zoom calls stuff like that and
how would you say you rank compared to
your peers your your colleagues selling
the same
things um

[07:00]
things um
well I would say I would say I'm up
there I mean I have a natural ability to
like communicate effectively I feel like
so um I I think I'm in the upper tier
compared to my peers okay and is there
any like sector that you're already
leaning towards Like Home Services or I
guess you said tree trimming or or house
cleaning is there anything else outside
of Home Services that where you think
you could really leverage your sales
skills
um um I'm not sure um I mean I tried
getting a a cleaning business off the
ground like probably about six months
ago but like I what I found in Houston
is the Market's like super saturated and
so it's like this race to the bottom
with pricing and so like that was a big
struggle where I would quote people a
certain price and then they would just
be like okay I can just get this random
person to do it for like way less and so

[08:00]
person to do it for like way less and so
like I tried getting something up off
the ground myself but it just
didn't didn't pan out yeah so all right
I'm just trying to ask a bunch of
questions so I could like put my
thoughts together I feel like you
already have the two hardest boxes
checked and that's you have time 10 to
15 hours a week or 15 to 20 whatever you
said um thank you for being honest on
that most people don't actually work a
full 40 40 hour work week uh two have
cash 10 to 50 Grand like that's plenty
to start a business three you have one
of the hardest skills out there to gain
and that's sales like you you've already
done that so I tell my kids and I tell
everyone if you can sell you can do
anything and you should do anything you
should start something you should not
work for someone because that's one of
the hardest skills to learn and people
that are great at sales they they don't
appreciate that because it's it's in
their immediate orbit um if I were you I
would ignore house cleaning because I've
done that myself I had a house cleaning

[09:01]
done that myself I had a house cleaning
business it was called Halo Maids 2016 I
hated my life it was the worst um I
tweeted about this a couple months ago
but I don't like the house cleaning
business because it's not a binary
outcome model like it's yeah you show up
late you leave a hair like I don't know
if you saw that or not but there just so
many I see that one yeah yeah there's so
many ways you can mess up for like a $44
net profit like what and it's super
saturated like there's four five 10
people I could name off the top of my
head that are selling courses on house
cleaning services yeah so it's like so
saturated so I don't like it for all of
those reasons I don't like that it's low
ticket I would think of it this way you
have this super rare skill and that's
sales you're not afraid to do it in
person you live in like one of the most
thriving economies in the country
Houston Texas so I would stay exactly
where you are uh geographically I would
stay exactly where you are with regards
to your skills and I would find a more

[10:00]
to your skills and I would find a more
of a high ticket home service like
fencing foundation repair something
something where you could find a
subcontractor um to sub it out to and
just start pounding the pavement like
throw up a card website just do
something by the end of today that that
has you pop committed maybe it's a $10
domain name um just something to move
the ball forward and honestly if I were
you I would go buy a car website like a
a paid card account which is like 30 or
$50 a year make spend an hour or two
making a website and then you can copy
and paste websites so I would copy that
website five times and I would pick five
high ticket home services maybe even
Roofing and just literally make that
same website across five different home
services and then just jump in Facebook
groups and next door groups like tonight
and just start asking around like what
what are your pain points Point what
types of services are you unable to find

[11:02]
types of services are you unable to find
um and like that will lead you and you
don't even have to pick one of the five
until for a month two months three
months right like start going down all
the paths at once and just see where
they lead
you I don't like I don't like the idea
of buying a business um for the shoes
that you're in today because it's much
more symmetric of an outcome but you can
if you can learn with your own money and
your own skills and just kind of get
your feet wet risking almost nothing
then one two three years from now you're
going to feel a lot more comfortable and
confident to buy a business should you
want to or you might just say why would
I spend all this money for a business
when I know how to do all this stuff by
now yeah that makes sense and then and
then the idea then is just you know you
build it out um kind of get validation
through uh through the Facebook groups
and everything like that and then I mean
you're basically finding the job job and
then you basically contract that out to

[12:02]
then you basically contract that out to
a vendor that you find that you trust
that you've seen their work and then you
basically uh I guess split it up that
way yeah find the job first and then
find the
subcontractor okay perfect cool CHR
thanks man I appreciate it yeah for
sure all right uh we have Brandon back
all add in back in but if everyone if
you want to speak if you would just
comment on the um on here I can read
through the comments and we can get the
next people in after that so thanks
miral I'll add Brandon in and see if his
connection's a bit
better Brandon there you are hear me
yeah how's it going um sorry about that
I must have must have lost connection or
something um but I was saying yeah so we
have a street
yeah uh I just finished
uh go
ahead no go

[13:05]
ahead um yeah so I I was saying we have
a street sweeping business in California
um basically I I'm taking it over uh I
just finished a baseball career and
wanted to test this out so um yeah we
have HOAs uh commercial contractors
anyone building and then a bunch of just
commercial jobs parking lot sweeping Etc
um so it's either per sweep or per hour
and what is the average monthly ticket
price um I would say anywhere
from
probably 2,000 to 3,000 uh depending on
how big of a community it is or uh how
long it takes but um basically a a full
day it's
it's about a $1,500 to $2,000 day if

[14:03]
it's about a $1,500 to $2,000 day if
it's eight hours okay and you might do
one or two days a month for that
customer yeah correct um some some want
every week and some want uh twice
monthly it kind of depends for um the
county work how much they have in their
budget um but that's kind of where we're
meeting inspectors who are recommending
more uh so kind of requesting more fund
in order to do it and going back six
months if you could see the future would
you have still bought this
business oh I don't know um that's hard
to say so I have I would say it's
growing uh we haven't yet gotten to the
point where we're seeing that because
we're still investing into the business
um but I think there's I think it's a
really good opportunity uh pretty much
every local business around us that's a
sweeping business has been bought out by

[15:03]
sweeping business has been bought out by
Venture Capital um so that's our that's
our like main competition but most of
their clients come to us because they
aren't getting service prod so if you
have five to six customers what's your
what's your Tam like how many potential
customers could you get without buying
more trucks or really having to invest a
bunch into cap into Capital
expenditures um let's see I think each
truck can do if it's running full-time
can do about 25,000 in Revenue a month
um and we have we have two trucks
running one truck full-time one truck
that is probably 30 hours a week and
then we have two other trucks that we
can fill so four trucks
total yes and you're
Ventura yeah ventur so 100,000 people or

[16:00]
Ventura yeah ventur so 100,000 people or
so do you do you go outside of ventur at
all yeah we we'll travel wherever um
we're pretty much all of Ventura County
Los Angeles um parts of Santa Barbara
all those are so is it safe to say You'
got four trucks and you could do about
25 Grand Topline per truck today if
you're fully at
capacity yeah yeah possibly more if did
more night sweeps uh those just aren't
as profitable okay what does the sales
cycle look like how long does it take to
acquire an average customer and have you
acquired any since purchasing or you
just keeping what you what you
purchased uh yeah so we had those five
or six were probably the customers that
we bought the business with um we get I
would say five or six projects a month
um just from a contractor who has an
inspector coming in and needs to sweep

[17:00]
inspector coming in and needs to sweep
um and then we've probably added five or
six recurring uh sweeps to our
schedule um but yeah it's there we just
turned on ads probably two months ago
and we have uh almost doubled in Revenue
each month what type of
ads uh mostly just Google Google ads um
it just like we get calls we get um
links to our website for forms uh to
contact uh most of those and then but
there I mean there's sometimes we'll get
a contract for you know $30,000 a month
call in um and it's it's just a matter
of either lowest price that they're
bidding out or um how long the project
goes for okay are you are you listed on
Google my business
yes we are okay what is do you mind

[18:00]
yes we are okay what is do you mind
saying the name of your
business yeah it's cleaner streets.com
all right I'm just looking you up on
Google my business right now um do you
do you have any idea of
how uh like how much you're penetrating
your total Google ads budget for that
area uh no what is the how much could
you totally be spending um in that
geographical area on Google Maps I I
would learn that first and foremost if
you if you're telling me you doubled
your business using uh Google ads I said
Google Maps I me Google ad um like that
that feels like the answer to me right
like increase your ad spend yeah are
they converting
okay
yeah uh they converting pretty
good um so we're doing probably I think
it's like 2500 a month uh for ad spin

[19:03]
okay um but how many IED customers has
that brought
you
probably nine or 10 um some are one- Day
projects and then some are
recurring and then a lot are are people
calling in asking if their streets
getting swept so that they can move
their cars okay okay and what is your
most profitable type of customer like if
you could only lean into one type of
customer most recurring most profitable
lowest headache who would that
be uh probably construction the issue is
those are shorter
projects government like the city and
county ones are very good if they're
prevailing wage um those you just have a
lot more complaints and headaches um and

[20:00]
lot more complaints and headaches um and
they're usually bigger bids that
only you're breaking up you're breaking
up there Brandon the bids don't come up
very often you
said can you
hear uh yeah I can can you hear me yeah
sorry um yeah so the government projects
are every couple of years every third
year uh depending on the contract length
so those are there's fewer and far
between but definitely like the
commercial builds are the most
profitable
okay all right so let me just give you
my breakdown
um there's a there's an endless
trade-off between profitability and
recurring revenue and or the sales cycle
length and how long you keep a customer
so it sounds to me like you love your

[21:01]
so it sounds to me like you love your
construction comp uh customers because
they're more profitable the sales cycle
is probably uh shorter but it's not as
recurring right but it sounds like you
you still like those customers the most
the construction
customers yeah yeah correct so all right
if I were you I would start with your
Google my business profile you have one
five-star review which is great I would
try to get like 20 to 50 and that might
seem insurmountable having you know
being in B2B but even if you were to get
end consumers to leave you festar
reviews that would be amazing because
Google doesn't know people don't know
they don't care that it's not a
municipality leaving you a festar review
um that will help you get more organic
business uh I would remove the LLC from
your business name and Google my
business I assume that's something that
was that way when you bought the
business there's no need to put it in
there um and then I would really dig
deep on your Google ads like if you have

[22:02]
deep on your Google ads like if you have
a profitable Google ads campaign your
problem is already solved you just need
to optimize it and scale up your ad
spend like it's actually shocking how
many businesses don't for lack of a
better word qualify to really scale on
Google ads so if you have that that's
the Golden Goose so lean into that keep
doing that that's my first suggestion
second suggestion is you're an advantage
because you're in a defined geographical
area which means if if you're selling a
high ticket recurring Service as you are
then your potential customers are all
right there there's only so many
contractors or so many home builders or
developers in Ventura County um so I
would start with something like Apollo
and scrape everyone um you can use outc
scraper as well to if they're if they're
listed on Google Maps which most of them
will be and just build your master
database of customers and say all right
there are 300 people here that could be

[23:01]
there are 300 people here that could be
using my service and I only have three
of them and it it's probably going to
look something like that and then just
attack them every which way um if if
it's a higher ticket item and there's
only so many customers out there as
opposed to something like Landscaping
then you can really get personalized in
your Outreach um I mean you could find
these builders on venmo and send them
five bucks to get their attention you
could send them a custom loom video
spend five minutes send them a loom
video and talk about
how sweeping their streets will you know
add value to their lives or to their
projects um but at the end of the day
you want to test like five different
things because that's going to truly
tell you what which channel you want to
lean into I would start with Google ads
a lot of times the answer is right in
front of us and we don't even recognize
it maybe go to upwork find someone
that's an expert and pay him one or two
hundred bucks for an audit I much prefer

[24:02]
hundred bucks for an audit I much prefer
doing Google ads audits than hiring an
agency because a lot of times you know
8020 the 80% of the value they're going
to add is going to be in that audit and
then at that point you can just take it
over from there so you don't have to pay
them three grand a
month any thoughts on
that yeah no that all makes a ton of
sense and uh I I agree it I think we're
at the point where we're um
yeah trying to grow with very little
Management in place and so we're trying
to put like those systems in in place so
we can um provide like good service I
love it but um yeah the Google ads is is
yeah about two months in so we're gonna
continue hammering on that awesome well
I hope this helps and thank you for
calling in
Brandon yeah thank you all
right thanks Brandon I uh put out some
request request for people to speak um I

[25:00]
request request for people to speak um I
don't know if they've accepted or not oh
Joe has great Joe why don't you uh why
don't you go
next uh hey can you guys hear me okay
yep perfect yep perfect um well longtime
reader first time caller
um really enjoy the stuff you're doing
um when I was in college um I we were on
the same call with I think Brian srop
uhhuh and uh and we were gav I I ended
up starting a vending machine business
while in college awesome um over in uh
over in Provo at the Y um cool and so
that was really cool and then we uh
graduated we traveled abroad for a
little bit so I ended up uh giving the
uh kind kind of giving the range over to
uh to my cousin who was in accounting
really wanted to do some stuff so um
anyway so we're not we're not there
anymore we just moved to Austin um and
I'm wanting to do more like uh like of
an online business something I can kind

[26:00]
an online business something I can kind
of do more remote um because I've got a
lot of experience with like web
development things like that my um I
want to do more remote stuff so um so
that leads to the the business proposal
for the thing that I'm doing right now
which is um setting up websites for um
for small businesses so um to start off
I've kind of niched down to real estate
agents um I got a list of a bunch of
Agents from realor.com who don't have
websites so I can cold email them um
with with an offer to make a website to
them for I'm starting off like two grand
um but I I don't know if this is if it's
just totally unfounded I don't have a
ton of data that I'm going off of and so
I keep kind of getting this
like um I don't know like he heavy
doubts with it um or I don't know if
it'll if if if I can validate kind of
what I'm doing
as I'm going through or if I'm wasting

[27:00]
as I'm going through or if I'm wasting
my time in certain areas so I love kind
of like an audit of just where I could
be improving just the general business
process and what I shouldn't be worrying
about okay um so your general idea is to
make custom websites for real estate
agents that don't have a website right
yeah okay and is this still in the
ideation phase or do you have a customer
yet uh yeah still in the ideation phase
um I just sent out my first like cold
email um yesterday with a quick little
um you know hey we could make a I can
make a website for you and I attached a
uh a screenshot of what it would look
like with like their face their name and
um and the area that they cover with
their real estate to kind of see if that
would work so so just very early stages
have you thought of trying a different
approach and going after real estate
agents that already have a website that
might be unoptimized IED or just for
lack of a better word crappy and and

[28:02]
lack of a better word crappy and and
like pitching to them why their website
needs to be improved or should be
improved and what they could get from a
more optimized website because I don't
like the idea of finding realtors that
don't have websites because a there's a
good chance they don't have a website
because they are an inactive agent and
like you scrape their data and it's six
months or six years old or somewhere in
between and so they don't want a website
they don't even want to do anything with
real estate um I also don't like it
because it could be the opposite end of
the spectrum and you've got this small
town agent that just crushes it and I
don't need a website I do
just they're right you know and like
they could do much better if they had a
website but it's not your job to
convince them of that because you
probably won't right right and so I'm
thinking if you if you use built with to
let's say use built with to scrape all

[29:01]
let's say use built with to scrape all
of the websites that have a certain
WordPress plugin right like maybe you
know what idx
is um the the coding platform yeah idx
is is like the API for for Real Estate
right where it's like you link your MLS
to your website so you go to Stacy
realtor.com and you can you know you can
view houses not just her listings but
like it's it's just like an API that
pulls from the local MLS like Zilla does
oh that's awesome so I I imagine I
assume that WordPress has a plugin for
idx uh so therefore they have to there's
a million WordPress plugins if you find
that plug-in that supports idx and then
use built with to export the 100,000
plus websites that use that plugin then
you can infer that those WordPress
websites are realtor websites because
they're using the idx plugin so now you

[30:01]
they're using the idx plugin so now you
know that all of these people have
WordPress websites that are real estate
websites that are probably they probably
look really bad and or they probably
don't convert well or and or they're
probably outdated and so then you could
use those people and go find like what
was their website called like
grasshopper or carrot or something like
there's a half a dozen SAS platforms out
there that will basically make make uh
Real Estate websites that look really
really good um and you don't need to
reinvent the wheel you can still charge
$2,000 I know people that use card
templates and charge $2,000 and it takes
them 30 minutes to set up a site right
like you you don't have to make this
custom you could just piggyback off of
some overfunded Silicon Valley real
estate website startup I love that and
just yeah exactly and just say hey
and you don't even need to have a
customer first you could just point to

[31:01]
customer first you could just point to
other Real Estate websites that are
using that same platform and say hey
Stacy I see you're on WordPress good for
you for having a website because it's
surprising how many Realtors don't so
you're gonna kind of compliment them but
like did you know that a website that
has X Y and Z features results in 36%
more leads to real estate agents and it
doesn't cost any more than WordPress um
so it's like they want to know
immediately how can a better website
actually lead to more money in their
pocket right because you don't want to
you don't want to sell them oh your
website's ugly I'll make it look better
this will lead to more money in your
pocket um and you pointing to other
websites that are using that same
platform the implication is that these
are case studies these are your old
customers but no you're just showing
them examples right I love that yeah you
can pull stats off of the platform's
website like the 36% or whatever it is

[32:01]
website like the 36% or whatever it is
because I'm sure they have those stats
and just piggyback on those stats um you
can build your own website with that
platform even though you're not a
realtor and then you can go after people
that are already sold on having a
website they know it's important it a
website is one of those things where
it's been outdated forever you know it's
outdated and you know you need to fix it
you know you should fix it but you're
not going to until you get a cold email
you know like something has to be
impetus for you to do that and so you
could be that cold email you could still
charge what you want it doesn't have to
be custom you can you can copy and paste
all these websites literally like you do
on C on card and then swap out the city
and the
name sweet okay I love this this is a
fantastic I feel like this is the kind
of that last key in place to really make
this work I love this good yeah I think
uh I think this would work and honestly
you can you can text them as well um

[33:00]
you can you can text them as well um
there's the good and bad about selling
to Realtors I've done it my wife is one
uh the good is that you can get their
info super easily the bad is that
because of that everyone is pitching to
them non-stop um but there is more good
than bad because of all the people
you're going to cold call they are the
most likely to answer their phone um it
could be a
listing so that's what I would do okay
thank you I've got some good direction
here absolutely good luck all right
thanks Joe um Chris we have Matthew
Stewart next he's a mobile home park
owner he's looking for some advice there
Matthew you're up Hey Chris thanks for
having me on and Heath thanks for
allowing me to join here I uh we
purchased about six Parks over the last
two years um in north Alabama and
Tennessee uh three MH and three
RV and um I had a couple of specific
operational questions and and marketing
questions around the RV um parks in

[34:00]
questions around the RV um parks in
particular um one being you know we
struggle a lot in the winter months um
being in north Alabama it's it's not as
ideal as uh South Alabama for for winter
rving and um we see our income kind of
fluctuate pretty drastically you know in
the in the summer we're getting
$25,000 or more a month and then in the
winter it's down to 15,000 which really
eats into a lot of our fixed costs and
um uh obviously causes a lot of a lot of
stress and I'm I'm trying to figure out
ways to kind of even out our revenue and
Mark it to um people that that would be
interested in in in Winter rving um our
target market is is typically
contractors that are coming in the area
you know obviously Huntsville is growing
like crazy and and um we're over in
muscle shols but we do get a lot of that
bleed over and um and then also retired
folks um we have a lot of retired folks
that end up spending three to five years
um sometimes at our RV parks so I was

[35:01]
um sometimes at our RV parks so I was
just kind of wanted to pick your brain
on on what you've seen success in the
past at your Parks or uh if you have any
ideas for how we might be able to Target
those people okay so is your Revenue
fluctuating so you said you had MH and
RV parks is it fluctuating from the RVs
then because it's month-to month uh
correct yeah MH is is doing great okay
and are these Parks marketed as like
an amenity Rich short-term park or more
as like a long-term low amenity Park
they're more of an a longer term you
know we we've got laundry bath house dog
park you know kind of the basics um but
we don't have any like pools or pickle
ball cords or anything like that and do
you have how big are the parks on a pad
site basis each uh they're both about 50
pads um we just added a couple tiny
homes and those we've seen a lot of
success with those just running out
fully furnished utilities included
month-to month so I'm considering that
might that might be a good strategy you
know obviously it's Capital intensive

[36:00]
know obviously it's Capital intensive
but um I have a hunch that those will be
a lot easier to fill in the winter um
it's a little bit easier to live in a
tiny home than it is in RV in the winter
it's true so muscle shs and where's the
other one they're both uh right there
muscle shs and then we have another one
out in Hot Springs Arkansas but I'm I'm
kind of more focused on the muscle shs
ones right now because those are where
we've been struggling okay so they're
each about 50 pads both in muscle
are they both all RV or a mix of RV and
MH uh they're all RV okay um so your
revenue is dropping almost in half uh
just because people are going back for
their sou for the winter yeah you know a
lot of the contracts end around December
and so we see a huge drop off in
December and it doesn't really pick up
until March or April so um you know
there's like three months or sometimes
four months that um you know you know
they're they're pretty
stressful have you thought about

[37:01]
stressful have you thought about
marketing um your vacancies on a yearly
basis to account for that um I know up
north it's pretty common like instead of
$600 a month they'll charge eight grand
for a year knowing that for four months
at a time those pads are going to sit
empty yeah I mean I I really like that
idea I thought about kind of offering
some deals like you know sign up for a
six Monon kind of lease and you get the
seventh month free or something like
that um all the promotional stuff we've
done referrals and stuff doesn't seem to
have moved the needle at
all but uh you know I could explore that
yearly option for sure have you ever
talked to the customers that have left
for the winter and like
specifically asked them like why are you
leaving did you know you were leaving
when you got here is there something we
could have done better or you just are
just kind of assuming it's getting cold
so they're they're
leaving um so yes I've talked to a few

[38:01]
leaving um so yes I've talked to a few
of them um a lot of them that I've
talked to they're just they their job is
ending and they're moving on to
somewhere else and a lot of them have
said you know we'll probably come back
in the next couple of years um because
their their work will send them back but
um uh I think that we could definitely
do a better job of kind of having an
exit survey whether it's a phone call or
an email that we send to them allow them
to give us some feedback as to why they
might be leaving I don't think they're
going to other parks in the area I think
they're really just headed out of town
um yeah and I've had a couple people ask
you know should I basically store my
camper here for the winter so I don't
have to move
it and um you know what they'd be
looking to pay for that you know at
first I was against it because I thought
I could fill those sights um you know
but you know we're dropping from like
85% occupancy to like 50 um pretty
quickly so
um you know we definitely could have
some sort of storage component and you

[39:00]
some sort of storage component and you
know obviously there's no utility costs
involved with that in the winter months
do you have space to do that if they
were not on the pad sites like um not
really I mean we've there's a little bit
at one of our Parks um but we we've
tried to maximize the amount of pads
that we can we can put on these Parks um
all of our open space is um either on
gas lines or um tends to flood a little
bit so okay um what would you say the
percentage mix is between people that
leave that are like retirees more
full-time of of a tenant vers bluecar
workers that are there for a
job um you know we've we've managed to
keep most of most are all of our retired
folks they kind of like enjoy the
community we do community events and
stuff and they kind of have like a
little little click um that they tend to
stay together um it's it's pretty much
mostly the the contract
workers um and I know there's still work

[40:01]
workers um and I know there's still work
going on in the area we're just not
getting any of that yeah all right so
the the Surefire true way to really fix
an occupancy issue is to buy a unit and
it might be a tiny home it might be an
R&V uh we used to do this we bought a
park in a city with literally like 800
people in it and not like outside of a
big city it was it was out there it was
all by itself um kyowa Oklahoma to be
exact and the only way to fix occupancy
at that Park and I've never seen this
not work was to buy a eight to $15,000
trailer 25 to 35 feet usually 5 to 10
years old um so not a motor home just a
just a pull behind either gooseneck or
or otherwise um and then do a lease to
own and really Target it to towards
people that are going to live there for
6 months to six years at a time it takes

[41:00]
6 months to six years at a time it takes
some Capital obviously there's not
really a way around that you don't
really make money on the financing um
I'm sure you can we never tried to uh we
would just basically say you know your
lot rent is 250 and your payment is 250
so it's 500 a month and then uh
obviously if if you have to eat the
electric then it would be closer to 600
otherwise you would just it would be
direct build um I've never seen that not
work like if you were to go to Facebook
Marketplace and post an ad like I would
first go to Facebook Marketplace and see
what trailers in your area are costing
you could probably find one for 10 grand
and then kind of back of the envelope
what you know what that would look like
and then just take some pictures from
Google Images post an ad on Facebook
Marketplace and muscle schs and see how
many inquiries you get and th those are
your future tenants is that is that a
tenable idea 100%
I've been exploring that pretty pretty
uh heavily it's good to hear it from you

[42:01]
uh heavily it's good to hear it from you
who got a lot of experience here got of
a number of investors and you know
they're um I I need to kind of convince
them that this is the right the right
move and so it's definitely good to hear
from somebody with experience that this
is this is the way to go um and I found
a number of campers and Park Model um
trailers and um also just tiny homes
that I think I could probably keep our
our purchase cost from around5 to
$20,000 and have units and um you know
the rents what we're getting on those
like we're running a tiny home for 1100
a month right now um so it took one bed
one bath 400 squ foot tiny home um
so like I'm convinced that that's the
way to go it's definitely good to hear
you say that and then um another quick
question on on the MH stuff you know
obviously owning we we mostly own most
of our homes and I I want to transition
them to to tenant owned um and I'm
considering like giving away a lot of

[43:01]
considering like giving away a lot of
the homes and selling them for for dirt
cheap just to kind of turn like turn the
park into a tened own home park you know
our our basis in the Parks is such that
it would allow us to be operating a
10one home park at an AAP even if we
just gave away all the
homes and right now they're they're
running about a 10 cap or 11
cap and so and I just hate having a deal
with HVAC and flooring issues and just
running operating you know all the I
think we have 77 mobile homes now and
it's just a pain and it's expensive to
hire people and um so I wanted to know
have you ever done that before have you
seen success and kind of what are the
biggest risks you've seen with that
absolutely um I mean that was our
Playbook was we would convert all the
park owned homes the tenant owned homes
and we would usually just do it uh for
free um um and a lot of times in fact
most of the time their payment wouldn't
even change so if it were 700 a month

[44:02]
even change so if it were 700 a month
then it's like hey um FYI uh your lot
rent is 350 your payment is now 350 um
we're going to deed you over the home if
you want to move um then you have 90
days whatever you need um and we were
very clear like this means that the home
is now yours but it's now your
responsibility as well right and I would
say 20% of the people would just say ah
okay I'm out you know too hard but 80%
would say okay you know they don't skip
a beat they're not pissed they they get
it um and you have to do it right like
there are some states where you have to
be like a mortgage broker to do that
Texas and Oklahoma was was very
forgiving I don't I don't know what
Alabama's laws are but yeah I I would
definitely suggest doing that would you
um suggest even trying to get like three
to five grand out of these homes or just
is it cleaner it depends on the
condition

[45:00]
condition
um yeah I would unless they're just
completely
trash but yeah I think three to five
they're in good shape I mean they would
sell on Facebook Marketplace for 20 to
25 I'm sure oh then
absolutely I wouldn't give those away if
I were you okay and then um so the
reason I want to get some money is to
kind of build in sort of like a a
maintenance fund for our tenants to say
look you know obviously taking over the
home means that you know if the HVAC
goes out it's your issue like we're
willing to help you in the first year
that's a good idea just that's a really
good idea yeah I'd never thought of that
that's a great idea I like that a lot
yeah just kind of keeping that away for
a year and then after a year we can cash
it out or pay down debt with it whatever
but um okay yeah or maybe you could even
like you could give them an option to
pay an extra 50 a month for that like
fund and it's it's kind of like
insurance it's like if you're paying
into that and your AC goes out tomorrow
you you know we will proportionately use
funds to help fix that right yeah but if

[46:01]
funds to help fix that right yeah but if
you're not paying into that then you're
on your own okay that's a great idea
yeah I had thought of that I like that
okay well this has been helpful I don't
want to pick up too much more of your
time but um I really appreciate you
having me on and give me this advice
absolutely Matthew thank you Al righty
cool thanks Matthew all right Chris we
got David next he wants to start a
business that he can get his kids
involved with David you're up
hey Chris appreciate appreciate all your
Insight so um I'm actually looking for a
business for myself and my kids so uh I
heard you mention kids I heard you
mention that your wife's a realtor so we
have that kind of in common so just to
give you a little bit of an idea I think
the first speaker um had a little
similarity with my myself as well so I'm
in sales I'm in mortgage sales sales um
and we have a portfolio of long-term and

[47:01]
and we have a portfolio of long-term and
short-term rental properties that we
currently
own um it's fun however the I think
property values have have really like
shot up and we've just got like some
investment Capital that I'd like to
start looking into to explore like
different new business ventures um so uh
like I said we're in a smaller town uh
Nork Virginia
is not as big as Houston or any of the
other places that I've kind of heard so
far um and uh just just trying to get
your your Insight on like different
businesses that we can uh get into that
would like require minimal direct
involvement um and allow for like
operational management through like
hired
help so when you talk about the the
short-term ra business is that what you
do professionally or you own that real
estate
personally so I own the real estate
personally okay and then you you have a
job in in the mortgage industry yes okay

[48:02]
job in in the mortgage industry yes okay
and you because of the fact that home
values have gone up so much you're not
really looking to scale that business
right now you'd rather try something
else as
well so I'm very disciplined with what I
buy and and that I mean I guess that
could be a good and a bad thing right so
I think I've everything that I've bought
so far has been really good values and
I've uh double triple quadrupled and
sometimes even like 10 15 time like my
initial capital
investment however I everything that I'm
offering on right now I'm getting out
bid on so everyone's fighting for that
same type of property that I'm looking
for now so I'm just looking to get into
other like other businesses like you
know I'm uh I'm I'm heavily involved in
a lot of like um digital marketing
groups so like you know I believe in
like the one minute videos Google my
business and all that other stuff so
just trying to get some business ideas

[49:00]
just trying to get some business ideas
that could uh maybe take advantage of
some of the skills that I currently
already have and the knowledge that I
currently already have and just um you
know get virtual assistance to run local
service ads or Google ads to scale and
build or buy into a franchise I'm really
not sure man I'm just grasping for
straws at this point so what if you have
this idea to start a business with your
with family I assume that you already
have a couple ideas that are top of mind
you're you're kind of throwing around
Home Services what ideas have you guys
talked or thought about
already so you really caught my
attention on one tweet that I mean I
still can't get out of my head and and
that's where the whole 13-year-old son
comes into play too right um so that was
the bounce house business so I've
basically gone back and and read a bunch
of your tweets and I was like oh I
didn't even know this guy has a
newsletter so I think I I I don't know
what kind of businesses we can get into
I mean I've considered buying land and

[50:01]
I mean I've considered buying land and
putting warehouse space there because
you know we're we're part of a Soccer
Academy and you know I've had people
reach out to me saying they want to
build like batting cages and all this
other stuff I have contractors
constantly reaching out to me every
single day saying hey they need storage
so they want to buy a house with a bunch
of land so they can build all this
storage space so I'm just trying to
figure out how I can like you know solve
a need um but solve a need in a smaller
town because I don't have any intention
of leaving this town for the next 15
years um so I just need to put my money
to work and and and scale
into profitable businesses that don't
require a lot of involvement from me yep
okay so I'm getting some ideas so you're
a Norfolk I've got the map pulled up
here what I don't know if you want to
like blast out like where you live
exactly but I kind of want to get an
idea of how rural or Urban that you
are uh Norfolk Norfolk is I mean I live

[51:02]
are uh Norfolk Norfolk is I mean I live
in a town that has a very similar
population as
Northfolk okay okay
um how is land prohibitively expensive
there I don't think so I mean I've got
uh I've got a lot of resources to get
land too I mean there's Auction Land um
I mean I think zoning and uh you know
the use of the land and clearing of the
land may be my only challenges but
depending on what your business idea is
I'm sure I can find land okay so I I'm
biased obviously but that just you know
everyone's biased so I'm going to give
you ideas that I've had because these
are the ideas that I'm working with
every day uh and I see the Promise there
there's all kinds of things that I work
with that I don't tweet about because it
doesn't look promising and I would never
start it right but the 2100 square foot
metal building in my it's not
technically my backyard the property
behind me is amazing like I I had no

[52:04]
behind me is amazing like I I had no
idea how much demand there is for a for
metal like ugly simple kit metal
buildings that you can order on the
internet and have someone come install
that are between, 1500 and 5,000 square
feet there like there is no shortage of
ways that you can use these things so if
I were you I
would go find call
it one to five acres you don't need a
lot of space um of raw land make sure
it's zoned right um make sure that you
can put a metal building on it before
you buy it obviously and I would
literally buy one of those metal
buildings um like like I tweeted about
for that Sports Complex idea um you want
to get it extra well insulated you want
to put HVAC in there you want to put
Plumbing in there get a bathroom in
there and then you have a foundation
that you can do any number of things so

[53:02]
that you can do any number of things so
put it near the edge of your property to
where if you were to add more metal
buildings um there'd be plenty of space
to uh at that point you can do this so
you can subdivide it and rent out part
of it to pay the note on all of it um
you could rent out the entire thing uh
you can go buy five balance houses and
store them there before you even talk
about anything I was going to suggest
that if you're going to start a business
with your kids that you should start
some sort of a rental business um I mean
there's a lot of water in Norfolk like I
know a guy that does kayak rentals that
just crushes it uh he just absolutely
crushes it you could store those there
you could store bounce houses there you
could just rent it out um you could
start a home services business there you
could you could have classic car parking
there uh but if you have HVAC and a
bathroom and the zoning
and a cheap metal building uh I say
cheap it's cheap relative to you know

[54:01]
cheap it's cheap relative to you know
building any other type of building
there's a zillion things you can do with
it and that buys you a good year before
you really have to
decide okay what do you think of
that I mean I I think it's a great idea
um
so I think it was your Tweet you had an
indoor soccer you had a indoor soccer
field right okay
so how much are those buildings
typically and what it cost to put up so
I bought the land um as it was uh I I
bought the building in the land it was
already there but I believe it was like
I mean this was 2016 2017 when they put
it up I think it was like 60 Grand back
then um it's probably two or three times
that by now um but it's I mean it's
extremely affordable I I don't know what
prices are
lately but
okay okay no this is this is good I mean

[55:00]
okay okay no this is this is good I mean
this is definitely right up my alley I
think if I have enough land I can maybe
do some outdoor contractor parking as
well oh absolutely
yeah
okay okay so yeah of the kid-friendly
businesses I mean do you think that the
bounce house in in a small town like
this would possibly work or laser tag or
those little Orbee guns or what what are
you thinking would be a good business
for like a
13-year-old like highly motivated kid to
to start I think a good business like a
good rental business for kids is one um
with a broad enough name and a a broad
enough offering that you could really
hone in on any one of them so uh you
might cringe at this but there's a lot
of money in like um petting like petting
zoo like mobile petting zoo businesses
um I don't know if you want to raise
animals no no not at
all but I mean you could do you could do

[56:02]
all but I mean you could do you could do
the Bounce House idea you at the same
time as the laser tag idea as a kayak
rental like
just a rental Allin one allinone with
the the sole idea that we're not going
to do allinone forever we're going to
see where the demand is right but how
much does it cost to buy all this stuff
it's it's all fairly cheap
so yeah so I mean I did start a a mobile
um like Festival business and and that
worked out really well but now I've got
a trailer full of restaurant supplies
that I can't
sell yeah um that's that's just the
downside of it I I think that if you're
if you're starting to type of business
that we're talking about they're cheaper
assets than restaurant supplies um I
mean you can even rent out wedding
wreaths that's a good siiz business um
or just wedding chairs like there's if I

[57:02]
or just wedding chairs like there's if I
were more prepared I'd list off a dozen
things that you could rent out but
there's all kinds people only need for a
weekend so how do you manage to be in so
many businesses without having to put
yourself into all of this do you have a
bunch of Partnerships because I mean
ultimately I would like to get out of
what I'm doing I I don't like it I mean
I like it I really do like it but
it it ties me to Virginia right my my
goal is to be able to you know be able
to travel everywhere um be able to work
remotely and and just manage
businesses uh without having to you know
be ready for that you know that
Christmas Eve phone call that they're
asking about hey I want to I want to buy
this house and I need a I need a
mortgage that closes in 14 days yeah so
for something like that I mean I'm not
sure that this typee of business will
eventually get me out of this without
tying me to this

[58:01]
tying me to this
area well first of all any any business
is sellable right like you could sell it
if you needed to uh you could shut it
down if you needed to it doesn't sound
like you're you're trying to start a
billion dollar idea um I wouldn't get
hung up on that like I would just try to
start something that wets your appetite
helps you taste entrepreneurship a
little more than you already have get
your kids involved um and then whatever
skills you acquire along the way even if
you end up just moving to your dream
location and shutting it down you'll be
able to pick it back up um when you get
to your new
place
okay all right well I appreciate it
Chris and yeah thanks for thanks for all
the knowledge that you put out there
yeah thanks
David all right thanks David let's do
one more go ahead Chris yeah we got one
more here last one up is Tommy Tommy uh
go for for it and if anyone didn't get a
chance to go um we'll do this again next
week and we'll put you at the top of the

[59:00]
week and we'll put you at the top of the
list next week
so yeah hey Chris thanks for uh thanks
for doing this a longtime follower I'm
I'm mostly a Twitter lurker in the uh
real estate and you know small business
uh space of of Twitter but uh come come
from a family that's owned an auto
garage for since 1964 um in Alexandria
Virginia um you know grew up working on
cars with my dad and my uncles and my
grandpa and uh I went off to play
college sports got a corporate job and
so I've been in federal sales
for five and a almost five years now
four and a half years um did a small
stin coaching college ball after after
college but um two years ago just by
completely accidentally started a moving
business um so was just driving down the
highway one day driving out to my mom's
about two hours away and I just every 30
seconds I saw a U-Haul truck um so I
went out and I bought a 5 by8 trailer
that I figured I'd use it for hauling my
motorcycle around you know and then you
know to use well you know playing flag

[1:00:00]
know to use well you know playing flag
football the next weekend guy says I
gotta go pick up a U-Haul you know I'm
I'm getting my floors redone and so I
said yeah just use my trailer instead so
he puts his couch and his coffee table
on there while he's getting his house
remodled right um you know gave me 60
bucks for that and then he told a buddy
about it next week trailers rent it out
for a hundred bucks and so on and so
forth right so we we took that and and
this is just nights and weekends uh got
on next door and and on Facebook
Marketplace just messaging you know the
properties for rent properties for sale
you know somebody posts on next door
that they need help donating furniture
and all that stuff so um had a buddy who
was a strength trainer uh got laid off
during covid because all the gyms closed
and was at night school so he and I just
started picking up furniture for people
on nights and weekends now we own again
two hours later we've done about 275k in
Revenue we've got two trucks um I'm
still working full-time in in my
software sales job and kind of running
the business per se while he's running
the field so he drives the truck to
every job manages the cruise does all
the materials all that stuff so

[1:01:01]
the materials all that stuff so
essentially what I'm looking for and and
David by the way have a lot of interest
in the the Northfolk Virginia Beach
Hampton area we just did a trip down
there so David if you're still on shoot
me a DM let's connect I I was also
thinking that David could do a trailer
rental business put him in his metal
building yeah not that you want a
competitor literally the day before I
rented out to my buddy I I went and got
some spray paint and some stencils from
Lowe's and you know did Tommy's trailers
LLC and my personal phone number on it
you
know and so yeah just I think just again
every every other kid I went to high
school with half of them is a you know a
realtor or you know working in the
mortgage space and obviously where I
live is is very high growth area right
outside Washington DC so um I think my
family's name kind of carries a lot of
weight given that our auto garage
specializes in German Imports so we have
a lot of high ticket clientele but I
think
what my question is is you know we're
not making enough to I am I am the uh

[1:02:01]
not making enough to I am I am the uh
the bottleneck here right I'm doing all
the sales I'm doing all the
estimating um you know my partner is
great at the physical work and man the
field work but not the uh you know
answer the phone call and and customer
service and and giving out estimates in
front of customers type of guy right so
either you know we've got offers to buy
our our name from some of the other
local uh in town moving companies to uh
to kind of you know sell the name and
then kind of come on board as a contract
salesman um but I really see this as an
opportunity to be an add-on business for
our family's auto garage and then kind
of spin up other Home Service businesses
out of it almost forming like a holding
company to where we have we've got the
auto garage we've got the moving and
storage business you know maybe throw in
landscaping or home painting or you know
things like that as I kind of continue
to grow this you know year-over-year so
that's just kind of where I'm coming
from really curious your thoughts on on
kind of growing a service business and
kind of removing myself as as the
bottleneck or the face of the business

[1:03:01]
bottleneck or the face of the business
so that it really has an opportunity to
flourish if you were to only keep doing
what you're doing how much room is there
left to
grow in your
area what a ton I mean DC is just an
absolute monster of growth right now I'm
sitting outside of a senior living
facility that's getting built on top of
an old McDonald's right now um my
buddy's the the the broker realtor
that's helping lease all these units
right now so
we get we get calls like this every
single day to where we're trying to you
know we're getting a lot of office move
uh type type deals coming in now too so
again I'm the bottleneck because I'm I'm
not ready to quit my full-time job just
to you know replace that salary and and
go all in on this is not we're not there
yet you know I I have full faith that if
I did quit my day job I could I could
replace my salary in a couple months but
you know it's a it's a chicken or the
egg situation right married three kids
you don't want to lose that stability
right off the bat
oh how many trucks do you
have uh we own two trucks I'm trying to
sell the first smaller truck so we can

[1:04:01]
sell the first smaller truck so we can
go ahead and buy a second bigger
truck um and we are local only I don't
do any Interstate um again we the you
know Hampton Roads area down in
Northfolk area you know the other day
but that was a kind of a family friend
helping job and I don't prefer to go
long distance if we don't have to and do
you do any paid ads what type of
marketing are you doing
today oh 90% of what we're doing is
referral based um you know me and my
business partner both went to high
school here um we just know everybody um
I spend a little bit on Google and I
spend uh I spend money on NEX door
that's been great for us because that's
where we got started so we kind of have
our niche of being the local guys on
next door the go-to guys and then other
than that we have we we've got our logo
and everything up on one truck and and
on off days we drive that thing around
town and park it in uh hight traffic
areas like near the Target or down on
King Street where all the businesses are
are and where all the tourists are
coming through and things like that do
you have any data that shows that that's
working parking your truck in those

[1:05:00]
working parking your truck in those
areas yeah yeah we just got a call uh
this morning actually from a lady who
saw a truck parked uh near my buddy's
house uh in downtown Alexandria um
asking if we can come give her a quote
from March 18th how if you were to pair
this with your your family's auto
business how do you think you could
leverage that like what what is the
upsell what is the crossover
there yeah so um
I think it's just brand name like like
like name recognition right you know our
business has been here for 60 years
we're a stalwart right I mean we're we
are the go-to guys for your your German
you know import vehicles um it's a very
very high-end High ticket um auto garage
that has a a really really strong
reputation in a in a a fairly wealthy
area um so a lot of these customers are
re
you're breaking up Tommy I can't hear
you yeah Tommy dropped for me I don't

[1:06:01]
you yeah Tommy dropped for me I don't
know Tommy you
there maybe they have a family member
you know moving or something like that
but I hav used it okay does your does
the auto business keep a good record of
your your past customers because there a
good CRM there um not for my moving
business no it's completely no I know I
know I know it's separate but
oh yeah absolutely yeah everything they'
they've got it all automated a whole
automated CRM system there and I assume
your family would be okay like
leveraging that
relationship yeah absolutely like I've
I've gone so far as to like I said I've
got my uncle you know has Flyers out you
know on the uh on the front counter for
us and and we bring our truck there to
do all of our maintenance anyway so
again it's a hight trffic area where we
kind of use it as a billboard you know
once Okay so is it true that the Busy
season is just coming up it's like in to
hear in a month or two yeah absolutely
so December and January were awful um

[1:07:01]
so December and January were awful um
February has been great March is GNA
start looking really good April through
August is absolutely crazy okay all
right well all right I got my
prescription I'm gonna suggest something
that I don't normally do because it
gives me anxiety but tell me I think you
need to quit your job man like yeah you
have everything right now you've got it
all lined up you're about to get a
bigger truck you've got a whole CRM with
probably tens of thousands if not
definitely thousands of customers at
your family business that they would be
willing um to to to lend you it's
everyone that has a car has a need for
moving so although it's not like
landscaping and trees there is crossover
there right and if if you or someone in
your family were to start hitting the
phones uh on the car side of the
business and say Hey you know whatever
your last name is what's your last name
uh Kerman you know know the Kerman you
know the Kerman family how we do
business we do the same thing on our
moving side of our business we've been

[1:08:01]
moving side of our business we've been
open for a couple years we're looking to
really scale and expand um do you have
any moving needs or do you know of
anyone that does right like that is
super low hanging fruit furthermore
you're you're dabbling in Google ads you
could scale that also I had a call just
yesterday with a billboard salesman for
Clear Channel and I specifically asked
him this is just coincidental I said
what which of your clients can actually
say um your Billboards brought me more
business because Billboards you know
it's it's kind of like brand awareness
it's it's really hard to track it and he
said moving companies it's like when
they put a billboard in The Woodlands or
in Sugarland or College Station they
start getting calls from those areas and
they're able to track it like you could
throw up a couple Billboards and blow up
your business like I I hate suggesting
that people quit their jobs because
people always come come to me looking
for me to convince them to do that
forgetting the fact that I've never had
to do that I've always been a business

[1:09:01]
to do that I've always been a business
owner and the thought of having a
six-figure job having three kids to
support and then quitting it stresses me
out so I don't want other people to do
that but in your case like you're GNA
figure it out you're gonna you're GNA
find more business than you ever thought
was possible and so we could talk about
you know landscaping and other Home
Services but this could be a $10 million
business just moving locally
um I would just keep leaning into that
wrap your trucks get a third truck take
a little risk leverage up your your
Google ads Bend I have your website
pulled up optimize your website your g
website my sister threw that together
first last no it's fine it's better than
nothing it's better than nothing and um
I would just I would just go deeper on
that
yeah yeah that's uh that's a
conversation we've had I'm like I got a
couple of contracts I'm trying trying to
sell I think like August 30th is my my
hard cut off date for the uh for the
sales job right you don't want to leave
that Commission on the table before you

[1:10:01]
that Commission on the table before you
go all in so okay yeah that's kind of
what we're looking at right
now yeah but you got this man I mean
you're gonna be shocked like you're
gonna be mad that you didn't quit sooner
once you see the progress that you make
after you quit yeah yeah I've been on
the fence about it for about a year now
we're just we're at the point where
we're growing so fast that I'm I'm the
guy that's in the way because I'm I'm
trying to do two things at once so it's
either hire a sales guy or make this
make this my all-in thing you know well
and that was my that was going to be my
first suggestion before I heard how
promising this was and that was just
record all of your sales calls like
record everything you're doing like as
harsh as it sounds you're replaceable
right Nick sabin's replaceable you're
replaceable you can hire someone you
know even if you even if you absolutely
refuse to quit your job you could find
someone to do as good of a job as you uh
especially if you were able to keep your
finger over them and and keep good T
close tabs on them and not just let them
run wild
yeah cool well Chris that's all I had I

[1:11:00]
yeah cool well Chris that's all I had I
just wanted to uh just kind of get your
thoughts on on what avenue to take so
appreciate it yeah good absolutely good
luck well um thank you everyone I had
fun uh I hope you learned something and
uh I think we'll try this again next
week so we love to chat with you then
