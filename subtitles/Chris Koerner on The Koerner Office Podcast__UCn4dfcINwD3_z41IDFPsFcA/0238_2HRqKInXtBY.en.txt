welcome to the ker office today I had
Shannon back Shannon was on our July
19th and July 12th episodes and he was
so good that people beg for him to come
back so here he is Shannon's a lot like
me he started a zillion businesses he
flips High ticket items handbags watches
cars trucks worth of iPhones you name it
he started a lot of stuff and he has a
ton of experience so I wanted you guys
to learn from him some more so today
Shannon and I spoke about a bunch of
cool business ideas from digital detox
centers for kids and adults to kind of
like a ghost kitchen concept but not a
ghost kitchen you'll really like that
one and then we talked about integrating
AI in Boomer owned businesses and
charging a pretty penny for that so
enjoy this episode with Shannon and to
next week a week from today we will have
another episode of Shannon so come back
and listen to that one as well see you
[Music]
later I tell you another thing that is
happening at least in California I don't
know about in Texas but public school
districts around here just starting to
ban Smartphones at school they finally
like hey this is crazy czy so I really

[01:01]
like hey this is crazy czy so I really
think there's an interesting opportunity
in a digital detox retreat whether it's
yep virtual or you know they go for a
weekend and all these learn ways to
manage especially teenagers and kids
learning how to manage these devices
because you know a lot of parents they
just hand it here you go all the things
that you need on there like the safety
stuff and parental notifications and all
those kinds of
things I think it's a a really
interesting opportunity and I think that
the timeliness is hot I've been thinking
about this a lot lately coming up with
ways to do it you know is swinging back
swinging the other way so let's teach
these kids how to use this amazing tool
how to protect themselves what the dos
and don'ts are when to use it how to do
it it's a tool 2007 when the iPhone
first came out so you know over a decade
of time 17 years about but there's a
whole like my kids were a little older
so I was so lucky or fortunate that

[02:00]
so I was so lucky or fortunate that
they were already in high school by the
time that they started getting
smartphones but now I was just on a trip
with some family and you know one of my
wife's nephews he like eight years old
and he's got an iPhone
12 and just doing his thing you know and
so there's I I think that's an
interesting opportunity very easy to get
into you could use chat GPT to create
you a whole course a whole set of
curriculum and then you go through it
all learn it one of the ways I think
to get started too is to do things for
free is to offer your services for free
and I think you could do that with that
the digital detox it's like hey you know
our school is going off I created a
digital detox course here take it no
charge let me know your feedback and I'm
going to do a little webinar this
weekend or I'm going to be down at the
park and I'm going to talk through all
these things and see how it goes they
will tell you what works and what does
not right they'll teach you that's how
you can get started my brain is flooding

[03:00]
you can get started my brain is flooding
with ideas right now all right I'm going
to sit up in in my chair so I love this
idea it's very relevant because I have
four kids my oldest is 14 he just got
his first phone and we are very much in
the camp of like if you make it taboo
then they're just going to want to do
bad things I agree with you on that yep
and so it was like you have an iPhone at
14 it's locked down but you still have
access to certain things at a certain
age maybe 17 he'll get Instagram like he
has no social media cuz if he never uses
social media while is in our house then
who knows what he'll do when he leaves
right and so I don't want to get on the
soapbox about all that but I think it's
very interesting because they have
digital detox stuff for Millennials
that's been around for five years right
where it's like you pay $10,000 or
something crazy you go in the woods with
no phone and like you meditate in a cave
for a week turkey or something yes yeah
and then they have summer camps for kids
and a lot of those summer camps don't
allow phones and they're out in the
woods and kids have a fun time they do

[04:00]
woods and kids have a fun time they do
great but I don't know of anyone doing
this where it's like it could be a day
thing it could be a week thing like a
summer camp but it's not framed as a
summer camp it's framed as a digital
detox Camp right and I'm picturing it
like you've seen the show Scared
Straight yeah you ever seen that yeah I
love that yeah yeah yeah you could
probably take different angles at the
same camp where it's like on one hand
it's like a softer angle and it's like
here's the science behind it let's be
responsible
and on the other hand it's like a Scared
Straight where it's like watch this
video of these kids that all lost their
best friends in car accidents invite
these kids that have went about it the
wrong way or and then invite these
parents because you'd have multiple
sessions you'd have the kids session but
you have to have a parent session as
well and you then you have parents that
come up and say yeah you know I didn't
under I just handed my kid the phone and
and this because I would Hazard to Guess
that
most parents that are very busy and

[05:00]
most parents that are very busy and
they're not paying attention to what's
going on and the kids figure it out man
they get these apps to hide them
someplace and they go around and all all
these kids want to be on social media
but they don't understand the guard
rails that need to be in place and you
have to teach it in a way that respects
their intellect you can't talk down to
them they're smart young kid hey look
we're gonna I'm gonna teach you how
these things you can do with it as you
will but let me show you the the
repercussions and this is what you want
to save you know you want to protect
yourself and all that stuff I love that
concept do think it's very timely right
now for kids I talk to my kids about
this when they're driving it's like
here's how a cookie works or an
algorithm works if Instagram sees you
click on this cute girl then you refresh
the screen it's going to show you 10 of
those if it sees you click on a guy
fishing it's going to show you 10 of
those like it doesn't care what you look
like or what you look at it just wants
you to stay in the app forever right so
just know what's happening behind the
scenes like something like that would be
so valuable right very very and people
complain like oh my the x is just a Cess

[06:02]
complain like oh my the x is just a Cess
pool my feed is full of stuff it's like
well y let me show you how to fix that
you know here I don't want to see this I
don't want to see this post this post is
not relevant and it takes only a few
hours and all of a sudden oh wow I'm
seeing really valuable you know content
in my feed it so these kids don't
understand it and it's like okay and how
do you manage what's a reasonable amount
of time that you could spend on it and
this kind all those kinds of things I
think it's a I think parents would spend
a thousand bucks like that to have a
4our course down at the park I think
it's a home run big time and then the
kid comes home with like a basically
like a plan of action or a road map for
the next five years of their life right
like we recommend that age this they get
Instagram and age X they get Snapchat or
and it's like I don't want him to ever
have Snapchat and it's like he's gonna
get it at 18 they're going to get it
yeah they're going to yeah that's right
and you know it's the same thing that
mentality when your kids go away to
college they're going to experience

[07:00]
college they're going to experience
stuff that you probably don't want them
to so you got to start loosening the re
because I would rather have them
experiencing some of those things while
they're in high school still living in
my house so I could walk through that
and help them and be a resource for them
so but I love that the other thing I
really like is this we've see this more
and more out here in California where
you have people that want to start a
restaurant which I think is a horrific I
don't know anything about it but it
sounds like a horrific business but the
concept that I do like is and I have my
neighbor owns a couple of these is
licensing the name and the recipes of
another restaurant having a very small
almost like a ghost kitchen we just had
one in our my town they took over a
small it used to be I think a I don't
know a cheese steak shop or something
like that but now when you go there
there's all these restaurant logos on
the window and you walk in and there's
just a flat screen menu and you say what
restaurant do you want to order from and
you go okay I want this fried chicken

[08:01]
you go okay I want this fried chicken
place and I want their sandwich great or
I want this vegetarian boom boom boom
and the kitchen's right there and they
have all the ingredients and the recipes
from these local restaurants that are
well known they pay a licensing fee to
them so it's additional revenue for the
the bigger restaurant but your family
can go to this place and Order five
different things you can order it online
go and pick it up there there's no well
there's maybe there was a couple little
tables but I love this concept because
it's borrowed credibility which I'm I'm
talking on the business brain podcast on
Friday I'm talking about this concept of
borrowed credibility you instantly have
an audience that's searching for these
restaurants they've been around for a
long time maybe it's a national chain I
don't know if it's a national change if
they would license or not but certainly
Regional and you get this like look all
we want to sell is five of your best
items or whatever it is and we'll pay
you x x dollar per month and then you
have your ingredients that you can share
there CU ingredients are are the killer

[09:02]
there CU ingredients are are the killer
in those businesses right things that go
bad or you know stale or vegetables that
that don't last so you've spread your
risk across 10 different restaurants
that you are selling this stuff for I
love it and the one that we have here
locally to us is awesome you go in it's
like a big flat screen it's like I don't
know 20inch vertical thing and it's like
really nice nicely done and you can pick
and pick and like I want to cheat uh
it's called local kitchen this is ours
is there's a bunch of them yeah Local
Kitchen if I want a cheese a double
cheeseburger and french fries but my
wife wants grilled asparagus and oh
great and allows you to do it and pick
it up on the way home we order it online
and of course they do a massive door
Dash business right that people are
coming in and it's cool I think it's an
interesting concept it's different it's
like a ghost kitchen that you go to it
is yeah it's also kind of like a food
Hall but you just order everything from
one like at a food Hall you around that

[10:00]
one like at a food Hall you around that
one has a shorter line that one has a
longer line like I really want chicken
but the line's too long so I'll go over
here so it's not a food haul it's not a
ghost kitchen it's kind of in between
yeah it's most similar almost to
goldbelly you familiar with them no what
is that goldbelly.com is a website where
you can order like the most famous
iconic restaurant food in the world oh
that's cool like mail order to your so
like you know ribs from Alabama dish
pizza from GE oros and it's it's very
expensive cuz you're shipping this stuff
like a brisket is like $200 from
Franklin right but gold belly is like
$150 million company they do great I
learned about this on the flip side
because my neighbor who owns like three
food trucks and a couple of Standalone
restaurants and he licensed their
bestselling things to this Local Kitchen
and he's like yeah it's great because it
generates revenue for us that we
wouldn't otherwise have it's probably
the best Roi they have right do you know
what he pays I don't or do you know what

[11:01]
what he pays I don't or do you know what
he gets I don't know what he gets
interesting yeah I can find out you know
I'm sure every deal is negotiated
differently but I can't imagine it it's
got to work obviously there's uh you
know like I said the restaurants kind of
rotate I do notice that where you'll go
over there and like oh man they don't
have this anymore and I don't know if
they do that intentionally to keep it
fresh or you know they negotiate they do
a six-month trial and something changes
with a certain restaurant but that's
what I would do because the cost
structure I think is much better there's
only like three or four people in the
whole in this place and that yet they
make you know a hundred different you
know 10 restaurants their top 10 items
and then they okay great and then the
guy goes and does all that stuff it's
pretty it's fascinating they pick these
meals they want based on ingredients so
like we want to has to fit a profile
yeah it's a certain profile that says
this is how I would do it I don't know
if they do it I'm speculating but yeah
we want to do chicken but we have this

[12:00]
we want to do chicken but we have this
is the amount this is how we want to do
it we don't want to do this with the
chicken because we can do these five
other things with it or something some
produce or that kind of stuff it's cool
yeah all right if you are watching this
clip right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the Kerner office on any
podcast platform or you can go to TKO
pod.com also my newsletter will throw
that in there there are no ads It's
weekly it's different content than my
podcast and YouTube newsletter. chrisj
cerner.com You'll see the link and we'll
see you there are you familiar with Jack
Welch's management style have you heard
about that at all yeah a little bit yeah
a little bit yep so he basically at GE
like in the 80s and 90s when they had
their Hey Day Jack Welch was the CEO
their policy every year they would fire
the bottom 10% of all employ that based
on a performance review no matter what
and then they would promote the top 20%
and then the 70% in between just stayed

[13:01]
and then the 70% in between just stayed
I feel like that's what Costco does with
their products that's why you always see
new products at Costco because it's like
ah didn't make the cut you're out I
wonder if this restaurant does that and
if they don't they should where it's
like listen buddy we got to see 10 grand
out of you every month or you're out
there's no no reason yeah there's no
reason to do it and then like the top
10% it's like we're going to move you to
the top of the menu because people
clearly are looking for first thing yep
and and just think about all that
borrowed credibility you get when they
search for oh this place is like we have
a place here called The Hangout that has
unbelievable Fried Chicken well you're
searching for that place and in addition
to the results for their restaurant
ghost kitchen Place comes up there too
local kitchens we offer you know the
hangout Fried Chicken you know say oh
what do I want to do go eat at the
restaurant or just go walk in and like
take out that kind of counter if you
will it's kind of cool do they offer
brands that like don't have a a presence
or a name or is it only stuff that you
would have known heard of locally that
you would know but not nationally it's

[14:01]
you would know but not nationally it's
all typically local Regional I would say
restaurants yeah cuz a lot of ghost
kitchens just have a kelse pizza like
just some generic name that's not
actually a local brand so it doesn't do
like Applebees but it also doesn't have
generic names it's like locally known
Foods yeah yeah it's pretty much locally
stuff yeah yeah Regional interesting
it's cool yeah I think people sleep on
this
because online there's a lot of the AI
is crazy or whatever but I think the
opportunity to help small and medium
business owners with AI is unbelievable
I think that if you're a people person
and you're comfortable reaching out to
just start in your area if you walk into
these businesses and say hey you know
what and I would do it something for
free at first to get their attention
it's like how do you learn about AI just
go to the AI and have it teach you go go
to chat gp.com get a paid account and

[15:01]
to chat gp.com get a paid account and
just say how do I use you what are the
prompts it'll tell you it'll tell you
how to do it and yeah but something I
love is lots of these sites have OPP
tremendous opportunity these local
businesses to integrate AI into their
systems whether it's creating a chat
version of all their policies or their
knowledge base or their FAQs that's just
low very low hanging fruit you could do
that instantly within minutes and you
could give it to them for free to get
their attention on and on just keep
talking about it that all the ways that
they could do it and the data that can
be analyzed if you can do it I think I
can't remember if we talked about this
last show but I had a client that they
just wanted to find more customers that
fit this profile and I just took those
customers and uploaded them to the AI
and said find me 50 companies that meet
these same profile but tell me what the
profiles are first and then do it so if

[16:00]
profiles are first and then do it so if
you could show that to it's like hey if
you give me some data like if you only
if you're a service provider I don't
know residential and you only want
where's your sweet spot people's homes
that are over $2 million you can just
automate that with the AI so easy and we
always talk about boring businesses or
the silver tsunami all these older
people that own
businesses integrating this stuff
certainly makes their business more
valuable and the systems that you have
so when you're ready ready to sell you
can go oh yeah look we've got these AI
systems built in that are generating
these reports automating these systems
created this created that I think it's a
huge opportunity man huge yeah I want to
play out take one thing you said and add
to that and that was take their FAQs and
give it to them for free right like run
it through AI do it for free I think you
could also let's say you only attack
businesses that are listed on Google my
business profile that have over a 100
reviews there are there's already
software out there where you could

[17:01]
software out there where you could
export all those reviews just a couple
clicks for a dollar into a Google
spreadsheet like we were just talking
about
earlier and you could say you could
automate all of this where you upload a
list of businesses in Modesto California
that have over a 100 reviews you don't
care about the industry yeah upload it
to Chad GPT and say I want you to give
me the top five things that each
business can do to improve their
business and make it more profitable
solely based on the reviews yeah that's
huge then you take the output of that
when you scrape these you're scraping
their emails and their phone numbers as
well you cold email it to them and say
hey and you're very transparent about
the AI upfront like I used AI to do this
you're not trying to withhold anything
because I was just talking about this on
another podcast so I don't want to be
too repetitive but it's like AI will
always need someone to click the button
right I don't care how much it automates
there's got to be an operator so your
competitive Advantage is the AI like I
used AI to do this and I can use AI to

[18:01]
used AI to do this and I can use AI to
implement these five suggestions yeah
number two might be garbage I agree it
does need some fine tuning but I can
help you and that at least gets you gets
them on the phone when you close them AB
it's GNA be 2500 bucks a month yep
whatever one your contract they see that
you have credibility already credibility
is G giving them this up hey look here's
this information you know give it away
show them value first because they get
called all day long by people that want
their money before they give them any
value hey if you pay me I can get you X
but you're coming back and saying hey
look you don't have to pay me I'm giving
you why if you want X I'm here to help
and I'll explain it to you and this kind
of thing it's just a different approach
I just think it's local non-scalable
don't think about scaling right now just
go local and maybe you can only charge
who knows if you could charge 2500 bucks
maybe these smaller companies can only
pay you 500 bucks but you just have some
different L layers of things that you do
so they can ease their way into it say

[19:02]
so they can ease their way into it say
look it's $500 and I can produce this
this and this and if you want to
subscribe after that it's you know
whatever per month it's a huge
opportunity dude huge I agree we're back
to the pricing I was like how do you
first charge 2500 a month because that's
a big ask that's a lot of money and he's
like for what I was offering he was
doing like SEO or something or Facebook
ads he's like basically for the same
level of service I was offering other
companies were charging 900 a month and
I went in there and said I'll do it for
150 and it took me 20 hours to do that
so I was making like seven bucks an hour
but then the next person I said 250 the
next person I said 350 and really I just
started gumming up until I had my first
and he didn't get a no for like 12
people is that he's like it's a th bucks
a month like ah I don't know it's like
all right 900 it's like okay and like
that was his pricing strategy right
that's it test so you could do that same
strategy with anything yeah or free like
I'm not against free too like to get

[20:00]
I'm not against free too like to get
your to get your first testimonial I
think that's also smart oh yeah because
like for me this concept of borrowed
credibility like I had no testimonials
zero a few months ago and that was one
of the things like you really got to get
some testimonials so I just gave away
free calls you know hey can we jump on a
call and then we' talk and if we hit it
off good and and I felt like I had added
value I just asked him say hey if I can
I send you a link if you felt I added
value would you leave me a testimonial
for the call and boom boom boom boom
boom boom and so you you build that up
because you're giving first giving first
is huge one of the last things I'll
leave you with that I really like that
I've noticed more and more and more
there's a lot of energy that people that
want to be entrepreneurs they don't have
the nuts and bolts stuff that we've
generated over decades where you learn
how to file this paperwork and you get
this resale permit you get this business
license and you get your your employee
identification number and you do all
these if you're like a detailed oriented
person and maybe you're not the swashb

[21:00]
person and maybe you're not the swashb
buckling pirate sales guys you know that
want to come talk on a podcast but
you're super detailed this business in a
box that you could offer an entrepreneur
I think is a great confidence builder
for them where you just had all this
stuff here this is what you need and you
either create it and they can follow the
steps but I would argue that a lot of
these folks that are they're very smart
but you know how it is you get up on
this Government website and you're like
I don't know how to answer that question
am I cash or am I cruel I don't even
know what that is what is this and why
do I need to do it this way am I a
soulle proprietor am I LLC I just see it
more and more is that people that are
very intelligent and are taking action
on pushing them go go go but there's
they get tripped up with the small stuff
yeah so if you're like an accountant
background let's say or bookkeeper or
just a detail oriented person you could
create and you could use AI to help you
if you wanted but you could create this

[22:01]
if you wanted but you could create this
whole package this business in a box
like look I'm going to drop this right
in your lap and walk you through these
things so you can focus on the stuff
that you're excited about whether it's
you know Etsy or digital detox or I'm
building a restaurant or you're going to
start a you know whatever this is going
to be all with you all the way along and
I'll have all these instructions for you
and we'll meet whatever once a month and
go over it with you or I'll give you
access to me in slack and I'll answer
answer questions I think that's a a
really big
opportunity I agree I'm going to try to
level it up by the way that's what I'm
not pivoting but I've been going in that
direction on this podcast where we'll
start with a business idea maybe it's
like maybe we're saying up front this is
a stupid idea I know it is don't judge
me here it is and then you say all right
well what if you did this and then I
said okay I like that it's like a yes
and to a business idea like but I do and
then by the time you're done with it
it's like we have an amazing idea
absolutely right and it's all like

[23:00]
absolutely right and it's all like
there's no prep work it's improv and
it's like that's what's beautiful about
it is that it all happens in real time I
love that idea and I I think it's very
approachable other people that see it
happen this is how it happens dude so I
like that idea and I particularly like
framework of sell to one to sell to 10
so it's like people say in software it's
like build once sell a million times
that's why software is cool this is like
sell to one to sell to 100 and so
instead of selling to a entrepreneur and
I don't use that as a perjorative I use
it fact someone that wants to be an
entrepreneur you can sell it to him or
you can sell it and this was your idea
to a CPA or a bookkeeper or an
accountant and you could say hey you've
got 136 clients varying levels of
success one guy might own a $50 million
Lumberyard one guy might have a $50,000
Barber Shop Right Y and so you use your
best judgment but how easy of an upsell
is this this Shannon where every

[24:01]
is this this Shannon where every
February you mass email all these CPAs
or tax prep guys and you say hey you're
about to send a bunch of invoices you're
about to make 80% of your Revenue I have
this business in a box that is
customized for insert state name here
you got Texas Illinois you even do
Industries insert city name and insert
industry here and you're using chat GPT
to go look at all of the headaches that
people have on the like the Texas
website to file an LLC is swear it's
from 1988 like before the internet was
invented somehow I'm telling you this
website was launched before the internet
somehow I don't know how they did it
yeah yeah and so it takes all those
nuances and it could be like like an
outline a title page and it could be
like 10,000 words right yeah you could
have some loom loom videos in there
maybe that you walk through like hey do
this and do that if you're this if you
do this you do that it it could be an
incredible curriculum that you created
once you change some of the stuff up B B
on your state or whatever it is or the

[25:00]
on your state or whatever it is or the
industry you're trying to get into I
think it's it I think there's definitely
a need for it right there so there's
three things we talked about today not
quite done you're not done no no I'm not
you we got to price it so yeah you sell
it to them and and it's like hey you can
mark this up as much as you want I
recommend that you just tack it onto
their tax return Bill say hey all right
it's going to be 380 bucks but I have
this business in a box thing it's
specifically for the plumbing industry
here in Illinois it's an extra 100 bucks
what do you think so it's like I'm going
to sell it to you for $40 or 50 or 80 or
whatever you mark it up however you want
but I recommend that you attach it to
the tax return because it's an
afterthought it's like oh yeah okay yeah
roll it in there that'll really help
yeah what do you I love it I think it's
good I think that at the same time you
do that then you also have it and you're
pushing it out you know everywhere for
that people to buy it on their own so
you're basically white labeling to these
other accountant book other
administrative type people um you've

[26:01]
administrative type people um you've
created it one time and and created some
specialized parts of it but yeah I think
it's a great opportunity I think it's
huge yeah I'm excited about that one
yeah I I get excited about too I love
talking about these things and that what
I really enjoy with talking with you is
boiling it down to making it accessible
it's like yeah I don't have you know all
this cash to go buy a restaurant but we
talked about a guy that bought an old
cheese steak shop and moved some stuff
around added a few things and came up
with an interesting idea to build kind
of a quasi ghost kitchen for regional or
the detox thing where you could do it in
the park that the cost is minimal to
build some curriculum you could even
include one of those what is that yonder
sleeve that they lock those phones in
the parents get that sleeve so when the
kids go to bed at night oh just stays in
the sleeve until the morning you know
there's just all these upsells that you
could do and and bifurcate into that and
the business in a box and then I same

[27:00]
the business in a box and then I same
thing is don't sleep on marketplaces
Etsy eBay is the greatest AB product
testing sell selling place in the world
and it's huge it's huge opportunity
surrounds us and if you keep that
positive framework and if you understand
starting small is the way it that is it
you're going to make mistakes and
mistakes are tuition you'll kill it man
that's how you get started and that's
excites me I love helping other people's
get going other people get going it's
killer I'm still hung up on this local
kitchen idea like I feel like there's so
many ways you could make money there
like you you could reverse engineer what
they do right you could go get their
contract and you could get the whole
system down and because like there's a
million guys out there that want to
start a restaurant so you somehow get in
their Facebook groups where it's like
people own a food truck or people that
want to start a and then you start like
whispering in their ears like all right
I know you want to start a barbecue
restaurant but for this price I can sell
you a template of starting a you can't

[28:00]
you a template of starting a you can't
call it Local Kitchen no starting a
local kitchen where yeah you you
basically go knock doors of some local
restaurants that have good reviews in
your area let's say you get four and
then your barbecue restaurant that no
one's ever heard of is number five that
way like you're taking 80% less risk for
the like you don't spend any more in
kitchen materials or any of that it's
more complexity it it is more complexity
yeah and you're using their credibility
they've spent years and their reputation
they've spent years developing so you
obviously have to convince them that you
can cook it that you can make it that
you have a decent chef and maybe you
have to say hey I'm we're making this
maybe you have to invite them over and
say hey can we cook you your top five
dishes so you could come taste them and
work out a deal where you could you know
it's a novel idea but it takes action
that's the key to getting started action
research and it probably won't wind up
the way you think it is but that taking
action and planning and getting that
stuff going that's the
yeah I love that you said it's a novel

[29:00]
yeah I love that you said it's a novel
idea cuz that just gave me a new
framework it's the best ideas are novel
ideas in that are working well in a
different market right because like I
don't like novel ideas in a vacuum I
don't want to start something new I
don't want to revent the wheel but this
is working in California yeah you could
do it anywhere you know and pop it up
and start small and see if it works find
it a place that already has the kitchen
and all that kind of stuff don't go
spend you know $100,000 building it out
or go borrow somebody borrow some time
in a kitchen I don't you know I don't
know I don't know anything about the
restaurant business but so it's awesome
