all right here's a real estate investing
secret that I'm using that I want you to

around that new store because a whole
economy pops up around them and I just
had my team assemble a list of the 20
newest locations that Bucky and has
announced from oldest to newest and then
at the end of this I'll tell you how you
can find these off-market Property

because I'm building RV parks around
