[00:00]

our first 14 tournaments of the Year our
spring and summer ones and we had over
400 teams sign up in 2
[Music]
minutes welcome to the ker office I am
stoked about today's episode I
interviewed Lance bird he is the owner
founder of rocker B Ranch which is a
massive baseball field out in the middle
of nowhere Texas about an hour east of
Fort Worth and he sells pizza he sells
gelato he has fishing he has a swimming
pool he has a 15,000 foot horse Arena he
has everything but it's really four
baseball fields for youth traveling
baseball teams here in Texas and really
all over the country I was just
fascinated about everything and I think
this is basically the bies of Youth
Baseball Fields and so I wanted to learn
all about it and I think you do too
that's why you're here that's why you're
listening so enjoy this episode of the
ker office my first question is what PR

[01:00]
ker office my first question is what PR
did this where did this come from I I
don't know it's a love for baseball our
family's love for baseball growing up I
had two brothers and we played baseball
just all the time my grandfather was a
big baseball player and would just take
us to the ballparks all the time and my
dad played baseball in college and uh My
Little Brother played baseball over at
wasall Baptist I played briefly I didn't
really play I practiced a lot but
briefly while I was at Baylor and we
just love the game of baseball and we
bought this property back in in 2005 and
none of this was there and it really
wasn't a plan to build a baseball
facility it was just a family ranch and
we just wanted to have a place to get
out there and get out in the country get
away from the city uh ride four-wheelers
mess around and over time um I I always
wanted to be in the horse business
actually and my grandfather the same
baseball guy used to always tell me
we're not getting horses that's the
horses business is a terrible business
but I wouldn't listen to him and when I
first bought the ranch we turned it into
a horse facility like the arena that's

[02:01]
a horse facility like the arena that's
there was a was a cutting horse Arena
and actually the the first baseball
field was a cutting horse outdoor round
pin and we did that for a little while I
realized my grandfather was right and
that I didn't want any part of the horse
business and so we tried to tell
you and we just it just sat there for a
little while those facilities and when
my son was about five we started we just
took that round pin and converted it we
were just let's just turn it into a
little whiffle ball field be fun just a
place to play B mess around so we did
that and then we turfed it put a grass
down not Turf but natural grass and I
was talking with the grounds keep Keeper
at Colonial Country Club here in Fort
Worth and he goes I said could you come
out and just look at my grass and see if
you could help us make it a little nicer
and he's yeah sure so he came out there
and he just loved it he thought the
place was so cool he goes I'll help you
make this really cool if you'll just pay
me on the side I did and he taught us
how to cut the grass with a real Mower
and how to properly fertilize it and
before you know it this little whiffle

[03:00]
before you know it this little whiffle
ball field was just this kind of Premium
baseball it was just it was just very
nice and grass was nice and we started
just having my my son was playing Little
League baseball at the time and we
started just having his team out and a
couple other teams came out and we
played a little tournament and it was
the kids just had a ball and everybody
loved just getting out of the city and
getting out there and relaxing after
that it just we started having a couple
little small tournaments on that one
field more and more people kept wanting
to come and so we eventually built a
second field and and it just kept
growing from that it's been a project
that's like I said I bought the place in
2005 and here we are in 2024 and now we
have four fields and thousands of people
are coming from all over the country and
it's just crazy it just it was never
really intended to be a business it just
happened it just we just kept meeting
demand as it came at us it's funny how
the best businesses often start that way
right like you just started out of a
passion and it it turned into what now
is I assume an awesome business I I want

[04:00]
is I assume an awesome business I I want
to get a handle on the timeline so you
bought it in 2005 when did you say we're
done with the horse stuff let's put a
whiffle ball field in here I'd say we
started about that about 2009 and then
okay in uh 2000 around 2010 we started
adding some hotel rooms we didn't have
any you know hotel rooms out there but
it's kind it's an hour from Fort Worth
but still people typically stay out
there there's a lot of places a lot of
people have houses out there at Pome
Kingdom Lake and ranches out there and
there's some hotels and neighboring
cities but we started building some
lodging and and that wasn't and we just
we just incrementally just keep build
adding facilities as we go as we have
the funds to do it
yeah so you started with the one field
in 09 did you add the hotel rooms next
or a second field next we built 10 hotel
rooms in 2010 we built our first little
kind of Lodge and then we had four
little cabins there so we had know 10
rooms and four cabins

[05:00]
rooms and four cabins
and then we built a second field and
then it was about a few years later
maybe 2015 16 17 something like that we
we built another 12 rooms and then we
built a third field which is a high
about about the time my son kept
graduating up to the bigger fields we
added a high school field because our
our first two Fields were youth Fields
the first one's okay 200 down the line
225 to Center the second one's about 250
and then now the third one is is 400 to
Center and 315 down the Lin High School
field and then now we just have built a
fourth field that's uh kind of in
between the The Big Field and the M it's
more for 13 14 year olds like
275 and are you adding these additional
Fields out of demand this fourth we did
it was a mistake actually it was we
getting out in front of myself but we we
decided to expand here this last year
about a year ago and we increased our
hotel rooms to 50 rooms we we took back
over the food and beverage service we
had farmed that out before but we took

[06:00]
had farmed that out before but we took
it back in and we had to we so many
people were starting to come we just we
had a lot of needs our swimming pool was
we built this little swimming pool out
there several years ago but it was just
a residential kind of swimming pool it
wasn't intended to to have that many
people when all these folks started
coming we'd look up and there'd be 300
350 people in this little residential
swimming over and then they get out and
it's almost empty right all the water
displacement it's hot summertime they're
kids it's hot you're out in the middle
of a ranch in Texas and it's important
the pool was important so that kind of
really drove some of this expansion was
to to to build a bigger pool we built a
kind of an outdoor covered Pavilion that
just provides shade because it's hot
when the just place for everyone to get
out of the Sun and then we built a a big
large resort style pool it's 115,000
gallons and little whole wow 400 people
there's Cabanas around it and we're
still rolling that out we don't have it
all up and running just yet the pool's

[07:00]
all up and running just yet the pool's
open but we're just finishing the
Cabanas and we've we built a whole new
kitchen to be able to provide the food
service and and re re redid the bar
remodeled the inside provided more
seating and created this kitchen that
allowed us to be able to you know
provide the food for all the people that
are there we're we're out in the country
so it's a ways from it's a little bit of
a once you're there it's it's 30 minutes
to drive into mineral wells to get
something to eat so you got a captive
audience we can that's a positive but at
the same time we have to provide we have
to be able to service that and we
weren't able to do it with our with our
kitchen before so we just had to do a a
big expansion and completely RIT our
kitchen hired a new staff got chefs on
on on full-time now and it's all coming
together really good but it's just been
a lot of there's a lot of moving parts
to it and it's taken it's been a lot to
get it all up and going I have to ask
what what happened to your insurance
cost when you added that pool did that
change significantly you know not it
didn't go up too bad because we had it
before the liability we've had a
liability policy on everything for a

[08:01]
liability policy on everything for a
while and that's not the killer it's
really the fire protection out there in
this area that's so expensive sidebar
but we we've had we had a lot of fires
out these big wildfires out there really
starting in about 2011 and for several
years we hosted an event at the ranch
called buckets and boots and it was a
fundraiser it was a concert uh
fundraiser for all the volunteer fire
departments and over the we did that
about five five years and donated about
a million dollars to all the little
local volunteer fire departments out
there but the fires are always a risk
there's lots of Cedars out there and
canyons and it's hard to get they're
hard to get to and when the wind starts
blowing out there it's just can be so
really the fire coverage on the
insurance has been the more expensive
what does your insurance run nowadays
which you talking about on the property
or the yeah just everything I don't have
the exact number it's a commercial
liability policy it's not ridiculous I'm
not exactly sure what it is but it's not
like a huge line item it's not too bad
no yeah but the property is more more
than the liability I know that yeah okay

[09:02]
than the liability I know that yeah okay
so back to 2010 you add 10 hotel rooms
that was right before Airbnb started how
are you marketing those out did you just
throw a website up or we've never really
done any marketing this has all just
happened just Word of Mouth we put a few
Facebook posts up and we've paid to push
the Facebook post a time or two although
really that the ones that do the best
are the ones we just put out there and
all the word of mouth and people are
sharing it we'll put up so last January
we put out kind of one Facebook post
couple weeks before we went live on
January 3rd and we just announced the
dates and put it out there a few little
pictures and with then then we went live
on January 3rd with our first 14
tournaments of the Year our spring and
summer ones and we had over 400 teams
sign up in two minutes it it jammed the
software that we use we use turning
machine for the signups it jammed

[10:00]
machine for the signups it jammed
software and then it it was supposed to
restrict to eight teams per division it
puts us at 24 teams and then we would
typically add a few more we can get to
28 or 29 but for some reason it didn't
cut off at eight teams and it let 35
teams in like 10 of the weekends which
we can't accommodate 35 teams with three
Fields there's just not enough time in
the day so we were up this is we're
looking up January the 6 we've got 30
something teams in in nine tournaments
what are we going to do I either got to
give everybody their money back and make
them mad at the same time or we had to
build another field so that's what
forced our hand here and we just in a in
a period of about 60 days built a new
field and it's we were thinking about
doing it anyway we had a pretty level
spot we had some materials out there
that left over that we could use so
we've built a fourth field it doesn't
have lights yet but it it we can use it
during the day time and it's it's

[11:00]
during the day time and it's it's
allowed us to be able to accommodate
this 30 34 to 35 teams that we have
pretty much every weekend from here on
out through through the end of July
until we sign up for a fall one so that
kind of accidental glitch accidentally
taught you how much more or potential
demand there was for your field ended up
being a good thing right yeah it's crazy
there's a lot of demand and
it's it really blows my mind when you
really think about that 400 teams signed
up in 2 minutes it's just it really just
blows my mind that that there's that
much demand and where I don't know if I
had to try to Market this to create that
kind of demand I don't even know where
I'd do it or how I would do it would
been fortunate that people enjoy coming
and and they talk about it and they tell
their friends and the kids love it and
it's that's a cool thing about what
we're doing out there it's we're trying
to create memories I want to create the
absolute best baseball facility in the
country and I want you know kids to love
coming there and parents to love coming
there we call it a tnic because there's
a tournament going on it's an excuse to

[12:01]
a tournament going on it's an excuse to
go there but it's a vacation and the the
parents have a great time the kids have
a great time all their grandparents and
Uncle Joe and everybody comes we we
started out doing these and we would
we'd have about 35 people per team would
would come to the ranch and we had a t
Okay so there's one team we have 35
people that number just continuing to
grow and now it's 65 to 70 people per
team because they just wow the there's
12 kids per team there's two coaches at
least one parent usually comes sometimes
twice but what to but what we're seeing
is both parents are coming all their
siblings are coming their siblings are
bringing a friend Grandma and Grandpa
are coming the uncles are coming
everybody they just they're bringing a
big crowd and we end up 65 70 75 people
per team out there and when you have 36
teams that's just that's a lot of people
they're all not all there necessarily at
the same time they're coming throughout
day they'll play their games but now

[13:01]
day they'll play their games but now
with the the improvements that we're
making with the bigger pool the Cabanas
it's a resort it's beautiful yeah and
plus I didn't really talk about this but
it's an absolutely beautiful setting I
wish I had I was out there and I could
turn to I'm excited to go check it out
yeah but at the base of the palino
county M the palino mountains and real
Scenic views Ridge lines and just looks
out towards the brazes river and it's
just there's a ton of History out there
it's where Charles good night and loving
started the their cattle drives for the
good night Trail and you know tons of
history with commanche Indians and just
all the Texas history out there it's
just a beautiful beautiful piece of
Texas and it's uh pretty Rural and not
developed like the city and you just get
out there and you're just your blood
pressure drops yeah the tension comes
out of your shoulders and you just enjoy
being out there I think that's I think
that's one of the reasons so many kids
and families like coming to our facility
it's relaxing it's not it's just
different than every other youth
baseball place that I've been to and and

[14:00]
baseball place that I've been to and and
I've been to a lot of them but but it
people seem to really enjoy it do you
think people are going out of their way
literally to to sign up for games on
your property because of the amenities
because of how nice it is obviously when
that many teams sign up that fast when
we first started doing it wouldn't like
that we would yeah we'd announce the
tournament dates and we'd get two or
three teams sign up and we'd start we'd
call everybody we knew and try to get
more teams to come and finally they'd
come but once more people started coming
and seeing it themselves and started
telling all their friends mouth to mouth
that that's really made it take off and
now we'll put a post out and there'll be
people make some comments about the post
that we're talking about the tournament
but then they just start sharing it and
they start put their coach's name on
there and there different people they
want then there's all these just kind of
shares and people talk about it on their
on their team pages and forward it put
their pictures out and it's just great
word or mouth advertising it's just the
absolute best kind of advertising you
could have yeah there's a built-in

[15:01]
could have yeah there's a built-in
virality to it because by nature of the
business by nature of the sport people
want their Grandma to come see they want
their coach to know about this facility
and so they they have to share it in
order to really use it right yeah you
can't you can't just book it in a vacuum
you've got to do it as a team so what do
the unit economics look like for teams
that come book what do you charge them
most of our tournaments there some of
them are three days and some of them are
4 days so our three-day tournaments are
$800 is $799 a team you you got 12 kids
per teams you divide that by 12 it's was
it 50 50 something bucks I'm not I gota
get my calculator something like that
but and then the four day ones are are
uh 1,200 for the extra the extra day and
um and you get more games and but that
relatively speaking when you look at
some of our competition the real
exclusive travel facilities across the
country they charge a lot more than that
and we're on the low end but I've been
pretty sensitive to just the econ
economy and we have a lot we have a lot

[16:01]
economy and we have a lot we have a lot
of teams that travel to our facility
they'll come we have teams come we'
probably had half a dozen teams come
from California last year and several
teams from Colorado New Mexico and a lot
of teams from South Texas Houston
galeston tons from West Texas abalene
Midland Odessa so there's a lot of
travel teams that come but a lot of them
are just local DFW teams and and some of
them there's some teams that just make
this their entire season they just come
out and play on the tournaments and it's
a large part of the tournament that they
play in so we I've tried to be sensitive
and just keep the prices down we went
through this expansion I didn't really
want to mess anything up so I even
though our prices and margins have gone
prices have gone up and our margins have
gone down we I I still just been
sensitive to raising the prices too much
and I've just really tried to keep it
affordable because we're in the we're in
the youth baseball business the kid
business the family you know business
and we're it's we're trying to build a
really exclusive facility and it can't
be as cheap as some of the local
tournament that you have it at city

[17:01]
tournament that you have it at city
parks and stuff because there's just
there just a lot of infrastructure
there's there's just more needs that we
have a lot of people we'll have 75 to
100 employees a weekend out
there and we just had to build a lot of
infrastructure we had to we're in an
unincorporated area and um there's no
City to provide water sewer and all that
kind of thing so we've had to we had to
become our own public water supply which
is a it's a lot how did you do that what
does that look like it it's it's all
regulated by the tcq Texas commission on
Environmental Quality which is
essentially the EPA so they they
regulate all that and there's just tons
of complicated code we we kind I I
didn't really know what I was going to
do when this kind of first became an
issue I wasn't even aware of such a
thing and we we had an AR system reverse
Osmos system out there where we've made
our water for years and I didn't realize

[18:01]
our water for years and I didn't realize
the need to become a public water
company until I I found out but once
you've had more than 25 people come to
your business more than 60 days a year
you automatically become a public water
supply and you have to meet these
standards and so I was really confused
what to do at first and uh we end up
hooking up with a an engineer out of
abalene hibs and Todd uh who's actually
Jordan hibs the guy that runs kid had
been out there and played several times
and he was with the place and he called
and said hey I'll help you figure this
out if you want I was like absolutely so
we contracted with them and they've
helped us get in compliance and we've
had to spend some money and add some new
tanks and new filters and do some things
a different way but but it's now we have
now we control our own destiny in that
regard we're not relying on City
municipality to provide us water we
wouldn't have been able to add the pool
and do some things based on the needs
you know on the water situation out
there but now we can control our own

[19:01]
there but now we can control our own
destiny and do that and along with that
sewer the sewer we had to build a
massive um Sewer Septic Service uh
facility down there you know on our
place that covers it all but it's just
it's just expensive it's more
infrastructure are you on city sewer or
do you have a septic system no we have
we're on a septic a very large septic
system that yeah was uh pretty elaborate
we just upgraded that in this last
little go around when we added the rooms
and the new stuff and we just upgraded
that septic deal and it's works it's
good but just a lot of they're just
unanticipated expenses that you weren't
when you first went into this yeah in
the RV business it's the same thing the
biggest problem we always face is what
to do with all the poop how do we get it
out right that's like the biggest thing
I I faced a lot of struggles in business
but I've never had to answer the
question of what do I do with water
where am I going to get my water from
it's unbelievable and plus when
this makes a big impact on our community

[20:02]
this makes a big impact on our community
out there on the county palpo county
only has 27,000 residents and we'll
bring about 60,000 people to our
facility this year you know so it's it
makes a big impact they they stay in all
the hotels and minw Wells and there's
tons of vrbos out at Pome Kingdom Lake
and other little hotels and all the
hotel occupancy taxes that are collected
there's two or three different Hotel oxy
TX authorities in the county the
employment we're one of the largest
employers in the county now we use lots
of high school lot of high school kids
and people that are just looking for
weekend jobs cuz most of our employment
demands on the weekends so it works out
good because those the kids can and they
they're hard workers and they need the
money and want the money and so they
they it's been a that's been a good
solution to our labor problem yeah so
let me ask you this if it weren't for
baseball let's say you only had a ranch
a traditional ranch what would your
Ranch look like today and what would it
look like if it were only baseball if
you didn't have have any hotels
supporting your baseball and if you

[21:01]
supporting your baseball and if you
didn't have any baseball supporting your
hotels I'm not sure the I don't know the
hotels make a big impact on the bottom
line because it that adds to it quite a
bit it would it' be a little bit of a
struggle to probably do it without the
hotel rooms the food and beverage makes
a big impact because they're just people
being there and buying buying food and
beverage all weekend makes a big
difference and but the the hotel
definitely contributes our deal there's
lots of little buckets we have a general
store we sell sell rocker B merchandise
out there and that's a bucket the the
kitchen and the food and beverages is a
bucket the the hotels and just all
together it works without it all gets
thinner as you start taking buckets away
yeah so if you're hosting a three or
four day tournament over a weekend can
you pretty much not guarantee but you're
pretty assured that those hotel rooms
are going to fill up for that time slot
what we do is so we'll announce our
tournaments on Jan January 3rd or we'll
do the we'll do the fall tournaments in
June 1st we announced the tournaments
they fill up on that day and then the

[22:02]
they fill up on that day and then the
next day we go we open up the lodging so
that before we would just open up the
same day and people would book a room
but then they wouldn't get in the
tournament didn't work so now we wait
till the next day your team's in that
tournament before you go booking the
lodging okay and there's a we have a you
have to book it for the whole tournament
there's a two night minimum or a three
night minimum during the Texas Title
four- day tournaments but then once they
book it we know they're coming and yeah
we know the teams are coming we know the
the hotel rooms are coming so we can
plan accordingly it'd be hard to do it
otherwise if you didn't you know have
that assurance that teams were coming
yeah that's one of the reason I noticed
one of your comment someone asked about
the cancellation policy and we once we
once once you've signed up and paid and
we don't do cancellations now if it
rains out we do we provide a credit it's
a transferable credit that you can come
to another tournament or you can sell
that credit or you can give it to a
friend or whatever but it's not like you
just don't get your money back but we
can't the baseball business is
tournament business you can't have teams

[23:01]
tournament business you can't have teams
just like dropping out before the
tournament because they want to go to a
different tournament or whatever re
you've got 100 people on the staff that
need to know that they're getting paid
that weekend yeah and that's that's like
why we can't give everybody's money back
on a rain out because it would just yeah
there's 75 people there that there's
bartenders there's lifeguards there's
umpires there's parking people there's
General Store attendants there's people
cooking the food people serving the food
bartenders it's a lot of people and they
have to get paid it's unfortunate when
it rains and we do everything possible
not to have rain outs first of all we
spent a lot of money really working on
our drainage so we get the water all off
the fields and away from the fields as
quickly as possible we have a great
staff of permanent and part-time people
that get out there and we tarp the one
field that has dirt on it and we just we
do everything possible to play ball cuz
people traveling from from across the
country don't you know they don't want

[24:00]
country don't you know they don't want
to credit they want to play and we we do
the best we can and gosh we've had just
an unbelievable amount of rain this this
spring it's you know it's very untypical
for the area but it's we've missed we've
had to cancel a few days but we had had
to we haven't had to cancel a whole
tournament we've gotten most of our
Friday nights in most of our Saturdays
in we've had to cancel sat Sunday I
think twice just because it just we got
12 inches of rain you just can't
yeah what what do the unit economics
look like of building a field if you
were to have to add a fifth field to Bor
what type of costs would you need to set
aside for that we build everything
ourself and that that's we save a lot of
money by doing that because we have we
have staff on site and we do a lot of it
ourselves don't pay a contractor to come
in and do everything but I think we
spent close to 300,000 on this last
field that we just built we had some
pipe left over from that we were able to
use that kind of cut some cost but it

[25:02]
use that kind of cut some cost but it
just depends on whether you put Turf
down or grass down there's a lot of how
much drainage you do what how much fan
structures there are this one was not
one of our Premier like couple of our
Fields have really nice structures and
this has covered uh seating and it's
nice but we didn't go too elaborate on
it so that that's about the price wow I
must be ignorant when it comes to
baseball I'm a wrestler I've got fond
memories of going to wrestling
tournaments all day but I would have
never guessed it would cost 300,000 to
add a baseball field what's the 8020 of
that like where's most of the cost going
you got a piece of land you gota you got
to build a fence around it when it's a
big it's a big area especially a high
school field then you got to put the INF
field you usually have your drainage
that has to go in to get the water away
and then there's all the expense of the
grass there's some Turf that we used
even when you use the turf you have to
put a bunch of road base down and the
lights are we didn't put lights on this

[26:01]
lights are we didn't put lights on this
field yet but lights add another
$100,000 to it but then you can play
play more games on it so it's it's hard
to make the make that work just on the
teams paying you $800 to come but it's
everyone staying and enjoying themselves
and taking advantage of all the stuff
that we offer out there that that kind
of allows it to work yeah so let's back
up I meant to ask this earlier 2005 you
buy the property
where were you at in your life in your
career you had young kids I think
everyone that lives in a city wants like
has that dream of having land outside of
the city right I assume that you were no
different you wanted somewhere to go on
the weekends what where were you at in
your career how were you able to afford
that was it were you already investing
in real estate at the time were you a
business owner at the time I'd love to
hear more background there my background
is oil and gas business and I I lived in
actually lived in Dallas in 2005 and we
had a company cero energy we were active

[27:00]
had a company cero energy we were active
in East Texas and North Louisiana we
drilled natural gas and oil wells and
that that's what was my primary business
and that's really what allowed me to do
this is taking cash flow from that
business and putting it into this new
one and I I have I'm not really active
in the oil and gas business much anymore
I still have some properties and stuff
that we manage but I'm not real active
in it but I've put more of my time
recently into real estate and really
real estate that I can improve things
like this I like the building process a
lot more than the operations process but
I like improving real estate I find it
it's fun for me it's creative
fortunately my brother I have little
brother Bart bird who played baseball in
college at wasw Baptist and he lives at
the ranch and he's the one that really
runs the operations my wife it's true
family business my wife here in Fort
Worth handles a lot of the business side
and they talk all the time and she
handles a lot of the inventory and a lot
of the corporate event marketing and
booking but Bart handles all of the

[28:00]
booking but Bart handles all of the
baseball and he's really good with all
the coaches and all the teams and the
kids and really the employees he he
recruits the employees that that work
out there his daughter goes to high
school there in Graford and has a lot of
friends there that so they're a key part
of the whole thing it it would be it'd
be pretty tough to pull this off without
Bart and it'd be impossible without my
wife she's the boss if wasn't for her
which really yeah and what does your
day-to-day look like then with regards
to the ranch specifically
I spent a lot of time just working we're
still rolling things out we're not up to
speed we're not running on all cylinders
yet we we just added a coffee shop which
is a it's really cool little shop and
it's got gelato and coffee and snow
cones and soft drinks and tea just
different things and we're still just
rolling that all out and we've had it
open now two weekends and just a lot of
there's a lot of moving parts to that
but we we added uh when we added the new
kitchen we added a Woodfired Pizza Oven

[29:01]
kitchen we added a Woodfired Pizza Oven
and so we just three weeks ago started
rolling the pizza out and we're not I
don't cut corners on the stuff out there
I I like to do it right and I we didn't
want to have a par-baked pizza that
Frozen crust that you stick onto a
conveyor belt and run it through in
three minutes we we wanted the real
product and so we when we hire it was
really we put together a great kitchen
staff we got just great group of guys
that are running our kitchen and they
look at this the same way I do and they
they want to do it right so we've we're
making our own pizza crust from scratch
with just flour and yeast and making the
dough and letting it proof and rise over
a two-day period we're three four 350
400 pizzas a weekend that we're just
making by hand and rolling the dough out
and and when it comes out it's cooked in
a woodf fired pizza oven when it comes
out it's good pizza it's not it's not
just something you pick up in a gas
station it's really good quality pizza
and that's that important for me to to

[30:00]
and that's that important for me to to
people are coming out there for like I
said for a vacation and they're coming
to a baseball tournament but they're
also come into a little Resort when they
and they their expectations are high
they they want good food they want good
a good bar good Beverages and mean so
you have to do it right and that's what
we're spending a lot of time on just
working out those Logistics and
providing a a a product that we're proud
of it it might sound silly but that
might be the craziest thing I've heard
you say so far just the quality of your
pizza cuz I'm a foodie I've got like a a
Woodfired Pizza Oven in my outdoor
kitchen we go our favorite pizza place
is Ken raso by the star in Frisco and
they import their double zero flour from
Italy and they've got a wood fired oven
in the shape of a Cowboys helmet and
they let it ferment for two days like
they're doing everything that you're
doing but if I go to a baseball
tournament in the middle of nowhere I'm
going to expect really bad pizza and I'm
going to be okay with that because
that's just what you get at a sports
tournament right so the fact that you're

[31:00]
tournament right so the fact that you're
breaking the mold with these tiny little
details is is honestly shocking to me
it's essential put forward a product
like that you have to learn how to do it
yourself so I'm like you I spent a lot
of time figuring out how to cook good
pizza and I was terrible at it I bought
a homemade before we rolled this whole
thing out I bought a pizza oven at my
house and I started doing I was on the
YouTube and watching these videos and I
I found this guy veto La aell I know oh
yeah I subscribed
he's very entertaining he's the best and
I bought his master class how to make
pizza and how to do it on a commercial
basis and all that and I watched all the
videos and I probably watched them 10
times because you know every time you
watch it you learn something else and
then when we got when we started taking
this now to we're going to try to do 400
of these a week it's one thing to do 10
of them your little recipe for 10 pizzas
but when you try to turn that into 400
it's it's a little tougher but Daniel
and our guys our staff out there they
all watched the videos and he's the same
way he watched it three or four times

[32:00]
way he watched it three or four times
and we just figured out how to do it and
after a little while it gets easier and
we got a big mixer now that you know
allows us to do a batch of about 150 at
a time but we most of our tournaments
are on the weekend start some of them
start on Thursday you have that Monday
Tuesday Wednesday and a lot of them
Thursday to kind of prep and that's what
we just make all our dough and do all
the thing the other thing that we're in
the coffee shop is our gelato and I'm
not just buying I'm not buying I'm a
gelato snob too I'm making it myself we
we went out same thing I just spent a
bunch of time on YouTube and different
researching it figuring out how to make
gelato I bought a little small gelato
machine from my house and started doing
it and getting a little better and a
little better and when we rolled this
out we bought a commercial batch freezer
now and actually during the week I
actually run out there and make gelato a
lot of time I was out there last week on
Tuesday wednes making gelato I haven't
turned that over to anybody yet I'm kind

[33:00]
turned that over to anybody yet I'm kind
of proud of my gelato that sounds
incredible what do you it really does
like I'm such a foodie I love gelato we
went to Italy as a family and I'm just
I'm a big fan of all these things and
Barbe also you were in Texas we got a tu
barbecue and so we've got we've got a
wood smoker there and we cook we prep
all our own barbecue and cook our our
own barbecue we've spent a lot of time
talking about what we want our
cheeseburger to look like and taste and
what kind of cheese cheeseburger we want
and that that's super important to me
the chicken strips what kind of chicken
strips we have and I did a lot of that
that I did a lot of research by just
talking to kids you know my my kid and
we just over the last few years we've
always run them by them and gotta have
good chicken strips at a baseball place
so if I expect to get a really good
pizza that Neapolitan style I'm G expect
to pay about 18 20 bucks what do you
guys charge for pizza out there it's a a
cheese is $19.99 and then you can add
toppings on top of that but yeah that

[34:02]
toppings on top of that but yeah that
where we are and it's a quality product
it's good and first we were maybe burn
getting a little too CR a little too
crisp a little too Char for the kids so
we had to it's only in there for 60
seconds right oh I know our oven so we
bought this oven from a it was from a Mr
gaddy's pizza place that had gone out of
business and it's just six foot by six
foot Dome oven that the floor spins and
it gets up to 750 degrees so yeah you
put a pizza in there it only takes you
know a minute and it's cooked and minute
and a half and it's burned you got of
keep an eye on it I'm getting hungry
so of all the things like you're selling
food you're selling tournaments you're
selling hotel rooms what has been like
the most unexpectedly profitable or the
most
unexpectedly unprofitable item that
you've sold or serviced what's really
surprised you our merch has surprised me
it's really just taken off we'll sell 4

[35:02]
it's really just taken off we'll sell 4
to 500 rocker B hats a weekend which
kind of just blows me away when we first
started doing I we were just like hey
let's let's have a little merch you know
let's have some T-shirts and some hats
and we were printing them ourselves we I
bought this little the kind where you
got the thing you're pushing it down and
pulling it up and a workout but we I'd
go back there this is three or four
years ago we'd go down there on the
weekends and I'd be down there just
working like crazy I'd print me1 15
t-shirts or whatever and bring them up
there and and then they call me in 30
minutes and say hey we need more shirts
what and then our hats we were ordering
the patches and and putting the patches
on our and we just couldn't keep up we
it was we were trying to do as much of
that as we could ourselves but it just
we're sell the the quantity I think one
weekend we sold almost 600 hats one
weekend and kids just it's become kids
wear them you see them wearing them all
over the place you see them all the time
at r Ranger games and people will send
me texts they'll be in Cabo and somebody

[36:01]
me texts they'll be in Cabo and somebody
will be wearing a rocker B hat or be
walking through an airport somewhere
crazy and see somebody and that's
surprised me I just the Brand's cool and
we try to pick out cool merch that
people like that looks good but the
amount that we've sold been
surprising yeah now what's something
that you launched that just hasn't gone
well I would say at this point it's all
nothing's really gone bad I haven't had
anything that people were like why'd you
do we try to when we first did our
before we opened the coffee shop and
gelato shop we Tred we opened like a
little thing an old barn thing we call
the Sugar Shack and a lot of the same
stuff there but it was off away from
everything and that the location for it
wasn't as good and we didn't have we
didn't have the coffee we didn't have
the gelato we didn't have everything yet
so we moved like a candy store it was
like that it was just it really just was
snow cones and it was really a snow con
stand really but the new one's attached
it's right attached to where the kitchen
is right near the swimming pool right
where everybody walks and where
everybody is and it's just a it's a

[37:00]
everybody is and it's just a it's a
better location so that's gone it's gone
a lot better since we got a little
better spot for it okay now do do you
think you'll ever be done adding on
building is there ever going to be a
time where you're like all right this is
what we've got feel good with this I
probably should be done but I probably
won't be I when you're done you run out
of have you run out of fun right like
it's fun building I know and I how do
you stop building fields and hotel rooms
when they sell out two minutes I mean
all of our lodging for all 15 of those
hotel rooms double A or two two two two
room two night minimum they all sold two
of the tournaments had a few rooms left
but four Let's see we had 14 tournaments
12 of them sold out in two minutes the
other two took a couple more days to to
sell out but they why would you stop
building those rooms pay out you know
pretty quickly and I think we'll
definitely build more hotel rooms
and I think we'll definitely build more
Fields just need to take a little break

[38:01]
Fields just need to take a little break
and digest what we've just done but
that's that's definitely in in the
future I feel like we're maybe halfway
to where what I'm envisioning this place
to be I want to add some softball fields
we've had a lot of girls want to come
play softball and we've had a couple
softball tournaments but our Fields
really aren't softball fields softball
teams like to play on all dirt infield
or All Turf infield and we have Mound
the pitching Mounds are getting the way
we have grass on the infield they're
just not softball fields but I think
it'd be really cool to in another little
spot out there have have three or four
just softball specific fields and just
every weekend you can have softball
going on while the baseball's going on
but yeah to work through some of the
logistics of that parking is a little
bit of an issue we got to we have to
expand our parking lot and as a couple
people pointed out on your post I need
to improve the part it's been a little
muddy here this spring but yeah it's
very it's just not it's typically rain's

[39:00]
very it's just not it's typically rain's
not typically an issue we're dealing
with out there it's usually drought it's
usually everything's too hot and dry
it's not everything's too wet but we
just keep getting this 10 or 12 inches a
week of rain and it's no place for the
water to go and so now all of a sudden a
couple of people were complained about
paying to park and then it being a mud
pit and they're right I just it just
wasn't an issue until it was and so it's
definitely something we're going to have
to address but it's it's a big parking
lot we' got the one we currently have is
185,000 Square ft and with the
additional field and additional people
we really need to probably expand it to
300,000 square feet yeah that'd be I
haven't really I'm trying to we're doing
some work to it just to get the drives
and everything a little bringing in some
road base and getting them better so
that we can at least get people in and
out but at some point I'd really like to
improve the lot and make it nicer but
just
do it do it as we can do it yeah I I put

[40:00]
do it do it as we can do it yeah I I put
a road here in at my property I'm
working on it and I was shocked by the
per square foot quotes and so to to
resurface 200,000 square feet you could
be that's a seven figure job and it's
hard to justify doing that because of
one unseasonably wet season right yeah
yeah you do people complain about the 20
bucks you to million dollar parking lot
at 20 bucks that's that's a lot of cars
it's a lot of cars to come through there
we're and like you said it's just not
typically is not an issue it's just this
we've just had so much rain so many
weeks in a row and it's just never had
time to dry out finally we this weekend
we just had is the first weekend we've
gotten the whole tournament in without
having without having without missing a
day because of rain do you have crushed
granite out there or what is there right
now it's mainly road base now okay a lot
of the roads like the main road coming
in and a lot of the area where everybody
walks and where most of the track
traffic is Chip sealed and we just re
chip sealed all of that it's just our

[41:02]
chip sealed all of that it's just our
our parking lot the big you go off the
chip seal onto a road based little
portion of the road to go into this
road-based parking lot and that that's
where we've had the problems and it's
just but it's in eight years of doing
these tournaments that really hasn't
been an issue until this year and it
just it wasn't something we budgeted to
to fix because it wasn't a problem I
don't know we'll see unque year with all
the you know lond year do you do you
envision a day where the resort ameni
side of your property outshines or
overtakes the baseball side or do you
think they're always going to be married
it's a baseball complex primarily and
that's why people come kids don't come
just to play baseball they come to just
run around and be kids like we have a
couple of lakes out there that we keep
stocked with Fish And I see kids get
more excited about going fishing than I
do about the baseball game i' see I see
them coming out of the Dugout they'll
throw their bag over there towards your
Mom and hey come on let's go fishing and

[42:02]
Mom and hey come on let's go fishing and
they grab their buddy and they're
hauling across the over to the lake to
Just Fish and this gosh two weeks ago a
kid caught about a nine and a half pound
bass out of the lake out there W big
throw that back say that for me now if
someone they love getting out there and
being kids and the parents they can run
around they can fish they can play
whiffle ball they can swim they just
there's just lots of activities and
things for everybody to do and then the
parents love it because they're they
don't have to really worry about their
kids we're in a kind of once you come
through the gates and come down the road
to where the facility is we have have
police officers on site every weekend
and it's not like you're at some sketchy
Community part you're in a pretty safe
environment and it's lots of there's
lots of staff and people around
everywhere and uh people just they enjoy
the just getting away kids just enjoy
getting out there and being running
around being kids if a family pulls in
and pays 20 bucks to park can they do

[43:00]
and pays 20 bucks to park can they do
all the pool and fishing stuff for free
basically and then they just pay for
food and anything most places would
probably charge a gate fee or a ticket
or you have to buy a ticket you know if
you go to Six Flags everybody goes in
has to buy a ticket but we don't do that
we just charge the 2020 out of that the
we pay our lifeguards partially out of
that and you know the just all the staff
and it all just goes into like I said
the buckets all go into one thing to
contribute but there's a lot of people
that have to get get paid and that just
that helps offset some of those costs do
you think you could ever see a day where
people are coming and paying 20 bucks
just to eat that amazing pizza or just
to get that barbecue like they have
nothing to do with baseball they're not
gonna swim they're not gonna fish now so
it's like everybody that I don't we
don't ask you when you've come in if
you're there to play a game or not they
just if you want to come in and buy a
pizza come on yeah get in there but and
we we also do a lot of other events out
there it's not all baseball we we'll do
25 baseball tournaments this weekend and

[44:00]
25 baseball tournaments this weekend and
those are all week this year those are
all weekend tournaments and then a lot
we also do a lot of corporate events out
there and those the the companies that
come out there and have their Retreat
you can now we have 50 rooms so you can
bring a pretty good size group we all
the foods included all the activities
the pool that a lot of times they
incorporate whiffle ball and kickball
and all those things in we also have a
crisbee golf range and we have a that's
where we have a shooting shooting range
ski shooting range that's not open
during the baseball weekends but it's
more for corporate stuff but the cool
thing about a corporate event is once
you come there you we rent the whole you
get the whole facility and that's the
only way we do it and so you're not out
there and there's some other company
here too or some other people it's you
get the privacy of coming out there and
being able to do whatever business you
need to do with your team or or your
staff and nobody else is there there
privacy people really enjoy that and
then we we're really able to do we're
really able to do really good food when

[45:00]
really able to do really good food when
we're cooking for those smaller groups
we're able to really we we'll we can add
tenderloin to the menu or just all all
different kinds of options just whatever
the client wants but do they pay extra
for pretty much every company that's
ever come out there and done a corporate
event has called us and come back we've
we we almost always have them come back
and is that side of your business
growing it is something we need to we've
gotten side TR that's probably something
we need to do a little bit more
marketing and just let people know we do
that because it's the baseball does so
well with just the word of mouth and
people sharing it but the corporate
stuff people don't talk as much about
that so that's an area we need to maybe
have someone focused on a little bit
more what do you charge for a a standard
corporate event and what is all is
included in that there's packages you
made a point on your post about 13,000 a
night that was the old pricing before
that's what we charged before we added
the additional rooms now we have 50
rooms so it's once we get an inquiry our
my wife who's currently our corporate

[46:01]
my wife who's currently our corporate
marketing person we'll send some more
information and do you have do you need
10 rooms do you need 20 rooms do you
need all 50 and there's a different
price structure just based on how many
rooms you need gotcha and then do you
include food with that is it usually an
allinclusive but but we do provide the
food but again you can lay out your menu
do you want and typically people don't
eat three huge meals while they're there
all day long they'll maybe have have a
light breakfast and a big lunch or or a
light lunch and a big dinner and they
spread it out but we just Lauren just
sits down with them and talks to them
based on their budget and based on what
their food allergies or just whatever
whatever they want to have on their menu
and then we just work it out with our
chefs and just create a customized menu
for with whatever you want now we did we
had had pizza in the past so that's
going to be a new thing we can offer and
it's pretty reasonably priced too I
anticipate a lot of Pizza in the future
we're also trying to addition to the
corporate stuff we're also especially

[47:00]
corporate stuff we're also especially
during the December January February
time frame we have a lot of kind of
downtime right there because it's not
very optimal weather for playing
tournaments we try to do like some
that's the time when a lot of high
school teams and college teams are
getting ready for the season they're
getting in shape and we've done several
little kind of team building teams bring
you know high school teams will come out
there for a night or two and do a team
building deal and they practice on the
field and they hit in their you know
then they they have their meetings and
go over all their internal you know
signs and all the stuff that they want
to do and we'd like to do more of those
type of events especially in December
January February just need to again just
get the word out there that's an option
yeah now what about dove hunting you
offer dove hunting out there is that a
focus or is that just a it's not really
something we've ever really done we I've
Dove hunted out there and we've had some
people out there I did you see that
somewhere on that was offered I I don't
I think it was an old Instagram post
that I saw I think one time we tried to

[48:00]
that I saw I think one time we tried to
we did a post or something about maybe
Labor Day weekend or opening weekend
doing someone could rent it for a dove
hunt and have it out there but we don't
we haven't really done a lot of dove
hunting out there I've I've done it just
myself and with friends but I think it's
actually I don't think we're actually
supposed to do hunts out there with
according to our insurance on I'm not
sure we'll edit this out very many of
those yeah now what about
none zero noted have you ever been
watching a game out there and you just
saw a superstar you just saw a kid
playing you're like man that kid's gonna
be good and then you saw him go on to do
great things we've saw we we haven't
been doing it long enough to see kids go
on to play in the pros or anything but
we've had some really good teams out
there we had a team came out a 12E team
came out there that played their last
they were the the canes they had their
they played their last four games of the
season at rocker b a couple years ago
and they finished the season 101 and

[49:02]
and they finished the season 101 and
zero that was their record wow holy cow
kids played 101 games in won every one
of them and they they got in a little
early they came from out of town and
they were there and they were the night
before the tournament started they were
all just they're 12-year-old kids at the
time my son who played High School
baseball and he he was like 14 I think
at the time and these 12y old kids were
every one of them were bigger than him
and everybody on their team and they're
sitting there just hitting home runs out
of our our field like it's they're just
like they're hitting a whiffle ball or
something it just it was unbelievable
but we've seen some really talented
teams and some really talented players
for sure I can't specifically say one's
gone on to do great things but I'm I'm
sure they will because just oh yeah so
many thousands of kids are coming out
there every year it's just law averages
at some point and it's we get our our
tournaments are competitive they're we
get it's not there there's some really
good baseball teams that come out there

[50:01]
good baseball teams that come out there
that that really play the game right and
so it's there's some talented kids for
sure now what about adding what about
building like an indoor basketball court
where you could hold basketball or
wrestling tournaments during the winter
time you thought about doing that that
is a good idea we have a we have an
arena a big 15,000 foot Arena that was
originally a cutting horse Arena that we
we could probably enclose right now it's
we have batting cages in there and a
whiffle ball field and there's a gym
workout facility yeah I don't know it's
just the economics of that I don't know
what it would look like building a
gymnasium is expensive and air
conditioning heating it I just I don't
know if we'd have enough enough demand
for that but it's
interesting yeah like I I grew up in
Orlando in the Orlando area and they had
Disney's wild Wide World of Sports and
we'd go have tournaments there and I see
this as as like a Texas Disney right
like a a Texas Wide World of Sports and
the economics of both basketball and
wrestling tournaments are pretty
lucrative like we go to wrestling
tournaments with 25 35 teams there and

[51:02]
tournaments with 25 35 teams there and
you're there multiple days and I feel
like you you've built up so many
amenities that would be so advantageous
to host any type of a youth sports
tournament I I posted a tweet a few
months ago about a building I have on my
property back here and there's a ton of
demand for training Youth Sports
training especially in rural areas cuz
the gyms don't know what to do with
these kids and there are plenty of
private trainers but they don't know
where to take these kids right so I just
think that if you continue leaning into
the Youth Sports side of things and not
just baseball softball but shoot you're
not afraid to just build random
buildings right
but up until now the difference between
Disney and and rocker B is Disney if
you're in Disney you want to build
something you just got to call corporate
and get them to give you the funds I
guess when you're a little mom and pop
like us I don't have any Partners in
this it's just me so it's yeah sure it

[52:02]
this it's just me so it's yeah sure it
all comes back to me and I don't I don't
know I got to be careful the capex
projects I take off right now we have so
many other needs I think it would make
more sense to build more hotel rooms and
make more sense to make it make uh
improvements to our parking lot and then
build additional Fields because you know
that just brings more people and the
more people you have does your Arena
have does it have air conditioning is it
enclosed no it's open air a it's it's an
old cutting horse R it's just open air
but it we built it when about 2006 back
when I was was trying to get in the
cutting horse business yeah has there
ever been a time in the last 18 years
where you've really worried like man did
I do the right thing am I on the right
track or did you do it so SL right
that's just the world of being an
entrepreneur you got it's not for
everybody it's definitely stressful
there's there's days when you're
bulletproof and there's days you're like
what world have I done so it just you
know that's just the way every business

[53:00]
know that's just the way every business
I've ever been in is like that and
people don't understand that everyone
wants to hey I'm just going to build
this business and go do it but being an
entrepreneur is it it's takes a lot of I
don't know it's hard work and and
there's not they're not always peaceful
night sleep yeah but it's now everything
getting to the point now where we're
built up enough scale that was our
problem a few years ago is we just there
just wasn't enough scale to to cover the
overhead that you had to have and all
the improvements that we needed so as we
as it gets a little larger and more
people come there's there's just more
scale kind of covering the business so
if you could go back eight to 10 years
with everything now would what would you
have built differently or would you have
added something in a different order or
would you have done everything just the
same it's worked out pretty good and
we've just done things out of necessity
as we've needed to and have had the
funds to do it I don't know how much I
would have really changed it was pretty
it's a pretty pretty cool spot I wish I
really want you to come out there and
see it I'm gonna hold you to that I'm

[54:00]
see it I'm gonna hold you to that I'm
coming you really need to come see it
it's just I'm coming for the pizza if
nothing else it's just such a cool place
it just has a good vibe it feels like
you're in a little you're in a little
City walk around it just feels like
you're in some old Deadwood City
everything's rustic and old and or looks
old and even like the little outdoor
covered Pavilion that we just built for
shade is we called it good night Hall
after Charles good night and it's made
out of old red brick and just looks like
it's been for a long time and it's just
I I don't know I I love the vibe of the
place I love what we've built I don't
know that I'd really change anything no
I think it's I love what we've done and
I think it's I think it's really cool
and it's fun and obviously all the
people are coming and they like it too
that's yeah that's the best phot of
confidence I think what you've done is
such a testament to doing things slowly
right and just testing the waters seeing
how it goes adding more I think most
people are expecting more results in a
shorter period of time and have you
heard of the Lindy effect Lance I want

[55:00]
heard of the Lindy effect Lance I want
you the Lindy effect it's basically the
theory that the amount of time that a
business has been around can predict the
amount of time that it will continue to
be around so if you go invest in a
50-year-old company statistically
speaking it's going to be around for at
least another 50 years and a three-month
old startup is probably out of business
in within three months right so you've
just done it you've just done it right
and you went into it with the intent not
even to build a huge business but let's
just add a wole ball field let's see
where that goes oh people like it let's
make this a real baseball field oh
people like it let's make another one oh
people need somewhere to stay let's add
some hotel rooms oh we have more
baseball teams let's add another field
oh we have more people let's add more
hotel rooms it's just it's I won't say
it's drisk but you're mitigating your
risk and I think that's another
misconception of entrepreneurs is that
we're these shoot from the hip Risk
Takers whereas we're doing a lot of
research we like I do a ton of research
before I take any risk right and I'm

[56:00]
before I take any risk right and I'm
sure you're the same way yeah we've
built it just like you just described
and it's I don't know that this is the
only business I've ever done this way
it's the only business I've ever done
where I didn't have any Partners in it
I've never just gone out on my own and
done something like this it's really
just our family place and but it
probably would have made sense you
probably you could have done things you
can look back at that and could have
done things faster would have been
better I don't know Partners have
opinions and so it's I've been pretty I
had a pretty clear understanding of kind
of what I wanted here and what I wanted
this to be and I want it to be like I
said the start of the deal I want this
to be elite I want it to be the the best
facility in America to go play baseball
and I think we're well on our way
there's there's other places and that's
I was coaching I coached my kids
baseball when he played here in Fort
Worth at Westside Little League both my
kids played and I would coach their
teams I coached their all-star teams and
I started looking for places that I
could take the team I want where where
could we take them because your Little
League's different than travel ball
Little League you play at your little
local place and then when you get to

[57:01]
local place and then when you get to
Allstars you want to go play against
some better Talent so we're like let's
find a good travel tournament to go to
and just play against some better
talents something be really cool really
fun fun for the for the kids when you
start really looking there's not there's
not a lot of there's nothing like rocker
B it's a very unique facility there's
there are some really cool places
there's the there's the Cooperstown
place up in coopertown New York the Hall
of Fame is and it's phenomenal it and
but it's I think it's just for 12 U
teams and their like their entry fee is
$1,200 per
kid holy cow that's a different deal
it's you'll spend $177,000 taking your
team to a tournament there there's some
other there's some great facilities that
that Cal Ripken and Billy Ripken have
built the Ripken baseball guys Pigeon
Ford and all these really fabulous
facilities but they're it's a little
different it's not as much the resort
stay on site fish run around be a kid

[58:03]
stay on site fish run around be a kid
it's just it's a super nice they're
super nice baseball facilities but you
again you stay offsite at off-site
hotels and I've done so much of that we
traveling with my kid I've just been to
so many baseball tournaments and so many
facilities all over the United States
and they just they make for long
weekends when you're just sitting around
a hotel a holiday in or something all
weekend long and then you just go over
there at 5:00 play your game then you
come back and you're just you're just in
some random town somewhere just hanging
out and that that's what I was trying to
create was a destination that being
there is the cool part everybody and
that's what we've seen happen especially
this year since we've added these the
new pool the new facilities people come
and they just stay they they don't go
back to Mineral Wells and just sit sit
in the hotel they stay out there all
especially when the weather's nice they
stay out and enjoy the scenery enjoy the
view enjoy the
outdoors and all the things that we have
to offer that's what we're after is this

[59:01]
to offer that's what we're after is this
unique facility that where you create
these just once in a lifetime memories
with your buddies and with your family I
look back over the baseball tournaments
that I traveled to with my son and the
time that we spent just driving down the
road in the truck and it's Priceless
it's some of the most wonderful times
we've spent together and that that's
what I'm trying to continue to build on
is this facility where people just get
to go out there and spend time with
their families and their kids and
just enjoy beautiful part of Texas yeah
I I can't believe it's taken me an hour
to make this connection but you're the
bues of baseball fields do people ever
refer to that do people ever say that I
think there's a bunch of bies though we
only have one so you got to come to this
one yeah just the experience right like
they're going to you to play baseball
but they're not they're going for the
experience like you go to bies to fill
up on gas but most people don't even
fill up on gas right have you ever been
compared to bies in that way I don't
know I maybe the first I think I saw
some let the record show it's me I
invented it the bues of baseball field

[1:00:01]
invented it the bues of baseball field
rock rocker
bies yeah it's the it's very similar
because you walk into a bues and it's
professional and it's clean and the food
you buy is actually really good it's
pricey but it's because it's high
quality and it's really good and people
care and they're nice and it's well
cared for and but they're in the middle
of nowhere they're in real what you just
said so critical of any business it's
got to be professional and it's got to
be clean and we yeah we take we we go
way out of the way and we have a great
staff of people that are all super nice
and kind customer service is real
important to us we clean our bathrooms
we have staff out there doing that and
just keeping I walk around when I'm out
there half the time I'm just walking
around picking up trash I just I don't I
could I like it to be like Disneyland I
don't like you go there there's or the
Masters you walk around at the Masters
you don't see trash on the ground you
don't see cups land when you got 2,000
people it's going to get thrown down but
I just we we have a staff of people that
are just constantly picking enough trash
and keeping everything looking nice and
every night we go in and you know clean

[1:01:00]
every night we go in and you know clean
everything up and get the chairs back
situated the right way and it takes a
lot of extra effort and extra payroll to
make that happen but it's essential
everything has to be clean and
professional do you think this is
franchisable do you think you could ever
expand this to other areas our facility
is unique because of the the landscape
where we are it's just absolutely
gorgeous piece of property and it's so
you'd have to find another I think
that's part of Vibe is just how pretty
it is out there but it I bought it a
long time ago and bought it out in a
rural area hour away from the Metroplex
and I'd say that could probably replic
I've had some people ask me about it
I've had we get tons of of expro
baseball players out there there's just
been hundreds of them that are they're
coaching their kids now and there's been
a few of them that have asked me about
opening one in California or opening one
in different places and I
I we're still drinking water out of a
fire hose just finishing everything we
got here but I wouldn't say no but it's

[1:02:00]
got here but I wouldn't say no but it's
not something that's on my current
agenda yeah I feel like you could put
one in the Ozarks and it would have a
similar topography you could put one in
the Smoky Mountains as well yeah I would
definitely have some Partners in that
I'm not going to go doing more of those
myself but but yeah maybe we'll you know
we'll see how it goes I I've been in
your shoes when things are going and
you're growing and you have a system and
there's just all these shiny rabbits
that's just calling to you but you just
know if you just keep doing what you're
doing you're just going to keep crushing
it what's the point it it'd be neat to
have some it's fun to think about but at
this point it's just it's everything I
can do to keep this keep us moving along
and I I'm not finished it's like yeah
we've we've come a long way but it's
still there's just still so much to do
and there's so much there's just so much
demand that that is just that we can't
meet just because of capacity it's it
should at least take a couple days to
fill your tournament up I would think
not a couple minutes I think that means
crazy we got to keep keep doing a little

[1:03:02]
crazy we got to keep keep doing a little
bit more here to get to the point where
we can satisfy the demand and are you
doing corporate events during the season
or are you waiting for the offseason for
that no we do them yeah we can okay just
earlier in the week it's easy really
easy for us to do like a Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday type of deal Monday
usually is a lot of cleanup and
straightening everything up and staff
and everybody kind of catching their
breath and then Tuesday Wednesday
Thursday it makes for busy weeks when
you got another group you got to clean
everything and clean all the rooms and
then the kitchen staff doesn't have
their time to do all their prep they
have to they're preparing meals for
another event but but we've done it and
we'd like we can do more we just
gota just we we just we haven't really
marketed the corporate stuff yeah quite
to the degree we need to but but it's a
really it's a cool spot for for having
your corporate deal cuz just you like I
said the privacy of the whole thing and
just all the things are to do we have a
about a mile jogging track or kind of
walking Track around it and a lot of

[1:04:00]
walking Track around it and a lot of
people go on Hikes along that just just
a lot it's a lot to do out there and
it's relaxing so how much of your foot I
think I think our corporate stuff will
build here over the next year two as how
much of your footprint are you using
right now on your acreage we have 320
acres and I'd say we're
utilizing 35 or 40 acres of it so
there's a lot of additional land for
that and it's all you know about 60% of
it is open and pretty flat and about 40%
is wooded but there there's a lot of uh
just a lot of just flat open land that
it'd be really easy to build additional
fields and additional lodging and we
when we were building the lodging we
have we did a lot of things in advance
so that when you add additional lodging
down the road a lot of stuff's already
in place the infrastructure of the water
and the sewer and all those internet we
just had to redo all of our internet
you're just out in the middle of nowhere
so there's just not
any that's not a lot of infrastructure
we infrastructure but now we've done a

[1:05:00]
we infrastructure but now we've done a
lot of that and we've taken these steps
that are going to make future
development easier and less
expensive now I gotta ask 2005 was a
really good time to buy real estate what
did this land set you back
then oh gosh it wasn't very much I think
it was
like was around I think it was like 1500
Acres it was a long time oh man you
can't get a single family home for that
much in in Plano nowadays that's why I
would just it would be hard to yeah I'm
not saying I won't ever have competition
around for this but sure it's it would
be expensive to build now because you
just the land alone would cost so much
more but then the we've built this all
over time I built this the horse Arena
that which is now the indoor facility
and we built that in you know 15 years
ago it just everything cost less back
then and I was doing it we just we just
have incrementally added things and just

[1:06:00]
have incrementally added things and just
just recently we did this kind of bigger
expansion and that that was an
aggressive move but something we needed
to do and so I'm glad we did it but
we're just finalizing it all we're just
finishing we have a short window to
build stuff because starting in March we
have tournaments all the way through
July and then we break after the second
week in July until September because of
just it just get so hot it's just it's
too hot to play baseball and so we we
take a break there and we start back in
September and we go till November so you
basically have December January February
to build stuff and we built a brand new
kitchen 28 hotel rooms a a commercial
swimming pool resort pool with Cabanas
Pavilion covered open air Pavilion and
the fourth field all in about 90 days it
was just we were but we were going fast
but one of the benefits of being out in
an unincorporated area too is you don't
have a municipality that you have to
permit everything with you just permit

[1:07:01]
permit everything with you just permit
with the state and so it make you're
able to move faster but it was pretty
aggressive we we we went at it pretty
hard for it it was a and we're still
just finishing it all up we're still
trying to finish everything we haven't
rolled the Cabanas out yet we're hoping
to do that here in two weeks at our
first Little Texas Title event just got
the pizza out just got the coffee gelato
out so we're just we're just finishing
it up and cleaning everything up and
getting the roads all tightened up it's
just it's hard to go that
fast where do you see rocker be in 50
years what's the what's the big picture
goal for it keep it in the family sell
it what do you think it's it'll be
interesting to see my daughter's about
to graduate she's just finished her
sophomore year at Baylor and she loves
the ranch and has talked about coming
back and running it and working on it I
know I don't know that I'll be doing it
in 50 years but I'm if I still be around
but but I I don't know it's it's hard to
predict the future sometimes but I know
we're having fun right now and I know
it's it's a lot of fun building these

[1:08:01]
it's it's a lot of fun building these
facilities it's a lot of fun to see all
these kids and people come out there and
the smiles on their face especially we
made it through covid we we ended up
having nine tournaments during covid and
that was those were some of the most
rewarding ones because man people wanted
to get out and get away and get out of
the house and we were in a r this rural
environment we reached out to the
governor and they he gave us a kind of a
special little was about to do this
little special thing for us he he
eventually opened it up for all the
youth baseball facilities since it was
Outdoors that we could start having
tournaments and so we had nine
tournaments during that pandemic and
they were just some of the most
rewarding people were so happy to just
be out there and it it's just it's just
cool to see everybody come out and have
a good time and enjoy the enjoy what you
built and appreciate
it talk about a roller coaster I I just
I imagine when Co hit you were stressing
out and then you became one of the only
facilities that were allowed to open and
just zero to 100 right that's when we

[1:09:02]
just zero to 100 right that's when we
made our Mo we we got our most momentum
really we were really working hard to to
get tournaments full before the year
before that and then during covid
everyone found out that we were having
tournaments and so teams start we got
there was a bunch it generated a bunch
of stuff on social media and people just
start that and that's when our
tournament started filling up was during
that time and then the year after it
just really took off and then this last
year has just been even faster every
year just gets a little bit I always
always worry about it I hope everybody
signs up this year but then we announce
it it's a couple minutes later they're
full so it's been cool have you ever
crunched the numbers on what percentage
of all baseball teams within a couple
hours are like what percentage of the
market you have and how much left there
is to go there's probably what eight and
a half n million people that live within
two and a half hours of the ranch when
you think about
high school kids youth yeah yeah we
don't do as many high school tournaments

[1:10:00]
don't do as many high school tournaments
most of ours are more up until we peek
at about 15 14 15 years old the the high
school teams it's a different it's a
different deal this we've had a few High
School tournaments but they by that
point kids are just really looking to
get recruited for college and they want
to go play in the the perfect game the
different tournaments that are more
recruiting oriented plus they don't
bring 65 or 70 people per team they the
kid drives out there in his truck
himself plays his game goes home so it's
just a different it's a different model
but we're just we're focused really on
about 8 and n u up through about 13 14
year with what 12 12 11 12 13's far kind
of our main area yeah I would think with
as busy you are there's still a long way
to go with regards to how many teams are
actually using your field every year
it's hard to know I don't know how you
really find out that information it's uh
cuz like I said we had we just really
haven't done much marketing I don't know
how to even do it we just and a lot of
the we'll put our post out and I'll my

[1:11:01]
the we'll put our post out and I'll my
Bart my brother does most of them but we
we'll see the we'll see the response
that we get and sometimes some of them
we'll put little videos out that maybe
75 or 100 thousand people will see it's
just cool but obviously there's a lot
more just interaction between people
that have been there that's it's that
word of mouth sharing that people are
doing that's I think we're really
getting a lot of momentum we don't
really see all that because it's on
other people's pages and website they're
just you just can't put a value on
people saying nice things about your
place yeah but that's really what's
Driven a lot of it I think yeah Lance I
want to be respectful of your time but
is there anything you're willing to
share about the the size or scale of
your business what are you uh you size
of a small restaurant or a small country
not a country I think we're I think
we're going the right direction and I
think there's a lot of potential in the
future as we kind of finish rolling
everything out and getting everything

[1:12:01]
everything out and getting everything
operating efficiently on all cylinders
and then eventually taking steps to add
more capacity whether it be a field or
more lodging on site and it's just how
fast you tackle all that and how you
approach it especially in this
environment where you can't go borrow
much of money to do all that stuff in in
this environment so you just have to
either have Equity or cash flow and and
all of our we pour all the cash flow
back into the business it's just we're
not we're just constantly compounding
that's just that's our motto is
constantly improving so we're just
trying to get better and make everything
better all the time and it just takes
everything at this point but I I really
I feel like we're going the right
direction and I feel like in the future
there's it's GNA it's going to be very
rewarding just because we're just trying
to do everything the right way and we're
trying to build a facility that that not
only are we proud of but everybody wants
to come to it just because it's Unique
it's different it's clean it's nice the
food's good Margaritas are good you

[1:13:00]
food's good Margaritas are good you
talked about our $16 Margaritas too and
but that's another thing we're it'd be
one thing to to pour a sugary margarita
mix into a a Dixie cup and call it a
margarita but ours are quality
Margaritas it's two shots the tequila
use I think it's casamas I think I've
never drank alcohol in my life but my
friend was asking he's I wonder what
type of tequila they use but I think
there's two shots of of Premium tequila
there's a shot of quantro and and it's
all made with fresh lime juice and it's
all Fresh Products we don't it's the
same as the pizza we don't buy the
little yeah sugar mix off the shelf and
pour it in a cup we do it the right way
I'm sold if you put that much attention
and detail into your pizza I assume you
do it with everything I'm impressed you
know who veto was oh yeah yeah he hit
like a million subscribers a while back
isn't he awesome he's a good guy I need
to have him out I need him to come check
