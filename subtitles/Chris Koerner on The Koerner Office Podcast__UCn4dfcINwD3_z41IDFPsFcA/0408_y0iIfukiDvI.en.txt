look at this freaking guy right there
that's my friend Kyler and at 22 years
old he started a business with only $300
and one Facebook Marketplace post that
makes him $7,000 a month here's exactly
how to copy it and what exactly it is so
Kyler's Grandpa owned an apartment
complex that had washer dryer hookups
but no washers and dryers and he thought
why is that how can I make money on that
so on a whim he posted an ad to Facebook
Marketplace that said washer and dryer
rental $60 per month and then he went on
a cruise for a week and never checked
his phone after a week he had dozens of
inquiries from this one Facebook
Marketplace post and he thought oh crap
I guess I'm in the appliance rental
business now he went out and bought used
ugly white washer dryers for $300 total
he picked him up on the way to his first
customer and then dropped him right off
in the back of his Toyota Highlander he
didn't even have a truck or a trailer
Flash Forward a year and he has over 100
units and only 1% of them break every
week and only 1% of his units get stolen
every year I just did a full Deep dive
breakdown with him so you can copy it
