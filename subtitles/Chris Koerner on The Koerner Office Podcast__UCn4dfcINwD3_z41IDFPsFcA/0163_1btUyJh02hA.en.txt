[00:00]
with the recording um so by way of
background my name is Chris Kerner I
live here in Dallas Texas uh I'm a
Serial entrepreneur I love business and
I have a podcast and YouTube channel and
we own a bunch of businesses and I have
been importing things from other
countries uh for 16 years now since I
was 22 years old um maybe it's iPhone
Parts iPhone accessories Bitcoin miners
perfume machines bounce houses
trampolines you name it um I've reported
a lot of different things and I enjoy it
I love I love business and so um I'm
grateful for this opportunity that we
have um to help import these um
wonderful perfume vending machines uh my
business partner is Nick heski um he
might be in here right now he might not
um and we have a company called
co-founders uh that owns and starts uh
companies much like this one um the
owner of the perfume vending machine
company is called perfuma and they are
an amazing company out of Spain and we

[01:01]
an amazing company out of Spain and we
are the authorized distributor for North
America and for everyone that's tuning
in uh that's International I will get to
that uh later so for now I want to talk
about the machine I know a lot of you
are curious about pricing um I know a
lot of you are curious about profit
potential so I'm going to cover all that
um there is no question that's off
limits and if it is off limits it's not
off limits so um you were probably here
because you saw a viral video on
Instagram with this uh this ugly mug on
it and when I posted that video I had no
idea what would happen I post videos
about business ideas all the time now I
did have somewhat of a relationship with
perfuma um because we had spoken three
months ago about me buying a bunch of
their machines because I genuinely think
this is an awesome idea uh regardless of
what country you're in uh and so this
idea had always just been kind of
sitting in my mind and then one day I'm
like um I was recording my podcast with

[02:00]
like um I was recording my podcast with
Nick and I brought up the idea cuz we
never really talked about it and then I
made the Instagram video to talk about
the idea to promote the podcast not to
promote the machines um and then the
video went viral and then I started
talking to performatic again and they
said let's work something out um let's
make something more official because
coincidentally Chris you have a lot of
experience doing this this type of thing
not with perfume I have no experience
with perfume and I won't pretend that I
do um but in business and in Commerce
and even a little vending machine
experience so that's why you're here
from that viral video that's why I'm
here I didn't know I would be here uh
last week but here here we are and so
let's roll with it um
I let's just get straight to to the
Brass tax so um performatic has has sold
thousands of these machines from across
the world um North America is a fairly
new market to them and I'm proud and
excited and honored um to be authorized
to distribute them here um once again

[03:01]
to distribute them here um once again
we'll get to the international questions
uh in a little bit but these machines
hold five bottles of perfume or colog um
and there it holds 30 milliliters per
bottle and you are able to charge per
spray whatever you like um the average
charge is a dollar um at more high-end
nightclubs it goes up to uh 250 um The
Profit potential of these machines is
pretty incredible um the payback period
is largely based on the location and the
volume of course right and so if you put
this machine in the middle of nowhere
your payback period might be a long time
but if you put it in a hot location um
such as a nightclub a gym University
campus a nicer gas station Believe It or
Not movie
theaters then the The Profit potential
is between anywhere from $7 to
$900 USD per month um to thousands of

[04:01]
$900 USD per month um to thousands of
dollars per month which means the
payback period as in when you can get
your investment back out uh ranges from
a month or even less than a month if
it's a really good location to three or
four months um if it's a bad location it
could be five six seven eight plus
months if it's an amazing location and
you find lightning in a bottle it could
be a few weeks um their best performing
location receive 7,000 sprays a month um
I assume they're charging a dollar so
that's 7 ,000 a month um fairly
passively these bottles take about 5 to
7 minutes to refill they last a long
time um and the warranty on these
machines is good for two years or
100,000 sprays uh whichever comes first
so I haven't even really referred to my
notes let so so let me go to my notes
and and see what I'm missing so these
cards uh these machines accept either
card uh paper cash or coin um the price

[05:00]
card uh paper cash or coin um the price
varies somewhat based on what you prefer
um some they also have a a free version
of the machine for um perfume companies
that just want to use it for samples and
don't want to charge um or for people
that rent out the entire machine to
festivals events or weddings and they
just want to charge a flat fee for
someone to have the whole machine for a
day um you don't really need a credit
card terminal in that case so you can
get credit card coin or paper um and and
the the locations where these machines
work best largely vary on the culture
and the country so what we've seen in um
Scandinavia for instance they work
really well at universities on campus um
because college students want to smell
good um in Eastern Europe we see that
it's more common for women to use the
machines so they do better in places
where women are in Western Europe it's
more common for men to use the machines

[06:00]
more common for men to use the machines
um so they do really well in nightclubs
in Croatia they do really well in
high-end nicer gas stations um movie
theaters gyms and I would bet that there
are hundreds of potential types of
locations that haven't even been
discovered yet because this is a
relatively young company um and there's
a zillion different places where you
could put these and I think a little
creativity would go a long way here um
these machines do take 60 days to
produce um from the time you order
whether you order one 10 or 100 it will
take 60 days um 70% uh of the deposit is
required up front and then 30% uh before
delivery is required um the price of the
machines it starts around 3,000 USD um
that can go up um based on the payment
options that you want adding a credit
card terminal costs a little bit more
um but the price of the machines at
$3,000 comes down as you order more

[07:01]
$3,000 comes down as you order more
quantities so it's around 3,000 USD for
1 to 5 units as you scale up six plus 10
plus 100 plus that price can drop the
price also does not include uh shipping
taxes or Customs charges um so that gets
that question out of the
way um got a couple questions in the
comments so you are able to customize
the machines if you order five plus
units um from 1 to four four units
you're not able to customize them the
machine does come with a an an LCD
screen with a like a default
advertisement for the perfume machine
you are able to switch that out with
whatever you want maybe your own ad your
own logo your own video or uh what some
customers are doing they're even selling
ads um on this machine as an additional
Revenue source so you're able to do that
as well and all of the machines come
with the video screen that's not an
additional cost

[08:00]
additional cost
you are able to offer free samples on
the machine so if You' like people to be
able to try before you buy um these
machines are equipped with a GSM or a
CDMA SIM card um which can make import
importing them um kind of tricky
sometimes if you don't know what you're
doing uh perfuma does own the patent on
this m machine so others that might be
selling something that looks similar or
violating that patent um and you are at
risk of interfering with um local laws
because if a device has a GSM or a CDMA
SIM card inside of it which these do
they can be classified as a
Communications device uh which is an
entirely different ball game than merely
a vending machine um so let me go back
to my notes here um just to recap for
people that have joined late the price
is around $3,000 which does not include
additional payment options on the
machine or shipping or or local taxes um
that price goes down as you add more

[09:00]
that price goes down as you add more
quantities customization is available at
5 plus units um profit potential is
anywhere between um 7 800 USD per month
to 7,000 per month on an extreme case
most people uh find that they're
profiting between 700 and 2500 per month
which would mean your payback period is
call it 1 to three four months um which
is that's a it's a pretty good
investment in my opinion um let me get
to some of the some of the questions
here I'm
scrolling all right let's
see man so many
people putting branding on the machine I
just answered that thank you Bahamas uh
okay power so the machine um it is
hardwired I believe I'm almost positive
it is hardwired into the power um so you
would need an electrician to do that um
and it only cost like depends widely on

[10:00]
and it only cost like depends widely on
what your local power costs are but the
power costs per month are like $2 to8 uh
it's very very very
small um but it the power is configured
to work worldwide it doesn't have to be
a specific plug
um how many sprays do you get per 30
milliliters great question I have that
in my notes I believe that uh Matt you
might need to correct me I believe
that's 250 to to 300 sprays um okay
that's what I have in my notes so you
would only have to refill it you know
300 sprays times five bottles in there
of course it depends on which bottles
are most popular um so the more you
refill it means the more money you're
making payment possible with credit
debit card only cash um coin cash or
credit/debit card all available um in
your experience in a nightclub for
example would the owner typically charge
you rent to keep the device in their

[11:00]
you rent to keep the device in their
establishment great question so I I
completely forgot to talk about the
reporting capabilities so you are able
to see and track from um iOS or Android
the status the sales the the levels of
your perfume or cologne from your phone
at any given time or moment so what that
means is you are able to negotiate
whatever you can negotiate with the
building or business uh establishment
owner maybe that's a flat $100 per month
uh maybe it's a profit share of 10 20 or
30% and you say hey I'm G to add you as
a user um to the back end of our
software so you don't need to worry
about trusting me you can have full
visibility into what that machine is
putting out and I'll give you 20% of it
um you're able to do either or uh what
we're seeing is it's a good mix maybe 60
40 uh 60% of people are opting
for um like a percentage Revenue share
10 to 20% and then 40% are getting a
small dollar amount per month but
ultimately this is a sales pitch and a

[12:01]
ultimately this is a sales pitch and a
lot of this depends on how you approach
the the business owner for you for
instance Tesla has thousands of
superchargers all over the the world and
when they approach a business owner they
say we're not going to give you any of
this um they might be paying 10 cents
per kilowatt hour and then charging the
Tesla owner 40 cents per kilowatt hour
right so a four times markup and the the
person that owns that parking lot gets
nothing they get absolutely nothing from
that no dollars no percentage nothing it
all goes to Tesla Tesla's pitches we
will bring you more traffic people will
go inside your building and spend more
money with you and over time that's
proven to actually be true and they can
point to to data data points that proves
that out um so if you approach the
business owner with the attitude of like
hey like do you think maybe it's
possible like I'll I'll share the
profits with you then that's definitely
not as high leverage of a conversation
of approaching him and saying listen I

[13:00]
of approaching him and saying listen I
actually that today's your lucky day I
want to bring you a lot more customers
today you own this movie theater I own
this thing that attracts people to a
movie theater if they smell good in your
movie theater they'll want to be in your
movie theater if someone has to choose
between a movie theater where they can
smell good uh or a movie theater that
requires them to spend $70 on a bottle
of cologne that they only use once every
time they go to the movies they're going
to choose yours right you just have to
attack them up front with this logic and
then when you hit him with the pitch
it's listen so how would you feel about
me placing this in your movie theater
what do you have to lose not hey so how
about I give you $200 a month to put
this in your movie theater it just
changes the whole dynamic of the
conversation you're the one with the
knowledge you're the one approaching
them so you should be the one to frame
it in the way that's most advantageous
uh for
you uh what is the average share okay I
just answered that great question I
agree Rudy what's the security of the
machine like what materials are used to
prevent theft I have that information

[14:00]
prevent theft I have that information
let me grab that that is a great
question um give me just a
second so um let me just give you some
like facts about the machine um it has a
3G or a 4G modem it also have has Wi-Fi
capabilities um it has an a lock for an
an vandalism it has uh you can get an
anti- Vandal housing material um you can
get plexiglass they have all types of
additional options um obviously some
locations might be more dangerous than
others um so that option is up to you as
to how many anti- theft or anti- Vandal
um protections you would like on the
machine but they are available yes um
the the HD screen is 10.1 Ines it's an
LED screen I said LCD um and I said 300
sprays per bottle that is incorrect the

[15:02]
sprays per bottle that is incorrect the
you have the display bottles um the
retail bottles that people actually see
those hold um 300 or 250 to 300 sprays
but then there's like a wholesale bottle
beneath that the customer can't see that
holds um like a thousand more um and so
I believe I could be wrong if I'm wrong
I'll send a retraction and a correction
but that it holds the machine holds
1,500 sprays uh before you have to ref
fill it um electricity bill $2 to $10
per month um you can integrate it with
several uh payment uh systems uh and you
can operate it uh remotely you can get
daily reports and
statistics does the machine come with
any sort of system data analytics to
gauge spray count yep okay thank you I
answered that can you change the
language yes you can actually have two
different languages at the same time as
well um they support all the major
languages and then you can have two uh
at any given

[16:00]
at any given
time physical dimensions of the machine
great question let me grab
that it is 700 by 400 MM uh length and
width and5 millim deep um so convert
millimeters 700 by 400 by 185 and empty
with no perfume it weighs 24 kg which in
pounds is like 52 lb or so so 52 lb 70
by 4 700 by 400 by 185
millimet how do you maintain these
machines such as cleaning refilling
servicing uh great question so repairs
are they do happen but they're not
common whatsoever they're somewhat
straightforward machines there is a
repair manual um it it financially
doesn't usually make sense to ship these
all over the country and world to get
them repaired and so there is a a a
generic repair manual for the most

[17:00]
generic repair manual for the most
common things for something more complex
you would be able to get on the phone um
with the manufacturer and have them uh
talk you through it for something more
complex than that you would be able to
ship it if needs
be what are examples of how you could
customize the machine I will send some
of those afterwards because I don't have
that offand power consumption what if
some breaks the
glass um voltage of the machine let me
see what that is
that's a good question I don't have that
but I will send that
afterwards uh but I'm imagining since it
draws such uh low power it it would be
110 how would manager store owners be
paid for placing machines okay answered
that insurance and maintenance um
answered that insurance um that would
probably be covered it's typically
covered under the establishment where
you have the machine um what challenges
do you think one would have in the US
great question David I think the
challenge here is finding the right type

[18:01]
challenge here is finding the right type
of location um I feel like certain
locations are already proven and they're
going to work in basically any culture
and that is a nightclub some sort of a
nightclub um other locations I think
could be riskier but have potential
reward uh universities are well
established to work in in Scandinavia I
feel like they would work very well here
in North America although I don't know
of anyone currently doing it um
universities do not work well in many
other parts of Europe because that's not
the culture um I think you you're really
just going to have to draw on the data
um that I'm providing and we'll try to
send more hard data on locations after
this um but other than that you're going
to have to be flexible and be creative
to be honest and leave some flexibility
in your contract with the business owner
to be able to pull out after 30 days if
it's just not looking good um I'm
friends with a gentleman named Quinn
Miller he owns hundreds of vending
machines in Southern California and it's

[19:01]
machines in Southern California and it's
very common to have a an option in your
contract to exit free of penalty within
30 days if it's just not going well
because he's been placing vending
machines for a decade and even he'll
find a perfect location that matches his
other perfect locations and it just
won't do well um and so you just never
know until you really try all we can do
is as much research and data Gathering
as we can and yes Eric they are wall
mounted and there is also pedestals for
them um there's an additional pedestal
option that has a much larger LED screen
if you really get into selling ads um
there's a much larger one for an
additional charge after two years of
warranty what is the best selection in
getting your machine property insured
knowing theft or
accidental uh events occur in these
retail areas I'll send that out
afterwards um because I don't have a lot
of answers about insurance other than
the customers that I know that that
piggyback on the the business owner's
insurance I don't have answers about

[20:01]
insurance I don't have answers about
like if you rent out the machine to an
event um or to a wedding do you get
notified when the bottle is running out
yes specs on the machine just did that
how are customer issues handled since
it's patented with perfuma um so we are
the official distributor for North
America for service and customer issues
like that that would be handled directly
with perfuma um yes you could go to us
and we'll make an introduction we're not
just to ignore you or anything um but
they are the ones to go to is it
possible to accept Apple pay and Google
pay uh
yes it is it integrates with n that's
like a a big fancy payment processor
that most have never heard of because
they're not consumer facing um but if it
integrates with Nix it integrates with
you and that includes Google and Apple
pay can you fit 3.4 ounce bottles um I'm
not sure I'll send that out afterwards
it's a machine made to be built in a
wall or they're standardized to be built

[21:02]
wall or they're standardized to be built
uh to be wall mounted um they can be
Standalone but most of them are wall
mounted and that's how they're they're
built credit card processing fee is
around 3% give or take um I can send out
the exact one after what share of
profits are business typically taking
for allowing the machine so 10 to 20% um
I'll try to get some more hard data on
that are there any ongoing fees or costs
from performatic um no no
um has performatic any specified
statistics on how well the product works
on various countries like Greece um I
know there's already an official um
partner and distributor in Greece um
they may have some statistics there um
but I'm not sure I'll try to get that to
you as well what does the process look
like of getting it placed into business
are there any ongoing cost from machine
how often is a person typically going to
replace it um so the machine lasts for
many years the warranty lasts for two or
100,000 sprays um they've been

[22:02]
100,000 sprays um they've been
manufacturing these um for 10 years um
they've been in business for 10 years
they've been manufacturing this
particular model for five years um
basically since Co started so we know
they last for five years they're still
doing really well um but yeah we don't
really know how long they'll last past
five but they're built very high quality
they're not built in China they're built
in Spain um with high craftsmanship
uh do we get to choose the card
processor for the card um terminal I
don't believe so it's all done through
NX but it also depends on the country
and I'm also not
100% so Dallas is not saturated there
are none in Dallas Fort Worth so we
don't operate these machines ourselves
we are distributor for
them okay can you confirm this is not a
vend machine telecommunic device no it
is it is a perfume V and cologne vending

[23:01]
is it is a perfume V and cologne vending
machine but it is often classified as a
telecommunication device based on the
country that they are being imported
into because of the fact that it has a
SIM card which means that you're subject
to different vat uh and different taxes
and different customs duties
um is there an option to be the sole
partner in the country for a given
period I believe so uh if you could
email me Chrisco founders.com I can make
the introduction how would you research
a great location Eric I think you do
that a lot very similarly to how you'd
uh research any retail physical location
uh it's kind of annoying it takes a
while it's tedious um but it works
really well and that's you spend all day
there and you count the people going in
and out for instance if I wanted to open
now Chipotle doesn't franchise but
pretend with me that they did uh if I
wanted to open Chipotle and I wanted to
know is there enough demand here then I
would go to the next closest and I would
literally sit in the parking lot and
this sounds crazy crazy but people do
this this is a common practice or

[24:01]
this this is a common practice or
sitting in an intersection and Counting
Cars I would sit in the parking lot and
I would count the people coming in and
out um and I would see what that's like
and then I would take an average order
value I'd make an assumption there and
say all right you know most people are
by themselves they're probably spending
$12 um and then I would use that math to
figure out if if my location might be
able to support um as many customers as
the other location is getting or more um
so you can often look at traffic counts
if you're in the US you can go to the
Department of Transportation website um
you can just start talking to people you
can stand outside the business and say
hey this is very random but if there was
a perfumer cologne machine sitting right
here and it cost a dollar and you were
headed into the movies or heading out of
the gym um would you use it would you
pay a dollar for it and honestly like I
would stand in the parking lot of a gym
all day and ask every single person that
and if it's a woman I would say the word
perfume and if it's a man I would say
the word cologne and I would have a
spreadsheet on my phone and I would just

[25:00]
spreadsheet on my phone and I would just
take a record of that now that data
isn't perfectly accurate because the
amount of people that tell you yes I
would buy that vers them actually doing
it is you're going to have to apply a
discount to it it it's not always one
for one but it will give you a really
really good idea of a the volume the
traffic volume of that particular gym
maybe you don't maybe you learn you
don't even want to put the machine there
because 70% of people would have to to
buy a spray in order for you to make
money um maybe you learn there ton of
traffic way more than you thought and
maybe you learn that no one would do it
and that's probably going to tell you
you're probably going to be able to take
that data and use it for the gym across
town right so I would go to a $10 a
month plan of Fitness I would go to a
$300 a month Lifetime Fitness I would do
the same research compare notes and then
use that data and extrapolate it against
the whole maybe it's Dallas for worth
and say okay someone in this part of
Dallas is probably someone a lot like
someone in that part of Dallas I could
use this data everywhere and I'm going
into all the plan of fitnesses or all
the equinoxes or whatever you learn um

[26:02]
the equinoxes or whatever you learn um
but the great news is is you can do that
research today before you spend a dollar
um and it's kind of fun to be honest
that's my favorite part of business is
doing that research
so shipping to the Netherlands I don't
have that information um I'm not sure
but just based on having a history in
logistics and distribution um I would
think it's anywhere from uh it depends
if you do air or boat um but on the low
end $150 to
$250
um it depending on the quantity as well
I'm I'm saying if you're only ordering
one and on the higher end $600 $700
somewhere in there um but if I'm
completely wrong I'll send a retraction
um
afterwards yes I will send a link to
this to this
recording all right I covered that can
the SIM card be changed to my own for
the data connection about the payment

[27:00]
system um I'm not sure about that but I
I do know that the the credit card
deposits can be deposited to any bank
account that you have or would
prefer what are the most wear and tear
parts that I have to do maintenance on
um the machine it's usually on the spray
nozzles
um there's another one I can't remember
the name of
it I can't remember but I'll send that
any
maintenance cost of the machine 3,000
give or take depending on options in
quantity what would you charge a country
club so I if it's uh like a very
specific question I'm going to pass over
that because I've talked about a lot of
this stuff and I want to be respectful
of everyone's time um and I will send
the
recording per performatic makes this
in-house um they manufactured these
themselves in

[28:01]
themselves in
Spain we're taking orders immediately um
starting
today does it have a battery power
storage in case of yes there is a backup
battery in case of
outages little refill
bottles yes you can keep stock of them
so you you're able to refill them more
quickly of the perfume bottles
you make contracts with only
person is there a step on the pedestal
for shorter people um I don't think so
I'm
sorry um so all of the international
questions please email me Chrisco
founders.com because we do have a
solution for you I want to introduce you
to perfuma to the person in your region
um Chris C H RIS I'll put it here in the

[29:01]
um Chris C H RIS I'll put it here in the
chat if you've these emails you've been
receiving from me that's from Chris at
Co founders.com
um I don't know why hold
on it's not letting me send a chat uh so
M Matt if you could do that for me Chris
at co-founders docomo dasc Fu n d rs.com
if you're anywhere outside of Mexico
Canada or the United States of America
email me and I will make a direct
introduction if you want to talk about
exclusive distribution rights or
connecting with them um but in North
America specifically you can email me
and we will help you uh
directly uh does perfume life deg grade
after certain days inside the machine no
um it would have to be many years of
sitting that inside the machine to
degrade uh if you have to pay 70% in
advance to buy the machine how can we
ensure our money security can we pay
that amount through a credit card great

[30:00]
that amount through a credit card great
uh question yes you can pay it through a
credit card and I understand I
completely understand where you're
coming from and you're also welcome to
reach out and like validate us
performatic is in this webinar but say
hey like is this guy is this a scammer
do you know this guy is is he just
selling your stuff without authorization
we are authorized to sell for them in
North America uh and you're welcome to
ask them that your
yourself um so we do have a relationship
with a a wholesale perfume and cologne
distributor in Switzerland um that sells
uh the actual liquid at a discount that
you would have access to by buying a
machine you are able great question
about the prices so um one thing that
we've shown in our research is high-end
clubs um they demand more high-end
perfumes Tom Fords and you can charge
more for it up to 250 per spray uh
mid-range clubs mid-range perfumes and
you usually charge between one and a150
for those but you are able to change the
price to whatever you

[31:05]
want how many sprays per bottle um yeah
so it's I covered that in the
beginning cost per month of the actual
perfumes so the the cost of the perfumes
is generally four
to8 4 to 7% of what you're charging of
course that would be cut in half if
you're charging $2 as opposed to one but
at a $1 price point the cost of the
actual perfume perfume is a single digit
percentage it's it's very very
dominal
um yes I will send a copy of the
recording so if a customer wanted to buy
perfume through the vending machine do I
have to have my own system of shipping
it to them um this is one thing I talked
about in my video you can you could
start an e-commerce website and try to
Source the perfumes and but I would not
recommend that because the volume of

[32:00]
recommend that because the volume of
people that elect to buy a whole bottle
after buying a spray is small it's it's
a numbers game right um so with that in
mind it's not worth building out a whole
infrastructure and website and
distribution system for that small
amount of people that want a whole
bottle um you just need to find an
existing website that is already doing
that and say hey do you have any
affiliate links uh where you can cut me
10 to 20% of the sale for all the
traffic I sent you and you take that
affiliate link you convert it into a q
QR code you put the QR code right under
the picture of the bottle and say buy a
whole bottle here you can even do that
on Amazon um here in North America you
you can apply to become an amaz Amazon
affiliate very simple and
straightforward and that would work
really well it's a smaller percentage
it's more like four or five percent but
people you know when they scan the QR
code and they see Amazon pop up they
trust it or and so your conversion rate
is going to be higher than if some
random perfume or cologne website pops
up uh uh uh from the limited

[33:00]
up uh uh uh from the limited
data funny you ask about one spray so in
certain countries a lot of people do two
three four five sprays um it depends on
the
culture the average is about 1.5 sprays
per person I would think in North
America um so North America is the
biggest market for perfume in Cologne on
dollars sold basis it doesn't mean it's
the biggest as big of our uh culture as
it is in European or middle eastern
companies or countries but it is the
biggest market for perfuming cologne um
that said I I would not think that um
Americans are getting three to five
sprays uh per use like you see in
Kazakhstan for
example maybe it's AER Bajan I can't
remember uh
um wholesale bottles
so we take payments to purchase the

[34:00]
so we take payments to purchase the
machines um just we'll send an invoice
to you and you're welcome to set up a uh
sales call I emailed everyone a link
everyone that's in here should have a
link to our calendar and so if you want
more information you want to talk to us
one-onone you can book a call there for
next week um but we'll just send an
invoice you can pay via wire credit card
U or
anything can you pick them up in person
uh yes with advanced notice if you're in
Spain
and yes I will send a
recording there's no deadline to have
the machine up and running after you buy
it it's up to you it's in your hands at
that point there's no you don't pay a
percentage of sales there's no there's
no obligation to ever place it that's
all in your
hands I don't have data on the specific
fragrances used but if I can get it I
will send
it um
okay thank you for posting that comment

[35:02]
the analytics are via um it's a web app
so you can pull it up on your phone
through a web app 70% in advance pay
required correct full amount correct 70%
in advance and 30% upon delivery or
right before
delivery um Ashley I'll try to get the
data on like which perfumes perform
best delivery time is is about 60 days
um it you could pay more like 60 days
from to for it to be manufactured um
once it's actually shipped typically a
week um if you're going from Spain to
the US to New York it would be via
air um if you want to ask about
Partnerships or anything like that or
other countries email me once again and
I'll make a direct introduction to the
person that you need to talk to uh Chris
coof founders.com
um and that's including within North

[36:03]
America um you you are able to use your
own um suppliers like if you're in a
pinch and you need to refill it and you
didn't have any wholesale on hand you
are able to do that uh it's it's just
going to be at a higher
price can the machine be set up for uh
multiple sprays with one purchase I'm
not sure on that but I will find out
there is no fee for the the um data
product for the
software multiple prices on one machine
depending on the perfume let's say I
have one expensive perfume and I want to
CH charge a premium price for that one
yes you can charge different prices
based on the perfume great
question
um all right you don't need Wi-Fi at the
location um not four months for making
and shipping um two months it's yeah

[37:02]
and shipping um two months it's yeah
shipping does not take that long the 60
days is for manufacturing and then it
will be shipped right thereafter and you
it would not take too long to receive
um I uh Cantor if if you could uh email
me about that I can make an introduction
I don't see any more questions um so if
you have any more you can email me
