[00:00]
Do you think it's possible if someone
were to go all in on this? Everything,
go all out, this could be a
million-dollar business.
&gt;&gt; Uh, yeah, very easily. One of the
grounds guys that we were speaking with,
he does a million and a quarter just in
Christmas lights.
&gt;&gt; What would you charge for a house like
this?
&gt;&gt; An average home of this size is $1,500
to $2,000.
&gt;&gt; If you could like wave a magic wand,
would you prefer to go all in on
Christmas lights or lawns?
&gt;&gt; Prefer to go all in on Christmas lights.
&gt;&gt; So, a commercial customer can be worth
100 times more than a home like this?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What I'd recommend is just try it.
Worst you could do is have a ladder that
you get to keep for your house. Now,
it's much simpler than you might think.
What's not to love about the Christmas
light business? Make $1,000 in an hour.
Never quit your full-time job. Do it
yourself or hire a part-time guy. Today,
we're diving deep on everything
Christmas lights business. How to find
customers, how to make money, how to
install the lights, how to price it.
Let's get going.
So, you picked this as a franchise. You
like the seasonality of it. You don't
have to go all in on just cutting lawns.
You can do other things. What are the
margins on a mow like this?
&gt;&gt; Margins for mowing is 10 to 15%.
Particularly commercial. slower because
the the competition is much higher. Um

[01:00]
the the competition is much higher. Um
as opposed to holiday lights, it's a
significant risk climbing 20 30 ft in
the air being on
&gt;&gt; that's what you're charging for
&gt;&gt; the liability.
&gt;&gt; Yep. And then also not only that, but
like if you have a bulb go out, you
don't want to go pull up a ladder to
replace that one bulb. So we come and do
we, you know, as part of the services,
we're coming and replacing those. So the
margins on holiday lighting, it
increases each year because the first
year you have to pay for the material.
So it'll be much lower, 20% 25%. And
then if you have the same customer
year-over-year, you can be increasing
that margin up to 50 and 60%. And I
would think that people don't start
shopping around for a different provider
every October. They're just going to
call you, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. As long as we did a good job, as
long as anytime they called, we came and
service them if there was issues and
then, you know, we take them down. We
just have to schedule with the customer
for install and take down. We give them
a week time span as far as install. Same
thing as as take down because we'll
route our areas so that we can take down
multiple, you know, multiple homes in
the same area.
&gt;&gt; So, as long as you did a good job and,
you know, I think communication is
probably the biggest thing. whenever
they call you, they get a hold of you,
then there's really no reason to reshop
it because next year, you know, they
might end up paying a little bit less
too. We give a discount, you know, 2
years, 3 years in.

[02:00]
years, 3 years in.
&gt;&gt; Y,
&gt;&gt; but even with those discounts, we still
have the margins still increased because
you don't have to pay for material.
You've already got them cut. The time is
less to install on the second, third
year.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Cuz you're not recutting them. You've
already got them set to the house. So,
the install time is less.
&gt;&gt; Have you started your marketing efforts
yet? Yeah,
&gt;&gt; we have a little bit. And we also uh
we've we've kind of combined efforts
with the grounds guys at Grapevine. So,
they had a couple customers that were
taking over for them. And so they have a
big commercial customer around 40 to
50,000 that will worth the revenue that
we'll put in for that customer as well
as
&gt;&gt; that's amazing.
&gt;&gt; We have a handful of we have quite a few
leads that we're marketing to our own
internal CRM system. So we'll be doing a
bunch of that this this year for that.
&gt;&gt; So a commercial customer can be worth a
hundred times more than a home like
this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's talk about the two different
models you have. So of installing
lights. So on on one hand you cut them
to size and they use them every year.
And then what was the other model or is
that the only
&gt;&gt; that's that's really the only
professionally installed way to do it.
Um, but we lease the lights versus the
customer can own the lights.
&gt;&gt; So, a lot of companies, other, you know,
competitors will do it where they'll
sell the lights to the customer. They'll
cut them to fit their home and if for
some reason the customer says, "I don't
want you back next year," they get to
keep the lights but that are already fit
to their home.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; We cut the lights and we keep the lights

[03:00]
&gt;&gt; We cut the lights and we keep the lights
and we're essentially leasing them to
them. Um, where we fit in the home, we
store them.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So, they don't have to deal with pulling
them in out, you know, in and out of the
attic every year.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Um, we'll bring them to the customer's
job site whenever it's time to install,
we install them. And then same thing,
when it's time to take down, we pull
them all down and we haul them off.
Okay. They don't have to worry about how
install them to store them properly. We
keep them indoors. That way they're not
dealing with, you know, getting hot and
cold or
&gt;&gt; under the in the weather or whatnot. But
yeah, those are kind of the two main
ones is either lease or let the customer
own them.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Just the difference in pricing on how
you do that.
&gt;&gt; So for a house like this, this is like a
3 to 4,000t house, I imagine, twotory,
threecar garage. What would you charge
uh for a house like this?
&gt;&gt; An average home of this size is $1,500
to $2,000 for an install. And it's by
the linear foot. So most of the time
what we'll do when we meet with
customers, we'll just we'll come we
measure everything from the ground.
We'll measure all the roof lines. Mostly
the roof line is what customers want.
Often times they'll do other stuff, but
roof line is kind of the number one
service.
&gt;&gt; And how are you measuring those?
&gt;&gt; We use a measuring wheel. So we'll just
basically walk it off from here. As far
as the pitches, you know, you just have
to walk the distance from the side to
the center and then, you know, there's a
little bit of math involved doing the
the pitches, but it's not really that
difficult. Measure everything from the

[04:00]
difficult. Measure everything from the
ground. We get a total linear footage
and then we have a a linear foot price
of the customer for roof line install.
&gt;&gt; So 1,500 to 2,000 for the first year.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And then what would it be next
year?
&gt;&gt; And we'll discount 10% each year
&gt;&gt; until the third year and then it just
stays the same.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So they'll discount the second
first year or the second year is 10%,
third year is 10% and then it stays the
same if they were with us for 10 years,
you know.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And then you store the lights on
your property.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.
&gt;&gt; And that's the thing, too, is if a
customer was with us for 5 years, they
don't have to repay for material. We
might be repaying for material, you
know, year five or six when the product
starts breaking down or bulbs are
burning out, but we're the one replacing
it. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So they don't have to worry about that
price really changing because it stays
the same three as long as they're with
us. Really?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Which model do you prefer?
&gt;&gt; We like the leasing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. because we can essentially reuse
material if someone doesn't want us to
come back. So, we have the material
already and that way we're kind of keeps
cost down on material.
&gt;&gt; So, for a job like this, let's say it's
1,500, what would be your profit margin
on year 1 versus year three?
&gt;&gt; Year one will probably be in the 20%
range cuz you're paying for that
material for the first year and then
year three uh will be around 50 to 60%.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Wow, that's awesome. And then
that's with you installing it yourself

[05:01]
that's with you installing it yourself
or your employees installing?
&gt;&gt; Employees installing.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, if you were to do it yourself,
the margins even
&gt;&gt; would be even higher. Yeah. you're doing
it all yourself. Again, depending on if
you have a full-time business doing it
and you're paying for insurance and all
that, which I wouldn't recommend a
customer ever really hire someone to get
on their roof without insurance, but
happens all the time. So,
&gt;&gt; what is your insurance costs run?
&gt;&gt; With all of our insurance, which
includes auto insurance and everything,
we're paying about $12,000 a year for
our vehicles, for our general liability,
workers comp.
&gt;&gt; It's not as bad as I thought, honestly.
1,000 bucks a month. I wonder what it
would be if you didn't do Christmas
lights at all.
&gt;&gt; It would drop.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; cuz they they rate this as a higher risk
activity. So, we pay for that. Same
thing with we we do uh ice melt, which
is technically snow plowing is the way
they categorize it. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Which there's no snow plowing here in
our in our market, but we do ice melt
and they charge us for that as well
because it's a higher risk activity.
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. I've never really said this
out loud before, but my mission with
this channel is to inspire 1 million
entrepreneurs to start or grow their
business. So, if you've been inspired by
this, please just say thanks by hitting
subscribe and it would mean the world to
me. Do you guys do anything with regards
to marketing and like yard signs or

[06:01]
to marketing and like yard signs or
knocking doors or like talking to the
neighbors? How does that go?
&gt;&gt; We do door hangers. We've done a lot of
yard signs. However, this year or Texas
has passed something where yard signs
are now technically illegals. Um, but we
do door hangers and again Facebook posts
or Facebook we'll do our own posts, you
know, before and afters as well as the
Facebook marketing. That's kind of the
main lead generation for our audio
lighting.
&gt;&gt; And do those work pretty well like the
non-digital methods?
&gt;&gt; Uh, yeah. Yard signs. I mean, I had a
another neighborly brand. I kind of was
following him, what he was doing. He he
would put out 80 yard signs a month.
Sometimes he gets calls and people
complain about it, but I still brought
in the gener generated the lead. So, it
was worth, you know, worth the risk, I
guess. At that point,
&gt;&gt; when you're putting out door hangers,
who does it? Do you hire a company to do
it? Do you do it?
&gt;&gt; It'll be our crews. So, a lot of times
when we do one home like this, we'll we
call it box nine. So, we'll do the two
homes on each side, two homes on that
side, and the five homes opposite side
of the street. That way, all the, you
know, when we're here installing, if
customers or neighbors see us, we'll go
put a door hanger on. That's, you know,
two touch points. one they saw us and
two they got a touch point from the door
hanger.
&gt;&gt; So that's like when customers start to
think in that direction. But

[07:00]
think in that direction. But
strategically when do you first start
marketing for Christmas lights and or
installing for Christmas lights?
&gt;&gt; That would be July. So you do a
Christmas and July campaign to say you
know we install lights. Get on the
schedule early. Essentially you can
offer discounts for getting on earlier
especially when the route when your
route fills up a lot. So the earlier you
get on you get discounts because if
everyone's stacking into November then
you just don't have time to install for
everyone. So July Christmas July
Christmas and July is kind of the time
frame. Okay.
&gt;&gt; When to start it and then again you'll
start again end of September, early
October for the actual marketing of this
time of year.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And then when do you start taking
down? 27th, 26th.
&gt;&gt; We'll start uh after New Year's. So
it'll be the week after because
typically a lot of people are out of
town still. A lot of people on vacation.
So we wait a full week into January and
then the first so basically second week
of of January will start taking down.
&gt;&gt; Do you do any permanent lighting?
&gt;&gt; We don't.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; We are going to we're planning to get
into it. We just haven't got to that
point yet. I have a friend that that has
a Christmas light business in
Pennsylvania and he says he hates
permanent lighting because it's one
time.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Uh he says he only does it when people
insist on it because at least he gets
something out of that customer. Yeah.

[08:00]
something out of that customer. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But he would much prefer to come back
every year.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
&gt;&gt; I mean for the install it's it's two to
three times the amount. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So if you're getting permanent lighting,
you you'll expect to pay three times the
amount you would for this isn't
permanent lighting, but it permanent on
there for the season.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But two to three times more if you're
installing permanent lighting.
&gt;&gt; Well, why don't we get into the
specifics of this job?
&gt;&gt; Okay. This is our our socket wire. These
come to you you can you order them in
bulk rolls. So thousand foot, 5,000 or
500 foot, whatever the bulk roll you
get. Um and so this is where we'll cut
the lights to fit. You put in the
fittings everywhere you want. And so you
can just cut anything in any length. And
we've got what we call zip cord, which
is how you get from different areas if
you're going from a peak to an area
where you don't want bulbs to be
hanging, you know, where they shouldn't
be. Uh-huh.
&gt;&gt; That's one of the differences between
doing yourself and having a professional
do it is you don't have bulbs hanging
from, you know, this peak here down to
that peak there where it would look odd.
&gt;&gt; You can use zip wire, try and hide it,
and you can cut it to whatever length
you want. So, when we do a customer's
home like this, we'll basically just
have that 500T roll down here. We'll
pull it out, we'll be hanging it, and
then we'll cut it to fit where where it
needs to, and then we use different
fittings. So, whether it's a male or
female fitting, pretty much exact same
fitting. One's a male, female, and you

[09:01]
fitting. One's a male, female, and you
just have a different slide on the back.
&gt;&gt; Would you be able to show us like what
that process looks like to cut and
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, we've got some extra cord. I
use a male fitting here. You just got
the actual piece here. It's got prongs
inside of there that'll just it'll
puncture the wire and then a slide that
goes on the back. Cut the wire to
whatever length you're doing it at. And
you'll separate the two wires cuz this
is just a two- wire system. Slides on in
there. So, it hasn't punctured the wire
yet. And that's what the purpose of the
slide on the back is. You got to you got
a directional slide.
&gt;&gt; Pushes it in and that punctures it.
&gt;&gt; As soon as you put the slide on, it's
now puncturing the wires. And so, that'd
be a that'd be a ready fitting.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; So, if it's easy to cut it, uh, then you
know, heaven forbid this customer
cancels next year. you have custom fit
lights, but it's not that big of a deal
to recustomize it to the next house,
&gt;&gt; right? So, like in this in this here
right here, we've got a, you know, 40
foot length of wire. So, if we were on a
customer's house or we need a 30 foot
length, we can cut that 30 foot and we
have 10t of waste.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That might be not be able to be reused.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Same thing all the bulbs. All the bulbs
you can pull out and put in a in storage
and when we need them, we'll put them
back in.
&gt;&gt; How long do the bulbs typically last?
&gt;&gt; So, these ones, they'll last 5, six
years where you really have to do
anything. Sometimes you'll have
defaulted bulbs. Really in this case,

[10:00]
defaulted bulbs. Really in this case,
you can send them back and say, you
know, we ordered 5,000 this year and a
100 of them were bad. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; From the start, they'll replace those.
But five to six years generally,
&gt;&gt; okay,
&gt;&gt; before it starts breaking down so much.
The longer you leave them up, too, the
more
&gt;&gt; you know, they degrade from the sun,
especially here in Texas.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, you you get to a job
site. What's the first thing you do?
&gt;&gt; Well, we've already got the
measurements, so we already have all
that. We'll have pre-bulbed wire. So, in
the shop, that way we're not doing it on
the customer's property. We'll bulb, you
know, 500 ft or however many whatever
length we need to in the shop. So,
there's less of that here. We'll have
that all wheeled upon the spool and then
we'll have one person that climbs the
ladder that's kind of fitting
everything, person on the ground that's
holding ladders, giving material, things
like that. But that spool will just be
on the ground and you'll basically pull
you'll have it hanging in the air as you
go up and
&gt;&gt; you know, you'll have we'll have it
pre-cliped as well so that we can make
it faster. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; we want to be on the job site the least
amount of time, do all the easy stuff
from the ground and in the shop. So,
we'll have that big spool here and we'll
just start pulling up the ladder. We'll
have someone down on the bottom that
feed material and then as you go, you
just fit it up as each clip goes on.
Then you'll cut it at the exact length
once you get where you need it. So, for
a $1,500 house like this, how much in
wire are you spending?

[11:00]
wire are you spending?
&gt;&gt; Let's see. Well, we buy all the material
early on in the year and then they ship
it around September time frame cuz it's
coming out of Utah. You can buy them
from local local stores. There's local
stores here we can pick it up. They're
just different bulbs. But for the cost
of material, I'm not actually sure on
the on that because there's cost per
bulb, there's cost per linear foot of
wire, but for $1,500, it might be $200
worth of material. Most of it's going to
be the labor that first year. You have a
lot of time spent cutting, fitting, so a
lot of it goes to labor. That's why the
significant cost is in the labor. You
know, the time you do it the second year
is significantly lower because you're
not cutting the fit. All you're doing is
hanging and plugging in.
&gt;&gt; Well, I also think like one of your
biggest competitors is the fact that
people move, right? They they leave you
because they move. But if you already
have everything custom fit, you knock on
the door of the new homeowner and say,
"Hey, you're probably going to get
Christmas lights. I already have your
lights. They're fit just to you, so I
can give you a good deal or whatever."
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could. We haven't tried that
yet. We do have a customer like and he
had a pretty significant amount of
lights, so we have an entire bin full of
them for that customer. But we could go
knock on the door and say, "Hey, he
moved. Do you still want lights? You've
already got them cut to your house."
&gt;&gt; It's it's a pretty compelling offer,
right?
&gt;&gt; And you could even you could discount
that more than you would a first year
person normally because you've already
paid for that material for the last, you

[12:01]
paid for that material for the last, you
know, the previous customer, previous
home owner. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What type of material you can do. You
can get all different types of colors
and they, you know, in this particular
case, we have something called Lightream
where you can change the color yourself
if you want.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, that's an offering you can ask to,
you can offer to the customer. If they
if they don't know what they want, you
tell them, you know, here's the colors
we have. And then, let's say you put it
up that first year and they it was
great, but I wish I would have chose a
different color. You can change out the
colors.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And uh
&gt;&gt; easily.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So before you know when we
pre-bulb the lights before we come back
to your house again the next year, we're
going to pull all those lights out and
if you want to change color, we'll
change all the colors from warm white to
green and red or whatever it might be.
Um
&gt;&gt; is there a price difference that you
charge?
&gt;&gt; Uh we don't. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Just because we already have material
anyways and we're the only added time is
de you know unboling debulbing or
whatever and then reboling all the wire
again. So we don't charge it but you
could and it would very easily be
something that they would probably
willing to pay for.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. For safety equipment, these boots
are something we use. We use a handful
of things. We have a these boots called
Cougar Paws. They have a felt mat on the
bottom so it gives a better grip on the
roof. We have a pitch wedge, which is a
very similar thing. Just has a felt mat
that you can stand on. It makes a a

[13:00]
that you can stand on. It makes a a
level platform.
&gt;&gt; Do you have any minimums on a job? Like
what's the least amount you'd charge on
a small house?
&gt;&gt; Yes, we do. We our typically about $800
is a minimum
&gt;&gt; and those generally are for single level
homes where it might be 150 to 200
linear feet worth of wire. The other
thing you're trying to do with with
bulbing is you want to end on corners.
You want to, you know, end on peaks. So,
I wouldn't want to end back here. It
just looks better when you're able to
end.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You know, here's the replacement duck
bill clips.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So, that's a duck bill clip there that
comes on the socket wire, but if you had
if you needed a replacement one, so I'll
replace those three up there that have
broken duck bill clips.
&gt;&gt; Do these have to be twoman jobs or can
you do them by yourself?
&gt;&gt; You could, but the the most difficult
part is getting the ladders up that
high. So, trying to move this type of
ladder by yourself is is fairly
difficult.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. and it gives risk of, you know,
damaging customers property.
&gt;&gt; If it's a singlestory property, will you
send one guy?
&gt;&gt; We we don't usually just because there's
always kind of someone on the ground
that can provide material. So, two would
be the minimum. You could have three on
a bigger house
&gt;&gt; cuz you could have someone, you know,
two people installing on the house and
you can have one guy installing around
beds around driveways cuz we do, you
know, lights with stakes. So, you can do
all that type of stuff from the ground

[14:00]
all that type of stuff from the ground
with one person.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Or trees. You can do trees by yourself.
&gt;&gt; Do you do a lot of trees?
&gt;&gt; Trees are uh fairly expensive. So, not a
lot of people want them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Um because the labor
&gt;&gt; kind of tedious.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The labor involved is just as much
installing versus as taking down. So, if
you're doing trees, they're pretty
significant cost and it takes a lot of
light. So, we have many lights that will
wrap around trees, but we do them, just
not as many. Most people want the roof
lineage. That's the most bang for your
buck.
&gt;&gt; If you're more of a doer and less of
just a watcher, then you need to join us
at tkowners.com. It's my private
community where me and 500 other
entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs are
actively building, starting, and or
growing businesses. You will not regret
it. tkowners.com. So, what are your
go-to uh tools in your tool belt here?
Really all you need is just a set of
wire wire clippers. In colder climates,
it's a little harder because it's much
colder. So, here it's not so bad really
where your hands aren't so cold and hard
to do fine work with them because you're
trying to peel wires and stuff them in
the little fittings. Um, but really this
is all you need.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; As far as that. And then zip ties are
another one. Sometimes zip tie certain
areas. But when you use zip ties, when
you're installing the lights, you're
trying to install to where it's as easy

[15:00]
trying to install to where it's as easy
as possible tear down. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, typically when we're tearing down
lights, we're not even bringing ladders.
We don't need them.
&gt;&gt; Wow. You just
&gt;&gt; We're using a Yeah. a a painters pole.
And so in this, you know, in this case,
we'll reach up and pull that and that
that painters pole can get most of that.
So you don't want to you want to install
it in such a way that you can tear down
easily cuz your time tearing down is
significantly lower. 10 5 to 10 minutes
to tear.
&gt;&gt; Well, every minute you spend on this
thing, your risk increases, right?
&gt;&gt; Not too
&gt;&gt; risk of death.
&gt;&gt; And then, you know, putting up a 30ft
ladder, it takes two people.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So there's risk of breaking windows,
things like that if you're not if you're
not paying attention, being careful.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So we're always in our minds and when
we're installing, we're trying to figure
out how do we make this easy to tear
down.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then same thing when you tear
down, we're trying to keep as many of
the strands together as possible. We'll
label the strands so that strand one
goes to this peak, strand two goes that
peak type of thing. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Same thing there is we're pulling them
down, trying to keep them together as
much as possible to where when we
reinstall the following year makes it
easiest.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Least amount of labor to do that.
&gt;&gt; Assuming you have everything prepped
beforehand, as you should, how many
minutes will you spend on a job like
this to set up and take down?

[16:00]
this to set up and take down?
&gt;&gt; There'll be a little bit of setup time
in the in the shop. So maybe half an
hour to an hour of setup time,
especially if you're changing the bulbs.
And then the install for a house about
this size, uh, an hour to an hour and a
half.
&gt;&gt; And then take down.
&gt;&gt; Take down will be 10 minutes.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; Because all you're doing is you're reach
up there and pulling it. And then you're
you're labeling the wires, labeling or
the strands you put down. And then we
have a drawing which
&gt;&gt; you don't have to be all that
sophisticated,
&gt;&gt; but as long as you can read just a
sketch. I mean, that's all I really do.
We label the wire runs and each, you
know, each one we on the wires we label
what we do is we'll label we'll label
the peak light. So, in this particular
run, I've got a red zip tie that
indicates that's where I want that to be
on a peak because we always want a bulb
on a peak.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Interesting. It just goes to show,
I mean, 10 minutes to take down, 30 to
60 minutes to set up, 30 minutes in the
shop. Goes to show how important your
route density is, right? Because you
could easily spend more time driving
than you spend on the entire job site.
Right. Right.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; So, if your route density is good, your
margins are a lot higher.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Or you're able to charge less.
&gt;&gt; And then the more you make sure you're
doing on the ground, less call backs or

[17:01]
doing on the ground, less call backs or
less service calls. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, service calls, if you have to come
out and replace a bulb, you have to put
up this ladder for one bulb. So,
ideally, you're trying to minimize the
amount of of service calls. That's why
you want to make sure everything's good
on the ground first. Stuff happens.
We've had squirrels chew the wire.
Nothing we can do about that, but we
have we go and repair it. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But sometimes we'll just burn out or
sometimes heavy winds might pull some
clips off, so we'll go replace those.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And do you set them up with
timers?
&gt;&gt; Yep. So, we have a timer. I think it's
in the bucket
&gt;&gt; and that's included in the price.
&gt;&gt; Yes. So, we'll just set the timer to
whatever the customer wants. In this
case, you know, you got different hour
settings where you just don't do dawn to
dust. That way, the customer never has
to really deal with it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; The other thing I would recommend is not
installing this up high in the air where
you have to get to it with a ladder.
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Because if you have to adjust something,
now you have to get a ladder for
adjusting that. Using your uh timers
somewhere where they're still hidden but
accessible. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And one of the things we're doing when
we're installing is we're trying to hide
as much as we can. We don't want wires
hanging. Yep.
&gt;&gt; So, anywhere we can stuff them under
under ridges or uh whatever might be
behind gutters, a lot of times we're
trying to hide those wires so it looks
more professional, looks better. Well,
that's probably something that the cheap
guys don't care about, right?

[18:00]
guys don't care about, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You'll see if you if you look,
you'll find it where they have a bulb
hanging from another one. You've just
got dangling wires that aren't attached
to anything.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right, Jeremy, tell us who you are
and what you do.
&gt;&gt; I'm Jeremy. I'm the production manager
at Grounds Guys for Wesley.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And what is a production manager
do?
&gt;&gt; All right. So, I get to manage all the
crews and the uh the schedule. The main
thing is communication with the
customer. Um, that's what they like the
most and that's what we offer that most
don't. I'm available to them any time of
the day.
&gt;&gt; What do you love the most about this
job? Honestly, I I really like the
outdoors. Yeah, that's kind of why I
took the job in the first place. I
enjoyed uh being outdoors. All this is
kind of just fun to me almost. You know,
I actually enjoy being out here working.
So,
&gt;&gt; Yep. Do you have any horror stories from
being on the job doing Christmas lights
specifically?
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't say horror, but kind of.
Yeah. Cuz you know, if you have any kind
of fear of heights, which I'm not
terrible, but like I you get you get me
up high enough, you know. Um, but
there's some of them that are so slanted
and even with the safety equipment like
the boots and the, you know, the
triangle and then we have a bar that
goes over the peak so you can kind of
hold on. Even with that stuff, you still
kind of slide, you know, and so it's

[19:00]
kind of slide, you know, and so it's
kind of it's kind of spooky, but um, I
guess after a while you kind of get used
to it, but you also get that mindset of
we got to get this done, you know, so
you just get brave.
&gt;&gt; If someone's watching this and they're
thinking about starting a Christmas
light business, what advice would you
give them?
&gt;&gt; It's not difficult to figure out as far
as the wiring and all that stuff. Um, I
would say watch videos on safety. Um,
because that's the number one thing. I
mean, one, you don't want to get in
trouble, but two, you don't want to get
hurt. You know, it could be a serious
injury, you know, falling off of one of
these roofs, even a one story if you
land wrong. You um, so I would say
safety, you know, just focus on that at
first.
&gt;&gt; You'll get your own groove after a
while.
&gt;&gt; And what about how to talk to customers
or communication? Do you have any tips
for people about that?
&gt;&gt; Um, just be open, be willing to talk to
them. Uh, sometimes customers just want
more than just the information you're
giving them. They want um almost a
friend.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, you just you just talk to them as if
you're a friend, you know, and then um
they will be more open to you cuz that
way if cuz some sometimes customers if
they have a complaint, they almost don't
want to tell you cuz they feel like
you're just going to ignore them anyway.
But if you start off as a friend, you
know, they feel like they can tell you
about it and you'll you'll take care of

[20:00]
about it and you'll you'll take care of
it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And they'll be more likely to buy
stuff from you, too.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. I mean, I can't stress
communication enough. That's what
that'll that's what'll build any
business.
&gt;&gt; I used to tell my employees that
communication covers a multitude of
sins.
&gt;&gt; It does.
&gt;&gt; All right. If you screw something up and
you get ahead of it like proactively.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; A lot of times you can you can turn that
into a good experience where they buy
more stuff.
&gt;&gt; You can, you know, because like even
when the crews like let's say they run
into a mailbox, if they'll call and tell
me the moment they do it, I can call
that customer and head them off, you
know, and like, hey, we hit your mailbox
today. I will take care of this and then
they don't call me mad cuz they don't
have time to pester about it, you know?
&gt;&gt; So, it does help with communication.
&gt;&gt; So, if someone were watching this and
wanting to start a Christmas lights
business, what advice would you give
them? um hire someone to get on the
roof.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Because I've hired a few people that
they said they would and then come, you
know, when push comes to shove, they
don't want to be up there.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; You don't we don't always get on the
roof. We try to use lad as much as
possible. But that's
&gt;&gt; that's like the first question you ask
cuz it's really the negotiation.
&gt;&gt; I'm hiring landscapers. I'm asking them
that. Like I'm I'm hiring them to mow.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I'm telling them that in the fall we're
going to be doing holiday lights and do
the roof
&gt;&gt; because you just can't work around that,

[21:00]
&gt;&gt; because you just can't work around that,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; Um the other thing is I guess I would
probably recommend using Facebook as a
as a means of getting leads.
&gt;&gt; What about safety?
&gt;&gt; There's a few pieces of equipment I'd
recommend you get. You don't have to get
everything and you can generally try and
use the ladders as much as possible. And
you might even start on some of the
easier roofs. There's single story
houses that you can do that are much
easier to do. Easy to get your feet wet.
Um, but safety equipment, I would get
these boots. They're cougar paws. Pitch
wedge is another big one. Sits on the
roof and helps you sit on a on a level
platform as as you're standing on the
roof. Um, then 30 foot ladder. You're
going to have to have one of those
really.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And then I guess what I would recommend
is just try it. The worst you could do
is have a ladder that you get to keep
for your house now.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then you can, you know, start on
your own home, put the lights on your
own house. You'll get a feel for how it
goes. And it's it's much simpler than
you might think as far as how to fit
them together and how to, you know, do
it do it that way.
&gt;&gt; Can someone go to Home Depot and buy
lights or would you not recommend that?
&gt;&gt; Uh, you can get some of that, but
typically there's I wouldn't necessarily
recommend Home Depot because they're not
really made to fit to your house.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You can get 100 foot lengths or 50 foot
lengths or 25 foot lengths, but pretty
much anywhere you live there's probably
going to be some sort of supply store.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So, you know, where I live here, there's
somewhere I can go that's one mile away
to get that those supplies.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; But wherever you live, there's going to
be a supply store that's selling holiday

[22:00]
be a supply store that's selling holiday
lights.
&gt;&gt; All right. What are the startup costs
for this business? best to buy the stuff
you can in bulk because you know the
more you can get in bulk the cheaper
it's going to be per foot essentially.
So really it's just the materials that's
the materials if you've already got a
vehicle that can kind of haul the stuff
you need and the materials you can buy
them in bulk but it's you know maybe $2
$3,000 the first year we spent about
$4500 $5,000 on all the material that we
were kind of expecting to do about 15
homes. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So we bought that much material kind of
ahead of time. You don't have to buy
that much. You could just buy you know
one reel of this a couple boxes of the
lights fittings all that. So you might,
if you were just trying to get started,
you might only be $400 or $500 as far as
material and then a couple pieces of
equipment, safety equipment, ladders.
&gt;&gt; Do you think it's possible if someone
were to go all in on this, focus, do
paid ads, everything, go all out, this
could be a million-dollar business?
&gt;&gt; Uh, yeah, very easily
&gt;&gt; with good profit margins.
&gt;&gt; I was just on a call with with Grounds
guys, you know, talking to other other
grounds guys owners throughout the
nation. One of the grounds guys that we
were speaking with, he does a million
and a quarter.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Just in Christmas lights.
&gt;&gt; Just in Christmas lights year. He's
doing the landscape lighting.
&gt;&gt; How much commercial? He didn't say he
didn't have that breakdown. But a large
portion is going to be commercial and
then you know as far as as residential

[23:01]
then you know as far as as residential
customers, you know, you might have 200
to three 400 commercial customers if
you're doing a million plus.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Then the rest of that would be the the
commercial customers.
&gt;&gt; Any horror stories from this business?
&gt;&gt; Uh no no real horror stories yet. I
guess the worst that we've had, if you
want to call it, it's not a horror
story, but we just had uh some squirrels
that did some work on a customer's
property. So they said all the lights
weren't working. It only been maybe a
month they were up. So we go out there
and investigate it and find that the
squirrel squirrels had chewed through
four or five locations of it. So we went
and just snipped it and patched it up.
&gt;&gt; And that happened once out of 20 30
times.
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And what are your goals for this
business?
&gt;&gt; Our goals are like we really want to
increase this line as well as uh
landscape lighting. So two two lighting
areas that we want to increase in. Um
for holiday lighting, we'd like to do
half a million to a million a year
within the next two or three years. So
we're like I said, we're three years in.
So if we continue to double down on all
the holiday lighting and landscape
lighting, you know, between those two,
we'd like to be doing over a million a
year in in just the lighting. Yeah. All
right. Well, Wesley, thank you for your
time today.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
