[00:00]
will chat GPT use chat GPT oh it is
logging Airbnb listings that are
underpriced for me while I do five other
things at the same freaking time look at
all these tabs it is just going it took
the image and it put it in Google Images
whereas before it told me it can't do
that it's not allowed to do that and
then I said go to Google images and do
it it found emails it found an email for
me gosh oh my gosh it solved the capture
for me
okay so last week I paid for chat gpt's
new operator plan which is 200 bucks a
month I started tinkering around with it
I hit record I posted this video right
here and you guys loved it this was so
fun for me it was like seeing magic for
the first time but I'm a little greedy I
want more I want more out of operator so
I thought okay how far can I push this
can I have 10 operators running in 10
different tabs at the same time 20 five
I had to no so let's get to it so we've

[01:01]
I had to no so let's get to it so we've
got six tabs open all for operator six
different prompts I want to run all of
them at the same time and let's just see
what happens okay so start with number
one boom boom if I'm trending by
underprice items on offer up and
Craigslist to flip on Amazon or Ebay I
want to add more to
it all right so this is kind of weird
because it's asking it to do two
different things so we'll see how that
goes I like the idea of getting really
specific with a prompt and really broad
with a prompt because you learn
different things in both scenarios okay
next one pull product review data from
Amazon and scrape onestar complaints to
identify gaps for a private label
product okay I'm going to leave that
pretty broad track Google flights from
stake fairs these flights should
only leave from Dallas
Texas any date in 2025

[02:00]
all right so then fourth one is extract
email list Texas Chamber of Commerce
directories put them in a Google
sheet okay and then over
here I'm just going to do
Etsy okay analyze Airbnb listings in a
specific City yada yada yada in let's
say Minneapolis okay but you know what
we're doing six I kind of want to do 10
because it's double digits it's just a
better number and frankly it'll get more
clicks in the headline so let's do 10
let's go ahead and duplicate this all
right so what are we doing with these
four find an iPhone
15 on Facebook Marketplace that was just
listed today and significantly
underpriced but not stolen or broken I

[03:02]
underpriced but not stolen or broken I
wonder if it can use chat GPT for me
will chat GPT use chat GPT oh why have I
never thought of this okay I want you to
use chat GPT to make a business plan I
doubt this is going to work but we'll
see to launch uh tree trimming business
in Dallas Texas I own a tree trimming
business in Dallas Texas so we'll see
how accurate this is I want use chat to
make a business plan it must be very
tactical and specific and
Source case
studies of others who have done this
with success in the past in any
Market okay all right two more how about
this

[04:00]
this
I want you to comb my
inbox for a very long
email from
2007 that I sent someone that seems to
be very
meaningful okay we'll see you okay last
one I want you to find find viral
Instagram reals on my Instagram account
in the business Niche that have over
200k views and then book Mark three of
them and then be done okay so let's go
back here iPhone 15 Instagram real
business plan those are not in order but
all right we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
10 ideas 10 things to do at the same

[05:02]
10 ideas 10 things to do at the same
freaking time let's see shall we okay
I'm just going to go
boom boom imagine if you had a virtual
assistant in the Philippines using your
account paying them $6 an hour which is
about 10 times the local minimum wage in
the Philippines by the way just to
operate a bunch of operators at the same
time it's like a switchboard operator
back in the day go look it's already on
offer up okay
and you can look at the time stamp here
on loom to see because I am going to be
editing out pauses and such but that
that's going to keep me honest
okay oh my gosh okay it's just going
product in mind uh let's
see guitar
accessories okay boom boom boom okay
we're looking at flights oh my gosh oh
my gosh just looking up flights oh okay
it's looking up Texas Chamber of
Commerce directories oh we're on Etsy

[06:01]
Commerce directories oh we're on Etsy
over
here there's my
thumbnail by the way these three albums
in my background best albums ever made
okay it's on
Airbnb I'm just going to try this
again if you try to rate limit me then
override I need 10 operator tasks
[Music]
running and your oldest conversations
dang it all right we're going to do six
we're going to do six but then I'll do
the other four it's still looking oh my
gosh it is just going I said guitar
accessories okay it's flicking out on me
could you please complete it so I could
continue searching for mistake faes and
Flash I want to see if it can complete
it how about
this try
harder all right I got to take control

[07:00]
harder all right I got to take control
whatever this Feels So Meta to be using
an a bot to perform a capture
validation okay so now it's on skip
lagged I'm let it keep
running R
it dude it's just going it is just going
look at all the tabs it has open so we
have six tabs running operator each
operator has 10 tabs five tabs we're
talking dozens of tabs going at the same
time you can't tell me me this isn't
worth $200 a month I sound like such a
shill there's no affiliate program by
the way for open aai so I make Z if you
go and pay for this plan oh my gosh look
at
this oh look at that you can see
everything it's
doing you can give it feedback okay
let's say I like home decor it's just
going my
gosh holy
cow it's just it's still look look at
all the tabs it has open in Minneapolis

[08:02]
all the tabs it has open in Minneapolis
how does how is it
thinking tell me your
method for
finding Arbitrage
here oh my gosh it's just still going
this is
freaking
insane this one's like
broken okay guitar accessories didn't
work but guitars did are we still going
here it's still going so imagine waking
up with a to-do list all right I got to
book this flight I got to go book an
Airbnb you wake up you rub the sleep out
of your eyes you open up five operator
tabs type in five prompts or you know
what better yet you open up chat GPT you
type in one prompt for all five it gives
you five prompts that are more finely
tuned for operator I should have done
that and then you just let them run and
then you just get to freaking work keep
looking this is so it says they require
filling out forms y y

[09:04]
y
okay we're gonna get back to these four
because I really want to see it go
through my email by the way look how
much it's doing this is the hardest
working employee I have blank tab issue
that couldn't be closed and was unable
to proceed yes but remember everything
you've
seen that's really weird blank tab I
don't know if operator is going to be a
thing like I don't I know if this is
going to be a flagship product for open
aai but if it is it's pretty dang cool
being on the frontier of all this so
video is cool but you know what's better
long form audio via podcast and my
newsletter TKO pod.com go there to
subscribe for free to my newsletter it's
one email a week very tactical and then
go to my audio podcast three episodes a
week stuff like this you're going to
love it all free no sleazy sales
TKO
pod.com okay so we're we're good at Etsy
I mean honestly though if this is where

[10:01]
I mean honestly though if this is where
AI stopped and you just had to keep
fixing things as it broke in a zillion
different tabs it's not stopping there
in a month this is probably going to be
so much more seamless but even if that's
where it stopped it is shocking to me
how
much more efficient this is it's looking
at flights
$82 f is that Fort
Lauderdale log all of these in a Google
sheet okay okay we're going to
go operator test we're going to give it
edit
permissions okay which one was
it and then keep
searching it's just freaking
going log
everything
interesting you see
in a new tab that you create here I'm

[11:03]
in a new tab that you create here I'm
going to use the same sheet new tab boom
copy
that go over here it's telling me how it
finds
Arbitrage
perfect keep going then
log everything you interesting you see
okay boom opening a new tab for Google
Sheets log everything interesting you
see here in a new tab
look look at that all three of my
operators are in here the same time what
is this
world I got a new
tab oh my gosh this is so cool oh my
gosh and this this one's just wrong here
try again you have edit access oh my
gosh it's even naming the tabs
yes but what does the capture say I

[12:04]
yes but what does the capture say I
don't care that I spell capture wrong
get off my back guys come
on oh my gosh oh my gosh it solve the
capture for me like okay if you're
Technical and you're watching this
you're like actually that's not actually
that complicated because listen shut up
99.9% of people thinks this is cool
including my simple-minded self I
realize that it won't enter for me due
to some guard rail that open AI has put
on this surely it could if it wanted to
um but the fact that it just told me
what it is it can see captas better than
I can I can't even read these things
let's see It'll Ty it in for
me why can't
you all right we'll get back to
that okay I said try again you have edit
edit access let's look at the
history it works now it said it doesn't
work and I said yes it does and it just

[13:00]
work and I said yes it does and it just
tried
again holy crap okay what are we
doing policy restrictions okay of course
TR K
xxj okay that's going to keep going this
is still going let's go back to our
spreadsheet we got two tabs ooh okay we
should have more than two it is logging
Airbnb listings that are underpriced for
me while I do five other things at the
same freaking time okay okay we're back
to Craigslist I haven't even said told
it to do anything else here just the
original prompt so let's go back to this
one go back to
Craigslist okay underpriced
Vehicles they are cheap but how do you
know they're a good value
value compared to

[14:03]
value compared to
other similar makes and models and
mileage in those same
markets
okay it's like you're right I don't know
if these are a good value so I'm going
to find
out please log all of these in a Google
sheet
here as you
go okay boom boom boom you don't have to
sign in Amazon to see
reviews all
right what are we going to end up with
here look at all of this searching it's
doing holy crap okay we got three tabs
we got three it's naming them that is
very
helpful we're still looking in freaking

[15:00]
helpful we're still looking in freaking
Minneapolis look at all the tabs it has
open it's got more add than I
do defuser lamp with five star
rating what tells you there's
opportunity here okay so I found a
diffuser lamp it thinks it's a good deal
because it's a high price I have no idea
if the margin's good here's what I'm
going to ask it to do I'm going to say
do a reverse image search on AliExpress
or Alibaba or Teemu or whatever and find
the
supplier okay um could you help me clear
the source link column and email it
shouldn't have a hard time doing
this try again no I didn't do
anything this is like the Super Bowl
clearing the source link
column okay it's

[16:02]
clear look at all these oh it's putting
flights here too that's a problem let's
go back here does it really require
logging into Amazon for one star
reviews okay I'm signing out going to
amazon.com I'm going to click on
something
random okay I'm clicking on a
product one star reviews yeah it does
it's right okay well let's see if I can
find a work
around let's do
this you need to log all of these in a
new tab that you need to
create not sheet
one all right see more reviews click on
that do it do

[17:01]
that do it do
it click on see
more okay well let let me just log
in all right I had to edit out me
entering in my password there for a
minute but you do have to log in to look
at one star reviews never knew that uh
hopefully it just keeps going let's go
back here all right this is still
looking for airbnbs there it is they're
kind of running into each other over
there we're on Oli is this the same
freaking
thing
similar show a picture of a link oh
here's a
screenshot
okay
$179 that's the same freaking thing
isn't
it it's the same freaking thing oh sorry
I'm looking at Etsy in the background

[18:00]
I'm looking at Etsy in the background
too okay
now okay different
thing let's try this go to
images.google.com
[Music]
and reverse image search the Etsy one
because I already told it to do this but
I didn't give it Specific Instructions
so looks like it might do it now that
I'm
specific we'll move on no exact matches
it's just freaking going it is running
and gunning trying all kinds of
dates this is crazy now we got to get
back to the
flights okay open a new tab in that
Google sheet then paste your results
there and remove them from the sheet
there on
look at all these onear reviews it's

[19:01]
look at all these onear reviews it's
looking
at let's go over here what's it going to
do okay we got we got a new tab called
flight
deals this is crazy it found emails they
found an email for
me oh I haven't checked on that one in a
while though just find a ton of
emails because it told me yesterday that
it cannot scrape and email people but if
I ask it to do that
in separate steps will it do
it oh I found a
directory doesn't need a form entry
doesn't need you to log in okay I need
to save the product image should I
proceed with saving the image from the
search yes and don't ask again if in
doubt don't ask just do it like
Nike
said okay over here okay Airbnb is just
Crush it okay but they're not being

[20:01]
Crush it okay but they're not being
logged correctly and look it's going to
like move these over one at a freaking
time why is that taking so
long go
faster look it took the image and it put
it in Google Images whereas before it
told me it can't do that it's not
allowed to do that and then I said go to
Google images and do
it and it now it's doing
it if this video doesn't go
then this world is doomed because this
is freaking awesome objectively it's
just
searching all kinds of different
dates what's your logic on searching
these dates that's another good
framework here is like ask it what it's
thinking like why are you working this
way and it will teach you different and
unique ways of thinking it could say
like well you know what I'm looking for
dates in the middle of the week because
dates on the weekend are generally more
expensive and you told me to find
cheaper dates you didn't say you didn't

[21:01]
cheaper dates you didn't say you didn't
say find cheaper dates on the weekend so
it's like huh okay interesting or it
could say I'm looking for eight months
out because those are less likely to be
booked so then I can get a more clear
picture of the Arbitrage opportunities
that are out there I chose dates align
with typical booking patterns y y
[Music]
yada keep going and move faster that is
my favorite prompt alternative product
price at 2560 with a minimum order of 2
p pieces here's a
screenshot oh my
gosh I just found it for $25 it's being
it's not the exact same I don't
think log that in
a sheet and find
more oh my gosh I didn't tell it what
types of products I just said Etsy go
and it finds something that has like an
80% profit margin and then it find it
found the freaking

[22:02]
found the freaking
supplier look at all those
Vehicles okay poor goity we're going to
sit on the Amazon one for now it did its
job it found the ones that reviews cool
flights okay are these moved
over okay all
right delete the old ones and use column
headers on the new ones and then keep
searching and move
faster all right all right it's logging
this stuff into a fifth Etsy
sheet the product link the Etsy link oh
my gosh okay all right here's what we're
going to do all right we're going to
close Amazon boom then we're going to go
to this new operator and try to find a
an iPhone 15 come on come on ah okay six

[23:01]
an iPhone 15 come on come on ah okay six
at a time okay it needs me to log into
Facebook so a lot of people have been
saying
that they won't let them log into
Facebook so I don't know if I'm just
lucky here or what
but there's something ironic about
clicking trust this device
within an AI
agent um all
right keep going let's go back here what
do we what we got what we got in
Minneapolis I think we should end this
because we've learned that it works
great it's not
logging I think the other agent you know
adding to the same tab really screwed it
up all
right I only C3 and move
faster okay Etsy
Mark safe and

[24:00]
Mark safe and
resume um okay we're going to stop Etsy
because wow floored I'm floored by Etsy
it worked great it worked amazingly I
really want look I just added another
one ah I kind of don't want to stop that
though sheet
five $59 oh my gosh so dang
cool we're all so screwed we're so
screwed all right here we go how about
this put the NADA or
KBB value of each vehicle in a new
column and then show me what percent
they are
undervalued in yet another colum let's
see if that
works okay um go ahead and check that
box for me it's not a capture

[25:00]
so I told it's not a
capture you are wrong this is a bug that
is a normal
checkbox not a
capture check
it oh I was really hoping that would
work all right I got to check the
freaking box oh I got to do all the work
around here
okay all right go back here email
extraction it's look at all these tabs
holy cow look at all these tabs it is
just
going okay we got a bunch of suppliers
here adjusting map to explore
neighborhoods still only have three
monitor task okay so with Facebook it

[26:00]
monitor task okay so with Facebook it
does want you to
stay in there that is a downside with
Facebook is it want you to stay okay so
it Facebook is really being picky about
you can't see it I don't think you can
see it because I moved it to my other
monitor
but I'm trying to see if that's a
workaround
to allowing Facebook to keep going
without my
monitoring
so let's see if that works
now no okay we're going to we're going
to end one of these okay so Etsy you
crushed it like you did the Google image
search even though you said you couldn't
you found five options here oh my gosh
okay this is amazing we're closing Etsy
we're going to move on uh we're going to
save that okay now we're going to go to
this new
operator and it's going to let us
because I just closed that other
tab okay
look for the email you're describing I

[27:00]
look for the email you're describing I
need to access your email
account okay Facebook is still pausing
because I'm not giving it any attention
Okay let's go back
here still only three results on Airbnb
but we get the idea it works and it got
glitched because the other operator
interfered by adding flights so we're
going to close that one and then we're
going to start this one
okay log into your email on browser
so open Gmail and I'll log
in okay Facebook is just keeps glitching
out on my other monitor here because it
requires more handholding so this will
be our 10th I'm going to have to log
into
Instagram actually I'll say can you
do YouTube short you don't need a log

[28:02]
again so now it's going to YouTube
shorts and watch what it does in the
browser it doesn't it could go to
shorts.
youtube.com all right let's go back to
vehicle
listings oh my gosh it's got a formula
in here so it's undervalued by negative
140% so it's not
undervalued you're so dumb man this AI
is terrible my kids say that sometimes
we'll be using Chad gbt and he'll say
something wrong he's like man this is
dumb it's not good at all and I'm like I
just want to slap him because it's like
you don't even know you have no idea how
not dumb this
is
okay do this
instead it is not unavailable what is
your
problem let's try this again start here
and then start scrolling and searching

[29:01]
and then start scrolling and searching
for business shorts with over 200k views
and then save to watch later
playlist that's crazy okay so let's just
do
Instagram because that worked the other
day so I know that should
work it's interesting that you can use
Google search Google Images reverse
image search you can't can't use Gmail
or YouTube shorts oh I haven't done that
one yet
okay let's go back
here we go to email contacts we got two
we got
two oops it's looking up NADA values
that is
crazy or Kelly Blue Book vehicle
listings it's taking a long time though
but I mean look at this this one is
undervalued that one's overvalued that
one's about right
all right

[30:01]
all right
so we're going to cancel the email
thing okay it's allowing me to log into
chat GPT oh my gosh all right is this
going to be a
thing I really hope this
works I really really freaking hope this
this works
all right I'm putting in my open AI
password
here two Factor
authentication okay two two Factor okay
that's
random all right oh I'm so excited so
video is cool but you know what's better
long form audio via podcast and my
newsletter TKO pod.com go there to

[31:01]
newsletter TKO pod.com go there to
subscribe for free to my newsletter it's
one email a week very tactical and then
go to my audio podcast three episodes a
week stuff like this you're gonna love
it all free no sleazy sales TKO
pod.com okay I'm so excited I'm so
excited I'm going to watch chat GPT
operate chat
GPT here we
go maybe you don't think think this is
cool make the
prompt better using
every you
know okay it's thinking what's it
thinking enhancing The Prompt with
specific details market analysis
operational strategies marketing plans
Financial projections and any regulatory
consideration specific to Dallas include
case studies Suess
should I submit it oh my gosh now let's

[32:02]
should I submit it oh my gosh now let's
go look in my chat
GPT
okay new
chat right freaking there it's right
freaking
there okay we're gonna go back
here it's viewing it okay let's log into
Instagram now I was already logged into
Facebook so this is going to be
interesting to see if it'll the cookie
will carry over
no okay authentication
app code

[33:00]
all right I'm now logging into Instagram
inside the browser do not save my
info um okay we're going to go back
here make it more
refined okay we're going to close that
let's look at the flights that it found
three okay not bad not bad I
guess okay it's going back to find car
values still looking for email emails
but like one thing is like it's not
asking me to interact and like it's just
going right whereas certain websites
like freaking Facebook thanks Zuck wants
me to like intervene every five seconds
like why can't we just steal your data
come
on yes don't
ask I got a funny
idea all right return control to
operator let's watch it watch reals
we're going to watch a computer surf
social media okay sensitive data yada

[34:02]
social media okay sensitive data yada
yada return
control it'll still work it just needs
me to babysit it oh that that actually
looks pretty cool I might actually make
a video out of out of
that look it's just watching look at
this there's no watch later playlist
that was in that was
YouTube just hit the bookmark
button don't ask first okay it said
would you like me to bookmark it I said
yes okay now watch this use chat GPT to
log into operator to overtake
yourself in an infinite
Loop of course whatever I had to try all
right paint
listings what is it even looking for
emails still okay two emails you failed

[35:02]
emails still okay two emails you failed
well you did a great job at working
really
hard okay NADA vehicle
listings not bad let's drag this down
see what we
got okay um we're going to close that
business plan done all
right let's see I want to see if it can
tell me what's happening in the videos
here because like mid journey and all
them like from what I understand there's
not like a a native way for AI to watch
videos which seems crazy to me because
it can analyze pictures why can't it
just watch a video frame by frame by
frame like a woman is leaning in the
door a woman walks in the room you think
it could do that maybe there's a tool
out there please let me know in the
comments if there is but it can surely
listen to the transcript or extract the
transcript but one thing that I'm
noticing is it's not like extracting
things it's acting like a human it's
listening
now I'm going to log into I want to see

[36:00]
now I'm going to log into I want to see
that wedding idea what are you
doing I want to log into my Instagram
account on my phone and see if it
actually bookmarked a reel it did
not the next real you see tell me
exactly what's happening in it and save
it as a bookmark in my all
post book mark
folder I've bookmarked
three where are those three reals they
aren't
in my
folder let's see what it's
doing it's going it's going to go look
in my bookmarks folder
saved okay it knows where they are where
they should be yep not in there you dumb
idiot re bookmarking

[37:02]
idiot re bookmarking
post it's not
there all right I'm going to tell it to
move on from the bookmarking and just
forget the
bookmarking find any real
whatsoever and watch the whole thing and
tell me exactly what's happening and
what the engagement
metrics on it
are oh oh
shoot guys it did it it worked look at
this look at that look at that I've
never seen this before it just
bookmarked it 12 Margaritas deep
protecting my smalltown Mexican
restaurant employees when Ice shows up
that's pretty good that's pretty good
but it it worked it worked I just had to
finesse it I gave up on it too
soon oh okay
um I already have a headache it's not
even noon

[38:01]
even noon
yet playing real for Content context
content comprehension okay it picked
this reel for some
reason USD Professor who created a fire
resistance aable
home oh my
gosh when was it posted and how do you
know what happened in the video from the
transcript or did you watch it
it can watch it I didn't know it could
watch
videos holy cow this just opens up
everything like I have 300 reels I could
use the API to say watch all 300 of
these okay boom here's look at all the
engagement data okay boom why did these
go viral why did these fail all right
learn train on my data and then and this
was this idea was courtesy of my friend
Sam and then when I take a new reel I
can upload it and say how will this do
how how many views will this get in the
first 30 days based on what you've
learned on my current data oh poorly how

[39:02]
learned on my current data oh poorly how
can I improve it well this hook works
this hook works this background image
works better than that background image
like imagine the freaking possibilities
okay my brain's exploding this is a joke
um thank you for watching TKO pod.com uh
