here's exactly how you can reverse
engineer any Shopify store to find out
what their best sellers are so you can
copy them shamelessly first of all go to
builtwith decom and scrape a list of
every single Shopify store in the world
if you don't want to pay $450 to
builtwith like I don't then go to
upwork.com and find a virtual assistant
that already has access to built
with.com and you can pay $20 to scrape
whatever you want step two look at this
URL suffix or yeah suffix you want to
take this URL suffix and put it at the
end of their homepage hit enter and it
will sort all of their products to best
to worst selling so I covered this hack
on episode 30 of the ker office TKO
pod.com and a bunch of other e-commerce
hacks on reverse engineering your
competitors there's no ads there's no
cost just enjoy follow me for more like
