look at this freaking thing right here I
don't know who's selling these machines
but I know how I would turn this machine
into a side hustle that pays 5 grand a
month in profit first I want to validate
the side also before I spend a dime on
this expensive machine I would go to
zola.com and the not.com because they
have every wedding planner in the
country it's a database there's 18,000
wedding planners I would scrape them
with a simple piece of software and then
I would skip Trace all of them to get
all of their contact information name
company name email and phone number then
I would take a sample of 500 of them I
would do cold I reach to them and say
hey look at this video and I would send
them this viral video in the background
I sell these for $5 a piece and I know
that the average wedding in the United
States has 120 attendees so I need to
serve one wedding per day on average so
more like five per weekend to make five
grand a month in net profit you can do
this research before you spend a dollar
on a dumb machine like this
