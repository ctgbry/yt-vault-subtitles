[00:00]
absolutely I want to hear about your
dumpster rental business okay yeah I've
been in business for about 6 weeks now
took quite a while to get funding for
the dumpsters and the truck and
everything so I ended up flying into
Texas buying a truck and 11 dumpsters
and driving them back to Salt Lake and
we have had those for about six weeks
now and things are going really well but
I mostly just wanted to kick your brain
about some unique ways to Market to
either contractors or Builders and get
some more like long-term contracts most
of our customers right now are
homeowners which has been great but
we're spending a fortune on Google ads
and those traditional marketing channels
and so I wanted to pick your brain about
Landing commercial jobs working with
General Contractors or Builders or just
anybody like pulling permits I've
thought about marketing too wanted to
just get some of your advice on
that so you just went ahead and bought a
truck like I assume a truck to move
these things around plus 11 dumpsters in
Texas and just started from scratch or
is this a business that you uh bought

[01:00]
is this a business that you uh bought
started from scratch yeah wow okay what
about the industry or business made you
want to just go all in on this and I
like the business too don't get be wrong
I'm just curious what your mindset is
yeah so I've been flipping houses for
the last three or four years and had to
rent them all the time and started just
running the numbers on them and you can
buy a dumpster for probably all in after
painting and decals you're like 5,500
bucks and you can rent them out for 350
a week it's also just really like
operationally it's pretty simple right
now I've got a full-time driver and then
a full-time uh office manager that takes
calls and schedules so operationally
it's pretty simple to scale the biggest
thing is it's just really Capital
intensive that's the biggest downside
but yeah that that was most of the
appeal is I've paid for them all the
time and they're pretty
profitable okay how what percentage of
capacity are you right now with your 11
dumpsters it depends on the week so like
last I think two Fridays ago it was
really warm out and we hit Max Capacity
we all of the dumpsters were out of our
yard but earlier this week we were at 0%
you know capacity so we didn't have

[02:01]
you know capacity so we didn't have
anything booked and then this Friday
it's warm again so we've got a lot so
that's one reason I'm wanting to move
more into the commercial space is there
a lot more consistent a lot of these
Weekend Warriors want to rent one when
the sun comes out um I've got 12 more
dumpsters coming on the 15th so I'm
really going to need to increase my my
bookings in order to to accommodate
those how much do these cost you said
500 but is that what these cost no they
cost like 5500 once everything S500 yeah
yeah and
then okay six grand a piece okay and
you're ordering them because it's been
going and it's in Utah and the weather's
warming up and you want to grow your
business yeah right okay how have you
been finding customers so far 90% has
just been Google ads we've done quite a
bit of we're just cranking out cold
calls every single day doing a lot of
just like networking with Realtors and
moving companies but primarily Google
ads has been all of our we're starting
to get some traction with SEO and we're

[03:00]
to get some traction with SEO and we're
starting to rank on like the Google Map
Pack so we've been making some progress
on those fronts but primarily Google ads
which is pretty expensive I think we're
spending about 200 a day on Google
ads and what is that are you able to
attribute it correctly so you know like
how much in Google ads equates to a
rental yeah so $200 in Google ads spends
usually can book me about one and a half
to two rentals a
day okay so we're talking 700 or th000
bucks in Revenue somewhere around there
yeah assuming that we can maintain that
and I think that'll yeah that that's the
goal for this year once I have those
other dumpsters come
in okay theoretically as you scale the
ad campaign it'll get less efficient but
it's also getting warmer so is it
reasonable to assume if you were to to
spend a thousand a day that it would
still be somewhat profitable as the
weather warms up but not as I would
think so the more I I increase the
budget I've already noticed like my cost
per click starts to go up a little bit

[04:00]
per click starts to go up a little bit
my conversions are a little bit more
expensive the nice part is as long as
I'm getting like one and a half to two
bookings a day that covers all of my
fixed costs so the vast majority of my
expenses are fixed like I've got to pay
a full-time office person full-time
driver my yard rental is 12,200 bucks a
month my loans on the equipment so once
all that's covered my margins get
significantly better so even if my ad
spend efficiency goes down it would
still be worth it okay and what
percentage of your business is coming
from Google ads today
90% okay so cold calls aren't yielding
much fruit yet they haven't we've been
cold calling primarily like roofers
remediation companies homebuilders and
no we haven't had any luck with it we've
probably done I don't know 200 300 cold
calls at this point a lot of them either
already have a dumpster guy that they're
using like already have a contract with
somebody that's set up so that's one
thing we've been running into we can try
and compete on price but a lot of these

[05:00]
and compete on price but a lot of these
guys have larger operations so they can
run at smaller margins are you willing
to tell me what your website is so I can
pull that up yeah it's co how easy is it
or hard to change the pricing on your
website on any given time yeah would
take two
minutes and it are you not concerned
about that would it not cause friction
with current customers or is it not a
big deal no we don't have very many
repeat customers most of them are like
one-off homeowners that are find us on
from a Google ad search or the map pack
and are just booking one so we have a
couple repeat customers but okay do you
know how much you compete with those
backer bags at Home Depot at all I don't
know how you measure that
but they're a lot smaller than what
you're renting I know that yeah yeah so
we have 20 cubic yard dumpsters so
they're pretty
large okay and are most of these
homeowners just doing like bathroom
remodels and stuff or is it bigger stuff
yeah a lot of them are either just like
garage cleanouts or some sort of of

[06:00]
garage cleanouts or some sort of of
smaller
renovation okay or a lot of them are
moving okay have you thought of trying
to partner with the junk hauling
companies in the area um I've given a
little bit of thought I actually called
a junk removal guy yesterday to see if
we could set up some kind of like a
referral program the larger junk hauling
like junk removal guys so you've got
like 800 got junk and junk Kings and
those types of like franchise models
those guys have their own dumpsters that
they'll rent out on occasion the guy
that I talked toest yesterday was
midsize so he doesn't have dumpsters but
he said usually if he gets somebody
that's requesting a dumpster he'll just
try and talk him into doing a junk
removal job and he can usually for a
slightly higher price than a dumpster
will just go out and a lot of those junk
removal guys work really cheap they
don't seem to make a ton of money so I
think they're willing to take a cut in
price and make it worth it for their
customer have you gone the handyman
route and scraped a list of handyman or
general contractors specifically more
smaller ones to do Outreach to them we

[07:03]
smaller ones to do Outreach to them we
haven't um most of the people we've been
reaching out to are are larger companies
like large remediation because my first
thought was I want to land as big of a
contract as I can so mostly like larger
remediation Roofing and uh home builders
but that might I haven't really given
that much thought but that might be some
uh lower hanging
fruit yeah the the the hard part with
those guys is they can be some sometimes
hard to find a lot of those handymen and
contractors like they don't have a
website they're not even on Google Maps
they just get business from referrals
and yeah you know what I'm saying yeah
absolutely have you noticed on your
Google ads a time of day or week when
you're busier or slower like when is the
demand is it like on a Thursday before
the weekend or is there no correlation
there's a lot of correlation so
Wednesday Thursday Friday are wild like
today I've got I think four drop offs
yesterday we had two or three so
Wednesday Thursday Friday are crazy
Monday and Tuesday are pretty slow and a
lot of that is because I'm working
primarily with home owners that just

[08:00]
primarily with home owners that just
want a warm weekend where they can do a
garage clean out or tear down that deck
or whatever it is and that's one reason
why I do want to go the commercial route
a little bit more is because they're a
little bit more consistent if it's rainy
out they're not going to stop their
project or so that that's one thing we
it's very varies a lot between Monday
and Tuesday is dead and then Wednesday
Thursday Friday is just crazy to where
we we run out of dumpsters okay do you
have to rent these or could you sell
them as well sell the dumpsters yeah is
that even an option or is the margin not
out there if I were to sell them it
would just be to like another dumpster
company or just a a commercial business
right that that needs an extra one
permanently yeah that have to go through
the trash company they would need
somebody to empty it I could sell it to
them and then just service it on a
monthly basis so usually like we've got
one guy up in Park City right now that
we have a monthly contract with so him
for example we charge 550 bucks a month
and that includes one empty and and then
if he needs us to come out and empty it

[09:01]
if he needs us to come out and empty it
before that we can do a swap for 200
bucks so those are usually how those
types of contracts work I'm sure I know
there's some people that will like
fabrication shops will buy a dumpster
that's for like metal recycling and then
somebody will come empty it for free but
primarily it's more of a a
rental and the guy in Park City what is
his use for this dumpster he does build
outs for commercial spaces so he's doing
like a a commercial buildout on the
shopping center right now okay so you're
you've been trying to find more guys
like him yeah the nice part about guys
like him and especially as we get more
dumpsters is like we've been having to
go the residential route right now
because we only have 11 dumpsters so we
have to turn these things really quickly
but the nice part about those commercial
guys is he takes the exact amount of
work as a residential person so for
example a lot of residential guys I'll
cut them a deal if they're doing like a
three-day booking and they'll pay
$2.99 this commercial guy he keeps the
dumpster for a month but he pays me 550
so it's the exact same amount of work
and the the additional 200 bucks is just
pure profit the downside is I've got

[10:01]
pure profit the downside is I've got
that dumpster tied up so ideally what I
could do is over time shift more and
more to commercial as I get more
equipment and eventually that's
primarily where I'd like to be and then
do some residential jobs here and there
but those jobs are they're significantly
more profitable but if I only did
commercial jobs I wouldn't pay the bills
because I'd be booked out whereas with
the the residential jobs some of these
dumpsters I can turn two or three times
a week so it's more work but more
profit okay all right I think I've got
some ideas think if you're spending six
grand a month and I don't know if you
think how I think but this is how I
think I I never want to hire an agency
for anything because I don't want to pay
one to four grand a month for anything
right but then I'll just I'll dump $200
a day into Google ads and it just seems
totally different to me and really it's
that's three agencies so yeah I don't
know if you think like that but I think
you would be pretty well served to find
uh a gmbb agency to organically increase
your M pack ranking over time and I feel

[11:01]
your M pack ranking over time and I feel
like you're in this for the Long Haul no
pun intended and you're willing to make
investments today to grow your business
six months from now which is why you
bought all these new dumpsters but I
think that would really help it's not
going to move the needle today but I
think a lot of these agencies are a, to
1500 bucks a month and they work like of
all the agencies you could hire it's a
lot of times with any agency it's is
this guy is this even working but with
gmbb it's very clear you can see your
ranking Improv
on certain terms I would try that
there's a I've tweeted quite a bit about
it if you do an advanced search under my
name for Home Service I've tweeted quite
a bit about improving your map pack
ranking and all that I would try that I
would also experiment with surge pricing
I would be willing if I were you to
really drop your prices during those low
demand times and see if you convert a
lot better directly from Google that's
the great thing about cold traffic to a
website is you can play around with your
prices all you want and no one's going

[12:01]
prices all you want and no one's going
to Care no one's going to remember no
one's going to Care I've always wanted
to buy a hotel just so I could
experiment with surge pricing like to an
extreme where it's like all right I know
that my cleaner is going to take an hour
to clean this room I pay her 18 bucks an
hour so my hard cost is 18 bucks all
right our hotel is normally 130 a night
but if I'm not 100% occupied I'm going
to charge 30 until someone books it cuz
then I have an email address that I
could Market to them every month I still
make a $10 profit because those empty
rooms are just throwing money away yeah
I would experiment with something
drastic like that where you even
increase the prices on the weekend and
maybe they convert the same and you drop
them like significantly just to learn
even if you're losing money during the
week when you know like realistically
I'm not going to get any conversions
today just play around with it and see
what if it works what do you think about
that yeah yeah I think that's a great

[13:01]
that yeah yeah I think that's a great
idea and then even if I'm breaking even
on a couple bookings on a Monday or
Tuesday and I get a shorter booking it's
better than them sitting in the yard
I've got these things they're like a
really bright blue color and they're all
decaled and everything so they're like a
moving billboard so if I can move him
around town and keep I've got my driver
there at the yard fulltime anyways so if
I'm just trying to find things for him
to do he might as well be breaking even
on a delivery and that way we can
remarket to that person a lot of times
their neighbors will call based on the
so we've got it we've got like a QR code
and our phone number and everything on
these dumpsters so they're like a moving
billboard so if we can I love it have
that added benefit and then also
remarket to that person and keep my guys
busy then I think that's a great idea
yeah I love that I'm did you ever see
that Dollar Shave Club viral commercial
from 10 years ago 15 years ago I've seen
a couple of
them it was the original one it was the
guy in a warehouse it's really funny I
would go use that as a case study and
put a little money into making a
60-second video that you can put right

[14:01]
60-second video that you can put right
on your homepage of just you something
funny and endearing you sitting in a
dumpster or sitting on a stack of
dumpsters maybe right when they arrive
just like climbing up there getting a
video a very professional one saying
just what am I going to do with all
these dumpsters I've got 26 dumpsters or
whatever like what am I going to do with
them and that's let people see your
personality right there on the homepage
and I I think that will really help
because this is a commodity and it's man
I could pay 400 bucks to this commodity
or I could pay 450 bucks to Bailey and
he seems cool and funny and I like this
guy yeah I think that would help
conversion on your landing page because
if you're relying that much on cold
traffic then every little tweak you make
on your landing page is going to make a
big difference so you can play around
with keywords and all that stuff inside
of Google but I would focus more efforts
on your actual website to better convert
the traffic that gets there and then I
would take the efforts or money or
Manpower that you're spending on cold

[15:00]
Manpower that you're spending on cold
calling and just divert that to more
digital efforts for at least a couple
weeks posting on next door posting in
local Facebook groups Buy Sell Groups
mom groups anything posting on KSL
Craigslist Facebook Marketplace and just
don't coold call for a while see how
that goes and but specifically tell your
story I'm a Utah entrepreneur and I put
all this money to drive to Texas and to
buy a truck and 11 dumpsters so I could
better serve the valley with dumpsters
tell your story and people will read it
like they'll keep reading to the end and
then they'll feel like they know you and
they like you and it it seems kitchy and
like silly but I promise you it works
like when we do our cold Outreach we
tell our the story of James my my tree
Biz Operator just graduate from college
moved to Texas started like people love
it they want to support you as a person
but if you're just a business a faceless

[16:01]
but if you're just a business a faceless
business I know your face is on the
website which is awesome I would do the
same thing then it's you're just any
other dumpster rental company yeah that
a great idea I didn't even think of that
but anybody I've told that story because
I I flew out to Dallas and had to move
all these dumpsters around so they could
get shipped and put one on the back I'd
never driven anything more than a pickup
truck so I drove it 26 hours back to
Salt Lake anybody I've told that story
is pretty interested or think it's funny
or engaging so that's not a bad idea
exactly yeah and then I would get I
would scrape a list of all the handymen
General Contractors everything then you
can start doing cold Outreach to them
cold call text email going to their
website submitting a contact us form and
then just keep going the realtor and the
commercial realter route for referrals
because I think you're on the right
track there I would just pause it for a
while to try these other things before
revisiting it yeah I think you'll find
success there awesome yeah those are
some great ideas I yeah you're a genius
