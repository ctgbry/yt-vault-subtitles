[00:00]
I cannot come home until I've doubled my
money.
&gt;&gt; Every no is closer to a yes. When in
doubt, sell water.
&gt;&gt; All it takes is one yes.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I've got money. We found some good
people. I own my time. I own my
paycheck. And it's worth it. Look at
that. 30 bucks.
This just feels good. If you don't end
up selling these, what's going to happen
with them?
&gt;&gt; I'll keep them here. The car runs over.
They shoot.
&gt;&gt; We don't want that to happen.
&gt;&gt; Their mama got hit when it was about
&gt;&gt; Oh, no. 3 weeks old.
&gt;&gt; What are we going to do about those
puppies? Well, I've got a creative
solution to that.
&gt;&gt; I have a map of Texas and a dart.
Wherever this dart lands, I'm starting a
business. I'm kind of secretly hoping
that the dart lands somewhere up here
cuz I don't want to drive 6 hours today.
So,
shall we? All right, we got Houston down
on the bottom right, San Antonio bottom
left, Austin in the middle, Dallas Fort
Worth up top.

[01:04]
[Laughter]
Uhoh.
Okay.
Where are we?
Flats, Texas. Let me look this up on
Google. Usually, when you look up a
city, there's going to be like an
outline of a city. You go to Flats and
you see an intersection. So, the closest
city is
Emory. Uh, let's look up Emory, Texas.
1390 people in Emory. All right. Well,
we're going to Flats. We're going to
Emory. We're going to start a business
in the middle of nowhere today. All
right. Let's talk about the rules of the
game today. Three rules. Number one, I
can't use my audience or influence to
grow or start this business. Number two,
I can't drive all the way out in the
middle of nowhere just to start an
internet business. Now, can I use the
internet for research, for looking at
Facebook Marketplace, posting to
Facebook Marketplace? Absolutely. But I

[02:00]
Facebook Marketplace? Absolutely. But I
can't just drive out all the way out
there and start an internet business.
Number three, and this is the most
important, I cannot come home until I've
doubled my money. I cannot see my kids,
my wife, my family. So, yes, that means
I'm going to have to stay overnight if I
don't double my money. And it's also a
double-edged sword. If I find a couch on
Facebook Marketplace that's worth $400
and I buy it for $200, I've got to sell
it. I cannot come home until I sell it
for $400. But if I use much less money
to start or grow this business, 10, 20,
$50, then I have to double much less,
but I have less to work with. So, I'm
probably going to be looking at more
service industries, more service
businesses. Um, I don't know what I'm
going to do yet, but we're going to talk
to some locals, see if they have any
good ideas. If not, then I'm going to
have to kind of start to subscribe.
[Music]
All right, 20 bucks. That's a wrap.

[03:05]
[Music]
All right, we are 8 minutes out from
Flats, Texas. It's pretty flat out here.
I can't remember the last time I paid
cash for gas. Pump two, I think.
&gt;&gt; Awesome. Anything else?
&gt;&gt; That's it.
&gt;&gt; All right. 3.638 gallons. It's got to do
it today.
[Music]
The thing is is even though we're in the
middle of nowhere, every mile or two we
see homes. And every single one of these
homes needs something done. I guarantee
you they're going to be more willing to
pay me to do it if I sell them my story.
Because people buy the why, they're not
necessarily buying the what. So if my
why is I want to see if I can start a
business in Flats, Texas thing. I'm just
curious. I like a good challenge. That's

[04:00]
curious. I like a good challenge. That's
a story. That's a better story than I
charge $100 to pressure wash your
driveway. There's no story there. That's
just I'm just stating facts.
All right. If anyone knows what business
to start in Flats, Texas, it is going to
be the post office of Point, Texas. I
don't know if they just love geometry
here in Texas, but we got points, we got
flats, rhombus, triangle. I don't know.
How's it going?
&gt;&gt; Good. How are you?
&gt;&gt; Good. Um, this is very random.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; But I'm wondering
I want to start a business in Flats,
Texas today.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; What would you start if you were me?
&gt;&gt; Um, I'm not I'm not really for sure. I
mean, flats is pretty small, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, I would start I'd probably
start like an online business.
&gt;&gt; What if I were start a business that
just sold a service like gutter cleaning
or something?
&gt;&gt; Maybe a new restaurant or something like
that.
&gt;&gt; Have you heard anything or do you have
any friends that are business owners?
And
&gt;&gt; I never really pay attention to that
kind of stuff.

[05:00]
kind of stuff.
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Well, we're just looking for
ideas.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; All right. Thanks, man.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Yep. We are not starting a restaurant
today.
This is Flats. This is Flats, Texas.
It's this one intersection. Um, I see a
few cars.
I think we got to go start knocking
doors. Maybe the camera will help
dissuade people from shooting me. Oh,
look at this sign. This is our first
sign. I'd turn back if I were you.
And then it says, "Warning, there's
trespassing."
I'm going to do it for the content.
[Applause]
I don't know if anyone's here. Should we
try this mobile home?
That second knock was either a good
choice or a bad choice.
I got nothing. Let's go try that house.
All right.
Hey. Hey, guys. Hey. Hey. Oh, there's

[06:02]
Hey. Hey, guys. Hey. Hey. Oh, there's
some cute puppies. Cute puppies.
Oh my god. How's it going?
&gt;&gt; How you doing?
&gt;&gt; Oh, good. Sorry to bother. I'm Chris.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; This is very random. You're going to
have to hear me out for a sec. I'm not
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; I uh I threw a dart at a map of Texas
this morning. And I told myself,
wherever it lands, I'm going to start a
business. And it landed on flats.
&gt;&gt; Lots of luck, junk.
&gt;&gt; Are you Are you the population of flats?
One person here. I am a person in flat.
&gt;&gt; How many?
&gt;&gt; My name is Danny Ra. I was born in flat.
&gt;&gt; I'm Chris Kerner.
&gt;&gt; I'm Rascal Plat. I am the rascal inflat
Texas.
&gt;&gt; Okay, I like it. So, if you were me
wanting to start a business in flat,
what would you start?
&gt;&gt; You have to have some kind of idea or
&gt;&gt; because you can't walk out to something,
flip a coin, and walk off.

[07:00]
flip a coin, and walk off.
&gt;&gt; Something like home service, like window
washing or pressure washing.
something like that.
&gt;&gt; I see. Uh that'd be a tough line. You do
better in lawn care.
&gt;&gt; Lawn care. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Cuz not a lot of people around here make
a pretty good living
in lawn care around.
&gt;&gt; What kind of puppies you got here?
&gt;&gt; Oh, man. The them are pitbull and uh uh
labs. I need to get rid of all of them
but one. Their mama got hit when they
was about three weeks old,
&gt;&gt; man. And I've raised them, so I've got
attached to them.
&gt;&gt; You don't want to sell them if someone
was buying?
&gt;&gt; Oh, I would sell them if somebody walked
up and poked money in my hand.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But they're they're a mixed breed like
that.
&gt;&gt; I I just got a business idea. How about
that?
&gt;&gt; What's that?
&gt;&gt; What if I take pictures and videos of
them, list them online, find you a
buyer, and we split the money?
&gt;&gt; Sounds great to me. Come here, Robert.
Come on.
&gt;&gt; Oh, man.

[08:01]
&gt;&gt; Oh, man.
Adorable. Do you ever list stuff on
Facebook Marketplace?
&gt;&gt; I don't mess none of that. I don't know
how to turn a computer on. My smartphone
is so much smarter than me. It's unreal.
&gt;&gt; So, if you don't end up selling these,
what's going to happen with them?
&gt;&gt; I'll keep them here. The car runs over.
&gt;&gt; We don't want that to happen.
&gt;&gt; Book me up electric fence.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But they run through it and yel when I
get through it.
&gt;&gt; Okay. We're going to be back later this
afternoon. Is that okay? That's great
with me, man.
&gt;&gt; Okay, Danny, I'll see you later today.
&gt;&gt; Okay, y'all have a great day.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you guys.
&gt;&gt; Likewise. All right, so Facebook does
not allow any rehoming, selling, giving
away of pets, free, paid, or otherwise.
Not Facebook groups or marketplace. So,
we still got to do something with these
poor dogs. So, I'm going to find some
animal rescue places, some dog shelters,
give them a call, and see if they can
take them. like maybe worst case we just
put them in the back of my minivan here
and go drop them off.

[09:02]
and go drop them off.
These videos take a lot of effort, time,
and money to make. And if you find any
value in them whatsoever, it would mean
the world to me if you would just hit
subscribe and maybe even share with a
friend. Oh, he's got a no soliciting
sign, but we're not soliciting. Well, we
are definitely soliciting. So, hey, the
first sign that we saw today said, "I
will shoot you basically." So, this is
an upgrade.
I really feel like someone's home. I
don't want to waste this.
&gt;&gt; Hey.
&gt;&gt; Hello.
&gt;&gt; Hi. I um I have a very random question.
I'm wondering um what business should I
start in Flats or in Emory, Texas. I
came from Dallas. I literally threw a
dart at a map this morning and it landed
on Flats. I never heard of Flats. And
I'm just asking people what I should
start here.
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure. Maybe another food place.
That's what everyone says. There's no
food here.
&gt;&gt; I mean, there's not really good coffee
shops either. I mean, they're okay.
They're not like great.

[10:01]
They're not like great.
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't even drink coffee, so that
wouldn't be a good choice. Is there
anything you guys need done around the
yard or anything? Any bushes planted or
trees planted?
&gt;&gt; I don't think so.
&gt;&gt; All right. Well, thank you for your
time. Sorry to bother you. The people I
just spoke to, they don't have any
landscaping, any trees. They're next
door neighbors here. They have about six
or seven fruit trees. They've got a
couple oak trees. They've got beautiful
landscaping. And so it would be really
easy to say, "Oh, I need to go to these
guys because they don't have landscaping
yet. They don't have landscaping because
they don't value it." The customer that
already has landscaping is my customer
because they're probably already
thinking, "I could really use some
hedges out front or I might need to put
some landscaping edging around my my
trees so the weeds don't grow in on it."
Hey, yes, ma'am. Um, I'm just wondering
if you need any work done around the
yard or anything.
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Gutters cleaned, windows washed?
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, it looks like you take good
care of your yard, so you must find
enjoyment in it.
&gt;&gt; I do.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Do you know of any anyone else
that might need anything done in the
yard?
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I don't.
&gt;&gt; No worries.

[11:01]
&gt;&gt; No worries.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Yep.
&gt;&gt; I'm back on a mission. All right, Chad
GPT. I am in the middle of rural Texas
and there are five mixed breed pitbull
puppies that I need to safely rehome. I
need some creative solutions for these.
&gt;&gt; Local word of mouth. Just chat up
neighbors. Hope that helps. What if I
only have like 5 hours to work with?
&gt;&gt; In 5 hours, just swing by any busy local
store or cafe and ask around. Sometimes
a quick chat finds a home faster than
you think.
&gt;&gt; All right, I got an idea. So, instead of
leading with uh what business should I
start? I'm going to lead with the
puppies. That's my icebreaker. Hey,
how's it going? Do you speak English?
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; The internet is no working.
Okay. Loento,
that is the most awkward thing ever. If
you had any assumption that I was like
some doortodoor sales wiz, I'm not. I'm
not good at selling. I'm an introvert. I
don't like selling. So, if I can do
this, anyone can do this. But to be

[12:00]
this, anyone can do this. But to be
determined if I can even do this. We
want to go where the people are. Okay,
that is a requisite to a transaction.
There needs to be two people. Takes two
to transact and tango. So, we're going
to go yonder down this road right here
towards Emory, Texas. There's 1,400
people here, which is about 1,400 times
as many as are in flats. And if we can't
make it work in Emory, then we're going
to have to go a city bigger cuz we're
not quitting. So, let's go to Emory. I
go. We are in Emory, Texas right now.
Population 1400. And we're trying to do
several different things. We're trying
to make some money. We're trying to find
out what to do with these five puppies
that we don't want to die. So, we're
going to come into this puppy grooming
place and see if they have any ideas.
And we're also going to see
if they'll buy anything from us.
Dang it.

[13:01]
Dang it.
Oh, these poor puppies. All right, I'm
feeling a little dejected. We don't have
any revenue. It's 2:53 in the afternoon.
I need to call in some reinforcements.
So, if you remember my friend Kyler from
the appliance rental video, he's
actually in Texas right now. Kyler,
where you at?
&gt;&gt; I am in the middle of nowhere. Where are
you at?
&gt;&gt; I'm also in the middle of nowhere. I
need your help. I need to sell some
services andor products. Can you come to
Emory, Texas, and help us out?
&gt;&gt; Where the fetch is Emory, Texas?
&gt;&gt; That's what Google Maps is for.
All righty. Yeah, I can be I can be
there.
&gt;&gt; All right. Thanks, buddy. All right.
We're meeting Kyler at this grocery
store. He should be here any second.
Then we're going to go in here and try
to find a way to make money. And I'm
legitimately having anxiety about this
cuz it's just awkward. What's up, man?
What's up? Thanks for coming.
&gt;&gt; Of course. Ready to make some money.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm going to go ask this kind
store manager if we can sell uh puppies

[14:02]
store manager if we can sell uh puppies
outside of his store.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Maybe we can wash his windows. Maybe we
can pressure wash.
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; Another thing we can do while we're here
is be thinking of what we can buy and
sell. Or we have $10.
&gt;&gt; The Ryan Tran glitch of buy a 24 pack of
water and resell it.
&gt;&gt; We've talked about that. We could sell
popcorn at the fair. Oh. Oh, I see
someone. Here we go. Here we go. Excuse
me. I have a question for you.
We found a gentleman in town in Emory
that has five puppies that he needs to
give away or they're going to get hit by
a car.
&gt;&gt; Is there any way we could give those
away in front of the store?
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Let me ask you a different question. Is
there any like window washing or
anything that you guys need here that we
might be able to do?
&gt;&gt; We think we're good.
&gt;&gt; All right. Thank you.
[Music]
&gt;&gt; All right. So, the day is not going that
badly. We're just broke. I can't go home
and see my family. I can't buy an energy

[15:00]
and see my family. I can't buy an energy
drink. I can't buy lunch. And five
puppies are going to die. It couldn't be
worse, right? Okay. So, the best way to
make money is to sell things to people
that have money. So, I'm pulling up
Zillow right here and I'm going to find
the part of Emory, Texas that has the
most expensive homes. Where do you want
to go? Do you want to go by the lake or
do you want to go to this nicer
neighborhood up here? Here's the thing.
Sell it before you have it. They don't
have a ladder and they say yes, I'll you
can do it. You have a ladder? No. Let me
be right back. go to Home Depot. I mean,
honestly, side note, can I borrow a
couple hundred for a ladder? Can you pay
me up front? I will let you hold my
iPhone as collateral. Another framework
is find people that have homes for sale.
They probably need stuff done, right?
This neighborhood has three homes for
sale. Look at all Look at all that crap
in those. Look at that freaking stuff
right there. All right, Kyler, get in
there.
&gt;&gt; Okay,
&gt;&gt; we're going to take a picture. Big
cheesy grin.
We're going to post on Facebook
Marketplace. Now, of course, Facebook
Marketplace doesn't want you to post

[16:00]
Marketplace doesn't want you to post
services, but if I do pressure wash,
then they might think I'm selling a
pressure washer. All right, it's in
review.
There it is. Now, you think we're just
going to sit around and wait for our
phone to ding? No. No. Because we may
say our prayers on our knees, but
they're answered when we're on our feet.
Write that down.
&gt;&gt; All righty.
&gt;&gt; Read that twice.
&gt;&gt; Hey,
&gt;&gt; what's up?
&gt;&gt; How you doing?
&gt;&gt; All right. Hey,
&gt;&gt; hey, it's okay. So, is there anything
you need done? Gutters clean, pressure
washing, weed eatated where I can earn
50 bucks.
&gt;&gt; Just had it done.
&gt;&gt; What about weed eating?
&gt;&gt; That's my job.
&gt;&gt; What about gutters clean? That you don't
want to break your back.
&gt;&gt; I I'll get it, man. I got it.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Do you know anyone that wants any
puppies by chance? Trying to get
&gt;&gt; rid of of abandoned pets.
&gt;&gt; Do you know anyone in this neighborhood
that might need something done?
&gt;&gt; Uh, no, man. I don't. We just kind of
stick to ourselves. Okay, I appreciate
it.
&gt;&gt; All right, take it easy.
&gt;&gt; Yep. All right, on we go.

[17:05]
&gt;&gt; Hey.
Hey, buddy.
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; All it takes is one. Yes.
&gt;&gt; They might be home. Got three cars.
&gt;&gt; Hey, how's it going?
&gt;&gt; Good. So, I know this is random. I'm
filming a YouTube video right now.
&gt;&gt; And we're entrepreneurs and we are not
going back to Dallas until we make a
hundred bucks. Is there anything you
need done around? Firewood chopped, weed
eated, gutters cleaned, anything? No.
&gt;&gt; This is another random question, but we
we found a gentleman with five puppies
that he's trying to get rid of. Do you
know of anyone that needs or wants a
puppy?
&gt;&gt; I'm free myself. I'm good.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you know of like a shelter or
anything?
&gt;&gt; No. Um, like we don't have anything
around here for that. I'm sure if you

[18:00]
around here for that. I'm sure if you
drive down the road, you'll see some
dogs that are hit on side of the road,
stuff like that, just cuz they're Yeah.
Way too.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you anyway, man.
&gt;&gt; Appreciate it, guys.
&gt;&gt; Will you give us $100 to leave? No, I'm
I'm just I'm just kidding. Have a good
rest of your day.
&gt;&gt; You're like only kind of kidding.
&gt;&gt; Hello. Hi. I have a question. It's very
random. We drove from Dallas this
morning. Um, we're filming a YouTube
video. We're entrepreneurs. I have four
kids and we promise ourselves we cannot
go back home until we've made $100 doing
some sort of a home service business.
&gt;&gt; Do you do your gutters need cleaning by
chance?
&gt;&gt; Well, they probably do, but right now is
not a good time for me to be able to pay
you anything. I appreciate have a good
day.
&gt;&gt; Thank you. Look, there's a stick.
&gt;&gt; Oh, there's sticks up in the gutters.
It's a numbers game, Chris.
&gt;&gt; I know. It's a numbers game. It's all a
numbers game.
&gt;&gt; We just got to knock a lot of doors.
All right. This woman is mowing her lawn
and I'm going to go offer to do it for
her for 10 bucks. Got a question.

[19:02]
her for 10 bucks. Got a question.
&gt;&gt; I know this is very random.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, I'm I film YouTube videos.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I drove here from Dallas trying to
see if I could be an entrepreneur in the
middle of nowhere.
&gt;&gt; Do you have Do you have any interest in
letting me mow your lawn for like 20
bucks?
&gt;&gt; Sure. Really?
&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.
&gt;&gt; 20 bucks.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Oh, you're the best. Promise I won't
steal anything.
&gt;&gt; You do better in lawn care.
&gt;&gt; We got it.
We did it, boys.
We did it. 20 bucks. All right. I've
never been more excited to mow a lawn in
my life. All right. So, you want me to
get everything in here? Okay. What about
a weed eater?
I can do that. I will. Thank you.
[Music]

[20:03]
[Music]
If this is my after mo interview, she
call me postmo loan. Am I right? Am I
right? So, first of all, this is like
the hardest $20 I've ever earned and the
sweetest $20 I've ever earned because I
earned it. I own this. I own my time. I
own my paycheck. And it's worth it. So,
this will be the best mowing job I ever
do. Judge me in the comments. I don't
care cuz I'm happy with it. Okay. The
mow must go on.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. No problem. Do you
want one?
[Music]
All right,
&gt;&gt; there you go.
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.
&gt;&gt; It should be there.
&gt;&gt; All right, we are good.
&gt;&gt; This is great. You're doing stuff.

[21:01]
&gt;&gt; This is great. You're doing stuff.
&gt;&gt; You made my day, Leah.
&gt;&gt; So glad to meet you. You made my day
because I was about to have to mow.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; So nice. You didn't look happy out here.
&gt;&gt; No. So,
&gt;&gt; I did. I was
&gt;&gt; Look at that. 30 bucks. 30 bucks for
what? An hour's worth of work. You do
that 40 hours a week, that's $60,000 a
year working for yourself.
This just feels good. I don't know what
to say. Let's go check in on our uh
puppy friend and uh give him an update.
&gt;&gt; Hey, Danny. We're old pals now.
&gt;&gt; Remember me?
&gt;&gt; Yes, I do.
&gt;&gt; How you doing? I'm doing pretty good.
&gt;&gt; Good. So, I tried to sell them. Facebook
won't let me sell dogs.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; But I'm going to post about them on
Instagram and see if I can get people to
adopt them.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; How does that sound?
&gt;&gt; That's good as anything.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, we'll get these dogs off
your hands.
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; I've got a John Deere
&gt;&gt; M
tractor.

[22:00]
tractor.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
The last year they made MT
or M series tractor was 1952.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Are you trying to sell it?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd like to get rid of it.
&gt;&gt; What do you think it's worth?
&gt;&gt; I'd take $500 for it.
&gt;&gt; Can I take pictures of it?
&gt;&gt; It's wrapped in trees right back over
there.
&gt;&gt; All right. We'll go look at it and then
be out of your hair.
&gt;&gt; All right. Thank y'all. Have a great
day.
&gt;&gt; Thank you. Got some bamboo. I see a
gate. There we go.
Look at you. Look at you looking at that
washer. Barbed wire right there.
I think I see it.
There she is. In case you haven't heard
me talk about it already, I do have a
private community called TK Owners where
me and about 500 other people are
actively building and starting and
growing businesses. So, if you ever want
to hang with people that are doing cool
things like yourself, check out
tkowners.com and we'd love to have you.

What the
dude? Is that a smoker?
Smoker hardly know.
This is like an authentic offset Texas
smoker. This is where you put the wood.
Always post oak.
Oh yeah.
Needs new tires. Need to clean it up.
Tail lights.
This could literally sell after
restoring it for $3,000 legitimately.
Let's go ask him what he would sell us
this for. Hey,
&gt;&gt; look how cute.
&gt;&gt; We did. What about that smoker back
there? That offset. Are you interested
in selling that?
&gt;&gt; Oh, hell. What are you giving me for it?
&gt;&gt; Well, it's pretty rusted out and it
needs tires and brake lights and all
that, but I' i'd do 400 bucks for it.

[24:00]
that, but I' i'd do 400 bucks for it.
&gt;&gt; I mean, my money.
&gt;&gt; I need to come back with my truck. I've
got your number.
&gt;&gt; You don't give me $400. You can come
back any damn time you want me to.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I got pictures of it, so
I'll see what I can do with it. All
right.
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Danny.
&gt;&gt; The sun set and we stopped by Danny's
house to follow up about his puppies.
We're going to find some good homes for
him. He was happy about that. And most
importantly, we found an authentic Texas
offset barbecue smoker. After fixing it
up, it's probably worth 2,3 or $4,000.
Um, and he said he'd let it go for 400.
He said, and I quote, "I don't even know
how to turn the computer on." So, the
chances of him ever selling anything on
the internet are exactly zero. So, if we
could do that for him and take 10% or
take anything over what he wants to get
for the item, then it's a perfect
win-win. So, we're gonna go ahead and
list all this stuff on Facebook
Marketplace, see what we can fetch for
it, and then hopefully come back to
Danny with some good news and some cash.
&gt;&gt; YouTubers.

[25:00]
&gt;&gt; YouTubers.
&gt;&gt; Uh, yeah, something like that. We're
basically like Ryan Tran, except no
one's ever heard of us. So,
&gt;&gt; I got a question for you guys.
&gt;&gt; This sounds really shady, but it's not
shady. We have five puppies that we need
to place in a good home. Do you guys
know of anyone?
&gt;&gt; I don't really need another one. I
already got a corgi. Do you guys know of
anyone that would want them or anyone
with
&gt;&gt; find somebody at the fair? Honestly,
&gt;&gt; what time does it start?
&gt;&gt; Five.
&gt;&gt; Do a lot of people go to it if we don't
want to spend any more than $20. We
spent 10 on gas. We have $10 left. We
have $1 poster board, $1 poster board,
$1 Sharpie, $5 water, 32 of them. If we
sell all this water, we can make $32. We
can more than double our money today.
But we can't have ice. We can't have a
cooler. The ice is $ 230 a bag. The
coolers are $26 and the bags are $ 250.
So no matter what, we're going to have
to sell lukewarm water, which means our
positioning, our riz, our sales acumen

[26:00]
positioning, our riz, our sales acumen
has to be off the charts. But I'm up for
the challenge. Are you guys going to the
fair tonight?
&gt;&gt; How much would you say a bottle of water
is in there?
&gt;&gt; $3.
&gt;&gt; Three bucks.
&gt;&gt; All right. Thank you. Feel like water's
the old standby, right?
&gt;&gt; Everyone needs it. When in doubt, sell
water.
Oh my gosh. My gosh. This thing does not
draw.
How about that?
&gt;&gt; I like it.
&gt;&gt; The great reset.
All right. If we don't sell the rest of
the water in this bag, I don't go home
tonight. Okay. Is it cold? No. Does it
have the illusion of cold? Because I
happen to find this in the back of my
wife's van cuz she uses this for her
Costco runs. Yes, I'm not telling them
it's cold, but they're assuming it's
cold. And that's on them.
&gt;&gt; You think it's We can get in this way.
&gt;&gt; Of course we can.

[27:00]
&gt;&gt; Of course we can.
&gt;&gt; I have no idea. But if you say it with
confidence,
&gt;&gt; you can just do things.
&gt;&gt; That's right.
&gt;&gt; Oh, here we go.
&gt;&gt; Here we go.
&gt;&gt; Water.
Room temp. Water.
&gt;&gt; Water.
&gt;&gt; Hey, some people prefer room temp. Hey,
and the closer we are to the fair,
the more likely they are to think that
we're with the fair.
&gt;&gt; The same.
&gt;&gt; But assumptions,
that one might give it away. That one
might give it away. This reminds me of
my very first business selling used golf
balls at the Logan River Golf Course in
Logan, Utah. I found my most customers
standing in the parking lot of the
clubhouse. It's the first time I got
cussed out. Any interest in supporting a
starving YouTuber?
&gt;&gt; Maybe on the way out. We just ate. Well,
we'll be out here when you come back.
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; Have a good time.
&gt;&gt; Good evening.
&gt;&gt; No, not
&gt;&gt; Okay, ma'am. We'll be out here when you
come back.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Thank you. Have a fun time. Every no is
closer to a yes. This could be a lesson
in price anchoring. So, I stand up
there. $3 water. Like, oh, no, no, no.
Then you go back here at $1 water.

[28:01]
Then you go back here at $1 water.
That's a bargain. We're colluding. It's
like price fixing, but not.
&gt;&gt; They have to say yes.
&gt;&gt; They have to state law. It's three bucks
in there. $1 right here.
&gt;&gt; I'm good.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Chug a few water.
&gt;&gt; Understood.
&gt;&gt; My water's cleaner.
&gt;&gt; It's three bucks in there. One buck
right here.
&gt;&gt; Any water.
&gt;&gt; One buck or three for $3. Or even 10.
I'll do 10 for 10.
&gt;&gt; Three for three. Whatever. What' you
say?
&gt;&gt; Uh, five for five. Three for three.
&gt;&gt; Say three for three.
&gt;&gt; You are the man. My
&gt;&gt; first sale of the night. You know what?
I'm going to throw in one for free.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Just cuz you made me so happy.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.
&gt;&gt; All right, guys. Have a good one.
&gt;&gt; Really appreciate it. Enjoy.
&gt;&gt; We did it. Water's three bucks in there.
I got 20 waters. I got 20 waters.
&gt;&gt; You got change?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I got uh three. I got three bucks.
You only have a 20?
&gt;&gt; I only have two.
&gt;&gt; Do you think you could break it up over

[29:00]
&gt;&gt; Do you think you could break it up over
there? I'll give you three for free if
you do. I've got uh four kids at home
and I can't go home until I sell the
rest of these. So,
&gt;&gt; you'll be supporting uh families. if I
can break it up for you.
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you. I'll be right here.
&gt;&gt; Well, it's getting late. The sun's
almost down. The fair is almost closed.
And we are $3 away from hitting our goal
of doubling our money. If we do not do
it, then we are staying the night in
Emory, Texas. And I have yet to even see
anything other than a motel. And I
really want to be home by bedtime. So,
we'll see.
$3 away from hitting our goal.
&gt;&gt; No. Okay. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; $1 water.
&gt;&gt; You're not thirsty.
&gt;&gt; Water.
&gt;&gt; That's fair. That's fair. I'm I'm $4
from my goal.
&gt;&gt; $4. I swear on my life.
&gt;&gt; I have water.
&gt;&gt; Oh, dude. You would be the You would be
the best.
&gt;&gt; Oh, man.
&gt;&gt; $3 for my goal. Thank you so much.

[30:00]
&gt;&gt; $3 for my goal. Thank you so much.
Oh, man.
&gt;&gt; Oh,
&gt;&gt; that's okay. That's okay. Oh, I've got
money. We found some good people.
&gt;&gt; There you go, man.
&gt;&gt; You don't know how many times we've been
told no today. Here. Thank you. Take it
all.
&gt;&gt; You guys are the best.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; All right. Hey, this video might get
like a million views. For real. So,
&gt;&gt; yeah. Thanks, man.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Let's go. We're rich. All right. We
got one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, $8 plus insert screenshot here.
Venmo $30. That's $38. We more than
doubled our money. I can go home and see
my kids tonight.
So, the highlight of my day today was
Leah giving me $30 tip for mowing her
lawn. So, we're gonna say thanks to Leah

[31:00]
lawn. So, we're gonna say thanks to Leah
by
multiplying her investment.
&gt;&gt; All right,
&gt;&gt; let's do it. It's a good looking yard,
&gt;&gt; man. My husband, Stephen.
&gt;&gt; Hey, Stephen. We want to tell you we hit
our goal.
&gt;&gt; We went to Dollar General, bought some
waters, went to the fair, held up a sign
that said the fair is a ripoff. $1
Waters. Uh,
&gt;&gt; that worked.
&gt;&gt; And uh, we wanted to thank you for being
kind. And so we got you money for a new
weed eater.
&gt;&gt; Oh my.
&gt;&gt; There you go.
&gt;&gt; My goodness. You didn't have to do that.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I know. I know.
&gt;&gt; But we got rejected all day until we
came to this house and it really meant a
lot.
&gt;&gt; Well, you guys were very kind. I was
having a very tired afternoon and it
looks fantastic. The world's full of
good people.
&gt;&gt; There you go. And you're one of them.
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.
&gt;&gt; Thank you, too.
&gt;&gt; Y'all be safe going back to Dallas.
&gt;&gt; Thank you. So, I've been thinking a lot
today about what my takeaways are from
this experience. Number one, it's really

[32:00]
this experience. Number one, it's really
hard to do things in rural areas. It's
really hard to sell things when there
aren't people to sell to. That's one
thought I had. The other thought I had
is that it's really hard. It's hard out
there to make money and to be an
entrepreneur. Going doortodoor, that's
one of the hardest things you can do
getting rejected to your face. So,
um I'm proud of what we did today.
Um, the headline of this, the title of
this won't be, you know, I made $1,000
in three hours doing almost nothing.
Passive income guaranteed.
But the the headline of this will be
entrepreneurship is alive and well. Uh,
America is a great place to be an
entrepreneur. Um, people are good. Um,
I'm grateful for the people that said
yes. It makes me want to say yes more um
when people knock on my door and uh just
to support small business and

[33:01]
to support small business and
entrepreneurship. What are we going to
do about those puppies? Well, I've got a
creative solution to that. All right,
follow-up update. We were able to save
the puppies. I joined a bunch of
Facebook groups in Emory, Texas. I
posted this. Some people were like,
"Yeah, I'll take one." But they didn't
really commit. They wouldn't respond to
me in the messages. Finally, Arley, this
mom with seven kids who places puppies
as a passion of hers, said, "Hey, I'll
take them." She lives two hours away.
She drove all the way there on a
Saturday. When she got there, Danny
actually said he wanted to keep three of
the puppies, and so she was only able to
take two of them. But hey, that's better
than zero. You can't force Danny to give
away all of his puppies. And as for the
tractor and the smoker, well, stay tuned
for part two. Share the current office
with a friend and we will see you next
