so I open up Facebook Marketplace today
and I see this a $100 wedding arch for
sale then I think huh this is a good
business the wedding arch rental
business so then I Google Dallas Texas
wedding arch rental cost and I pick the
first website I find this one $5 to $800
per wedding and you can buy a wedding
arch to rent out for $100 so then I go
to the entrepreneur subreddit and I
search for wedding arches and I see the
whole business plan is right here okay
so one link plus another link for
research and then Facebook Marketplace
plus $100 and you have a business plan
and a business asset to rent out
business is just solving problems and
putting things together this business

spare time what are you waiting for
