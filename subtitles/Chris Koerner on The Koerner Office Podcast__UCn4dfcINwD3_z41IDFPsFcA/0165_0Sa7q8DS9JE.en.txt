I'm going to tell you exactly how you
can copy it shamelessly in two steps for
$0 out of pocket step number one go
online and find pictures of someone
else's photo wall and videos and put it
up on a free landing page builder like
on card.co it takes 5 minutes and it's
free step number two go somewhere like
logo H logo.com and find a $3 per hour
Filipino virtual assistant to go to the
not.com for you which is a wedding
website that lists all the wedding
planners in your area and have them copy
and paste the same sales pitch to all
the wedding planners hey $500 for a
wedding to rent out this flower wall
eventually they will hit your website
and give you a lead and then you can
sell that flower wall for $500 per
wedding before the wedding ever happens
then you can use that $500 and go out
and buy the crap to build a d flower
wall follow me at the ker office for
