all right you're not going to believe
what I found why is no one copying this
strategy this business is called go
outdoors and they're in the UK they sell
outdoor products but their pricing
strategy is brilliant it's kind of like
Costco and that you can become a member
and pay a yearly fee and get a
discounted rate but at Costco you have
to be a member and it's like 150 to 200
bucks a year but at this place you don't
have to be a member every price has two
options the member price and the
non-member price take for instance this
tent right here non-member 250 bucks
member 70 bucks $180 savings so the
yearly fee must be pretty expensive
right wrong $ five dollar so why are
they doing this how does this make sense
their yearly fee could be $300 and
people would go there no no no it's not
about the yearly fee Costco makes 25% of
their profit from their yearly fee and
they Mark everything up 14% that's their
strategy it works great I love Costco
these guys are different this is called
anchoring the $5 per year is recurring
Revenue sure it's fine but it doesn't
really add up to that much but what it
does do is it anchors someone to a the
fact that they bought the yearly
membership and B the higher price once
you buy the membership you're like might
as well shop here I might as well buy

as well shop here I might as well buy
this wow look at the savings I don't
want to lose money on this it's kind of
like coals they Mark everything down 70%
which makes it seem like you're getting
a good deal when really their margins
are like 90% so they're getting a great
deal the best pricing lever you can pull
is human psychology I wrote everything I
know about it here
