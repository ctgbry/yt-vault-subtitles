serious question why do we have
squatters laws that protect crap like
this this is a 10,000 ft home in
California that has been completely
overtaken by squatters that are
literally attacking the neighbors with
beer bottles and rebar and this is
perfectly legal how is this okay the
owner of this home provides jobs to
countless people and contributes to the
local economy by buying Andor Building
Homes like this and it's incredibly
disrespectful to allow stuff like this
to happen you can forget California I'm
staying in Texas
