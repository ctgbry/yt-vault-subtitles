[00:00]
why don't you show us your customers and
give us your customers and sell your
Vans and not be in the logistics
business at all just give us some of
your margin and stay in your cremation
facility all day every day and focus on
growing your business and we'll have the
capex and the Opex of the Vans and the
drivers and people calling out and all
that and that was very attractive to him
we're going to go knock doors and find
you more vets yeah we're going to grow
your business basically and and so yes
your Top Line will take a hit your
bottom line might even take a hit you'll
have less headache and we'll grow your
business with future vets that we bring
on because we are not about to buy our
own incinerator and get in that side of
the
[Music]
business welcome to the ker office we
had another call-in show today with four
callers I talked to a guy about his
unique idea to have a quiet room rental
service so basically he goes to the
library to get some studying done and
there's always a line and he thinks
there's a big demand for not a we work

[01:00]
there's a big demand for not a we work
not a Starbucks somewhere to work that
is quiet all the time and no one's doing
this which I don't like about it but
this seems like a really great idea and
could be really profitable which I do
like about it so we talked about that
talked to a guy that is starting a pet
cremation business in Phoenix just like
we have a pet cremation business in
Dallas so he wanted to ask some tactical
strategies should I go to should I
partner with the Vets should I partner
with homeowners or consumers should I
partner with cremation facilities how
should I attack this and some people
might be like I'm not sure sh my secrets
cuz we're competitors but no I just
shared it all I told him what we're
doing and what he should be doing talk
to a guy that does search engine
optimization for a Yacht Rental business
or a yacht booking business and he's
done it for 15 years and he's really
close with the owner and the owner wants
to sell the business to him so he wants
to know could I grow this am I too
dependent on Google what should I do and
it's a pretty attractive price and
pretty cool business and then the last
person wants to start an RV Park from
scratch in an area where a lot of blue
color workers are and he wants to have

[02:01]
color workers are and he wants to have
more amenities than the other bluecolor
RV parks and he wants to start from
scratch and he's doing some things right
some things maybe less right so I gave
him some tips he was really grateful for
it but I actually forgot to record so I
ended up just talking him through it or
I ended up just summarizing it myself in
five minutes to cover all the high
points but that's it today and also I'm
not sure how many of these Q&A Callin
episodes I'm going to keep doing I don't
know if I like them I don't know if you
like them they take a lot of time and
energy out of me maybe I'll do them once
a month I don't know about once a
weekend anymore but I want to hear from
you if you're on Spotify you can
actually comment on episodes now which
is a brand new feature so comment on
this let me know if I should keep doing
them if I should change them or email me
Chris coof founders.com or comment on a
YouTube video just let me know do you
like the Callin the Q&A yes no what type
do you like I want to know give me
feedback podcasts are hard because it's
hard to get feedback unlike Twitter I
get it immediately so love you guys
thanks for listening please like And
subscribe and share with your
friends how are you man great great

[03:00]
friends how are you man great great
great thanks for having me of course I'm
sorry to keep you waiting I I messed up
my time zones and you're actually the
first person I'm talking to and I I
missed everyone else oh my God so wow oh
wow oh wow oh wow it's all right you got
my message right I don't have so much
time yeah no that's fine let's just
knock it out okay all right sure all
right the idea is about creating this
quiet spaces for people to study and
read and I got this idea from when I was
reading for my final exams I just
completed my Ms at University of Dallas
and I live in bikini right so I'd go to
the library every day and the library
opens at 10:00 closes at 600 some days 9
on other days and at 10:00 the door
there at the door there like 20 30
people waiting to get in you know oh wow
and it's kind of tough because it's
always noisy bring kids in and stuff
like that so I thought why aren't there
any quiet spaces why AR there any places

[04:00]
any quiet spaces why AR there any places
where you can go into a secluded room
and it's just you and you
have 5 hours 6 hours to yourself and you
can just get your head down in your
books and study hard you know and in the
M library they have three study rooms
but you can't book it for more than two
hours in a day you know so once it's two
hours you need to get out so yeah I
thought about that and I searched around
and there's nothing like that actually
not even in the 100 mile radius of
Dallas right right so I felt that well
this could be
something
H okay so we're talking about the mckin
library every single day once they close
20 30 people are waiting like hey what
yeah to get in yeah yeah every day you
can't do this at Starbucks you can't
they're clearly looking for this need
because they're not able to get it at
home oh okay is this a thing in other
areas like cuz it's not co-working

[05:00]
areas like cuz it's not co-working
right you don't want to pay 200 bucks a
month just something quiet like a quiet
place yeah something you can pay 10
bucks 15 bucks an
hour and do you think you could even you
think it'd be a like a subscription
service or something that you pay by the
hour or either pay as a use and do
subscriptions as well yeah that could
work have you found anyone else doing
this like how much research have you
done all right so I search on Google and
I searched on Facebook Marketplace
search for spaces stuff like that
nothing
mhm but I'm asking this because I want
you to have found someone that's doing
this right like I would rather see that
someone's tried
this yeah I don't want you to be first
you know I
gotta okay so what I think you should do
where do you think these people are
hanging out Facebook
groups yeah how could you find people
that are looking for this oh you okay

[06:01]
that are looking for this oh you okay
here's what I want you to do okay so go
to the library and start talking to the
people waiting at the door and just ask
them just be very transparent this is my
name this is what I'm looking to do like
do you mind if I just ask you a couple
questions about yourself like some of
the stuff you won't have to ask them I
would just assume their age assume their
gender assume their race write that down
and say like are you a student are you a
working professional are you a mom are
you a dad what makes you need to come to
the library and I will ask do you know
if these people are going to the library
to rent books or to study or both is
that clear yes so yeah so when I get in
I see some go
study that some bring their systems they
bring their some bring their screens in
there you know and some come there to
work as well so people have meetings so
it's always sometimes it's Rowdy and
noisy so it's hard for you to
concentrate if you're actually studying
for exams or setting for some kind of

[07:00]
for exams or setting for some kind of
certification and something else you
know I also wrote A certification
recently my project management
professional certification and it's a
proed exam right and so you could either
go to the center uh the Vue Center or
you could take it at home so if you take
it at home it's a proped exam so there's
someone on the other side of the screen
watching you while you take exams so
this quiet space could also work for
that you know if people want to take
exams you don't want to go to the Center
Drive one hour you drive an hour and a
half if you have that in your city then
you can go there and take your proped
exam in peace and quiet yeah this could
be a partnership play right where it's
like you could be like an offerred
exactly an approved referral provider to
the test precisely to the VES yes yeah
okay so I would love for you to do
surveys like five nights in a row and
like WR down all right Monday night

[08:00]
like WR down all right Monday night
there's 13 people waiting two Tuesday
night there's 34 people waiting and as
much data as you're willing to gather
ask them who they are why they're there
do they have any frustrations maybe
they're just there to rent a book and
that's not your person at all and then
count the percentages of how many people
are there to rent a book how many people
want to study and then use that data and
I'm picturing this as being like a
shipping container a 20 or a 40 a 40
foot shipping container that you would
have to retrofit I'm wondering if you
could rent something to prove the model
but you obviously need air conditioning
in there especially in Texas yeah but
you could build out the inside of that
shipping container with like spray foam
insulation make it like very very very
quiet and I'm picturing like a hallway
on the left side and then just rooms
along the right exactly yeah so if it's
40 feet long then you know you don't
want it any more than six feet wide the
office is and if the hallways like
they're 8T wide the hallway is uh two

[09:02]
they're 8T wide the hallway is uh two
feet wide yeah it's pretty small isn't
it yeah it's going to be so small it'll
be quite tight yeah it' be tight maybe
you could fit three in there or
something because it's 80 by 40 it's 320
square feet maybe you could fit I mean
so yeah so that could be like three 10
X1 offices and that's pretty big
actually for just a place to study so
maybe like four 8 by8 somehow you could
just cut the the thing into fourths and
then when you do your research when you
talk to them ask them what they'd pay is
this like a $30 a month thing or is it a
$30 an hour thing an hour thing right MH
and just get a feel for it I would think
this is like going to be a thing this
has to become a thing at some point like
the world is getting more loud not less
which means the pendulum needs to swing
in the opposite direction for many of us
it's like a it's a Starbucks alternative
you're going to to have Wi-Fi MH yeah
and probably Refreshments like Beverages
and stuff that people maybe a vending

[10:01]
and stuff that people maybe a vending
machine actually yeah yeah I wonder if
you could make this work like in a like
a a physical space like that you rent
that's what I was thinking I was
thinking of you know renting a space in
uh maybe like I don't know look for some
maybe 1,500 square F feet and just just
build it out inside yeah so let's say
all right so I know the space a little
bit because I used to rent a th000
square foot spaces for my iPhone repair
store and I was just talking to a guy
that owns a bunch bunch of similar types
of locations nationwide so let's say
it's a th feet and it's I mean it there
can't really be a communal space because
the point is for it to be private quiet
right yeah so it's almost kind of built
out like a massage place like a Massage
Envy right just like a hallway with a
bunch of rooms bunch of rooms yeah
uh-huh but specifically like sound
barrier rooms yeah go ahead and also
it'll be a self checking so
the rooms will have electronic locks

[11:01]
the rooms will have electronic locks
where you put in your code and then you
can enter yeah MH so you know you have
that tool space for your time yeah all
right so let's say they're 8 by eight
rooms that's 64 square feet let's say
you could probably fit like 12 in 1,000
square feet because you you do need like
an open area and a bathroom so let's
just be conservative and say 10 10 rooms
in 1,000 square ft let's and let's go on
the low end say five
an hour and you're open 247 okay so
that's
$120 a day total potential Revenue per
room so $1,200 a day total potential
very few people will be there at 3: a.
1,200 per day equals
36,000 or so 200 yeah 36,000 per month
total you pay one hourly person just to
make sure nothing crazy happens maybe in
the middle of the night it's like an
Anytime Fitness and there's nobody there

[12:00]
Anytime Fitness and there's nobody there
MH right but you'll have to have someone
there occasionally so your costs are
very low your rent is going to be let's
say three grand a month for something
like that so that's 10% of your cost or
less than 10% so like with a person
there and insurance and water and
electricity your gross margins on this
could be 80% at like okay at full
capacity which you won't be so but $5 an
hour in my opinion is also very very
cheap right I I I I I I I estimated like
uh 10 bucks an hour 50% capacity for 12
rooms and I came to about 300,000 a year
yep yep okay so that would be 72 Grand a
month at $10 and full capacity so then
we got to cut that in half at 50% we get
back to 32 Grand times 12 you're like
400 take out your cost you're exactly
right 300 Grand okay that's a good
business that's a good business but a
lot of ifs a lot of ifs I mean let's see

[13:02]
lot of ifs a lot of ifs I mean let's see
how many people that needs to be so yeah
so let's say people are there for two
hours so 50%
capacity so there's if okay so if
everyone's there for two hours there's
12 slots a day times 10 rooms so 120
slots a day but then 50% capacity so 60
slots a day am I doing that right that
see that seems right yeah Chris I need
to jump off to the other call I'm so
sorry I'm so sorry that's all good you
go ahead and go all right thank you so
much yep no problem
bye all right so let me just finish that
up because he had to go so that's 60
total slots a day if everyone's there
for two hours so that means if
everyone's there let's say 3 days a week
on average then you need think about 80
customers 80 to 100 customers at 50%
occupancy to net 250 to 300 Grand a year
I could be wrong but one person so if
they're there for $20 * 3 that's 60 * 4

[14:04]
they're there for $20 * 3 that's 60 * 4
that's $240 a
month so
25,000 / by
240 yeah about 100 customers but 240
bucks a month is a lot so maybe you make
it a $100 membership and and then they
can book rooms for free anyway I like
this idea it's a cool idea but I would
like to I would like him to test it
before signing a 5-year lease with a
personal guarantee because only idiots
do that I've done that anyway that's a
good
segment Carl good afternoon or good
morning how are you good how are you I
am well thank you all right where are
you calling from Phoenix
Arizona all right I was just calling
mobile home park owners in Phoenix
yesterday yeah there's a few of them out
here Mesa there's a lot of them right
quite a few yeah they don't answer their
phone though that's the problem
yeah that's a problem with a lot of

[15:01]
yeah that's a problem with a lot of
things right people to respond and
follow up and get things that you want
to accomplish done right that's right so
you've got a question about our pet
cremation
business yeah so with the little bit of
inspiration of some stuff I saw from you
back in September October somewhere in
there you know I'd actually had a
conversation with buddy we started up a
business and we're looking at doing full
on creation retort all that fun stuff
and ran into some issue with zoning so
we put that off to the side and
essentially just working as a courier in
this market we partnering with a
cremation facility so we'll drop the
pets off there let them take care of
things we'll pick them up and redeliver
so you know like I mentioned we' gone
down the path with the zoning thing but
it's a bigger you know big fish to fry
essentially and just trying to get
something off the ground so but
initially wondering how you approached
that topic I saw a little bit of
information on I think you guys might
have partnered with an existing
cremation
facility yeah we had the same issues was
zoning it's not insurmountable but it

[16:00]
zoning it's not insurmountable but it
was enough for us to start thinking
creatively and thinking like man what if
we just like partner with cremation
facilities because those incinerators
are not cheap as I'm sure you've learned
yep what point in the process are you
right now so we're just about ready to
turn our website on we're buying a van
having an employee hired that's ready to
start here next week or whatnot so I
think initially going be picking up a
lot of households picking up from there
and taking care of things from that
perspective and then we're looking at
obviously Mak some calls to to vet
offices there's plenty of them here in
Phoenix and get the volume going from
that
perspective you're going to do The
Courier Model start with one
refrigerated van and you're going to
hire someone to do the driving you're
going to call on the vet do you know
what your competition looks like in that
area yeah there's not a whole lot
there's a four or five actual cremation
facilities and a couple I think three of
them are you know actively marketing
themselves to the vets and picking up

[17:01]
themselves to the vets and picking up
from vets and then from the career
aspect of things it's a little more Mom
and Pop there's probably three or four
from what I've seen in the market so
it's Rel for as many kind of do the math
based off of a little bit off your
original post I think it was say start
reverse engineering you know Phoenix has
a four or five million population 50%
have vets 80% get cremated there's a a
lot of demand there right so and The
Cremation facility that we're working
with with they're nowhere close to
running at capacity so we could
presumably pick up quite a bit and keep
them entertained and you know make some
money while doing it so um that was our
thought process on there so is that
similar to what you guys have going on
yeah it is what kind of a split have you
worked out with them I don't have the
numbers in front of me but it was very
economical to where we could mark it up
35 for
commun5 for individual and 135 for
private okay yeah that's pretty good and

[18:01]
private okay yeah that's pretty good and
how does the vet play into that like
with his
markup yeah that's where that's probably
where the line of question that I have
for you at this point leads into because
we haven't quite got that far with the
Vets yet I did some initial calling back
in no October November just to have
conversations with vets but that was
before any of this was fully realized
and all that and it was actually under
the different model where we running our
own retorts and all that good stuff but
yeah so I know that the from what I've
ga anyways I think the Vets probably
across the valley are getting probably
somewhat similar pricing to what I just
read off to you there um so that might
be a little bit of the challenge but
thinking you might know a little bit
more yeah I think the one of the
challenges you're probably going to find
is picking up directly from consumers
because there's no predictability to
that and finding them at the right time
can be hard if you use Google ads that
can work but it can be like the
profitability on that is close to break
even we tried it I think your best bet

[19:00]
even we tried it I think your best bet
is to exclusively focus on vets because
if those consumers don't think of their
vet when their dog is getting close to
dying then they're going to Google it
and the chance that you'll be able to
it's it's very very very time sensitive
like if you get to them a couple hours
late they're no longer your customer so
I would think you'd be more wise this is
what we're doing to focus more
exclusively on vet Partnerships and
starting with the ones that have more
locations just because it's more
efficient mhm yeah that's I think like
you said it's a timing thing right and
just need to pop up you know for the
consumer side anyways pop up first in
the search and in those type of things
right so you know we've got some stuff
my business partner has a another a pet
groming business so we have some things
built out for that and scheduling and
all that good stuff and then obviously
we'll build in the vet routes and the
return of ashes and all that good stuff
in into what we're doing but the the
Vets are where it's going to come in
handy so if you don't mind sharing what
when you guys are working with vets how
do you guys put those uh deals together

[20:01]
do you guys put those uh deals together
what do the numbers look like what the
conversations look like well we still
we're still early on in this and my
partner Matt is the one that has all the
vet relationships because he used to do
he used to work for private equity and
they did vet rollups but with the vet
the first vet customer that we got we
basically inserted ourselves as a
middleman between him and The Cremation
facility and the pitch to The Cremation
facility was don't worry about logistics
anymore we'll do that and the pitch to
the vet was change nothing like keep
doing what you're doing and that's
worked so well that's worked pretty well
so far and we're trying with some
success to get the cremation facility to
actually refer us some of his current
customers and say Hey give us some of
your margin because he was very
concerned that we would go after his
customers without even knowing he
wouldn't tell us who they were but he
didn't want us to take them said okay
well we don't know if someone is your
customer until we already have a
relationship with them and then we ask
and then at that point they might not

[21:00]
and then at that point they might not
want to tell us so we said why don't we
do this why don't you show us your
customers and give us your customers and
sell your Vans and not be in the
logistics business at all just give us
some of your margin and stay in your
cremation facility all day every day and
focus on growing your business and we'll
have the capex and the Opex of the Vans
and the drivers and people calling out
and all that and that was very
attractive to him so we're still trying
it's kind of a long-term play but that
could be another thing that you do is
you go to The Cremation facilities and
Pitch the same thing say hey send me
your vets I'll interface with them and
then your other pitch to them is not
only stop worrying about the Opex and
the capex but we're going to go knock
doors and find you more vets yeah we're
going to grow your business basically
and and so yes your Top Line will take a
hit your bottom line might even take a
hit you'll have less headache and we'll
grow your business with future vets that
we bring on because we are not about to
buy our own incinerator and get in that
of the
business yeah that's and we had a

[22:01]
business yeah that's and we had a
similar I guess to degree anyways
conversation with the The Cremation
facility yesterday about okay who are
your customers and all that with that
being said like I said they've got a lot
of capacity to to build up they've got
four five vets in northern Arizona and
then four or five here in the Phoenix
Marketplace and so there's not a lot of
toes to step on there so there it's just
a lot of great big opportunity and I
think my the biggest thing I need to
come up with in fact to that question I
asked you okay the the pricing that I
mentioned am I going to be in the
ballpark when um having those
conversations with the vets and
obviously I'm selling a service and you
making it easy and not making sure they
don't have to worry about it have to
worry about ordering all the earns and
things that nature as well right so
taking a lot of time effort energy off
their hand and just taking Topline and
taking a little bit of margin but also
making their life a little bit easier so
exactly
yeah yeah I think your pricing is right
in line and yeah hopefully I gave you a

[23:00]
in line and yeah hopefully I gave you a
couple ideas that that might be helpful
yeah that sounds good so yeah so you
think that the pricing I mentioned I can
go to a there I can mark that up and go
to a vet
and they'll be okay with it I do one
thing we we did about a month ago is we
called a ton of vets around the country
just to get some data and I was very
surprised by how high the prices are in
other markets our first customer does
not charge nearly enough and we showed
him our data um The Cremation prices are
higher than you think they would be um
so I think you you could even juice them
a little
more yeah so what we were planning to go
retail or go to the market with was at
least to the consumer you know
individual household type of stuff was a
fair amount higher than that so we're
going to make some decent money there
just wanted to like I said it's a volume
play working with the Vets but make sure
there was more than five bucks or 10
bucks or whatever in there so quick
question for you you guys doing handling
any of the uh the ear Burns and Memorial
items not yet when we drop off animals

[24:02]
items not yet when we drop off animals
we pick up those and bring them back to
the vet so we are in that sense but
we're not like we don't make any margin
on that we're not involved in that right
now but it's something that we've talked
about doing in the future cool well best
of luck to you awesome thank you I
appreciate the time yep no problem see
you see you bye hey Chris good to talk
to you sorry you've been waiting so long
no no problem I'm all good
all good good to see you so it's it's a
company that I've worked with for a long
time and the owners are old and they
want to retire really cool people I like
them a lot I've known them for a long
time and they've done this business as a
broker for pretty good siiz Charter
Yachts mostly in the British Virgin
Islands people go for a week they go for
a boat they they get taken out and they
get people cook for them they go usually
it's like a 20 to 30
,000 vacation package for the week and

[25:03]
,000 vacation package for the week and
it's basically an online business
there's no physical assets you know we
don't own the boats we don't have any
control of the crew or the equipments
it's just connecting people that want to
go with the actual boat owners and the
crew yeah so you're like a lead
generation service or a marketing arm
for all of these
Crews yeah okay and then how are you
getting paid paid by them is it like a
per lead or a percentage of the booking
the commission on the booking okay and
what does that average ticket look like
I know you you said like 20 grand for a
week right yeah the total price to 30
grand is the average I mean it can go up
to 100 but that's pretty rare okay
straight commission you know pretty much
fixed on that booking okay what is the
commission that is
15% okay okay okay does it scale up or
down based on the ticket size or just

[26:01]
down based on the ticket size or just
flat no it's that's flat okay and how
big is this business like on a revenue
basis total revenue is about 280,000 or
so okay like that 250 280 per
year so like a hundred well like a
100ish bookings per year on average
couple right now no more like
15 to
20 probably basically like a couple per
month so it's okay not huge right now
but wouldn't that be like six grand a
month in commissions to
you how do you get to 280 some of them
are larger okay so tell me about this
opportunity that you have and how did
you come across it did they approach you
did you approach
them they approach me so they yeah again
I've known them for 15 years or so and

[27:03]
I've known them for 15 years or so and
they're just they're done and they said
we want to sell and would you like
to take it over and I said yes they've
been a great client for a long time and
you know that you know boating and
sailing and I that's a big interest I
love doing that so you've basically been
like driving them most of their business
or leads through SEO and outbound stuff
yeah ex exactly yeah email paid at
Google ads okay yeah and do you see much
opportunity to really scale it if anyone
would know this would be you right
obviously there's tons of competition
it's just because anybody can do it it's
really about lead generation I do think
there's opportunity to do more okay so
is that 280 is that top line or bottom
line that's just gross that's top okay
totally just gross do know what their
profits are I think they said like

[28:03]
profits are I think they said like
38,000 or so okay where are all those
costs coming from Google ads employees
or are they just like putting a bunch of
stuff on you know are they're just not
reporting a lot yeah so basically the
net income well between 38 and
40,000 okay I'm just wondering where all
those costs are coming from if it's a
remote business they're just generating
leads passing it on I feel like there'd
be a lot of automations there and sounds
like only 10 to 15% margins have you
seen their books even if they're like
janky and not very well kept have you
seen
them yeah
37,000 15% of 250 right I'm just
wondering what the 85% is in a business
like this oh that goes to the Yachts
that goes to the
owners so that money that's what they
pay to the actual boat oh okay so
they're counting the to like okay I

[29:02]
they're counting the to like okay I
thought they were only counting like
their cut as the revenue this is why I
thought there'd be like a hundred
bookings per year okay okay so they're
counting like the gmv like gross
Merchant volume is their revenue yeah
that would be what that was okay because
I think the more accurate way to do that
would be if if your average like cut
let's say it's a $2,000 booking you're
you take 15% that's three grand you're
doing three a month in
if I were keeping these books I'd say my
revenue is nine grand a month I'm not
counting their revenue right you're not
paying taxes on that 85% that you give
them so do they really have it so the
opposite question now do they have no
cost then there's like association fees
and insurance and broker fee total fees
are your costs just cost probably 500 a
month 600 a month yeah now have you guys
talked prices or multiples or you not
there yet they offered 60 was sort

[30:02]
there yet they offered 60 was sort
of thinking about more I don't know 35
to
40 so like one times profit one times
earnings just thinking about it I I
don't don't know not sure yet okay how
much time would this take per week for
you yeah that's a great question
probably honestly maybe an hour a day
okay I mean to me even 60 seems like a
great price I mean you make your money
back in two years essentially if you
don't do any value ad for five hours a
week work 40 is better but 60 is a 2X
multiple on a what sounds like a an easy
low-maintenance business that you have
not only could you scale but that's your
job is scaling businesses like this
right seems like you're the perfect
person for IT yeah it could just be like
this nice little just not passive but
somewhat passive Revenue stream that

[31:01]
somewhat passive Revenue stream that
pays dividends for years to come it
could be it's pretty pretty Google
dependent right now that's kind of the
main risk I I guess yeah especially with
AI and Google playing in AI so much like
it could totally change right for all we
know in six
months the homepage of google.com could
look totally different and they send you
to a completely different website you
know I get that what what if you tied
the earning out to a percentage of their
revenue being moved uh away from Google
within a certain time period so like
they got a certain amount of cash
guaranteed but if you don't rely Less on
Google within one or two years then you
don't have to pay out the rest oh so if
it moved away from Google then that
would be less of an earnout for them it
be requiring you to take steps to start
generating revenue from other channels
right
and if you were unable to do that within

[32:00]
and if you were unable to do that within
a certain time period whether Google
changes their algorithm or not there'd
be a discount on the purchase price but
you could work it the other way to where
it's more fair to them like hey if I
let's say I use cold email and that
becomes a big or I find a a partnership
opportunity with a like a travel agent
agency in the United States and they
bring a a bunch new Revenue like I'll
give you a percentage of that as well
like this earnout they could capture
some of the upside yeah be tied to some
of the
downside yeah well another thing you can
do is is like put a little money in a
couple Grand or something to buy the
option to buy them in like three months
at a set price and say hey I'm going to
spend the next three months trying to
find other Revenue channels for this if
I don't then no harm no foul keep my two
grand that's just for wasting your three
months time if I do then I will buy your
business at X Y or Z price at at that
time period in the future or

[33:00]
time period in the future or
sooner then you can just start
experimenting before you really take the
risk yeah that's a possibility okay well
anything
else well do you mind if I plug the site
no please you can check it out it's boat
bv.com British Virgin Islands British
Virgin Islands all right yeah my I've
talked to my wife about doing this one
it seems like it would be a really
awesome week you just have someone cook
for you and you fish and you swim and
the kids have fun' be
awesome an interesting thing some people
do is they do groups so three couples
will go and do
it that's a great idea
um and kind of something you can't
really get anywhere else it's not like a
cruise ship at all right
yeah okay well well that's awesome

[34:00]
yeah okay well well that's awesome
that's really cool I appreciate you you
putting me on here you know that's
really fun I've seen you yeah on on
Twitter all the I think I originally saw
you buying mobile home parks yep but
still I am that's
awesome okay well thanks man I got
someone else in the waiting room so okay
enjoyed getting to know you okay thanks
Chris all right thanks thanks Chris yep
appreciate it no problem bye all right
so I am kicking myself right now I just
had a caller named Daniel speak to me it
was about 15 minutes and I did not hit
record something glitched out with my
software and we recorded none of it so
I'm just going to walk you through
really quickly I'll save 10 minutes of
your time and I will summarize what we
talked about because it was actually a
pretty dang good call and I think you
would have liked it so Daniel lives in
an area of Texas there's a lot of high
earning bluecolor workers in this area
and he has a lot of RV parks in the area
that he drives by and he they all stink
he says they're all too close together
and they have no amenities and I know
these types of RP RV parks I used to own
one in Colorado City Texas and they're

[35:02]
one in Colorado City Texas and they're
called man camps and they're basically
RV parks exclusively built not just for
long-term tenants but for long-term Oil
Workers or transient tenants they're
typically close together they have no
amenities because these workers spend 12
to 18 hours on the job and they come
home and just go to sleep so he wants to
do something different by starting a new
one from scratch in the same area and
offering more space between the RVs and
more amenities like a playground maybe a
and charge a little bit more but about
the same hopefully and so he wanted to
know if that was a viable idea or not
here's what I told him I gave him the
bull case and the be case for that the
be case for that is you don't want to be
the Pioneer in the front of the line
getting hit with all the arrows you
don't want to be the first guy to try
something and I use the analogy of my
friend that opened a healthy restaurant
in a mall that had no healthy
restaurants he thought man we're going
to be the only one people want a salad
in this mall we're the only place where
they can get a salad and guess what he
failed because people don't go to that
mall to buy salads they go there to buy

[36:00]
mall to buy salads they go there to buy
Panda Express and people speak with
their money they don't speak with their
mouth right so don't listen to what
people tell you like oh if someone were
to put a salad restaurant in the mall
they would crush it no no you could
probably put a second Panda Express in
that mall and it would crush it not a
salad restaurant so I told him the
barric case for this is maybe these guys
work so much they don't care about space
they don't care about amenities if it's
the same price even if it's the same
price maybe that Mark is pretty
saturated for RV parks and there's just
not room for you okay but the bull case
for that is we are buying a park in
Louisiana that has a lot of tenants like
this it's not a man camp they aren't Oil
Workers it's not that type of an area
but 90% of our tenants are high earning
bluecollar workers and they love our
park and we have a waiting list for pad
sites because we offer a ton of
amenities we have multiple pools and a
great Lookout and golf carts and all
that and they don't get that at the
other parks and so amenities can help
you stand out it can help you keep your

[37:00]
you stand out it can help you keep your
Park full and it can help you charge
more but only in certain markets I also
told them that I would not start this
from scratch because the replacement
cost for these is pretty high you can
usually buy them off market for cheaper
than you can um build them so I advise
him to do that we talked about loans
terms and all that boring stuff but he
was super grateful oh I also told him
how to Market this he was about to go
take out a loan or he's thinking about
it to start this but I said go to
Facebook Marketplace put up two listings
one for your Park that doesn't exist yet
one for a current Park that does exist
right and so go to Google Images find
pictures of rvu parks that have a lot of
space that have a playground copy those
put them in your listing point to the
pain points like are you sick of living
in a RV park that has no space that has
no playground for your kids well that's
who we are and here's our price and
here's what city we're in post that and
then post a generic listing as if you
have a park that looks like everyone
else's and then measure how many clicks
each post gets versus how many messages

[38:01]
each post gets versus how many messages
it gets and that is your conversion rate
side by side same Market two different
Parks as if yours already exist what's
your conversion rate is it about the
same don't open don't take the risk is
it three four five times higher then
that's pretty good right but once again
people speak with their money they
haven't given you any money yet this is
just research they might like the idea
of living in a park you might like the
idea of having a park that is similar
rents but more amenities but does that
pencil in a spreadsheet it does but in
actuality does it pencil out anyway I'm
sorry you missed that his name is Daniel
okay that's a wrap I hope you guys enjoy

said this but I don't know if I'm going
