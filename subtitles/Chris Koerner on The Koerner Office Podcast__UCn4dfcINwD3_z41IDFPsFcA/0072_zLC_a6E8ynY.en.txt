newest small business obsession is this
middle of nowhere baseball field that
makes eight figures per year this guy
charges $1,000 per youth traveling
baseball team to come play plus $20 for
parking plus $16 for margaritas and
guess what if it gets rained out no
refunds you can go swim in the pool go
eat in the restaurant three baseball
fields and guess how much it costs to
rent out the entire 300 acre ranch per
night
$13,000 I'm interviewing Lance on my
podcast next week the ker office comment
below any questions I should ask him
such as what made you think that people
would come to this baseball field in the
middle of nowhere if you build it they
will come yeah not usually but in this
case yes I love this business the ker
