[00:00]
I have some legal docks out I'm going to
see how it plays out why would a
Christmas tree concierge business not
work I want you to tell me I saw this
LinkedIn post every month I write my
boss a $1,000 check and if I don't make
1,000 cold calls that month then he can
cash the check I've never once broken it
if a business model depends on spamming
someone with flyers in the parking lot
of your main competitor I am 1,000% off
for it if you're not in that Christmas
tree subscription game then where you at
do you remember that episode we had a
couple months ago about the the idea to
take the random viral like Tik Tok shop
type ideas and put them in a store
remember that yeah popup yeah well
someone's doing that on the prominade in
Santa Monica there's a literal like a
tick Top Shop it's not Tik Tok shop it's
this company called outlandish and it's
a physical retail location where you can
sell stuff on Tik Tok shop live you can

[01:01]
sell stuff on Tik Tok shop live you can
watch people selling live you can test
products you can buy products in person
you can take classes on how to sell on
Tik Tok shop you can take classes on how
to sell on live stream and it's all
right there exactly like we talked about
did they acknowledge that they got it
from us I have some legal docs out I'm
going to see how it plays
out no apparently this company's been
around for a few years but they've never
done like a physical retail store until
like last week they opened it I had
heard that the prominade was actually
having a hard time it's Third Street
promade you said right mhm yeah I heard
that they were having a hard time with
leasing space like they were getting a
lot of tenants leaving I guess there's a
really big homeless problem there in
particular so I mean it would make sense
if they just have some free space to
throw up that idea it's pretty crazy the
company who's doing it they're a legit
company like have you heard of them
before no but they're legit yeah I never
heard of them come to Dallas next all
right Chris let me ask you a question
are we the startup bro or the whole cob

[02:00]
are we the startup bro or the whole cob
Bros both we're the whole cob Bros thank
you you're right yeah that's what I we
don't just talk about startups you like
how I just like bulldozed through
it you're like both absolutely you're
right Chris we are only the hold
[Laughter]
cobos so I went I bought a Christmas
tree and when we were buying it was $20
typically we will buy Christmas trees
and we spend like10 or $15 we get a
permit and we go to BLM Bureau of Land
Management land black lives do matter I
agree thank you black lives matter land
and we cut down a tree and it's 10 or 15
bucks and it's a cool experience we
didn't do that this year because the
people we usually go with and anyways
whatever it's whole long story and so
instead we went to the place that was
selling a Christmas tree near our house
at the at the grocery store it was $120
to get this tree so it got me thinking
two ideas one's a dumb idea one's a good
idea the first one the dumb idea is is I

[03:00]
idea the first one the dumb idea is is I
haven't looked at any of the regulations
I don't know if it's legal or not legal
I can't imagine it's
like marketed as legal but what if there
was a
concierge Christmas tree
business where I go I buy 20 permits a
year so I cut down 20 trees and I take
it and I deliver that to people's homes
now you could get like as crazy with it
as you wanted right like you could take
pictures of it and they could choose it
virtually and the kids could look at it
and they could name the tree for a
couple maybe they named the tree three
years ago and they've been watching it
for 3 years it's finally ready to cut
down that's kind of too short of a
period of time but you get you get what
I'm saying mhm for significantly cheaper
than the
$120 I mean maybe 60 bucks you go up you
cut down 10 trees costs you $100 because
you went and bought the permits and then
you go and deliver the the trees to each
person for 60 bucks and you just made
you know $600 obviously your labor is
included in there why would a Christmas
tree concierge business not work is this
the good idea or the bad idea this is

[04:00]
the good idea or the bad idea this is
the bad idea
okay just kid no no okay any idea could
work with the right distribution and
execution okay I will say that right if
if you got Elon Musk to tweet about this
idea it would work okay just by the law
of large numbers but aren't people
paying for the experience of trekking up
there in the mountains and cutting it
down no this is what I'm this is what
I'm saying it costs me $10 to $15 to buy
a permit to to cut down a tree
or I go to Albertson's and buy a tree in
the parking lot that's pre-cut and it
cost me
$120 right so what I'm saying is a
hybrid if I was if I was a young person
and I'm was like I'm going have a side
hustle this Christmas I'm gonna make two
grand whatever why wouldn't I just buy
permits go cut down trees and then
deliver these to families and then on
the back end charge them another $50 to
come pick up the tree after Christmas is
done it's like your pizza business that
we talked about last week right like
it's not necessarily it's like I'm going

[05:00]
it's not necessarily it's like I'm going
to go scale it but it's just no no no no
I don't shoot there's no idea that's too
small for me okay no judgment here on
that my wife says that all the time
there's no such thing as too small
[Laughter]
Nick first of all Cindy I'm sorry you
had to hear that that's my mom who
listens to this
okay so you're and to and to my mom
you're welcome cuz I'm sure she had a
hearty laugh so this is an alternative
to the to the Albertson's buyers you're
saying it's a cheaper alternative yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah not to people
who are going to go cut down the tree
themselves like I'm not marketing to
them okay that's what my question was
assuming yeah no okay so I like this
because positive cash flow conversion
cycle collect the money up front ven
Momi 60 bucks or ven Momi 100 bucks if
you'd like it delivered you get paid up
front right and you could say hey 15 of
the 60 go straight to the BLM that's the
permit the rest goes to me $40 extra
dollars if you wanted to delivered or

[06:00]
dollars if you wanted to delivered or
you could pick it up in the parking lot
Saturday morning between 9:00 and 11:00
a.m. so I like that it's cheaper you're
cutting out the middleman you're cutting
out the multi-billion dollar company
that's selling it in the parking lot why
wouldn't that work I don't know why
wouldn't it work like it seems like the
side Hustlers Paradise like oh of course
I'll go cut down some trees I'll deliver
them and not only will I deliver them
but I'll pay you to pick them up too
like I'll handle everything end to end
what's the distribution strategy if
you're not on a busy corner like
Albertson's is two things I thought of
to start with old school I know I'd
probably put flyers up at Albertson's
people are there like they're seeing the
tree farm anyways but then all of a
sudden they see this fire that's like
I'll go cut you down the tree cool
you're
dirty dirty DS
and that would be one way I would do it
the the other way I would do it again
this is if I was local I would join some
of the local Facebook groups and just
say like hey I'm doing this this year
anybody who's interested let me know
because there are tons of Facebook

[07:01]
because there are tons of Facebook
groups in Eagle Idaho I would just go
join 20 of them since I live here offer
that as a service and see see who bites
I like it absolutely I mean if if a
business model depends on spamming
someone with flyers in the parking lot
of your main competitor I am a th% off
for
it I'm in I am in I'm in all right so
here was my second idea with this I got
curious and I started chatting it up
with the guy who was there he's not the
owner of the tree tree lot but he's
worked with the company for a long time
and I'm like hey how long you guys been
here we've been doing this for 30 years
he sounds nothing like this but it just
works part this is yeah oh we've been
doing this for 30 years how do you do it
are we just we have to get in contact
with Albert since and they award us a
contract every few years and we just
come and set up the trees like really
you've had it for 30 years he's like yes
sir we have what's the name of your
company tells me the name of it company

[08:00]
company tells me the name of it company
it's a landscaping company a landscaping
company owns H this tree lot right he's
like yes sir like how long you been
around we've been around two generations
at this point so got me thinking I'm
like dude this could be the perfect
business to go out and like try to buy
so what do we do we started doing some
research I find the name this is the
meme of Vince McMahon when he's sitting
in the ring and it gets like
progressively more
excited oh yeah yeah I was thinking
Vince V for some reason I'm like what no
no no so like the first thing I was just
like first I was like you've had this
for 30 years okay tell me more then he
tells me oh you're owned by a
landscaping company oh okay you had my
attention sir but now you have my focus
my grandson calls me the Boomer silver
tsunami go
on so then he tells me the name of the
the company I go to the website guess
what I found on the website Chris please
don't tell me it was just plain HTML
there was no website

[09:00]
there was no website
Chris they were on beautiful they were
on Google Maps because people had been
giving them reviews I click on the
website Chris first of all it's been
Ransom weird can you tell me the
business so I can look at this
up is it the same Google business
profile listing for the the tree
business and the lawn care business no
it's just the lawn care business there
is no Google listing for the tree the
tree
business the first one that comes up is
like your connection is not private it's
it's like I can't I can't go to it and
then the second one I tried to get to I
get this like Ransom where your website
is under construction if you're the
owner of this domain and need assistance
please contact web support at web
support so I'm like dude first of all
these guys don't care about their
website because they've allowed it to
just sit there as a problem second
they're a known entity people are
leaving them Google reviews but they're
still not optimizing it so you know when
you reach out to a mobile home park and
it's like Gary Johnson aol.com

[10:00]
it's like Gary Johnson aol.com
or Lauren Michaels comcast.net SBC
global.org the second I see that I buy a
boat why why do you buy a boat because I
know I'm going to be able to afford it
with all the money I'm about to
make what's
up oh my gosh
so was so good just the timing was
anyways so it it got me thinking there
have got to be many similar ancillary
businesses that are owned by unsexy
companies that are operating and there's
one of two options option number one you
try to buy the the Christmas tree lot
from them I think that would be hard I
don't think they want to carve that out
they're probably like super high margins
option number two would be going and try
to buy this business because I already
know a couple things number one they've
been around for 30 years so they've
they've got a really long track record
that's awesome they've got people know

[11:00]
that's awesome they've got people know
who they are they've got a crew they've
got they're delivering good service Etc
they're probably making a ton of money
from the tree farm and they're probably
making so much money they don't care
about their freaking website that's how
much business they have coming in so
they're probably close to retirement age
they're in the ballpark of like hey man
i' love to talk to you about buying your
business I'm not saying it would work
but there's a chance that you could buy
this business so I know you do the same
thing as well I think there are so many
opportunities like this to go out and
cold contact these people in your local
markets these local businesses that
could potentially be for sale because
they are going to sell in the next 10
years we know 10,000 Baby Boomers are
retiring every single day and a thousand
of them are business owners so as you're
out and about look for little Clues like
that could this be a company that's
coming for sale because you might just
find a gem I mean the homepage of their
website says click to print coupon like
what dude that's the
thing I know
I know and and like like not even

[12:01]
I know and and like like not even
necessarily I want to get
into La Landscaping but if I did like
dude this this would be this would be a
perfect opportunity these this is the
type of business that I'm looking for is
like an owner who's making so much money
they don't even care about their
branding or their website and they're
probably close to retirement I want to
reach out to them I have like four sub
business ideas based off of this one
first of all Andrew Wilkinson was on a
podcast and he talked about an idea that
I thought was really interesting you
know they have like the roombas the
roombas for lawnmowing now have you seen
those I makes sense but no I didn't know
it's like a fully autonomous robot
lawnmower and of course what do the
haters say oh Insurance oh it'll cut
your feet off oh like like as if they
don't have sensors it's the future right
we're moving that direction but guess
what we got we've had roombas in the
house for over a decade still selling
brooms still sweeping right there's room
for everyone here now this was said from
a tech guy who's probably never motal in
his life but his idea was buy a

[13:01]
his life but his idea was buy a
landscaping business and take a Subs
segment of the customer base and say hey
we're beta testing this these robot
lawnmowers we're going to drop them off
and then we'll come back and pick them
up in a couple hours and you just buy a
fleet of these roombas for the lawn you
drop them off you train it to the yard
once you program it and you just drop
them off on your route instead of having
a whole crew of guys it's just one guy
dropping them off pick them up charge on
the drive drop them off at another set
of houses what do you think I just had
the mental image that 10 years from now
we don't see Hector driving around doing
lawn care we see freaking Kevin the nerd
driving around doing Lawn Care he's like
K just got to pick up these robots oh oh
this one's malfunctioning I'm just gonna
go back a white skin looks like a
vampire never been outside in his life
making 40 Grand a
week servicing all the machines
looks like we got to reboot this thing

[14:01]
looks like we got to reboot this thing
have we tried unplugging it and plugging
it back
in that's so good I don't hate the idea
but that just seems like super Capital
intensive you got to buy the landscaping
company and then you got to buy all the
machines you don't have to buy a
landscaping business I mean it's less
Capital intensive than having a whole
crew of of landscapers and lawnmowers
and equipment and oil and moving parts
and oh these are cheaper than
traditional Lawn Equipment they're
pretty comparable cuz they're a lot
smaller oh so they're all electric yeah
they're all electric and they're small
because you don't need someone to sit on
them right they're literally like the
size of a Roomba and a riding like a
commercial riding mower is easily 8 to
15 grand and these do not cost that much
the downside is they take longer but
there's no one riding them so it doesn't
matter so I think for like Cookie Cutter
neighborhoods like you see in the
suburbs 5,000 foot Lawns these are
perfect you train them to the lawn it
remembers that you drop it off you pick
them up so that's one idea that's a cool

[15:01]
them up so that's one idea that's a cool
idea interesting right second idea this
is like far out there in the future but
obviously figure Tesla they're all
making these robots and they're going to
go in the house you can't tell me
there's not going to be a business that
literally just drops off a $10,000 robot
at someone's house cleans it and then
someone comes and picks it up like the
counterargument to that is like what why
wouldn't they just buy their own robot
okay well I just did an episode about a
guy that rents out appliances for $60 a
month appliances cost
$300 and some people rent them for years
at a time they would rent the robot as a
cleaner I'm talking about a cleaning
business that owns a bunch of like Tesla
robots that drops it off Optimus they
clean the house yeah and then they just
come and pick them back up the way
you're thinking about it reminds me of
the way we used to talk about Tesla
probably I don't know five years ago
because they've been promising FSD for
years and like you and I would talk
about dude just foring body a fleet of
Tesla's weight and then rent them out

[16:03]
Tesla's weight and then rent them out
they'll be their own taxi like it's very
similar to these robots yeah well you
saw Tesla release that right like the
design for it yeah rad he promised to be
ready by 20120 we're a little late Elon
over promising h no thought our King
Elon all right so that's that's one
thing okay we're going to go in that
direction that's where that's where
things are headed does it mean that
cleaners are out of business not not at
all okay no and you drop off robots and
do laundry for you right we still have
invented we still haven't invented a
good machine that does laundry for you
have you ever seen those machines
they're like hydraulic machines with
these huge Hooks and they roll up to a
tree like a fully mature tree and they
dig these hooks in the ground pull the
tree out and then you go dig a hole in
the ground that's the exact same size
and just Boop transplant that tree into
that hole yeah isn't that insane insane

[17:03]
that hole yeah isn't that insane insane
or or the same I mean it's the same
concept but those machines that go and
pick apples in large Orchards like
they're driving and then they just grab
the tree and shake it yeah it's insane
so cool okay so two ideas here Christmas
tree what's stopping someone from going
to a Christmas tree
farm scooping that sucker out of the
ground putting it in a pot
right with extra soil delivering it to
the house oh we have a nice real
Christmas tree you're watering it every
week and then you just take it back put
it back on the farm do it again next
year when it's a little bit bigger did
you just invent a recurring Revenue
model from Christmas trees if you're not
in that Christmas tree subscription game
then where you
at what was the original version of that
where you at anyways me yeah yeah anyway
yeah why could you not do it I think you

[18:01]
yeah why could you not do it I think you
could it's it's it's the same concept of
transplanting trees which I've done
you're transplanting it into a pot that
is transportable you're putting it in
your living room and you're putting like
a nice wreath or a Garland or something
around the pot something christmy and
then you're taking it back at the end of
December and you're putting it back on
the farm to keep growing yeah like you
just charge someone a rental fee m it's
eco-friendly baby if it dies and it
breaks then you charge them the full
price of the tree that's a really
interesting idea well those trees can go
a long time without water I'm betting
that you could get away with not even
watering it that much there's probably a
farmer listening to this right now there
like these idiots what they don't
understand is so dumb birch trees can't
survive for that long outside of Mother
Nature someone slept through Agronomy
crop
class tell me you're not not an arborist
without telling me you're not an

[19:01]
without telling me you're not an
arborist I'd say these guys are HOA
uncultured if you'd know what I'm
saying we're so
stupid all right that's one idea okay
okay here's the other idea that I've had
for a while tell me why this wouldn't
work tell me why it wouldn't work if you
want to build a house or build anything
you buy raw land and it's probably going
to have some trees on it okay what do
you have to do you got to clear the land
land clearing is a thing it is a
wellestablished industry okay you can do
it with chainsaws you can do it with
heavy equipment skid steers you push the
trees over you cut them over you pull
out stumps you burn the stumps you can
clear land any number of ways so there's
a market there that exist and then
you've got a market of homeowners or
businesses that want to plant mature
trees because it's the one thing you
can't just like snap your fingers and
have exist they you either have to wait
decades for them to grow or you have to
spend a lot of money to buy a

[20:00]
spend a lot of money to buy a
transplantable tree the bigger a tree
the more expensive they are tree farms
are insanely expensive like thousands to
tens of thousands of dollars to buy
these trees that are 5 10 15 years old
and it makes sense right why can't you
buy one of those hydraulic
machines and somehow find a way maybe
you're pulling city permits maybe you're
pulling real estate records when a piece
of raw land sells and reaching out to
the buyer right after cells and playing
middleman between the guys that are
about to chop down or burn all these
trees and the guys that want to buy
mature trees and moving them if I were
the nursery or the tree farm that would
be something I would explore as a
distribution Channel I would reach out
to like you said tree triming businesses
or land clearing businesses or getting
records of homes that have sold in the
area and use that as acquiring cogs
essentially m CU in that way you don't
have to reinvent the wheel you're

[21:01]
have to reinvent the wheel you're
already selling these trees to people
you're selling them at a at a much
different maturity level but you're
already selling these trees yeah I don't
hate it those are four good ideas off of
that we're pretty tight all right if you
are watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter throw that in there there are
no ads It's weekly it's different
content than my podcast and YouTube
newsletter. chrisj cerner.com You'll see
the link and we'll see you there all
right do you remember when we were
talking a couple weeks ago about dogs
with leaky gut
yes well when I was talking to him it
gave me this idea and I was going to
bring it up last time but we didn't have
enough time if you remember he's selling
supplements to pet owners to fix their
dog's leaky gut and he charges a
subscription for and it's effectively a

[22:00]
subscription for and it's effectively a
two-month treatment course and then
people pay after those two months after
the leaky gut is fixed for the
supplements but he has a pretty high
churn so he's got three or 400 current
customers but he's had over 5,000
customers and when I was talking to him
on my podcast I'm ask I'm asking him the
question I'm like what are you doing
with those 5,000 he's like nothing I'm
like what are you doing to nurture them
do you sell to them no do you sell any
other products besides these supplements
no not yet and it got me thinking I'm
like how many other companies are like
this how many other Shopify or small
businesses Shopify stores or small
businesses e-commerce businesses just
have massive email lists that they're
not utilizing and we've talked about
going and buying email lists which I
still think is a really cool thing or
buying Facebook groups but the idea that
I had would be to spin up an agency
showing small
businesses how to better
monetize their customer lists so for
example these are some things that you
can do with a customer list you can send
surveys you can do special give ways you
can do announce product launches you

[23:01]
can do announce product launches you
could just start a newsletter to give
generalized updates but your customer
list is very similar to LinkedIn many
people only use LinkedIn when they're
looking for a job many people are only
using their customer lists when they're
trying to sell to them actively so the
question is there's like three main
questions what your process for
capturing consumer emails customer
emails which your strategy for nurturing
those relationships and how do you track
and determine success I don't think most
small businesses know how to answer
those questions they may know on the
front end when they're trying to when
they've launched like a sales uh
campaign and they're and they and
they've set up their funnels so that
they can actually sell on a specific
product but once they're in the door
they're not doing a really good job of
maintaining the relationship with their
customers so I think if you launched an
agency around helping small
businesses monetize their email lists
whether that's through a campaign
whether it's just nurturing them whether
it's starting a newsletter whatever it
is and then selling that
locally would be a really cool business

[24:01]
locally would be a really cool business
what do you think yeah I I like it so
not an email marketing agency that would
basically manage
someone's email but it kind of like a
consultancy a little bit yeah and I
would only start with existing customers
because there's going to be a natural
tendency to be like oh well I'll set up
all of your funnels what does your
landing page look like how do you
capture emails once the email comes in
and you've got a lead where does it go
how are you responding to it within what
period of time are you sending them
information I wouldn't do that you're
going like there's going to be a natural
inclination to do that I would just
focus on existing customers because
eventually then if you do a good job the
business owner is going to be like well
can you help me on the front end as well
they've got a leaky bucket they're
losing customers that they've already
brought on so help them patch the hole
in their leaky bucket and then you can
help them Upstream to figure out a
better way to set up their funnels but I
just don't think that they're capturing
information nearly as well as they could
so you help them with their their lead

[25:00]
so you help them with their their lead
magnet their email capturing system and
then you help them better monetize their
emails well no no I would you could do
that I would start with just their
existing emails and just say talk to the
business owner cool what are your goals
how does a customer typically purchase
what is the life cycle of a customer how
do you stay in contact with them and
then help them craft a customer
nurturing campaign or or just
strategy so that that keeps those leads
warm that's that's the first thing and
then I would help them set up other
funnels within their business to help
with sales what do you think it would
charge for something like this and ALS
second question what what does an ideal
customer look like what what size
business what industry I would start by
charging onetime Project based I know
it's really sexy to be like I charge a
monthly fee or I just think if you
charge a monthly fee you're going to
continually get blown up by these
businesses like set it up one time for
them and let them run with it and then
if they have problems they can come and
come in contact you I would charge
probably five brand and I would say look
this is my

[26:01]
this is my
Roi guarantee if you don't get X number
of sales within the next y days I'll
give you half of your money back you
know this with email lists of people who
have purchased from you before if if
you're a good company those are the
warmest leads that you have because
there's a relationship with you already
so I would charge just straight up five
grand then I would work into a monthly
subscription to help them on the front
end that's the thing that's going to be
changing a lot more is like here's a new
camp caign you can run change the
wording of this this is what the copy
like it's it's going to morph into a
more traditional marketing and sales
agency an ideal business size I think
it's going to be a sub one million
business that has a history and a track
record maybe they've been around for 15
20 years like it's that landscaping
company that we described earlier a
little bit newer because that's a kind
of a little too old a little too Boomer
is but they've got a history people know
who they are they've got customers
they've got something to work with that
you can then show them the real value if

[27:00]
you can then show them the real value if
they don't have a big customer list
already then the offering doesn't work
let me tweak
it so I think sub 1 million is probably
too small for someone that's going to
spend
$5,000 on something like this I could be
wrong but what about the model of so
fast tree care right our tree tring
business we have a sizable email list
and a phone number list that we've never
once used right total Hypocrites here we
are talking about
we've never used it it's like it's human
nature like hey don't eat carbs you
do you should take a brisk walk after
you eat dessert we don't and we know
that we should right okay so we're all
Hypocrites but I I just went through
this a couple weeks ago because I'm like
all right let's let's send a mass email
for fast Tree Care to drum up some jobs
and I would
bet I would bet 90 over 90% of Home
Service businesses that are
sophisticated enough to collect emails

[28:01]
sophisticated enough to collect emails
are not regularly emailing their list if
they are they're probably paying an
agency like a a full service marketing
agency way too much money to do it for
them which means it's not personalized
it's cookie cutter copy paste not very
effective so that means 90% of the Home
Services businesses out there I would
put at the ones between 500 Grand and $5
million in Topline Revenue you go in
there and say hey what's crmd use jobber
okay cool we know jobber we love jobber
here's what we're going to do for Z
we're going to go into your jobber
account we're going to segment your list
we're going to find people that you gave
a quote to but never purchased we're
going to find people that purchased but
never purchase you again we're going to
find people that just opted in for
whatever reason and they've never bought
from you and we're going to start
generating jobs for you from your
existing customer list well I I could
send an email anytime I want yeah but
you know respectfully you don't you
don't know what you're doing and even if
you did like you just need someone to
click the button you need someone to

[29:00]
click the button you need someone to
hold you accountable we'll just do it
for you well what do you charge well
nothing we're going to charge 15% of
every job that we bring you or we're
going to charge you $50 for every quote
that we generate for you every lead that
we generate and that's it we're just
it's it's an alignment of interest of
incentives I like the pricing model I
would go the lead route is it's hard to
say like it's hard just hard to track
like did that job close did they pay
what was the actual price it's not hard
if they are like diligent using job CU
then it would it would just be in jobber
and we're already in jobber but if
they're not they have job right but we
would need access to do this anyway but
they might like have jobber on paper and
pay for it every month but not like be
actually putting jobs in there and in
that sense so maybe it would just be a
gut call when you log in jobber and it's
like oh clearly you're doing everything
in here I'm going to charge a percentage
of revenue generated or clearly you're
paying for jobber you're just collecting
emails but I don't know like jobber
shows your revenue of zero I see nine
wrapped trucks in your parking lot

[30:00]
wrapped trucks in your parking lot
that's clearly not true I'm just going
to charge purly generated I love that I
think that could be a really good
business it's just hard like
philosophically it's hard for a business
owner to Shell out thousands per month
or one time for some service and just
hope and pray that it works it returns
right positive
Roi yeah I mean we we've dealt with that
a ton you think you have a really good
idea and you're like oh this is amazing
I could generate $100,000 a month for
this person it it makes all the sense in
the world but there's still that step of
Faith like okay I'll pay you five grand
for this what's my guarantee that I'm
actually going to get it so you better
have a really really good really well
dialed in offering all right quick
question for you do you think that
there's a business here I had a caller
reach out my Q&A episode and he wants to
start a business that's like a business
owner accountability platform form
there's a business out there that does
this for health and fitness you pay them

[31:01]
this for health and fitness you pay them
$600 $700 a month they check in with you
every day via text they don't eat this
don't eat that what you eat today I
think a there's a lot of automations
involved but there is an actual real
person on the other end of the phone the
company's doing well seemingly they're
growing he he wants to do this for
business owners both people starting a
business and people Renning a business
and accountability partner okay I'll
tell you what my answer was to him
actually I want to hear what you think
is this a viable business model why or
why not do I think it's a viable
business model it depends to me that
you're just describing a mastermind
whether it's EO YPO vistage tiger 21
Hampton well this is one to one though
this is like an it's like a business
partner with no equity it's an
accountability partner hey do you do
those cold emails today as opposed to a
mastermind is like I'm going to meet
with these eight people we have group
chat this is like very onetoone
personalized yeah I know I'm giving you
my justification you're asking me do I
think it's a valuable business yes

[32:00]
think it's a valuable business yes
because it's it's similar to those
companies and businesses that already
exist and a function of those
masterminds is accountability so yeah do
I think it could it could work yes does
he talk about pricing no I'm just
assuming he's he's in the same ballpark
hundreds of dollars per month here's why
I like the idea I like the idea because
it's really easy to not hold yourself
accountable I'll do it tomorrow this
came up and I wasn't able to get it done
and having somebody check in with you
every day even even if it's an annoyance
you're going to get better results
there's a reason why what do Sam par
always talk about my body
tutor I think is one of those that they
work right because there there's an
accountability there's a feedback loop
built in to the process so I think that
it's a good
idea from that standpoint I think the
difficulty of this is going to be the
intimate nature of it like in order for
me to have an accountability partner I'm
going to have to open up and I'm going
to have to tell them about my life my

[33:00]
to have to tell them about my life my
business things that are important to me
Etc I think there's a bigger trust
Factor there that you'd have to overcome
you'd have to really get them to
understand that you're not going to
disclose things or that you actually
have insights or you're going to be
consistent so I think that might be one
of the biggest hurdles is getting people
to trust yeah I agree I think if you
trust the person that's your
accountability partner then you're more
likely to keep paying and stay
accountable and do the thing but I think
there is has takes so much time that it
it needs to be a more expensive
product right I think so too I also
think it's like you can't be a nice
accountability partner it can't be like
oh what happened oh tell me about why
you weren't I kind of think you need to
kick in the pants a bit of like what the
freak man what are you waiting for you
said you're gonna do it if it's just
some stranger in an SMS it's like who
the freak is this guy I don't care if
I'm gonna do this or not you know yeah
yeah exactly I saw this LinkedIn post
where this guy he had a picture of a
$1,000 check and he's like a real estate

[34:00]
$1,000 check and he's like a real estate
broker and he said every month I write
my boss a $1,000 check to his name and
if I don't make a th000 cold calls that
month then he can cash the check keep my
thousand and I've never I've never once
broken it and it's kept me accountable
and I think that would be interesting
right I think it should be it's like the
barbell right this needs to be like
2,000 a month and like someone legit
someone you which is just a coach it's
just a business coach which is a
wellestablished industry it needs to be
that or it needs to be like a free app
where you deposit money and that money
is kept kind of like the idea we talked
about a couple weeks ago that money is
kept if you don't do the thing and you
doing the thing has to be provable
somehow it can't just be on your honor I
like that idea I like that idea because
then there's real skin in the game maybe
you start super Niche where it's like an
accountability partner for for cold
outbound and you have to link through an
API to your your open phone or to your
whatever it is so it knows for sure that

[35:00]
whatever it is so it knows for sure that
you're doing that thing and if you are
then you'll get your money back maybe
less of 5% processing fee and if you're
not the money's gone yeah it has to be
things that are easily measurable like
my my mind goes
to let's say somebody wants to grow a
social media plat or a social media
presence and that we're need deep in
that world right now that's very easily
measurable did you post three times
today I don't care about the quality
just did you post did you write what you
said you were going to write cool now I
know whether or not I can keep the money
or whether or not you get refunded yeah
picking a niche I think would probably
be the way to go hey I'm gonna help
entrepreneurs who have a hard time
losing weight that might be a niche or
like I'm gonna help entrepreneurs who
have wanted to learn
Spanish but never have it's like all
right sign up for dualingo and I know
exactly whether or not you've done the
courses and so you get your money back
yeah I like focusing on the vertical or
niche
so yeah I think it could be Co I think I
got that same question from him I feel

[36:01]
got that same question from him I feel
like we've gotten that a few times from
him maybe he he blasted me up like four
different ways what I would say to him I
can't remember his name I know I could
find it because I read the same thing
what I would say to you you know dragon
slayer
69420 is if you like you've asked us
this question several times go freaking
test it like at this point if it's on
your mind and you've been like you can't
stop thinking about it and you're trying
to get external validation from somebody
else just go do it just go see if it
works or not that that's going to be the
real validation whether or not you can
get somebody to pay for it you've heard
it here first bias cor action Trump s
start it before you have it all right
this is a good one all right what you
think please share it with a friend and
we'll see you next time on the ker
office
