there's a boring ugly industry here in
the US that is sitting on a gold mine of
an opportunity that no one's thinking of
there are over 44,000 print shops in the
US and almost all of them have an
outdated website that don't have an
interactive quote feature look at this
website behind me all of them look like
this if you want to quote for some
business cards banners Flyers you've got
to fill out a form and talk to someone
on the phone but the more sophisticated
companies like Vista Print allow you to
do all that online the widget that
enables this is not that complicated nor
expensive to build and you don't have to
build it I'm advising a business owner
right now that owns a print shop that
wants a widget like this on his website
cuz he spends 4 hours a day quoting jobs
manually so I said no problem I'll do it
I went and posted a simple job looking
for a virtual assistant to build this
widget for $200 to $400 he was quoted
$30,000 for the same widget I found
dozens of people to do this job as you
can see behind me quoting $8 to $12 an
hour or $2 to $500 for the whole project
his s's built on WordPress you can
scrape every single WordPress site right
here and cold email or text all of them
and you C copy and paste the same widget

and you C copy and paste the same widget
on all of the WordPress sites owned by
printing businesses pay $300 once for
the widget and install it hundreds of
times for one 2 3 4 $5,000 you will save
the business owner thousands of dollars
a year build once sell a thousand times
