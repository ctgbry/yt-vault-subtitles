I think you could monetize it. I think
you can monetize anything. Okay. They
have these devices that will be Dude,
you're blowing my mind right now.
This guy owned a bar or restaurant or a
nightclub and he created a fake profile
of a very pretty girl and set up dates
for like dozens or hundreds of men to
meet at that bar or restaurant. And it
worked. Like it just drove a ton of
customers and they all got ghosted, but
then they were there. I'm going to share
some crazy things. Are you ready for a
crazy story, Chris? He has over 10
million followers and literally all he
does is
Welcome to the Kerner office. It's
Friday, therefore it's Holdco Bros. Nick
and I are going to talk about some cool
business ideas and this is part two of
last week's Holdco Bros. Sometimes we
record a double episode and we split it
up. So, one quick note, we had a glitch
in last week's episode. We included a
segment that was supposed to be in this
week's episode, which was about using
chat GBT inside of Google Sheets, which
I'm really excited for. So, you may have

[01:00]
I'm really excited for. So, you may have
got a sneak peek last week, but that was
a different episode entirely. So, we're
going to play that whole segment again
this week. You might not have heard it.
Anyway, don't stop listening because you
start hearing a segment that sounds
familiar because all of the other
segments are new. So, enjoy. You're
going to love this one. Please share
with a friend. We'll see you next time.
Have you used AI in a spreadsheet much?
like not uploading a spreadsheet to GPT,
but
oh man, it is so cool. So, here's what I
did. So, there's this Google Sheets
extension called I think it's called GPT
for sheets,
and it's dirt cheap, costs almost
nothing, and you basically type in a
formula equals GPT, and then in
parenthesis, you put a prompt, and then
you put comma, and then the cell that
you're referring to. Okay?
And so, there are just so many use cases
here. I I did this for my newsletter.
Like I would love the first names of as
many of my newsletter subscribers as
possible because when I email them I
could include the first names and it'll
help your deliverability because all of
the carriers will see that each email is

[02:00]
the carriers will see that each email is
unique and it seems more personalized
like people know I'm not writing them
personally but it just feels better,
right? It just it just shows better. And
you can put in what's called fallback
values to where if you can't get their
first name, then you could just say like
for Texas next what I do is howdy, and
then if I have their first name, it'll
put their first name. If I don't, it'll
just put partner. So it's like either
way, I don't look like an idiot, right?
It's also not like I get all the time in
Twitter, hey co-founders, are you
worried about I'm like,
anyways, keep going. So on my subscribe
page, if I were to ask for their first
name, then I'd lose 20 to 30% of
subscribers. So I don't it's not worth
that much to me.
Really?
Yeah. It's just more friction.
Okay.
But I still want them. And so there are
services where you can append data.
There's one called Norbert where you can
upload a list and it's going to go to
LinkedIn. It's going to go all over the
internet and say, "All right, we think,
you know, this guy's email is
johnsmith@gmail.com. His name is gonna

[03:00]
johnsmith@gmail.com. His name is gonna
be John,
right? Sometimes it'll use logic just by
doing it that way and sometimes it'll
actually like connect the the random,
you know, dragon slayer@gmail.com
email to a LinkedIn profile and then use
their first. So Norbert and you know its
competitors work about 30 40 50% of the
time. But this GPT for sheets is awesome
because it can do it as well. So I use
it for two different things. So, for
perfume vending, for instance, we have a
type form where we require their first
name. But some people are idiots and
they type in like a question like, "Hey,
I want to know the price of it and it
says that's their first name." It's like
that's not helpful. And some people
don't put it cuz it it's not I don't
know if it's we asked for it, but it's
not like a required field, but most
people put it in. And then some people
just type gibberish. And so I exported
all the perfume vending leads to a
Google sheet. I typed in a formula
that's like, "Hey, most of these are
first names. Some of them are all caps.
Some of them have no caps. I want you to
standardize them. Make them all
grammatically correct. Uh if someone

[04:01]
grammatically correct. Uh if someone
just writes a sentence and like there's
no first name of any nationality found
in that sentence, leave it blank. Like
it's a really long prompt. And then if
it's like if it's all caps, just make
it. If it's like gibberish, like people
just hit the keyboard, then just leave
it blank. And then you drag it down.
Boom. Good to go.
What?
And it costs like a fraction of a
fraction of a penny per row.
Dude, you're blowing my mind right now.
cuz like data integrity is such a big
problem especially when you're trying to
do any type of analysis. That was a big
issue with all the leads that we got for
perfume vending is people would put like
we let me back up here. When you're
asking people for information, you can
do it one of two ways. You can leave it
free text or you can give them drop
downs. And when we asked them where
they're from, these weren't drop downs.
It was like where are you from? And so
some people like they just misspelled
Maryland or like Michigan or South
Africa like and so I had to go in
manually and find these ones and sort
and clean up the data. I had to do like

[05:00]
and clean up the data. I had to do like
a lot of manual data clean up
especially for large data sets. That's
incredible. Yeah. So then let's say you
don't have first names, you just have an
email address. Then the prompt is, hey,
all I have is an email address. Can you
like discern what the first name is? And
if you can't like reasonably with 70%
accuracy, just leave it blank then. Cuz
a lot of times it's like smith
johnhgmail.com.
His name is John. It's not Smith, right?
A lot of times it's like John7727.
Oh, it's John. And sometimes it's like
mixed in there and it's really really
good for that and it costs almost
nothing. So now what I did was I went to
my newsletter, I exported every single
one, I drugg it down and now I have
first names for like most of my emails.
But it doesn't end there. Go ahead. Go
ahead.
So tell me the name of the plugin again.
GPT for sheets.
Okay. So GPT for sheets. And then I just
go in a cell equals GPT.
And then I tell it what
open parenthesis open parenthesis

[06:00]
open parenthesis open parenthesis
prompt,
cell number, and then you drag it down
and then close parenthesis.
Could you do it where it's like prompt,
comma, column? Right. Right. So, it's
like
Mhm.
I want you to find me the most common
name in this column. Let's just say
boom. And then it'll be like John. Like,
will it do that type of information?
Does that make sense?
Yeah. Yeah. You can already upload
spreadsheets to Chad GPT. Like you you
recommended a podcast. I listened to it
yesterday, by the way. Very, very good.
And he was talking about he exports his
YouTube analytics, uploads it to ChatGpt
and says, "Hey, like what are some
commonalities here?" Like that's cool,
but this is like hyper hyper granular,
which I love. And so for all of these
co-founder applications we have, you
know, we've gotten 30,000 co- co-founder
applications and like a third of them
fill out a 28 minute long type form
asking all kinds of questions about
businesses that they started, what
they've done that's impressive, what
school, when are they graduating. And we
look at this and we're like, what do we
do with this? Okay, we could like do
control find Harvard. like that guy

[07:01]
control find Harvard. like that guy
might be interesting, but that's like
that gets you 1% of the way there, you
know, because we don't care about
Harvard. Like we want a guy that built a
Chrome extension from his dorm room and
like hacked into the the university
servers, right? But that's in his story.
That's not like we don't have a drop
down that says, "Did you hack into your
university servers?" And so we could
totally make a prompt that's like, "All
right, here's our grading criteria. We
want students that have actually done
something. Maybe it was a lemonade
stand, but like they have to have
already started a business. We don't
care what their revenue was. We want
students that have an eye for
entrepreneurship that are ideas people.
Uh we want students if you don't care
about GPA, ignore like assign zero
weight to GPA, a zero weight to school,
zero weight to graduation date. This is
what we're looking for. Drag it down.
Score them 1 to 10.
I'm on Google Workplace Marketplace.
Work. Google Workplace Marketplace. GPT
for sheets
by Tallarian.
It's got some weird look. It's like blue
background with some stars on it.
Sounds about right.

[08:00]
Sounds about right.
I'm in I'm installing it. But I do, if
you're listening to this and you want to
use this, you got to go to OpenAI, get a
$20 account a month account if you don't
already have it, and get an API key
because GPT for sheets will allow you to
use your own API key and it costs
especially almost nothing then because
it's these things are really cheap on
the surface, but the longer your prompt
gets your input and the longer of an
output you're asking for, the more it's
going to cost you. So across thousands
of rows, it actually can get expensive.
So, you want to use your own API key.
Oh, so you actually need to go and get
You don't need to.
Oh,
no. But you'll save a lot of money if
you do.
All right. Keep keep going with your
idea cuz I'm all over the place at this
point.
No, that's it. I'm going to make a
YouTube video about this. I'm going to
like share my screen and
I promise you listeners, you will hear
this in a week, two weeks, three weeks.
I promise you I will come with ideas
based on just using this Chrome
extension.
It's just the ability to clean up the
data.
Yeah. Like it's a big deal.

[09:01]
Yeah. Like it's a big deal.
Like right now, if I want to go in and
take a look at your financials and say
like what's something that you're
spending an exorbitant amount of money
on, I got to go filter the right way. I
got to put in some formulas to show me
which percentages I like. There's a
million things I have to do just to get
to the point where I can make the
assessment, where I can do the analysis.
This could clean it up for me so much
faster. Anyways, that's incredible.
Yeah. And another use case is I tweeted
about this a month or two ago, but if
you wanted to serve local businesses,
sell them something, you could use
outscraper to Are you with me, Nick?
I am.
Nick. Nick
kind of.
Yes. Okay.
He's not with me one way. Now he's not
with me another. I know right now. Okay.
Is that what you want me to say?
Tone it down. Tone it tone the
excitement down.
Okay. Go ahead.
I need you to act less like yourself.
Like your wife always asks you to do.
Don't be yourself so much. It's
annoying,
right?

[10:01]
No. Like imagine you go to outs scraper,
you say, you know what? I want to sell
customer service software to nail nail
salons. Okay. You scrape all of the
onestar reviews for nail salons in the
country. And then you use you put them
in Google Sheets. Use GPT for sheets to
say what are like the most common
repeated words in this dirty, late,
closed, rude, right? And then you can
build build software around the
complaints. Or conversely, show me all
the five star reviews. What are you
hearing the most? Boom, boom, boom. Wow.
Okay, there's a correlation between
number of reviews and the word
delicious. How can I monetize that? Like
there's just endless ways you can use
this. I'm really curious to use it right
now because like there are times where I
get data and I'm like I don't know how
to sort this because it's just in a
funky format. And so I'll go to chatgbt
and I'll say this is the data I have.
This is the format it's in. I'm trying
to do x y or z. Write me a script for
how to parse this data and it'll be like
okay do and it'll you know tell me
whatever to write. This could eliminate

[11:01]
whatever to write. This could eliminate
just even go to chatbt. I could just
write in here and tell it what I want.
Anyways that's freaking love it. All
right. What do you got? What do you got?
Two options for you. newsletters
or dating?
Let's do dating.
Okay. So, I was talking to somebody this
morning that we both know. Her name is
Kelly. She is our executive assistant
and uh she was complaining to me about
her Bumble interactions and just how
stupid men are. You know,
Bumble
just texting out of the blue, right? And
you when you're trying to get laid, you
say stupid stuff and that shows up in
the DMs. So anyways, I was thinking
about it and I started doing some
research. I'm going to share some crazy
things. Okay, are you ready for the
craziest stat you've ever heard around
dating? 30 years ago, what was the
number one way that people met their
spouse?
H I don't know. School in person.
Through friends,
like down at the soda shop, I don't
know, World War I. I don't know.

[12:01]
know, World War I. I don't know.
Through friends.
Okay.
What's the number one way today that
people meet their
online? online
online and it's cool but there's
something I think that we miss in
meeting people online and it's the
social proof like when you met someone
through your friends was like oh I know
Gary I'm friends with him you should go
on a date with him it's like oh Lauren
said I should go on a date with him okay
cool I'll go on a date with him but when
you go to these online dating sites yes
you have a lot more access you can talk
to people you see their profile you see
all this stuff but as far as I know like
there's no social proof
Mhm. You've been on LinkedIn and you've
seen where on LinkedIn it's like people
can write recommendations,
right? Yep.
Or like Sam Parr posted one time. He's
like, "Hey, a friend of mine is looking
for a date and he got a ton of people
reaching out to him." I don't see any of
that in the dating world. I just see it
as this is me. You're putting your best
foot forward and then people are
reaching out to you and it it just has
created this really weird dynamic. Let
me ask you though, do you know how big

[13:00]
me ask you though, do you know how big
the online dating industry is? revenue
per year.
No idea.
It's about10 billion dollars. It's
actually nine, call it actually nine $9
billion. By 2031, it's projected to be
at $13 billion.
So, as far as like an annual annualized
growth rate, it's about 7%. Which is
crazy good for a general industry. So,
it's only growing. It's growing like
crazy. And you're dealing with this
problem where you don't have the same
social checks to get people comfortable
with dating one another. So I started
thinking
and and these are like just ideas. What
are some ways that you could actually
facilitate this connection? So you could
start a business around
local sports leagues that are just for
singles. I know that that exists, but
I'm I'm just throwing it out there. You
you could start
a local newsletter.
You you know the newsletter economics
just for singles.
You could also scrape the APIs or or

[14:01]
You could also scrape the APIs or or
integrate with the APIs of Tinder,
Bumble, Grinder.
That was a joke.
On Grinder,
Tinder,
you had to. You had to. I had to, dude.
Tinder or Bumble and just build another
site where you can link to somebody's
social proof, right? It's almost like,
hey, these are my letters of
recommendation that you can go and look
at. these are my friends and this and
and these are links to their social
profiles so you can see that they're
actual real people. But if I were to do
this and figure out a way I don't have
the answer, but I like there's a huge
opportunity here. If I were to do it, I
would start local. I would start with
finding people
I would be local, find people in my
local market and I would start building
a network there and figure out what the
best way to facilitate that social proof
is and then try to roll it out. Do the
same things that I would do in growing a
local newsletter, but I would just grow
it locally for local singles. And then I
would either do a sports league or I I
tend to go sports league because I think
being active and physical is a really

[15:00]
being active and physical is a really
good way to have interaction. But there
could be other like you could have an
improv league, you could have cooking
classes, you like there's a whole other
thing, but it's like just geared towards
singles. What do you think?
So is your attempt to pull people off
the apps into p more inerson stuff?
My my attempt is to use the apps to
funnel them to inperson things. M
so it's like cool go on the apps find
who you like
but
maybe you don't want to go on a date
with that person maybe you don't want to
be one-on-one with them right like we're
Mormon we grew up when you turned 16 you
didn't you weren't supposed to just date
oneonone you dated in groups so it's
like facilitate a group environment for
people that maybe are uncomfortable with
just going the one-on-one route and and
have that facilitate relationships
all right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubetubes that aren't on
podcasts. So check out the Kerner office
on any podcast platform or you can go to
tkopod.com

[16:00]
tkopod.com
also my newsletter. We'll throw that in
there. There are no ads. It's weekly.
It's different content than my podcast
and YouTube newsletter. Chrisjkerner.com
you'll see the link and we'll see you
there. Could be a dating app for
introverts too. I don't know.
You don't care, do you? You really don't
care.
No, I'm just trying to think. I don't
know enough about like I've I've never
owned a dating app, right? ever. And so
I'm very
I've never been on a dating app.
Right. Right. Here are some thoughts
that come to mind. First of all, an
interesting growth hack that I saw was
this guy owned a bar or restaurant or a
nightclub and he created a fake profile
of a very pretty girl and set up dates
for like dozens or hundreds of men to
meet at that bar or restaurant.
Okay.
And it worked. like it just drove a ton
of customers and they all got ghosted
but then they were there.
So
it's pretty smart, right? It's the
thing.
That's a pretty good growth hack.
I think that any business built on the
theory that people are coming offline

[17:00]
theory that people are coming offline
more is a good business. I love that
thesis and I agree with it. Like the
mechanics of it, I I can't wrap my mind
around it.
I don't know. Yeah, it was just it was
just an idea that I had this this
morning where it's like there has to be
a way to provide the same social proof
and facilitate
these social connections in the real
world. It's fine to meet people online.
I think that's really good because you
don't have this like awkward like
getting to know someone and like what do
they really think and all that stuff
like you can kind of just see it up
front. What if it was something like you
like let's say Nick you're the business
owner you're the aggregator of the
people here and you go find like in
Dallas it would be like Clyde Warren
Park which is like a nice park downtown
it's built over an overpass it's kind of
hipster it's close to everything you
could organize meetups for specifically
targeted to people that are on dating
apps like active on dating apps
and people could have their first date
there that way like everyone at the
event which isn't public place so you
don't have to go rent something
expensive. They're all like they're in

[18:01]
expensive. They're all like they're in
the shared experience. They're all on
this awkward first date together and
they might end up meeting someone there
that that is the ultimate fit for them.
There may be somebody who's listening
that is in this world and they're like,
"Yeah, that already exists and we just
don't know. We're not single.
It's called It's called a party. Tech
this will go viral. We're going to get
cancelled." It's like tech bros discover
a party, right?
But it's like when we went to SM Bash or
when we went to Main Street, it's all
these people who like met on Twitter and
now they're meeting in real life and you
you there are functions there that allow
you to meet people in person. It's it's
the same thing, right? Like everybody's
on Tinder, so they may like recognize a
profile picture, but then there are
activities that are designed to get
people to interact. So it's like not a
party in the sense that it's a general
free-for-all. Like, oh cool, the punch
is over there and music's playing and
everyone just dances. It's like,
okay, you come. Maybe there's some speed
dating.
I was just gonna say that
you like literally and maybe there's
like sports. I really like improv
because I think it's fun to just see how

[19:01]
because I think it's fun to just see how
people think. Like maybe there's an
improv thing like and you can choose the
different activities
that you do, but that that would like
facilitate imposture it.
All right, we landed on something good
here.
Once again, Chris and Nick are super
unique. This one's good.
This is a good one. Like this idea
though.
This one.
this idea the the app idea though, dude.
No, it could be it could like let's say
you take a restaurant and you reserve
like the back room, right, for parties
like 30, 40, 50 people and the only
people that are invited or allowed to
come and you could charge a a fee at the
door that will be on their first date
with someone that they met on an online
dating app. It has to be a first date
date and they they never have to have
met them before and it must be from an
online dating app. And then you get them
there and then you gify it, right? Maybe
you do improv, maybe you do karaoke,
maybe you do speed dating, maybe you do

[20:00]
maybe you do speed dating, maybe you do
all three. And you could even gify it to
where it's like you go open-minded and
you might end up with the same person.
Like you might get there maybe maybe you
get there and intentionally you spend
like 20 or 30 minutes with that person
that you came with getting to know them
for the first time and it's like all
right now we're doing speed dating and
you have like two or three minutes with
everyone there and then at the end of it
it's like all right raise your hand if
you want to stay with the same person or
not for the rest of the night and you
could switch right or you could even
make it you could even make it blind
right make it blind or else human
psychology will get into play and it's
like all right here's a piece of paper
right here if you want to stay with the
same person or Twitch and then like
someone gets on stage and and it would
be really awkward, but it's like it is
what it is. Or or you copy Nick Gray and
you make it exclusive and and you and
like you plan the experience
and anybody who comes that doesn't
participate well, you kick them out.
Like you're very exclusive. You're gated
with who comes in. But before the event,
you send out a list. Here's everybody

[21:00]
you send out a list. Here's everybody
who's attending. You can go look at
their profiles here. Like it's it's very
clear like you're going to this to try
and find someone to date, but you're not
necessarily assigned to anybody up
front, but you can go and you look and
you're like, "Oh, Chris is going to be
there. Oh, cool. He's an Alabama fan.
Oh, all right. I went to Alabama. Oh,
Nick's going to be there. Okay, I like
that."
Could it could be my sister, though.
Could be my sister. You got to watch out
for that.
Yeah, that's true.
It's not It's not funny.
It's an epidemic in the South. Okay.
But you would go and you'd have some
information before you went and then
that would make the the party more
enjoyable because you at least know
who's there. You've seen their profiles.
You maybe you have a list of like these
are the five people I want to talk to.
And essentially you're just facilitating
a meetup, but you're focusing on the
niche of dating. And you could you could
do this with any niche. You could
facilitate meetups focusing on the niche
of SMB. You could facilitate meetups
focusing on the niche of disc golf
players. Like you know what I mean? Like
it could be any niche. It's funny

[22:01]
it could be any niche. It's funny
because like you don't have to pay for a
venue because they're buying their own
food and drinks, right? So, they reserve
the room for you because they know
you're you're going to be paying
customers. You just charge like a a door
charge, the 20, 30, 40 bucks at the door
for this whole experience. And that's
how you make money.
Yeah. You don't have to control any. You
don't have to control the venue, the
menu, the seating, none of it.
Have you seen Black Mirror? Have you
ever seen that on Netflix? They have an
episode that's like this where it's like
social proof. Everyone has like a social
credit score. And so for for instance,
like let's say you walk out of a store
and you don't hold the door open for
someone and the girl's like rude. She'll
pull out her phone and like scan your
face and like leave you a bad review as
a person. And then your reviews, it like
tallies up to like a score and everyone
is driven by like their score. Like
what's your score? Oh, it just dropped.
And like people are getting good scores
all the time, but occasionally they'll
get like a negative review that will
drop their score that everyone can see
and they like stress out over it. And it
kind of reminds me of that like it's

[23:01]
kind of reminds me of that like it's
like a crowdsourced are you a good
person?
Yeah.
And it's like there is a benefit to that
and there's a downside.
I just think in in situations where
there's really that are really high risk
is the wrong word. Leverage maybe.
High stakes. Dating is one of them
because you're you're trying to find
your spouse, like your mate for the rest
of your life. Starting a business could
be one of them. You want to have some
type of social proof. Like you're
looking for that because you're making a
decision with almost no information. You
want to gather as much as you can. It's
such an important decision.
I like it. That's a good one. Thank you.
I like ideas that like you don't have to
build an app for, right? Like you can
use the app to build something in person
for low tech. Yep.
We're not what we're not what our wives
would call like smart,
you know? No, no, no.
Very good looking or attractive to them
on most days
or decent providers.
Good father.
Yeah.
Right. Yeah. Or who I would have chosen

[24:02]
Right. Yeah. Or who I would have chosen
had I had it to be all over again.
Or our first choice, you know, like
I mean they call me Fallback Chris for a
reason, you know.
Plan B Chris.
Oh my gosh. All right. I got one. I got
one. So, there's this guy on social
media called the dumpster dive king. And
he he has over 10 million followers. And
literally all he does is dumpster dive.
That's it. And he has a GoPro and he
dives for dumpsters and he finds things.
And sometimes people confront him.
They're like, "What are you doing here?
This is private property." And he's
like, "No, it's not cuz according to
ordinance blah blah blah of the city, I
I am allowed to be here. This is
public."
Of course.
So that's like that's good content. The
biggest reason why he's so viral is
because of the payoff at the end of
these videos. What's he going to find?
It's a treasure hunt, right? This goes
to like a previous episode talking about
treasure hunts. Like it is human nature.
It's first principles. We want to know
what's at the end of the rainbow. Like
what's in the box? Like we want the

[25:01]
what's in the box? Like we want the
payoff and the algorithms want the
payoff because it means high retention.
So, I did a deep dive on the dumpster
dive king and was enthralled by it
because it's just a video with him
voicing over it. Like, he's not really
talking while he's dumpster diving,
right? He's like, "Oh, I found these
golf clubs. Oh, these are $400 golf
clubs." So, people love it cuz they're
like typing like, "That's not a $400
golf club. That's a $300 golf club. Oh,
oh, it was discontinued." And like
everyone has an opinion on what he's
finding. Everyone wants to get to the
end to see what he finds. And so it's
just it's a brilliant business as far as
social media is concerned. But then he
took it a step further.
And he sells all this stuff he finds on
his own website, lostg goods.com,
okay, which is a a very very ugly
website, but a very smart thing to do.
And I would bet that most of his sales
come from
eBay, Facebook Marketplace, Etsy, the
big marketplaces. And then this is just
kind of like the 5 10% of his sales.
It's a good It's a good name because
it's it's like lost goods. And no,

[26:01]
it's it's like lost goods. And no,
they're stolen from the trash goods, but
you've rebranded it to lost goods. You
know what I mean?
It is good.
But I like this idea because it reminds
me exactly of an idea I had 3 years ago.
So 3 years ago, I was living in Houston
for 6 months and we lived in a
neighborhood that had its own 18hole
disc golf course. And so I would play
disc golf with the kids and it was fine.
But what we really loved was waiting
through the ponds and the ditches
looking for lost disc golf discs. And
it's very simple. You take off your
shoes and there was a creek. The
neighborhood is called Cross Creek
Ranch. So there was a creek that went
across the neighborhood and you would
just kind of waddle through this, you
know, kneedeep creek and you would feel
plastic in your toes and you reach down,
you pick it up, it's like, "Oh, it's a
disc." And some of these discs are quite
valuable. They could be hundreds of
dollars. Most of them are like10 to $30,
but it's still it's like I just found 20
bucks. I just found 20 bucks. I just

[27:00]
bucks. I just found 20 bucks. I just
found three 20 bucks stacked on top of
each other because this is like a honey
hole where you know the the wind always
carries it to this spot. And it was so
fun. Like male, female, old, young. It's
just you're treasure hunting. And I
never sold I never sold any of them.
They're still in my garage. We've lost a
bunch of them. Uh a lot of times people
will write their name and number on the
back of the desk in Sharpie. And so that
was fun too because then you get to play
like hero and text them like I got your
disc. Come get it. And it's just it it
was very fun. So the idea I think you
could monetize this. I think you can
monetize anything. They have these
devices that will beep if it sees
plastic or if it senses plastic of some
sort in a certain vicinity. And so I
think you could build a tool where you
could easily find these discs and like
literally monetize it by just finding
and selling these discs. And then you
could monetize it by selling that tool
and then you could monetizing it. You
could monetize it by filming everything.

[28:01]
could monetize it by filming everything.
And it's the same principle as the
dumpster dive king. People want to know
what are you reaching in the murky water
for? What's coming out? There are guys
doing this with golf balls. Like there
are people that have built a decently
sized business on social media posting
content about finding golf balls and
then selling the golf balls on their
website because people want to support
them.
So you're starting a social media
channel and but you've thought about the
ways you would monetize it. It's not
just through views. You'd also have a
store that you'd resell this stuff.
Yeah, you could monetize it by but it's
not done. So I went and bought a domain
name when I had this idea, which isn't
saying much cuz I buy all the domain
names. In fact, at one point I owned 70%
of the domain names in the world. Fun
fact,
actually, hold on a second. Hey Siri,
remind me to buy all the domainames.com.
Okay. I go
anyway, the domain name I owned was
waterfinds.com,
which is so similar to lostgoods.com.
Yeah.
Okay. two words like and that the idea

[29:02]
Okay. two words like and that the idea
was to do this and then to sell
everything I found on this website and
is this going to be a $10 million
business? No. Could it be a sevenf
figureure business? Yeah, I genuinely
believe it could be even without social
media. But I think someone should do
this. I went and I let the domain name
expire and now it's like a premium
domain name for 10 grand. Someone like
it's not worth 10 grand. It's not. So,
like I am,
but like yeah, if I wanted to buy it
back, it'd be it'd be 10 grand.
Waterfind.com.
I love that idea. Fun. Get you out doing
stuff with your kids. That's awesome.
Absolutely. Someone needs to do it.
Okay, let's recap these ideas and then
merry date or kill them. So, we have
first GPT for sheets, which is a tool
that allows you to use AI in either
cleaning your data or just helping you
build out your spreadsheets. There is
facilitating local dating events or just
any niche group facilitating those types
of events. And then there is water

[30:00]
of events. And then there is water
findiness where you are starting a
channel and posting that content and
then either reselling the stuff online
or monetizing from the channel that you
can launch. All right, Chris, merry date
or and kill which ones?
Now, how are we monetizing GPD for
sheets?
I don't think we explicitly said how
we're monetizing GPT for sheets. I think
there's a lot of different applications
that you got for it, but it's just like
implementing it in your business.
I mean, we could theoretically just
charge a fee to clean someone's data
with it, right? We start for free. Say,
hey, hey, I'm launching this business.
I'm really good at cleaning data. I use
AI, right? We we could just go ahead and
say that. Can I do it for free? Yeah.
Yeah. Is it helpful? All right. What
would you pay for this? Right? And then
you kind of start pricing your way into
it. Go the old the old shout out to
Brandon Doyle method and charge
basically nothing to start and just keep
raising your prices until you start to
get pushed back.
Brandon Doyle beat dude.
That's right. All right. Brandon Brandon
Doyle rules.
All right. Just babe.
Mary did kill.

[31:00]
Mary did kill.
Oh, this is tough. It's like dependent
on like the time of life that you're in.
No. No. Stop horrifying. Just say it.
Yeah. Mary GBD for sheets. Date
waterfines. Kill dating idea.
Okay. Mary GPT for sheets. Date
facilitating local events and kill water
fines.
That makes sense. I would have guessed
that for you as well.
Okay. So, we both said to marry GPD for
sheets. I think that to me that's like
there's so many applications. Like you
could start a ton of businesses or you
could just make your own business more
efficient. Like there's a ton of
reasons. Why did you want to date the
water fines? because it's really really
fun and I would love it. It would be a
grind to get to a meaningful amount of
money, but it would just be so fun and I
like I'm an introvert like organizing
events like that gives me anxiety. So,
it's not really a knock on the business
model or idea. It's it's me. It's not
me, it's you. I didn't like the water
finds because I just I think it'd be a

[32:00]
finds because I just I think it'd be a
grind. It would take so long to get it
monetized. Like if I have something else
that I'm doing that's making me money
and I want to have a side hustle or
whatever, I think it's a cool channel to
do and I think it's a fun thing to do
with your kids. But I think for anybody
listening who wants to just like start
it as a business, I think it would be
really really hard. So for me, that's
why I killed it. I didn't put the dating
as number one, I think it's much harder
to spin up than utilizing the GP for
sheets. I think utilizing GP for sheets,
you can do really quickly. the the
dating or facilitating niche groups, I
think is really really difficult to get
spun up.
Also, the the dating thing, as far as we
know, this could exist. We could sound
like idiots right now to half the
population. As far as we know, isn't
really a thing. And that just makes me
nervous, right? I don't I don't want to
invent something new.
Yeah. Yeah. So, let us know what you
guys think. Merry Date or kill.
All right, that's a wrap. All right,
man.
All right, what' you think? Every
Friday, hold on the Kerner office. Love
you guys. Please share with a friend.
