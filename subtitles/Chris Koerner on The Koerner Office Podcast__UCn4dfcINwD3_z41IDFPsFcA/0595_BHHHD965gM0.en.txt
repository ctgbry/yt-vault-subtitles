look at this freaking thing right here
what's one of the best most stable blue
color businesses out there day 57 of
Genius business ideas follow for more
car washes but how much do car washes
cost to build this freaking much but how
much does this freaking thing cost I'll
tell you in a second this is a portable
car wash and from a business owner's
perspective it's freaking brilliant
because it can go anywhere without any
special equipment your startup costs are
95% less if you're having a slow day
just move across town you get almost all
the upside of owning a car wash with
almost none of the downside the only
thing you're missing is real estate
appreciation which I don't appreciate
there's hundreds of people making six
figures with this thing and the best
thing you could do is piggyback on top
of a mobile car detailing business it's
a built-in customer base these things
cost low five figures get all the
details here
