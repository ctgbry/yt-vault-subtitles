this might be the most brilliant
business I've ever seen and for some
reason no one is copying it here's
exactly what it is and how you can copy
it this is in Fort Worth Texas and
they're on about 10 acres outside of the
city for $150 you can shoot 50 clay
pigeons with a shotgun but they're not
just any clay pigeons these are glowi
in-the-dark clay pigeons what they're
doing is they're buying normal clay
pigeons for about 10 cents each and then
they spray them with glow-in-the-dark
paint and then they have black lights
sitting on the clay pigeons for about 15
minutes before they're shot which charge
them up what do the shotgun rounds cost
about 30 cents each so they're charging
$3 per round and their costs are about
40 cents per round you don't need to buy
a bunch of acreage you can lease it you
don't need a bunch of buildings you
don't need a parking lot you just need
grass this business is brilliant because
it doesn't need a perfect prime location
it can be in a far-flung rural area and
you can grow on Instagram because look
how visual this is these videos go viral
you fling the clay pigeons out there
they glow in the dark and you shoot them
I made a free business plan for this
