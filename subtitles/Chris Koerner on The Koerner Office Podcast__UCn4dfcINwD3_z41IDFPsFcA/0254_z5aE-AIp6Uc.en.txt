please steal this AI business idea from
me a travel planner that is AI powerered
and no it is not as hard to build as you
think all you need is webflow zapier typ
form and open ai's API sounds confusing
but it's not people visit the website
they type in where they're going it
spits out what their travel plan should
be it emails it to them with affiliate
links embedded and then it automatically
posts that article on webflow as an SEO
article to get traffic forever it would
take you 3 hours to build cost about
$100 and you'd learn a ton it's infinite
user generated content and an asymmetric
bet and you can use Instagram travel
influencers to promote it
