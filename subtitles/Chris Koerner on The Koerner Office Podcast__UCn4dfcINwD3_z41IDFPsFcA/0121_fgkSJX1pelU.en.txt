are you a degenerate business junkie
like I am well then you have to hear
about the Alpine Coaster business how
much money they make how much will cost
to build them yada yada yada so I just
interviewed this guy named Matthew on my
podcast who started the second alpine
coaster in Pigeon Forge Tennessee here's
exactly how it looks $9 million to build
out 180 Riders per hour at Max Capacity
the raw land is either purchased or
leased at5 to $15,000 per month it has
50 plus% net margins the revenue is 2 to
million per year depending on you know
how good your location is and you can
sell photos and merch to add 20% to your
Top Line these coasters all come from
the same German manufacturer and it's
basically one giant Lego and they never
close down even when it's raining I love
this business if you can throw together
8 to10 million I don't see a problem
with it I would love to own a fun
business like this and guess what else
he said he's never seen one closed down
