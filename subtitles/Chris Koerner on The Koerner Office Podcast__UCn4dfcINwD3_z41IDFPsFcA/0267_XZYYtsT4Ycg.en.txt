you see this ugly mobile home park right
here I paid 900 grand for this invested
8440 Grand into it and sold it for I'll
tell you at the end of this video 2
years later here's exactly how I did it
number one I was on some message boards
Bigger Pockets someone had talked about
a mobile home park they inherited from
their dad that they wanted to sell for
900 Grand this was a great price I
immediately got a contract got in my
truck drove 2 hours to East Texas met
the seller Shook on a deal and we had a
deal this park did have some problems
the roads were torn up there was no
Street visibility there wasn't much
population growth in the town but it was
still an amazing deal the lot rents were
only $200 a month whereas Market lot
rents were 350 half of the pad sites
were unoccupied and it came with two
Billboards lots of levers to pull in
this deal after we closed on the park I
went to the park met every tenant in
person shook their hands and we started
making repairs to the trees and the
potholes we started increasing rents
from 200 to 350 a month we got our
occupancy to 96% and we sold it for 3.95
million 2 years later
