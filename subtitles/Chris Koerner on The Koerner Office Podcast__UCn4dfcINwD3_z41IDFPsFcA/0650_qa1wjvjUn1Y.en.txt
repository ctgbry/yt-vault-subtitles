look at this freaking thing right here
listen I'm a toxic Optimist but I hate
everything about this video going on
behind me because it's all a lie don't
fall for these videos this crying girl
that's a video from years ago that some
random drop Trippers just sold the video
of the old guy stop no these are not
handmade rugs these are generic Prince
drop shipped from China now I'm all for
capitalism but I can't get behind
dishonesty do not buy products from
people crying videos talking about their
dad or grandpa that just can't get
anyone to buy their product
