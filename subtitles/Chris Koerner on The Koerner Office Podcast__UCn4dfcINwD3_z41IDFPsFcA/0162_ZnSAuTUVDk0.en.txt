all right look at this freaking thing
right here it's a portable inflatable
nightclub I can think of three genius
ways of how you can make money from
something like this number one host your
own nightclub parties 20 bucks ahead
half off at the door if you post a real
to your story about it that's built in
viral referral marketing you can put
these in a Walmart freaking parking lot
on the street corner I don't care put it
in a glacier put it in a cave put it in
a barn put it in a church put it in a
park you can put them anywhere the more
obvious the more public the more Awkward
the better idea number two buy these and
rent them out to millennials to host
their own little parties you can rent
them for 1,000 bucks a night and you can
charge 10% ahead okay guess what 78% of
Millennials value experiences over thing
this is a freaking bounce house for
Millennials people follow me at the ker
office both YouTube podcast and right
here for more business ideas like this
