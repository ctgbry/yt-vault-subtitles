my buddy just opened this crumble
franchise in forny Texas population
27,000 there was a line around the door
for days cheerleaders you name it is
crumble a fad no and here's why when a
new crumble opens it puts competing
dessert shops out of business that
doesn't happen with other dessert shops
also owners can profit over a million
dollars per store if they're in the
right location is this the next
forgotten froo franchise no the next
Dunkin Donuts maybe are cookies a fad
maybe but the best locations will always
win and these are delicious by the way
not an ad follow me for more business
takes like this
