my friend Sam built a six-figure
business installing saunas and cold
plunges inside of his gym and charging
$75 a month for Access here's exactly
what he did how much his startup costs
were and how you can copy him he bought
four infrared saas for $7,000 each and
two cold plunges for $10,000 each the
one thing he regrets is not installing
drains on the cold punches cuz they have
to use a pump to clean them out every
month his total upfront cost was about
$50,000 and thankfully his gimm had some
extra space that they sub leased out to
him for a couple Grand a month he
charges $75 a month for unlimited access
or $30 per session it's a brilliant
business because he has built in
customers walking by his shop every time
they go to the gym he has about 130
members right now and he's close to
break even in his first year the hard
parts are Insurance there's a high slip
risk so his liability insurance is a
little expensive he gets his leads from
local influencers Facebook ads and from
the gym itself he's expanding to more
locations and plans to franchise this
