[00:00]
after my oldest son was born I had been
cold emailing Best Buy I owned this
company called phone
restore and we had four iPhone repair
stores and I wanted a white whale and
I've got lots of white whale stories
that worked out and I've got even more
that didn't work out right and I got in
touch with the CMO the chief marketing
officer of Best Buy and she responded to
[Music]
me welcome to the corer office today we
had another episode of old cobros where
Nick and I discuss a few things but
mostly two big topics one masterminds no
we're not selling you a mastermind but
we think it's really interesting how
masterminds make money and how people
can learn from masterminds and how to
sus out the crappy scammy ones versus
the good ones the second thing we talked
about was forming strategic Partnerships
chasing white whales doing really
tedious tasks that build a moat in a
business kind of like plaid it's a
financial software company that did the
tedious task of connecting apis between

[01:00]
tedious task of connecting apis between
tiny little credit unions and companies
like venmo it was very tedious and that
became their moat or their IP we talked
about that honestly it was a really good
episode I'm not goingon to lie we Rift
on a ton of ideas we had a lot of energy
so I hope you enjoy I talked to the guy
a guy this week he's going to be on my
podcast Nicon nomics his name is Justin
Donald he's an incredibly successful
real estate investor who over time has
started investing into a lot of other
small businesses his whole philosophy is
like he's a lifestyle investor he
doesn't want to you know save save save
save save and then when he's 65 have a
bunch of money to spend he's like no I
want to spend what I want to spend now
and I want my money to grow over time he
wants his cake and to eat it too yeah I
don't see a problem with that anyways I
was asking him some of the things that
he felt like had made him successful
like what differentiated him how did he
see more success than most people in his
position he was talking about you know
he made a plan he like the typical
things and then he goes I'm a member of
a lot of Mastermind

[02:00]
a lot of Mastermind
and I was asking about that you know
what a mastermind is right of course
okay so for those who don't know a
mastermind is
essentially a peer group that people
join to have self-improvement it could
be in a number of things but mainly it's
going to be professionals who are
joining these peer groups to grow their
businesses grow their networks make more
money be more successful Etc and most of
these peer groups these masterminds cost
money anywhere from $1,000 a year to
$100,000 a year this would be a very
opportunistic time for us to say by the
way masterminds are amazing and
coincidentally we're launching one today
it's so interesting for only
$177,000 a month you too could have
access to my Twitter account anyways so
he's telling me he's like masterminds
I'm like okay tell me about
masterminds he's like well here's the
thing they do two things for him the
first thing is they give him knowledge
he's like the stuff that I learned in
these masterminds it's like I went to
University I learned learned how to do

[03:00]
University I learned learned how to do
different Tax Strategies I learned how
to do multif family and real estate I
learned how to invest in private
companies things that he would have
either had to have learned over time and
iterated or like gone to school to have
someone teach him how to do that stuff
so he got a ton of knowledge and he's a
Perpetual learner like he's like us
right he's really curious he wants to
learn a lot of things arguably a lot
more relevant and higher quality
knowledge than what you get in
University way more relevant right
because it's tailored and specific he's
like he's thinking okay how do I take my
real estate and turn it into something
where I pay no income taxes I'm going to
go talk to a guy who's 10 years ahead of
me who's done it and they talk to him
they're like well have you heard of
bonus depreciation and accelerated
depreciation have you heard of cost
segregation studies so like he's talking
to people who have actually done it as
opposed to like going and taking a
course or figuring it out on his own so
there's a knowledge component to these
masterminds and the second piece that he
said is there's a network effect with
these masterminds he meets really
interesting people and over time he's
done deals with these people one and one

[04:01]
done deals with these people one and one
of the things that he cited he's like
somebody in my Mastermind is the head of
I can't remember exactly what it is like
a family office that makes investment
recommendations for the Ford's family
the musk family the gates family all
these like really really wealthy
families so he's like I get to tag along
now on all their Investments and I've
made a ton of money on the Investments
that I've tagged Along on that's just
one example of the types of
relationships that I've built out of
these masterminds I want you to guess
how much money he spends a year no no no
before I do that I want you to guess how
many masterminds he's a part
of well I already know the answer to the
first question because you tweeted about
it but how many Master 14 that's two
full-time jobs how do you keep up with
that he's a part of 14 masterminds I
think he's like treated them as a
full-time job like he really enjoys them
but there's also a ton of just economic
benefit from it and then the amount of
money he pays per year to his Mastermind

[05:00]
money he pays per year to his Mastermind
he he couldn't tell me an exact number
he was more than willing to share but
he's like I don't really know but it's
somewhere in the range of
350,000 to
$500,000 a year this isn't like a
one-time Initiation fee this is like a
year he swears by it he's like dude it
is the best investment that I could be
making because it's paid off all these
dividends has he talked about churn like
how long has he been in all 14 does he
churn through them every now and then
try new ones so on the podcast he didn't
specifically talk about that but I
talked to him a couple of months ago
when when I first met him and he he does
rotate in and out of a lot of
masterminds he has a few core
masterminds that he's been a part of for
a really long time but then basically
the way he looks at it is and and he
says this on the podcast he's like well
I want to learn something so I'm gonna
go find a mastermind that's kind of
built around that thing like he built
his own Mastermind and is offering it to
people it's $55,000 a year but it's for

[06:02]
people it's $55,000 a year but it's for
professionals who have money that want
to invest in private deals and so that
Mastermind is just all about bringing in
private investment opportunities to that
group and that's how he's gotten in on a
lot of these investment opportunities so
he's like if I want to learn something
I'm G to go and find The Mastermind
that's specific to it he's like but you
have to do your research you can't just
join a mastermind because you saw an
internet personality post about it or
you think like oh well my friend's doing
it he's like no if if you're gonna spend
money on it be intentional about what
they're offering who the people that are
going to be there what's the education
how often do they meet all that stuff so
like he's like on the one hand he's very
very very intentional about it and on
the other hand I look at it and I know
you look at it it's like half a million
dollars a year it like it just boggles
my mind that he's paying that I feel
like there's two types of people that
would pay this there's and I'm going to
give him the benefit of the doubt
because you seem to like him I know
nothing about him he's probably very
smart and he's probably very wealthy and
he gets a lot of value out of these and
probably gets a 5 to 50x investment on

[07:02]
probably gets a 5 to 50x investment on
his Mastermind then there's the other
there's the other type of person that
always wants a Panacea a silver bullet
their hand to be held one more
Mastermind and I'm gonna make it I just
I just need that one idea and this one
Mastermind and I'm gonna make there are
a lot of people out there like those are
the guys that paid Tai Lopez millions of
dollars because they just need that one
person and they're going to fix all
their problems right I was talking to
Jess about this and she just joined uh a
tennis club here here in in Boise cu the
winners are super long and she wants to
be able to do something year round
anyway so she joins it and the tennis
club is like telling her all of the
benefits that she might be able to get
out of it where it's like oh if you come
on Wednesdays if you come on the third
Wednesday of every month you get 50% off
if you bring an extra person and if they
bring two people they get 70% off and
they're like naming all the potential
benefits out of it and what I said to
her was like look there are two types of
people almost exactly what you just said
they're the type of people buy a

[08:00]
they're the type of people buy a
membership and never use it or they use
like 10% of it the Planet Fitness Planet
Fitness crunch Netflix maybe like just
what name name your membership those are
the people they make their money off of
and then there's the second group of
people who are like the 10% of people
that are Jess that are like they're
going to use every benefit that you have
that you offer they're going to take
full advantage of it and then if you
call them on it they're going to like
pull up on their phones like well no it
says here
right here in the fine print you're like
you that's going to be Jess that's Jess
right and it's a great quality that she
has and I'm super grateful that she does
have it because it's benefited me a ton
on the back end but that's how I view
Justin like in these masterminds is he
goes and he's like I'm gonna get every
ounce out of these masterminds because
I'm GNA learn a ton and then I'm GNA
apply that to things that I'm doing
whereas most people like you said kind
of get sold on these masterminds and
it's like a Tai lopezes experience where
they're like oh yeah this is it this is

[09:01]
they're like oh yeah this is it this is
what I need in order to be successful
and it's like no you're just making
another excuse for why you haven't done
it yet there's a selection bias at play
where if those guys join the Tai Lopez
masterminds Ty Lopez quickly learns that
and he says okay all right all right I
need to change the quality of this
Mastermind to attract more of those guys
that are looking for a silver bullet and
then by definition of the people that
are joining it it becomes a really
lowquality Mastermind yeah whereas the
ones that he's probably joining are the
opposite they're more selective right I
think that's one interesting
psychological aspect of it I think the
other interesting psychological aspect
of it is if you buy any High ticket item
you sort of have to justify it to
yourself like oh yeah of course it's
worth everything because I spent
$500,000 like what else are you gonna
say to yourself no it's a waste of money
every year but I still pay it yeah like
like you have a need to justify that
investment but what I find interesting
about these masterminds is
that a lot of people crap on them like
you and I we might look at them and be

[10:00]
you and I we might look at them and be
like join another Mastermind like good
luck bro well and in our defense
probably most of them are garbage right
yeah but the people who buy into them
that like my point is there's a lot of
people who want to learn like they want
to know how to buy that first business
that's why your stuff's like your
content in particular is so popular is
because you're constantly posting about
the next new idea the next opportunity
that could make somebody a million
dollars somebody like me like my
content's more like oh isn't this
interesting if you're a leader and you
go and you apply this Theory like
freaking snoozefest but you get people
excited because it's teaching them how
to make that first dollar and so there's
a lot of people who are interested in
that I just constantly have this rub
where I love educating those people but
then you also feel kind of slimy because
you want to crap on these communities
that people are essentially taking
advantage uh of of the good nature of
these people who want to pay for that
stuff all right if you are watching this
clip right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts

[11:00]
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the Kerner office on any
podcast platform or you can go to TKO
pod.com also my newsletter will throw
that in there there are no ads It's
weekly it's different content than my
podcast and YouTube newsletter. chrisj
cerner.com You'll see the link and we'll
see you there I've dabbled in this over
the last six months in two different
ways one with you and one by myself one
was with the tree Biz boot camp we
charged three grand for it was it three
grand or five five 2500 for virtual 5
grand and it was about 50/50 you I we've
never done that before we've never
tested that or anything and I was so
insecure about how good it had to like
that is you know me I'm cheap right like
we spent a half hour before recording
this to set up my $70 Amazon lights
because I'm too cheap to buy something
quality right and so the fact and I've
never paid $5,000 for anything and so
it's like we made sure that it was
really really really freaking good and
we ate at the best restaurant and we
just packed it full of value and we

[12:00]
just packed it full of value and we
filmed it and it was good and people
loved it we sent out feedback and they
had great reviews I did a similar thing
with an RV Park investing masterclass
which is all virtual three grand and I
just it's so much money but I wanted it
to be really really good because I'm
insecure about it and that's why I
didn't really talk about it I didn't
sell it hard because it's like ah this
feels greasy this feels slimy but guess
what like people are buying RV parks
like they're they're loving it it's
great so it's like uh I think a lot of
it's pride and ego if you have good
knowledge you've got to get over your
ego that cringe Factor because there's a
whole world on the other side of of
being able to put up with a little bit
of cringe cringing at yourself right
there's a whole world over
there it's so true well I I mean we're
seeing it more and more but more and
more it's going to become community is
becoming more and more important and I
think the need for knowledge or the
thirst for knowledge I mean less and
less people are knowledge knowledge

[13:00]
less people are knowledge knowledge
books less and less people are enrolling
in University right there's more and
more entrepreneurship they they want to
learn how to do this stuff and you're
not going to learn it online from a
university you're going to learn it from
people who have actually done it so it's
only going to come from people who are
willing to teach how they've done it and
unfortunately most of the time those are
snake oil salesmen well and
unfortunately there's another selection
bias at play for instance Amazon sellers
right FBA that's the perfect example of
I just need to S Silver Bullet like I
can't quit my job I just need that one
one thing that will give me passive
income oh Amazon Amazon's going I order
Amazon every day I you know how many PE
times I've heard people say oh I I order
Amazon every day every like we all do
that's like saying you buy groceries
every week right and so people take that
and they're like oh of course I just
need to sell stuff on Amazon how how do
I do it $5,000 course and these guys
that are selling these Amazon courses
got a taste of making a little bit of
money on Amazon and then they learned
that teaching people how to sell on
Amazon is more profitable than actually
selling on Amon because guess what

[14:00]
selling on Amon because guess what
selling on Amazon's really hard and they
crunch your margin and it's logistically
difficult so it's just the like the
worst kind of float to the top and sell
all these courses because there's more
money in that than doing the actual
thing totally agree I totally agree I
have two more thoughts about this I'm
glad you brought this up because it's
bubbling stuff to the surface you know
who's like the most bullish on education
in like this whole Space
right it's Alex Bro
mosy brother himself brother that's why
he went all in on school is because he's
sold he's like traditional education is
on the way out like look at
homeschooling look at charts look at
higher education enrollment it's all
trending downward and untraditional
education is trending upward and so he
never promoted any of his portfolio
businesses until he went all in on
school and because he just he believes
in the thesis of untraditional Education
that's my first thought I think that's
that's awesome I agree with it second

[15:01]
that's awesome I agree with it second
thought I'm close with someone we both
know him but I won't mention him on the
podcast who just joined a mastermind
$50,000 a
year and he he didn't even know if it
was he had already paid but he didn't
know if it was per year or not and I was
like probably per year it's probably per
year but it's the bigger po Pockets
Mastermind and it's not just a Bigger
Pockets Mastermind I think they have a
bunch but it's the founder of Bigger
Pockets like personal Mastermind and
it's at 50 people 50,000 each and you
have you of course you have to go
through the application process and
they're very selective and it's very
strategically introduce friction to make
sure that it seems exclusive of course
of course I mean we're talking 2.5 mil a
year for a mastermind and do they have
like Retreats and stuff yeah but you pay
extra for those it's just it it blows my
mind but guess what like this guy is
raising money for real estate and it's
only for guys that are raising money for
real estate and he's probably going to

[16:01]
real estate and he's probably going to
be able to raise six or seven figures
from this $50,000 Mastermind probably
the thing is I believe in masterminds
like you said you've got a selection
bias anybody who's joining that
Mastermind who's normal what are they
going to say I got to justify this
investment right and how do you justify
the investment I already described it
you do it one of two ways you either get
the right education which they're going
to be asking questions they're going to
be engaged they're going to be trying to
learn as much they can and you're going
to build a network so by virtue of the
fact that you're paying to be there
you're incentivized to go network with
other people so it's like this isn't
like a mix and mingle event where it's
like oh I guess I'll show up or maybe
I'll talk to somebody he's like no I
paid 50 Grand like I'm gonna talk to
Chris hey Chris what are you working on
oh that's cool could we partner on
something like there is a a real
incentive for them to work together so I
I think that in and of itself is going
to make it worth for whoever you know

[17:00]
to make it worth for whoever you know
the guys is that that you're talking
about that paid 50 Grand to be a part of
that Mastermind because the other guys
in that Mastermind want to make it
worthwhile as well it'll pay off in
Spades but it won't be a Ono one yeah I
mean I guess it can't be right because
it's so expensive brosi also he in as
part of like his origin story is he had
$5,000 to his name and he pushed it all
into this Guru marketing Mastermind and
it taught him about webinars and
webinars he started pushing ads for gym
launch to a webinar and it didn't work
but then he tried something else and it
did work and he was like that Mastermind
changed my life y y y so he sold on it
too even though it was like he didn't
even learn anything that led him to
success he learned something that
planted a seed that he pivoted away from
that led him to success so what's the
difference right he got value from it
it's true you believe in masterminds and
I believe in the underrated movie
masterminds with Zack Alanis Kristen wig
Kate McKinnon Owen Wilson and Jason
sudakis I mean that is a roster 34% on
Rotten Tomatoes but what about that time
when he says when they farted on each

[18:02]
when he says when they farted on each
other and he said you just gave me a
fart transplant that's a great line
that's what I believe in that's my
ethos it's under it's an underated you
got next
quote what do I got all right balls in
my court I want to talk to you about a
white whale that I learned about okay we
like white
whales
triggered I know been race into this but
whatever this is a company an Irish
company that raised 2.5 million in seed
funding and they probably didn't even
need to oh $2.5 million for me Lucky
Charms
okay okay okay they raised 2.5 million
and they basically their whole bit
company was built on one partnership
with this little known company you may
have heard of called Apple okay never
heard you know what they do you know
what these guys do they're out of
Ireland I already said that
they remanufacture they manage all of

[19:02]
they remanufacture they manage all of
Apple's iPhones BuyBacks trade-ins
whatever you want to call it all of them
one company out of Ireland Apple doesn't
do any of it themselves so like you go
to the Apple Store I want the new iPhone
okay we we'll give you a $100 credit for
your old one you trade in your old one
they send it to these guys it's a
billion dooll company that's I'm sure
they have other customers by now but
it's all based around Apple does Apple
own mind I don't think so it's an
independent company so I don't know if
it's funny we don't talk about these
things before we hop on this call so
this wasn't uh planned so Apple in
particular but there's a lot of other
large American corporations that shelter
their profits overseas have you ever
heard of the term
repatriation so the government like a
lot of elected officials are like we
want Apple to repatriate that money cuz
we need it back in the United States and
we want to pay taxes on it and that a
big reason or justification for the

[20:00]
big reason or justification for the
Trump tax cuts because he's like well
they're just sitting overseas we should
bring them back repatriate them at least
get some taxes for it but for Apple
Ireland is like the place where they
house the majority of their profits I
wonder if there's some relationship
there where it's like well we're already
here in Ireland and may like maybe
that's a huge I don't even know Money
Maker for them so they decided to
partner with an Irish company in order
to skirt American tax law or something
if it's funny a lot of times you hear
like these origin stories and they sound
really inspiring and beautiful and
sometimes they are they actually are
that story but a lot of times like what
this could be is like some apple
executive that was like you know we
really shouldn't it's like there's too
much liability for us to in-house this
because of you know everything happening
in China we should really Outsource this
hey Tim what if I mov to Ireland and I
just like happen to start a startup and
then maybe we meet over coffee on day
and then maybe I'm a billion dollar
company I'm just spitballing here this
conversation never
happened like

[21:01]
happened like
honestly
it that could be the case absolutely
could be the case absolutely I mean this
is they're called Alchemy this is on
their homepage $440 million in annual
revenues that's insane insane that is
insane and that that literally is a
white whale you've heard like s par
talks about this I think it's SAR where
he's like he wants to be a barnacle on a
whale or like some some saying of that
where it's like he doesn't need to be
the whale he doesn't need to be apple
you just need to figure out what company
you can be to sort of tag along with
apple and ride their wave I wonder if
that conversation with Tim Cook he's
like what what are you gonna call it I
don't know I mean really we're just
going to be like printing money we're
gonna be like creating gold out of thin
air how about alchemy Alchemy is a great
name oh I like that I'll tell you what
well hey Tim's from Auburn he does kind
of talk talk like I know I know you're
accent was actually relevant for once I

[22:02]
accent was actually relevant for once I
for for once what what you could say
anything in a Southern accent and it's
just better it's just more funny it's a
good one anyway but like maybe the
origin story there is it was just some
entrepreneur that pulled himself up by
the bootstraps and kept cold emailing
Apple until one day they answered and
said we had never even thought about
buying back iPhones thank you for that
idea huh I wonder what are some
other white whales like like this I got
one I got one for you let's go I don't
you might not remember this story but
the day after my oldest son was born I
had been cold emailing Best Buy I I
owned this company called phone
store and we had four iPhone repair
stores and I wanted a white whale and
I've got lots of white whale stories
that worked out and I've got even more
that didn't work out right and I got in
touch with the CMO the chief marketing
officer of Best Buy and she responded to
me and I was basically like LinkedIn

[23:02]
me and I was basically like LinkedIn
exactly and I was like Best Buy needs to
be repairing phones this was 2010 2010
like you got the Geek Squad and they
that was a company they bought out and
inh housed so I'm like okay there's
precedent for Best by partnering with
small local companies why not phone
restore like why isn't either Geek Squad
fixing these things they're already
going to customers houses or why don't
they have and they bought a company
called Magnolia Audio Visual and so they
in-house that basically installing
audiovisual stuff so I thought okay
there's two examples of Best Buy
partnering with these small companies
why not me and I hopped on a call with
the CMO the day after my oldest son was
born and she was kind of like oh
interesting oh and then like they
ghosted me right it didn't work out and
to this day they're not fixing
phones like and their stock doesn't look
great and but they have learned that a
lot of their profits are in services and
not selling Hardware right this could
have been a perfect addition to them
they missed out too bad for them look at

[24:02]
they missed out too bad for them look at
me look at me now I got a podcast and
they're just they're just slanging
they're slanging MacBooks up in
Minnesota
nerds oh but I like the idea more
broadly speaking of having a fund a
white whale fund right where you throw a
little money at these guys that just
have these dreams of partnering with the
apples of the world and you just take a
tiny single digit percentage equity and
you're really just buying into their
Charisma there is and their plans and
maybe you lose 25 Grand or maybe at a
th000 X's the white whale fund by that
domain it's a good one I wonder if like
the better way would be to find
Executives at those
organizations you recently started
asking this on your podcast right I
can't remember exactly how you say it
but like what businesses do you think
would be good to start tangentially to
your current business what what are you
seeing in your industry tangential to
your industry that seem like amazing

[25:00]
your industry that seem like amazing
opportunities but you're too focused to
ever Chase but other people could dude
like
that that would be an amazing question
to just like spam out and see who you
get responses from at these Executives
of large companies because I'm sure that
there are pain points that they have
that they're just not that are not being
addressed and you ask that question hey
what are you seeing in your industry
that other people aren't seeing you
gather some of this information and then
you make a bet or a decision or maybe
you recruit one of them or maybe you
like because getting the idea from the
Insiders would be an amazing way jump
start this back to our theory about
alchemy and
apple of course they were seeing yeah we
should probably be repairing these
inhouse like how do we get this done and
then they just partner with somebody to
Outsource the Fulfillment of it that
would be a really cool fund so yeah okay
so you just took my idea and leveled it
up so forget my $25,000 Angel checks
into these you know young Hustlers that
have this big white whale dream you go
to the mid-level executives or even the

[26:01]
to the mid-level executives or even the
middle managers that see this
opportunity that have tasted
entrepreneurship maybe they've been an
entrepreneur in the past because a lot
of people see opportunity but they don't
care about it they don't even see it as
opportunity it's a paino but it's just
like they look at it as a negative like
oh my job sucks because we don't know
what to do with these iPhones they just
sit in drawers and then they depreciate
and other people are like H like if I
worked at a company are you kidding me
like I would be starting so many things
and so maybe the fund here is to raise
$10 million and to go find these guys
that are making 250 Grand a year that
see opportunity and want to execute on
it but they've got golden handcuffs
right and you say Okay instead of
$225,000 check here's a $500,000 check
this is going to float your salary for
two to three years and you're just going
to get on the phone right after you quit
let me see your non-compete we're good
okay what state do you live in have our
lawyer look over it all right I want you
to go chase down those opportunities
we're going to pay for your salary and
we're going to have 20% equity and

[27:00]
we're going to have 20% equity and
whatever it is you do dude okay can I
level it up again because this is one of
the ideas I wanted to talk about today
but I think it would be perfect to pair
with this do you remember remember in
2010 I can't remember when it was when
you decided you were going to mail
physical letters to people that looked
like they were handwritten but they were
really just you know typed out and
handwriting it was it was a real estate
thing I can't remember exactly yellow
yellow letters yeah yeah letters so
Danny my brother-in-law he's looking for
a business right now to buy and he
targeted 100 skilled nursing
facilities and he found information
about each one of them and he found
anyways he typed up this the specific
information and then he used this
company called click send.com okay where
he like uploaded the text they printed
it out for him they sent the letter and
he's gotten three or four leads that
could be millions of dollars m right mhm
so I'm sitting there I'm hearing the

[28:01]
so I'm sitting there I'm hearing the
story and I'm like dude if you had a
list and in this example let's say it's
people but in other examples it could be
businesses if you had a list and you're
like these are 200 people that I'd like
to cold Outreach and you upload it to J
chat GPT and because chat GPT is going
to go crawl the web you could say give
me one or two specific things about each
one of these people based on their
social media presence based on a press
release whatever something specific to
them and then you have sort of a
template message like hey so and so what
opportunities are you seeing within your
industry but there's a line in there
that says hey so and so I love how you
think about X Y and Z and so then you
take what chat GPT goes and scrapes the
web and finds unique to them add it to
that list upload it to click Send and
then you've got handwritten letters or I
mean they also send like SMS text
messages they send LinkedIn they send

[29:00]
messages they send LinkedIn they send
Twitter like they send you know all the
emails all the other DMS but you've got
high value list you've got specific
information that hopefully catches their
attention and then you've got a means of
distribution to reach out to them so I'm
combining these two ideas because that
could be a really cool way to reach out
to let's say you you identify 10 whale
companies and then you find all the
executives in those companies you reach
out to them with this approach and you
just see kind of what comes back and
it's not going to take you 80 hours
hours to do it like it might have taken
it back in the day it's funny you say
that because before I called that Best
Buy CMO I I met with my mentor John
Nolan and I was like all right how do I
prep for this call like what do I do and
he's like we'll pull her up on LinkedIn
he's like okay and I think this is she
played women's basketball at Gonzaga I
believe he's like okay women's
basketball at Gonzaga and this guy does
like psychological profiles for a living
right it's like okay that means she's
going to have this personality type that
means you're going to need to approach
it this way and basically what you're
saying is is a scale version of that
exactly right because that takes time

[30:02]
exactly right because that takes time
yeah but it works it makes a huge
difference so to level that up a little
bit so I use this ringless voicemail
software right right and one click you
upload a bunch of phone numbers you
record one voicemail hey I'm actually
looking to buy mobile home parks so are
you interested in selling yours please
call me back and it will drop a
voicemail on their phone without their
phone ever ringing and it's awesome and
hardly anyone uses it and it's weapon
ah it is it is but you got to do it
right you can't do it on the Do Not Call
List anyway they just came out with a
new feature where they and I've been
like waiting for this feature because
it's like the Technology's been there
since chat gbt and you upload a list of
names and then it will take your voice
clone it and it will say their first
name in the beginning of the voicemail
right hey Melissa this is hey like of
course of course dude of course so I
haven't even used it yet but of course
the opportunities are endless well and

[31:02]
the opportunities are endless well and
like I said I didn't think about this
until I was talking to Danny yesterday
but go on chat gbt right now and be like
who's Chris kerer and it like it will
give you good information that it's
obviously pulled from Twitter or
LinkedIn or like wherever you're posting
so you get a list of people yeah there's
going to be a lot of them that may or
may not have good information but
there's going to be also a good few of
them where you have really pertinent
information that you can then tailor to
a pitch it just like cuts down the time
and amps up the like specificity of your
pitch and the likelihood that they're
actually GNA read it and respond to it
if you ask chat GPT for instance like
who Chris Kerner is it doesn't know like
about second families in Canada and
stuff right like it doesn't yeah okay no
it know about your
SSA what oh I had to you had to's
bulldozing he's
bulldozing oh jeez well I like that
idea white whale fund exact white whale

[32:02]
idea white whale fund exact white whale
fund and creative prospecting now with
chat GPT artificial
intelligence okay I like it I got one
for you you ready always there's a
company out there called Odo o d KO okay
okay and it is founded by a guy named
danne Atkinson and I'm pretty sure he
was a co-founder of Squarespace
okay and Squarespace is an interesting
case study in and of itself because they
basically were one of the first
companies to unlock how powerful podast
ads were podcast specifically oh Square
I thought Squarespace was with the one
with the anyways I'm sorry edit that out
Muhammad it's an easy drag and drop
website builder okay yeah they
advertised on a podcast and it crushed
and so they basically said we want all
the podcasts like Casper did and
athletic greens and all those okay

[33:00]
athletic greens and all those okay
anyway this guy he sold his steak in
Squarespace I think I don't know and he
started this company called Odo and they
basically are the middleman between
supply chain and local coffee shops
basically everyone except Starbucks and
all the bigname brand coffee shops so
they go to The Growers they go to the
suppliers and they match it with these
local coffee shop vendors and then in
addition they give them software they do
everything and so coffee shops sign up
with them and they buy their coffee
through them and they buy their software
through them and it basically makes
their lives a ton easier and they have
grown from zero to 150 million in their
first two years doing this with coffee
shops okay I'm an idiot and I also
wasn't
listening
but is the software that helps manage
all this stuff and they also act as a
middleman that's part of it it's like a
marketplace where they match like coffee
Growers with coffee shops so it's a

[34:01]
Growers with coffee shops so it's a
Marketplace and a software and a Supply
Chain management Allin one platform that
these independent coffee shops can use
so they don't have to buy from Cisco
like the hundred billion dollar
companies out there but they also don't
have to go start calling cold calling
growers in Nicaragua so it's effectively
lowering the
cost
for local coffee shops to acquire and
opening the accessibility for them to
Source better coffee more easily right
because it's a Marketplace
yeah so I love this idea because coffee
is just the first case study I think
it's a very hard business I think it's
extremely hard very tedious but I love
businesses that are extremely tedious on
the front end like for instance plaid
right plaid was very tedious because
Idaho Central Credit Union was never
going to link with venmo right and plaid
came in there and said okay we're going
to learn Idaho Central Credit Union's a

[35:00]
to learn Idaho Central Credit Union's a
API or we're going to build an API for
them and it's going to suck and it's
going to cost us 15 grand in developer
hours but once we have it we have it and
so we're going to do that with all the
credit unions all these random Banks
everyone not named Chaser Bank of
America and we're going to put it all in
one place and all this data is going to
siphon through us which is very valuable
data because it's consumers purchasing
Behavior will sell the data I just love
businesses that are built on an Inc
incredibly tedious
process because that's becomes a moe
it's becomes a moe like people think you
have to have this special IP or a bunch
of fundraising or this brand new idea to
have a moat but often times you just
need to do something that's really sucky
and
tedious we feel the same way about
marketplaces they're just really hard to
build because you have to bring buyers
and sellers to the marketplace time what
you're describing is like a unicorn
esque idea where it's going to take a
lot of time a lot of of money a lot of
Education to get people on both sides of

[36:00]
Education to get people on both sides of
the platform I'm not saying it's a bad
idea I'm just saying So eventually yes
but if you read the like the founding
story of Odo it started with him going
to coffee shops in person every day and
learning their needs and literally going
to the same shop every day and observing
and like doing things that really didn't
scale very well and building out the
product just for three coffee shops that
were within a f minute walk of his house
this is where I was going with it is
like coffee is an example of a broader
Trend that is happening which is people
want what's the word specialized Niche
products right like the episode in
Portlandia where they're like is this
chicken locally sourced what was his
name where does he come from right like
they they want products that are higher
quality and that are Niche so I think
coffe is an example but if I was an
entrepreneur looking at this who who had
experience in a niche product let's say
it was chocolate or let's say it was
food commodity I would go and try and

[37:00]
food commodity I would go and try and
find a small producer of that in South
America let's say and then work on the
distribution end in the United States
and kind of be the wholesale wholesaler
middleman because the hardest part of a
changing preference is education but if
people are already educated on it and
they're already like oh I want Artisan
that was the word I want Artisan food I
want craft beer I want these hypers
specialized products they already want
that then you're just bringing it to
them you're like hi can I introduce you
to Juan he runs locally sourced 100%
organic farm in Guatemala that produces
you know what I mean like all a sudden
people like Guatemala or Guatemala
Juan's like I'm just a farmer but
okay Juan's like Nick I went to school
with you we graduated from USC together
shut up Juan shut ju I need you to be
like yeah I manes a hedge

[38:01]
fund but it's just marketing at that
point it's all marketing at that point
and if you can find one producer and
then be the means of
distribution you can capture as a
wholesaler sort of that margin in
between because of your expertise so I I
like that that aspect of it yeah I think
that's how AO started too and then he
realized that there was a bigger
opportunity to in the in like the the
software and the supply chain side of it
as opposed to just reselling stuff two
more examples of people doing that one
is a company that they basically went to
Mexico and they sourced this oh it's a
type of corn anyway like authentic corn
tortillas out of Mexico are made with
three ingredients corn lime not like the
fruit but the what chemical disease the
disease and water and they found this
amazing supplier and I say amazing
supplier but it was just like a random
corn grower in ohaka and they started
selling these um tortillas and it blew
up and they went viral and they did

[39:01]
up and they went viral and they did
really really well and it was all based
around one relationship in Mexico and
they had to build that relationship by
flying to Mexico and knocking on doors
once they had it they made a business
out of it which is kind of what you're
saying exactly yeah I I remember that
when you and Keith looked at actually
doing it there in Allen we did it that's
expensive corn too but what's
interesting is like that corn was
probably the exact same corn as the
hundreds of farmers in that same Central
Mexican area but it was just like they
just needed to find one person that not
had the best product but that was
willing to work with these Americans
yeah and they did
totally all right I gotta get ready for
this
call wow this just gonna be like that
huh it do be like that
sometimes okay well is that it Nick I
think that's it my friend all right
until next time till next time see you
bro all right okay that ends this
episode of the ker officeold cobra let
me know what you think about the whole C
