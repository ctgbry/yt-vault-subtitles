the best way to get a great deal in real
estate is to have asymmetric information
which leads to asymmetric leverage so
this land I'm standing on right now you
see that pad right there that used to be
a mobile home I didn't want the mobile
home I just wanted the land and the shop
okay so the guy thought it was worth 500
Grand I thought it was worth closer to
470 he said listen it might be worth 470
without the home but the homes were 30
grand easy maybe 50 but I had asymmetric
information I buy and sell mobile home
and RV parks for a living and I knew
that mobile home was worth no more than
10 Grand so I said how about we do this
you keep the mobile home move it
wherever you want and I'll just buy the
land in the shop only for $470 he said
deal he sold that mobile home for 8
Grand and then he had to pay to move it
as well so I got the better end of that
deal
