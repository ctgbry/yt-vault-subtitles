look at this freaking thing right here
okay so I found this nerdy guy on social
media that cuts down branches of willow
trees Oaks them in water carves these
crazy looking wizard faces into it and
then plants them in dirt so they can
grow to be big willow trees that have
crazy looking wizard faces in but
there's a business idea here he's not
monetizing it but you should here's why
this works willow trees have a special
kind of hormone that enable it to grow
perfectly fine even if it's just a
living branch that was recently cut down
placed in water at least that's how I
understand it from one quick chat GPT
search so how do you profit from this we
can get a bunch of willow tree branches
carve some cool looking Wizards in those
things put them in some water put them
in some dirt sell them to a bunch of
Lord of the Rings weirdos for way too
much money full business plan right here
