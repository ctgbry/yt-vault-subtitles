everyone starts asking me which always
happens when things go viral where can I
buy these where can I buy these where
can I buy these it's like dude I'm not
the authority on perfume vending
machines I just posted a video and
talked about them but I'm kind of an
opportunist and so I reached out to the
manufacturer and said hey look at this
video you want to make something happen
and they're like oh interesting let's
talk in five or six days and I'm like
this will not be alive in 5 to 6 days
what are you talking about I went to
name cheep and I bought perfum
vending.com and I put up an ugly
[Music]
form welcome to the ker office it is
Friday morning and it's time for another
hold Co Bros FYI hold Co Bros episodes
will always be on Friday morning from
here on out so if you like them you can
count on them on Friday with Nick and I
today we talked about this perfume
vending machine business that we
accidentally fell into we talked about
it here on H GoPros about a month and a
half ago and then I made a video about
it on Instagram to promote and it went

[01:00]
it on Instagram to promote and it went
viral and now we're in the perfume
vending machine business and I'm not
exaggerating so we follow up on that we
tell uh what happened behind the scenes
and then we talk about Ponzi schemes
believe it or not and the boy band
business and what happened in the 90s in
Orlando and how that all blew up it was
pretty interesting and we just talk
about kind of the the complexities of of
investor relationships and and bringing
employees along for the stressful ride
of Entrepreneurship whether they like it
or not and how it can can get hard at
times so hope you enjoy we'll see you
next time I just think it's funny in the
life of an entrepreneur how fast things
hit you okay because a month ago I was
in Utah and we were talking on hcob Bros
and I brought up this perfume vending
machine idea an hour ago I pitched this
idea to over 100 people all over the
world that want to buy perfume vending
machines from me how do we get here how
do we get here I don't know your Genius
Chris Ker's genius is how we got here
ADHD chasing rabbits saying yes to
everything saying no to nothing not
knowing how to focus no dude I was

[02:01]
knowing how to focus no dude I was
literally just talking to who I talk
Jess about this where we're dealing with
some stuff in some of our other
businesses right
now and then I start talking to her
about this the perfume business and I'm
like this is the genius of Chris Chris
does this post it blows up and instantly
he doesn't wait like a day instantly
he's like I need to start collecting
these
emails and so he you create a website
you create a document for people to fill
out and start tracking and collecting
their information and now we've got a
list of leads that we're like we're
launching a business around this we have
1,82 leads at an average of eight
machines per lead and these are $3,000
machines so we have yeah what what is it
what is that
24,000 times yeah so $24 Million worth
of leads why don't you start back let's
start let's start let me back up so back
in March Sam Thompson my friend comes to
me and says look at this Instagram video
and it's a perfume vending machine and I

[03:01]
and it's a perfume vending machine and I
think brilliant I love this idea this is
super cool and then I put it on the
shelf and then a month ago we're talking
on hold cor Bros and I go to my shelf
and I say let's talk about this idea and
I actually emailed with them back in
March and said how much do they cost how
much to be an exclusive distributor
because I was interested in both placing
these at businesses and selling them to
business owners right do you want to say
when they responded to you at the time
of how many units you'd need to sell in
order to be an exclusive distributor h i
don't want know no no no I don't know
anyway so we talk about it on hco Bros
and then I'm thinking like all right how
do I promote this podcast oh it's
vending machines so I make this quick
Instagram real took me five minutes
threw it up no expectations went
massively viral on both Tik Tok and
Instagram massively viral eight million
views on Instagram three million on Tik
Tok which was by far the best I'd ever
have on both platforms added a ton of
YouTube subscribers podcast yada y yada
and everyone starts asking me which

[04:00]
and everyone starts asking me which
always happens when things go viral
where can I buy these where can I buy
these where can I buy these it's like
dude I'm not the authority on perfume
vending machines I just posted a video
and talked about them but I'm kind of an
opportunist and so I reached out to the
manufacturer and said hey look at this
video you want to make something happen
and they're like oh
interesting let's talk in five or six
days and I'm like this will not be alive
in 5 to 6 days what are you talking
about I went to name cheap and I bought
perfum vending.com and I put up an ugly
form and then I pinned a comment such a
great name perfum vending.com it's a
great name perfume vending that's it how
the freak was that even open I don't
know well probably because there's only
one of these in the world and they have
a patent and they they didn't buy it and
so I pinned the comment on Instagram and
I Chang my description on Instagram to
say buy this at Perfume vending I set up
an Automation in my Instagram DMS
because I was getting hundreds of DMs if
I got a DM that had the word fragrance

[05:01]
I got a DM that had the word fragrance
perfume or cologne I would auto reply
with perfum vending.com also here's my
YouTube channel also here's my
newsletter right might as well just
throw it in there you have to throw it
in there and so I start getting leads
every three minutes and this was last
week this was a day after I went viral
and they didn't stop it didn't slow down
the next day didn't slow down next day
now it's been a week and we're getting
leads every 12 minutes over a th leads
eight machines uh of interest on average
some a thousand some one most one and
now we've had a half a dozen talks with
the manufacturer and we're working to
become the exclusive North American
distributor and they're not even selling
into North America right now and I just
had a webinar with over 100 people from
these leads pitching them and we have 30
40 50 sales calls booked next week
that's where we are I think this is
incredible and then just like a display
of your superpowers I make the joke

[06:00]
of your superpowers I make the joke
Chris has the mih gene he's got the make
it happen Gene but to you post about a
lot of stuff and your stuff gets
engagement you posted about crumble you
post about pickleball courts you post
about pressure washing and your stuff
gets a ton of Engagement but with this
in particular to see your DMs start
filling up with where can I buy this and
then to have the idea H I wonder how I
could capitalize on
this I'm going to reach out to the
distributor
manufacturer they have a lackluster
response so you're like cool I'm just
going to buy perfume vending machine
whatever the website is what is it
perfum vending.com yeah perfum
vending.com
and over the course of the last week
you've collected over a thousand leads
representing probably between 20 and $30
million of potential business that we
will now launch something off of dude
that's your superpower that creating
helping people understand where an
opportunity is and then acting on the
inbound opportunity quickly I just think
is something your Genius at yeah well

[07:01]
is something your Genius at yeah well
thanks and it's it is interesting
because there's a lot of people that
post about side hustles and businesses
and
Entrepreneurship so many people right
and like what are the statistical
chances that the random guy who happened
to post this video is also the guy most
qualified to sell these not those aren't
good chances right but then when you
actually think about it it's like okay I
and or we have been importing multi
thousand hardware and electronics from
overseas for 16 years now sorry for 14
years 14 years so there is experience
like we're we're just Distributors we're
not trying to call ourselves a
manufacturer or an inventor we're not
trying to pretty this up right Joe Dirt
is Joe Deere right he's really just Joe
Dirt we know who we are we're middlemen
we're middlemen
right but that's okay I'm okay being a
middleman so yeah so basically without
giving away too many details they've
given us a steep discount on the machine
and we've signed an agreement where we

[08:01]
and we've signed an agreement where we
can sell them we can be an authorized
partner to the manufacturer here in
Canada Mexico in the United
States and today the jury's still out
we've yet to sell one we haven't you
know all the sales calls start on Monday
morning which is July 20 29th and so
we'll see maybe we don't sell one but
we're going to know in a week what our
close rate is and then we'll know if we
have a business this will be really fun
to update every week so talk about
really quickly all right we get all this
demand people are reaching out to the DM
you set up a website you're capturing
this information great what's step
two like what was the next thing that we
worked on building out the
website talking to the manufacturer well
multiple things at the same time
reaching out to the manufacturer I told
them up front that I was collecting all
these leads we talked multiple times a
day every day as this was happening once
they saw that it was going viral and
then I went to zapier and started
setting up automations because card CA
rrd where the site is hosted is not

[09:01]
rrd where the site is hosted is not
great for collecting form responses and
so I had to piece it together with
zapier so I used one zap to basically
pull it into Google Sheets and then use
another zap to Auto email them a link to
register for the webinar with Luma LMA
and then a link to book a sales call
with us with Matt who's one of our best
sales guys next week and I put in the
email only book a call if you're very
seriously interested because we're busy
right like we we don't want Tire kickers
and so despite that we got dozens of
calls booked so yeah it was basically
zapier while talking to the manufacturer
negotiating back and forth because we
could be an agent we could be a
distributor we could be an exclusive
distributor we could be have a sales
agreement like there's half a dozen
different ways we could partner what's
Luma it's what I use for the webinar uh
recording or for the booking okay so
there's one zapier for Luma what about
email like do we use

[10:00]
email like do we use
clavio did we use any anything came from
my gmail just zapier from my Gmail
account zapier from your Gmail and how
long did it take you to set up those
automations well I don't know an hour
but then they kept breaking as I do it's
been a I spent a lot of time in zapier
these last few days because emailed a
bunch of people three times on accident
it gets a little hairy what are the next
steps from here like Where Do We Go From
Here we keep negotiating the contract
and we start taking sales calls and send
invoices and collect payments like we
could start collecting money right now
if we wanted to take a sales call right
now like legally contractually ethically
we could do that we're just starting on
Monday yeah Chris and I have been
through this Rodeo once before in
particular with mining Syndicate and
when this first happened Chris called me
and we had a conversation and there are
like a couple different options we could
have actually just Sid stepped the
manufacturer and we could go to China
because we have relationships in in
China where we could actually create

[11:00]
China where we could actually create
this we could be a Wholesale Distributor
where we actually purchased the units
and then sell them directly to people in
the United States or we could be a sales
organization essentially that works to
generate leads educate sell and then let
the manufacturer deal with the shipping
and the maintenance of these products we
we're currently thinking about the
middle route as being the main route for
us to take because we don't want to have
operationally intensive businesses
to manage that's the agreement we're
trying to negotiate with the
manufacturer
perfuma yep that's the lesson that took
us many years to learn many years and
many dollars but yeah but that's the
thing is like you spend all these years
learning and then it's just one
opportunity that can turn into a million
dollars or or $10 million pretty quickly
so this will be fun to update people on
a weekly basis like you said so Nick I
want look at me right now everyone
watching this look at me right now you

[12:01]
watching this look at me right now you
don't just compound your money you
compound your learnings and your
experience that has been my biggest
takeaway every failure every stupid dumb
decision that you make every side hustle
that you abandon every bankruptcy
whatever it is that's just compounding
and it's going to pay dividends for the
rest of your life so don't get too In
The Weeds about it and if we never talk
about this opportunity again you'll know
that it failed and we're too embarrassed
to mention it that's right because we're
too prideful to not mention our
successes oh my gosh I love it so
anything else you want to mention on the
perfuma stuff no I'll follow up next
time see how it goes cool all right can
I talk about something let's go all
right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's

[13:00]
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there all right I want to talk about a
pain point and I think almost everybody
who's listening to this will understand
what I'm talking
about have you ever gotten a DM on
LinkedIn every day every freaking day
and how many times when you like accept
a connection request does it just turn
into an automated DM
why hasn't LinkedIn figured out a way to
better manage their
DMs I don't know it's terrible and like
at least with Twitter I can say uh my
DMs are closed unless I accepted your
request but with LinkedIn you can pay to
automatically DM people I find
linkedin's DMS to be more spammy and
less valuable to me than Twitter's DMS
would you agree or not agree I don't
know well Justin just dm' me and said
I'm currently in the process of
expanding my coaching business bus I'm
currently seeking faith-driven Founders

[14:01]
currently seeking faith-driven Founders
willing to help with a quick 10-minute
user interview as I fine-tune my
Approach as in exchange this I got this
yesterday I'd be happy to offer a
complimentary 30 minute coaching session
to see if we could find some
opportunities wow so if I give him 10
minutes to do a user interview he'll
give me a 30 minute sales pitch oh wow
what a deal for some potential synergies
yeah that's like walking walking to the
grocery store and they're like if you
pay $36 for this loaf of bread I'll
punch you in the
face what do you think I'm in I love
getting punched in the face anyway I
agree so I think that there's an
opportunity here for somebody who's
enterprising to figure out LinkedIn DMS
because what people currently do people
like me I have an executive assistant
you have an executive assistant and she
goes through and reads my DM she mainly
focuses on Twitter but she started

[15:01]
focuses on Twitter but she started
looking at my LinkedIn DMS now and we
track them in a
spreadsheet like let me say that again
we we manually track them in a freaking
spreadsheet it's a nightmare but you
never know kind of what nugget is going
to come out of your DMs That's My
Philosophy Chris's philosophy is cream
will rise to the top I'm not worried
about necessarily tracking these really
closely because if somebody really wants
to get to me they'll get to me so I
think there is an opportunity here
for someone to build something that
allows you to better manage your DMs and
filter for the right types of DMS the
problem is the apis that Twitter and
Linkedin have and their permissions that
will allow you to pull and scrape things
so like as you know it's hard on
LinkedIn and Twitter to integrate some
of these growth tools that you've that
you use in the past either using zapier
or some other API integration what I
think is someone could take

[16:00]
think is someone could take
A system that they buil out like I've
done with Kelly and actually go out and
offer a coner service to people that
first pre-qualifies what exactly they're
looking for and then only tracks the
things that meet that threshold here's
what I mean let's say somebody comes to
you and they're like hey Chris we want
to manage your DMs you're like I don't I
don't really know like here what's most
important to you well I only want to
talk to people who have have a business
or have an idea that's been vetted okay
cool everybody else I don't care about
everybody else yeah everybody else great
then that person just goes through your
DMs and anything that meets those two
criterias would bring them to your
attention and pass them along to you
because like I'm at the point now with
my DMs you know how I am with the email
like with DMS I'm like I'm not even
going to read it I found a DM from this
girl from the Ukraine 3 months ago and I
just ran r l opened it cuz I saw like

[17:00]
just ran r l opened it cuz I saw like
tennis in her bio or something and it
turns out she wasn't spamming me she was
like hey I'd love to come on to your
podcast because I think that I fit XYZ
criteria like I just thought she was a
spammer but she wasn't and if somebody
had actually gone in and read that and
been able to filter that for me that
would have been fantastic so I don't
know of a better solution than to have a
human filter do that and then to offer
this as sort of a coner service to
individuals who are looking for it but I
do think weirdly enough there's a market
for this go
couple things first of all I think you
got to take it a step further and kind
of convert it to being like a chatbot
because it's easy to say like all right
well if they want to discuss a business
idea then click here but most of the
first messages isn't going to say like I
want to discuss a business idea right
and so I feel like it it needs to be
something that's like something that
talks to them is like all right what is
your intent like an automated filtering
system H and I don't know if the API
allows for that or whatnot but but
that's what I think you might need and I

[18:01]
that's what I think you might need and I
think a potential issue with this and
I'm going to contradict myself in a
minute is like is this really that big
of a problem right is this big enough
problem for enough people to be solved
or is it a niche problem but that's you
know it's big enough to to make some
good money from I think it's a niche
problem I don't think it's like a mass
Market problem but if there was somebody
out there who was like even if there was
a
tool that would allow me to filter my M
I would absolutely opt for that there's
just too many and and there because
there's so many that are just pitching
me something I don't even open any of
them at this point so I feel like I lose
out on potential opportunities that way
here's your distribution idea to support
your idea okay you do automated DMS to
people with a ton of followers to sell
this product or service right so if
someone has 342 followers you they're
not a customer if they have 7,300 64
customers then you reach out to them

[19:01]
customers then you reach out to them
with your automated DM you're automating
DMS to the people that probably get a
lot of DMS to help manage their DMS
that's pretty genius and you could have
a really cool like first line that's
just like are you tired of getting DMS
let me help you clean up your inbox
someone sent me that I'd be like well
that's interesting click the first line
could be like this is the last DM you'll
ever
get huh
huh like it's a Spam it is a spam DM but
it's the spam DM to stop all the others
that are coming behind it I love that
did didn't girdley do a business like
this yeah and I tried to be a customer
and they shut it down I just think they
didn't have enough
customers was it exactly this or was
there something different about it it
was converting Twitter DMS to your
inbox so you get a DM and it shows up as
an email and you can respond through
your email and it would respond to their
DM um and I actually I think the reason
shut it down is because Twitter changed
their API that was the thinking but I

[20:02]
their API that was the thinking but I
talked to the guy who was running it and
there just from what I understand it
just wasn't like the API could have
managed it but it wasn't it just didn't
do well but Twitter's much more niched
than LinkedIn to support your idea right
that's much more of a niche idea than
what you're talking about to me it's
LinkedIn like Twitter I'm not even as
worried about LinkedIn I feel like has
actual professionals that are reaching
out to you the problem is like you can't
differentiate unless you go through and
read your hundreds of spam DMS to find
that needle in the Hy stack so like it
would just be nice to somehow call to
the top like I don't know why LinkedIn
doesn't do this I don't know why
LinkedIn doesn't have an option for
people who pay what is that LinkedIn
premium where it's like if they send a
DM to somebody it shows up as like not
spam or something like just something
marked as I don't know they had like I
would think that there would be a way
where you could verify who was coming
into your inbox anybody out there who
knows how to build a tool contact me I
would freaking love to do something like

[21:01]
would freaking love to do something like
this yep you if you can build a tool you
contact this
tool tool
squared all right I got a little I got a
little nugget for you oh okay little
Nuggie there's a new documentary on
Netflix that we started watching last
night I think you would love okay first
of all I love this documentary because
it has the perfect name okay I you don't
you probably don't know what I'm talking
about okay but I want to see if you can
guess this is right in your Q Zone I
want to see if you can guess what the
name of this is It's a documentary about
the dark side of the boy band
era the perfect name for a documentary
The Dark Side of the boy band era
yeah Black Street's
back what I'm just GNA tell you it's
dirty pop it's called Dirty Pop that's a
good name right it's a great name no
better
name yo we got a boy band guy right here

[22:00]
name yo we got a boy band guy right here
basically oh I'm sorry Chris why don't
you tell them your first thought when
you saw me for the first time sings Good
literally no other talents
whatsoever I thought you said when you
walked in when you walked into the
mission home and you saw me sitting down
there you're like who's this curly
headed Justin Timberlake in in the foury
year we started watching it my wife's a
big big nying fan not bigger than me
bigger than you for sure no do you know
about Lou Pearlman of course what do you
know about him Lou Pearlman was the
original manager who discovered most of
these boy bands so he discovered the
Backstreet Boys he discovered insync and
the way that his contracts were written
with
them those boy bands es especially on
their first couple of albums did not
make hardly any money Lou made the
majority of the money and so he was like
this loved and hated figure because he
brought people to Market and got them
popular but then he exploited them on
the back end and when insync released
their album no strings attached that was
the whole thought and impetus behind it
was because they were no longer attached
to luk prman they could make their money

[23:02]
to luk prman they could make their money
Etc you're like 80% right but there's a
couple important things that you learn
in this documentary I'm gonna spoil it
for you okay so Luke Pearlman he saw New
Kids on the Block and he's like I want
that that's going to be hot I want he's
an opportunist he's an entrepreneur and
so he assembled the backst street boys
and that was first right and he put an
ad in the paper in Orlando looking for
singers he found he s him out he put
them together and it was a dud to start
because at back at the time it was
Nirvana and it was Dr Dre like that was
it it was grunge and rap yeah we're
talking like 1996 we're talking like
19933 two yeah like nid on the Block was
like 90 and this was like 93 94 so it
just didn't hit they went on all these
Middle School tours and he had a million
dooll bus he had private jets and so
these guys were living in luxury as like
high schoolers which isn't normal like
everyone in the industry is like you

[24:00]
everyone in the industry is like you
don't do this you travel around in a
grung van and you eat Taco Bell every
day these guys were living in luxury
sounds amazing it sounds amazing and so
they go on this US tour and it just H
doesn't really resonate Germany is like
the King of Pop they go to Germany they
blow up they blow up they're celebrities
like they were absolutely
celebrities welcome to Germany that's
how it was when they got there right mhm
he's just powering through
okay they spend a year in Germany they
don't even go home for Christmas okay
they come back to the US and they're a
huge hit right they were just too early
anyway long story short yeah L Perman
Lou Perman is a scumbag he's kind of
sleazy but he was not making much money
on these contracts with backst stre
boards or in sync it was mostly BMG he
like completely screwed everyone just to
get like the Allure of BMG on their side

[25:01]
get like the Allure of BMG on their side
and they were making nothing and on
paper he was making 43% but the way the
contract was structured he really wasn't
making anything either because he was
just passing it on to BMG yeah BMG was
just raking their fees from them so that
was interesting but he had a couple
interesting business nuggets in there
and he said he started back street boys
and he said when Pepsi started Coke came
behind him and he's like there will be a
Pepsi to backst Street boys Coke he's
like why not me and so like that's this
what we were talking about a couple
months ago the illusion of saturation or
of competition right it's like he
created more competition because he knew
the market was growing so much someone
was going to capture it why not him why
not just make boy band number two and it
was genius which I don't think this was
calculated but it put a chip on N sing's
shoulder because basically anytime back
stre boys turn something down like this
Disney showcase they're like we're too
busy for that and syn would come in and

[26:00]
busy for that and syn would come in and
they were always like the junior varsity
but that put this chip on their shoulder
to actually they're like all right we're
going to focus on dance right that's
going to be our thing and so it just
became like their own brand but anyway
Lou Pearlman was an interesting
character because you and I have talked
about how like the bigger the higher you
go in business oftentimes the more the
line between like ethics and fraud is
grade right it is like the line between
Elizabeth Holmes of Toronto and Steve
Jobs is not as clear as people would
like to believe but Elizabeth Holmes was
in healthcare and the Machine that she
was lying to investors about happened to
kill people right yeah little
distinction little distinction but like
she was doing a lot of the same stuff
that people in in like if you're making
apps do it's like oh yeah our app's
almost ready it's almost ready like what
you're describing as like the fake it
till you make it mentality right like oh
no no everything's good we're on track

[27:00]
no no everything's good we're on track
yeah things are going well there's like
this weird line between like are they
lying yeah or are they projecting
confidence like I totally agree it's
like this weird space that people enter
into it's interesting to watch these
movies because the whole documentary is
vilifying Lou Pearlman and I haven't
watched the third it's three parts I
haven't watched the third part I Know
How It Ends so there's probably a bunch
of nasty stuff I haven't heard yet but
like so far the boy bands were like
complaining like we're not getting
anything We're not getting anything and
it's like dude you're flying in a
private jet also you were nothing like
he made you right like I I understand
like maybe your percentag but like
you're a nation you're a worldwide
sensation now so I'm always just looking
at it from the business owner's
perspective which is it's just different
how much money were the boy band members
making versus how much was it generating
do you know they weren't even very clear
with those numbers but there was one
quote where I don't know was Aaron
Carter or whatever got his first check
and it was $10,000 and he was like oh my

[28:00]
and it was $10,000 and he was like oh my
gosh this is the most money I've ever
seen in my life and then one of the
other band mates was like what do you
make it Outback Steakhouse you make like
twice that a year it's like that's not
that much money and then they were like
oh so like they totally thought and even
the people that they interviewed were
like yeah like I understand that but
they would be nothing without him and
you have to pay BMG so I I thought it
was interesting just taking a different
perspective yeah and then there was
another part where one of the like the
business partners that was working with
Lou that had no business experience he
was just helping him and things started
getting hairy they were raising money it
was getting ugly and it was getting very
very stressful and one of he was
basically an employee he didn't have any
Equity but he was feeling all the stress
that Lou was feeling and he ended up
killing himself oh my gosh yeah just
feeling the stress and they were they
were
like they were saying Lou like this
blood is on your hands you did this Lou

[29:00]
blood is on your hands you did this Lou
and I was just looking at this and I'm
like man you know like as business
owners like you go through so much
stress like we've gone through some
stress this last month and like you
become kind of immune to it and it
becomes your new Baseline but the people
you bring along it's not like we're
we've both been working with someone
specific this last month who's been
taking the stress pretty hard right and
it's like they don't it's a different
incentive structure it's a different
like they didn't sign up for this so I
had a lot of empathy for the young man
that killed himself um because I've been
on like I've been on both sides of I
felt that stress and then I felt the
stress for people that I brought along
with me that didn't really sign up for
it not on that part in particular but L
Perman
like there's this quote in Venture
investing that says firsttime Founders
focus on product and second time
Founders focus on distribution and I say
it a lot cuz I really really like the
quote but you see that represented in

[30:01]
quote but you see that represented in
people in particular like first town
Founders don't have experience so what
are they focused on of course it's the
product it's the genius of the product
it's how beautiful it is it's what you
made it's how it looks right and the
product in this case were the boy bands
well how good was the music how good did
they dance oh man they're doing
everything holy crap why are they making
so little money but then after you have
some experience that's why the second
time Founders realize it's not product
it's distribution because you can have
the product in the world you can be
super talented you could have the
coolest technology but if you don't have
a way to sell that you're nothing you're
never going to be found you're never
going to be discovered so I I also have
a lot more empathy for the the L peans I
guess if you will because without them
without that distribution without the
foresight to enter into a relationship
with BMG you would have never made
anything now do I think it should have
been tilted the way that it was tilted
no probably not but that's a very common
thing that once you actually get in and
start running a business you realize

[31:00]
start running a business you realize
like yes product is important experience
is important like all we know that but
what you don't realize so much from the
outside is how important the
distribution is and how getting people
to know your name and know your product
and understand who you are where they
can buy Etc is at least equally as
important if not more important than the
product itself well and in this case Lou
had like he had to distribute them three
different ways so first of all part of
the distribution was putting them
together he did that
right they didn't find each other he had
to find them then he had to raise
millions and millions of dollars that's
all part of distribution right you did
he millions that gets into the third
episode millions of dollars and they
would often sing to the investors and
then the third was he had to actually
distribute their music and go make
connections at BMG and fly to Europe and
fly all over and he wasn't married he
didn't have kids he was with them
everywhere everywhere like they called
him the sixth band member he's in all
the he was on stage he was like in the
weeds with them the whole time and just

[32:03]
weeds with them the whole time and just
to your point like I just the if if we
were to look at this contract today
right now we' be like oh yeah and and
like yeah those guys kind of got screwed
and especially when you've got like
safety and numbers like Oh Aaron Carter
just signed oh AJ just signed yeah I'm
gonna sign you know like oh I'm I'm
nothing without this guy so ni Carter
Nick Carter so like they he knew that he
had all the leverage he wasn't an idiot
right they were going to sign whatever
so I'm sure he took advantage of that in
an unethical way but yeah at the same
time they were nothing without him
that's interesting too because there are
a lot of you and I both been in these
types of relationships where you find an
investor or a partner and they're like
all right well the equity split's going
to be 70% in my favor 30% in your favor
oh okay cool and I'll bring the capital
oh okay I'm not going to do any of the
work and those are really hard
relationships to manage over time a
because usually the person who's doing

[33:00]
because usually the person who's doing
the Sweat Equity doesn't really
appreciate the capital because they
haven't earned that Capital yet M but B
I think more importantly it's just
lonely to be doing it all by yourself
and and when it feels like okay I'm the
one who got the ball across the Finish
Line it's hard to recognize like well
yeah what but you wouldn't have had the
uniform or the venue or the ball itself
to get across the Finish Line if it
wasn't for that initial seed investment
and just always a hard Dynamic to kind
of manage the capital and the talent let
me tell you where that situation does
work really well I think another part of
that that you didn't mention is recency
bias so if you make a deal like that
7030 I put in all the capital okay cool
four years go by that investor hasn't
done anything by definition of the
contract right he put in the money four
years ago which was enough everything
worked but in the entrepreneurs mind
this guy hasn't done anything for four
years I've been out here grinding
selling sleepless nights it's just the

[34:01]
selling sleepless nights it's just the
recent it's like that was the deal you
know whereas if that deal lasts six
months it's not as bad it's a defined
time period right and so it's like the
same deal la like exists in hard money
lending in like real estate loans it's
like all right I'm gonna give you all
the money I'm gonna take half the profit
but I'm not going to do anything it's
like okay and this guy works hard for
three months they sell it they flip it
they go they both are happy because
there was no recency buys it didn't last
that long you know so a lot of times
deals seem really logical and they make
sense on the front end but you have no
idea how it's going to work out because
you don't know how long that thing's
going to be around I said this Lou
raised the money it's totally different
once you realize we've I mean we've been
investing now in some deals once you
have the capital where it's like yeah
this was really hard-earned Capital it's
hard to earn and build up $500,000 of
cash that's really hard there's not a
lot of people who have that money and

[35:00]
lot of people who have that money and
then when you make that investment and
it goes poorly or you you put that money
into something and someone they don't
value it as much because they haven't
actually gotten to the point where
they've made that money yet it's just
hard to have those
conversations because at least one of
you is not understanding the perspective
of the other because they just can't
they don't understand how hard it is to
acquire that and that's obviously in the
boy band situation where it's like yeah
of course they don't appreciate
because they don't understand how hard
it is to acquire Capital they just think
well I I could have just s sang and
danced and I would have been famous like
no you wouldn't especially back then
like now we have YouTube and Instagram
and like you can reach people directly
but back then it was so controlled by
who uh owned the distribution the record
companies MTV whoever the TV uh
companies were at the time that you like
you had to play that game it just was
the game doesn't matter how talented you
were yeah to to tie up o on this the way
this all ends is like you know things
get more stressful NSYNC breaks off

[36:02]
get more stressful NSYNC breaks off
backst stre boys break off they buy them
out for 64 million bucks right they're
on their own Now Yep they're on their
own and Lou it turns out like was
orchestrating this massive Ponzi scheme
one of the biggest of all time all of
these companies that he owned
transcontinental this and Airlines and
blimps like he was committing insurance
fraud he never even filed entities for
these companies they were just like
existed on a business card and at all
turned out in the end it was a billion
doll Ponzi scheme and they only ever
recovered a third of it less than a
third of it and I've always thought
about Ponzi schemes and like how like
not how could you sleep at night from
like an ethical perspective but how
could you sleep at night from a stress
perspective just knowing that you're not
even investing the money like you're
taking $50,000 checks from little old
ladies without even the intent of invest
you're just spending it on cars like
I've never understood how that computes
like the stress of that but then as I

[37:00]
like the stress of that but then as I
watch this documentary and I see his
Baseline for stress increase over the
years and how literally people around
him that are feeling similar stress but
not nearly as much killing themselves
that and he's just like this is my
Baseline oh you think this is stressful
oh no way that just that Baseline keeps
increasing when I think of that it's
like oh like the potential to commit a
Ponzi scheme is possible because that
stress doesn't feel like that much
stress at all at that point
and you and I have talked about this
before too there are times where I
see Bernie maid off or Sam bankman freed
and I'm like I could see that remember
the guy who did the fire
Festival they just got out of control
it's weird but I'm like in my mind I'm
like I could see a scenario where that
happens to somebody right like it's the
fake it till you make it again with what
you're talking about with what was her
name Elizabeth yeah Elizabeth Holmes
where you're like no this is going to

[38:00]
where you're like no this is going to
happen this is going to happen this is I
bet Lou was just continually putting it
all on black thinking dude I've got the
backet boys and in sync and I think he
had 98 Degrees I can't remember I'm
gonna pay off these debts like it's made
in the shade I'm good baby this is going
to be fine and so he just kept
justifying and justifying justifying the
fire Festival is the same way like oh
dud we got all these people coming it's
going to be amazing so you keep
justifying and justifying and justifying
like no no no if we just push harder if
we just fake a little bit more if we
just sell that one more investor and
like Yeah by the end of it they're an
unrecognizable character but you can see
the sort of SL and like how it starts
and it's just a weird perspective when
all of a sudden especially as an
entrepreneur you're like yeah I could
see that yeah well and in all of these
cases in their defense like how many
times did they get close to the brink
and then something rescued them right
right like they're drawing on actual ual
data points like it it looks like
they're delusional from the outside

[39:00]
they're delusional from the outside
looking in but I imagine with the fire
Fest they ran out of money like 13 times
and then found an investor at the last
minute 13 times right so like why
wouldn't he believe that he could
eventually pull it off if he saved it 13
times in the past I think what you're
saying is exactly why Ponzi schemes or
whatever those schemes get out of
control it's because they never ever ran
into an obstacle that they couldn't
overcome MH like you have to learn those
lessons at some point you have to get
fired you have to lose money on an
investment if like something has to
happen and then you're like oh crap this
could actually all go away tomorrow I
could actually lose my house I could
actually lose a million dollars on this
deal and so then the next time you're in
that situation it it causes you to act
differently and I think when you have
these
successful schemes running and you've
never ever actually failed and they keep
being successful that just perpet just
snowballs that point right like had blue
or the fire Festival guy actually met a

[40:01]
or the fire Festival guy actually met a
roadblock that stopped them in the
beginning like they would have never
gotten to that point so it's almost like
these this combination of factors had to
go perfectly right in order for them to
even get to the place where they could
scam that many people yeah or another
thought is how many Ponzi schemes out
there never got caught they're still out
there and they're paying out dividends
and it's a Ponzi scheme and no one knows
and maybe some of them even like exited
successfully some somehow right they
didn't just spend it all on boats and
women like it was a Ponzi scheme how
fascinating would that be to interview
people who pulled off Ponzi schemes
although then you run into the issue
where where it's like Elon
Musk he pulled it out yeah but if he
hadn't figured it out we'd all be
sitting oh my fraud he bought Solar City
oh my gosh that was Insider dealing you
know what I mean
like the area great yeah because he's
like entrepreneurs think no I'm doubling
down no I'm going to get more investment

[41:00]
down no I'm going to get more investment
no I'm going to do all this X Y and Z
and they actually do pull it out whereas
you know some people
don't I'm with you though I I would not
be able to
sleep owing that many people that much
money I think from the outside looking
in it's easy to look at these guys and
you can lump them in with like murderers
even just people whose lives go spiral
out of control and you look at the Lou
Pearlman and you're like this guy he
just had it out for these kids from and
it's it's like no I don't think so I
think he was an entrepreneur and he
started with good intent and then he it
was a slippery slope and he made one
slip up here and then a little bit of
fraud there a little bit of fraud there
and the next thing you know you're full
fraud or bust yeah and that's just how
it ends I agree okay that's holdco Bros
