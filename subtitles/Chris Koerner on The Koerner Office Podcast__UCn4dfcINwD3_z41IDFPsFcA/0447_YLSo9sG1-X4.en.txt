look at this freaking stuff right here
I'm in the most expensive grocery store
in the world but it is full of business
ideas and I'm going to show all of them
to you so come with me want to charge
$16 for some Mandarin oranges easy just
peel them first want to charge $31 for
some chili just put buffalo in it and
put it in a mason jar want to charge $26
for a bottle of water put in a glass jar
and call it hyper oxygenated that's all
you got to do if you have the hot new
Italian restaurant in town why would you
not put your name on some spaghetti
sauce and sell it for $14 want to charge
twice as much for a treat put it in a $1
mason jar hot honey is all the rage
right now so why not put it in a
marinara sauce and charge $11 for it how
about 15 balls of ice for $16 as crazy
as this sounds I posted a video about
this exact idea a month ago right here
this little piece of cornbread is $6 but
guess what all of the ingredients are
organic people would pay for something
like this in any market so trail mix is
nothing special but what about $13 trail
mix and Ultra Premium packaging that's a
great framework for any business put it
in nice packaging charge three times as
much kale chips so hot right now but
what about kale chips that taste like
