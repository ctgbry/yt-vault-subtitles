look at this freaking thing right here
whoever told you that restaurants are
bad business did not know what they're
talking about I'm kind of a sicko so I
just calculated how much this restaurant
makes per year and it's pretty shocking
let me crunch the numbers for you look
how long this line is I sat and watched
the entrance of the door right there and
I counted how many seconds it took for
people to walk in and on average one
person walks in that door every 30
seconds average ticket price is $18 that
means these guys are making $36 a minute
which is over $22,000 an hour they're
open 13 hours a day 36 65 days a year in
case you're counting that's over $10
million Topline Revenue a year for a
freaking restaurant serving chicken and
fries it's not like they're the only
guys doing that now are they this busy
all day every day probably not but I've
been here multiple times and there's
always a line so let's just say
conservatively it's 8 million bucks
what's the rent here well I looked it up
right here $45 a square foot this is
about 3200 square ft which means these
guys are paying $10 to $14,000 a month
for rent so can restaurants be a bad
business yes but really what's bad is
your location your food or your customer
service if you can nail all three of

service if you can nail all three of
those these things will print millions
of dollars a year for generations to
come this one location makes about $2.5
million a year a net profit get all my
