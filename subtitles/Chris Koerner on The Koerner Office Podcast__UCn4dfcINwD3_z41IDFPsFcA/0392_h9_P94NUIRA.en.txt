look at this freaking guy right here
this guy handcrafted a four-sided mirror
that he takes hunting and hides behind
which is basically the perfect
camouflage for deer they have no idea
he's behind them and like I always say
any good idea is a good business idea so
if I were you I would figure out a way
to manufacture these at scale or just
start by manufacturing a few of them and
giving them out to your Hunter friends
to try for themselves then once you get
feedback on it then you can look into
Mass manufacturing them a while back I
posted this video about a guy that puts
mannequin heads in his blind to have the
same effect millions of people saw it
I'm telling you there is a business for
this so I made the full business plan
for it right here for free
