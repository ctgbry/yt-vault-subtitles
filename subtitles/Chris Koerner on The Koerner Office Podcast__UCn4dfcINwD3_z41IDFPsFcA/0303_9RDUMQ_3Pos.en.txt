my friend CJ told me something shocking
he's an executive for one of the big
four airplane seat manufacturers and he
begged me to start a very specific
business because the wiring harness for
these seatback displays are always
breaking and guess how much his company
pays for them you're not going to
believe me but I don't care 10 grand for
something that looks about like this you
see any airplane vendor needs to be FAA
certified with an airworthiness
certification this regulation creates
somewhat of a moat for potential
competitors he came to me because I've
been importing stuff from China for 15
years he said there's all kinds of parts
from vendors that get marked up
outrageously and they just pass them on
to their customer with some markup we
first had this conversation 6 years ago
and these cables were 6 grand today
they're 10 grand much more detail right
