you can learn a lot about business from
authentic Texas barbecue here's my
favorite lesson and then I'll show you
how my pork chops are doing this guy
shakes out to 23 cents a pound cuz I buy
them by the cord it's kind of like the
old Boomer that just doesn't care
anymore these are uniform 11in splits
that I pay about dollar a pound for
that's kind of like my hipster
Millennial and then these cute little
guys serve a little purpose they're 3-in
cubes they cost $150 a pound that's your
high maintenance gen Z that dress as
well that's actually poor and Trager
pellets those are basically hot dogs and
we don't compare hot dogs to steaks so
what's the lesson buy by the acre and
sell by the foot there's much more money
to be made in buying raw materials and
spending a little time or money to
refine them down into something that
adds more value a piece of rebar is a do
a pound a box of paper clips is $20 a
pound and these pork chops are looking
just fine
