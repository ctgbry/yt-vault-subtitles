welcome to the kenter office it is 9:00
the kids are in bed the house is quiet
and I'm ready for some listener
submitted questions I did this last week
backed by popular demand I stopped doing
it over the summer started a backup last
week and you guys loved it so we're
going to keep doing it if you have a
question to submit go to TKO pod.com
scroll to the very bottom and you'll see
a little widget that will record your
voice you can keep it 100% Anonymous
most likely I will play it here on the
show and answer your question live so
please do that
[Music]
let's get into it I wish I could tell
you how many I'm going to answer today
but I don't know we got to see where
this goes because it's not who you know
it's TKO okay that was really dumb but I
also liked it so okay first question
from Crystal Kor from New Zealand I have
a question for you about a claw machine
concept what would you do if you had
access to a claw machine and the
original idea was to create hype around
this machine that had luxury items in it

[01:00]
this machine that had luxury items in it
and have it be at different locations
and stuff like that and now I have
access to the claw machine and expensive
items that could potentially go in it
and it's up to me if I want to do
anything at all with it or just fill it
with stuffed animals I have a question
of how you would go about even beginning
this I'm in New Zealand so with certain
items the gambling laws take effect for
certain amounts of what things are worth
What would would you do would you just
stuff it with stuff and talk to people
and get it in just a store to get
Revenue going or do you think this idea
of sort of creating this luxury hype
situation maybe for the younger kids
maybe fortnite cards Rolex Pokemon I
have access to be able to put those
things in the claw machine and it has a
pretty funky name it's pretty cool what
would you do how do I start Crystal I
love your question I love you there's a
reason I put this question first cuz
it's cool it's Unique it's everyone

[02:01]
it's cool it's Unique it's everyone
loves vending machines right the
5-year-old the 50-year-old and everyone
in between so this is a super cool
opportunity and here's what I think you
need to do coincidentally I posted a
video about another New Zealand gambling
ask type business a month ago the
hole-in-one challenge if any of you saw
that on social media what it what it is
is basically a golf tea on the side of a
lake lake Tao right in between the lake
and the highway and 111 yards away from
the tea floating on the water is a green
a floating green with a hole if you hit
a hole in one you can win $10,000 and
the statistical likelihood of anyone
hitting a hole in one is about one in
12,500 and this business has to pay out
for holes in one about every two weeks
so I don't remember the exact math it's
in my video but these guys are grossing
around $600,000 per year and netting
about a third of that and why are they
doing that because math is on their side
and I love your business because math is
on your side so I did a little research
on claw machines for you and did you

[03:00]
on claw machines for you and did you
know that most modern claw machines are
programmed to only provide a strong grip
after 10 to 15 plays and that
interesting what a scam from play number
1 to 10 or 1 to 15 The Claw is
deliberately weak it will drop things on
purpose and scam you out of your money
as a consumer maddening as a business
owner interesting therefore the
statistical probability that an average
user will win a claw machine is about 5
to 30% so we can be angry and protest
that or we can use that to game the
system as a user I would sit there and
watch someone play the claw machine 10
to 15 times and hopefully lose 10 to 15
times and then I would step in and play
making my chance of winning closer to 30
to 60% so what you need to do is you
need math on your side much like the
hole-in-one Challenge on Lake TPO you
need to find out what is the statistical
probability of an average user winning
on your machine with various items
because a roll

[04:00]
because a roll
might be easier or harder to grab than a
stack of Pokémon cards so you need to
run these tests you need to make a
spreadsheet put a bunch of random things
in it have your kid play it have your
husband play it you play it and take
note of your percentage likelihood of
winning now multiply that percentage
likelihood of winning by the cost to
play the machine and then you know what
you can afford but now now is when you
get creative I don't think you put
luxury items in there I think you got to
put mystery items in there like baseball
cards NFL cards Pokemon cards fortnite
cards and you have to put a sign on the
machine that says something to the
effect of one of these packs of Pokemon
cards has a holographic Charizard in it
worth $1,000 or something I don't know
but you have to actually make sure that
that's true you don't want to lie to
them and you might have to open the pack
of Pokemon cards to do that you might
have to rig the deck in their favor so
to speak so you're not lying to them
otherwise you would have no clue what's
in those Pokémon cards so I have no idea
what a holographic charge is worth I've

[05:00]
what a holographic charge is worth I've
been out of the game for about 30 years
now let's say you find one worth $11,000
you buy it on eBay one card for $11,000
then you buy 100 generic packs of
Pokemon cards and some of them might
have a another valuable card in it it
doesn't matter that's just the cherry on
top for the user you're going to open
one pack of cards at random you're going
to replace one of the low value cards
with the $11,000 card and then you're
going to seal the deck of cards back up
so you know for a fact that one of those
actually has the card that you're
promising and then you need to do the
math let's say to keep the number simple
it costs a doll to play and you have 100
packs of cards in there and the average
pack of card is worth $5 and one of
those packs of cards is worth $11,000
and let's say the average user has a 10%
chance of winning that means you're
going to make $10 for every $5 pack of
cards you give out except for the one
$1,005 pack of cards so your cost on the
cards in the machine is $5 * 100 packs

[06:00]
cards in the machine is $5 * 100 packs
equals $500 plus the $1,000 card
$1,500 okay but to sell all of those
packs of cards statistically speaking
people need to play 1,000 times because
there's a 10% chance of winning if they
play 1,000 times for $1 each you're
going to make $1,000 which you would
lose money at all right let's use some
easy numbers here let's say you do this
research and you find out the average
user has a 10% chance of winning you can
fit a 100 packs of Pokémon cards in
there and it costs $2 to play okay
there's 100 packs of cards then it's
going to take 1,000 plays for someone to
win all of them eventually 1,000 plays
times $2 per play equals $2,000 okay
let's say the packs of cards cost you $3
each okay three packs of cards times $3
equals
$300 so before we factor in the th000
holographic Charizard you're looking at
making $2,000 in Revenue over $300 in
cost but you still have the $1,000
holographic Charizard so it's $2,000 in
Revenue over $1,300 of cost pretty good

[07:00]
Revenue over $1,300 of cost pretty good
profit it's about 40% give or take and
any user if they win has a 1% chance of
winning the holographic card so I'm just
spitballing here but I really think you
got to make the items in the machine
mystery items so they don't really know
what they're getting but they know what
they could get if they win and to get
even more creative I would put some sort
of a sensor a motion sensor on the
vending machine or on the claw machine
that sends out a noise every time
someone walks by it like when a $11,000
holographic Charizard card you want to
catch their attention and you know what
this might not be the offer that might
not be what kids care about so you got
to test a bunch of stuff swap out the
inventory every week or every month and
see what really resonates with the kids
it also depends on what type of venue
your machine is it's going to be
teenagers playing it kids playing it
adults playing it Millennials so what do
I always say test everything except
drugs you got to buy a bunch of
different things you got to test the
machine find out how much math is on
your side and try different items next
question man now I want to go buy a
Claus and try that myself okay Robert

[08:01]
Claus and try that myself okay Robert
let's see what he has to say hey there
love your content love your stuff see
you any questions be quick and ask a
question how do you keeping on I know
you've had 72 businesses and some
succeed some failure how do you come
back from that fear of failing and how
do you get back on the horse and how do
you stay innovating and feeling fresh
and wanting to actually do this stuff I
guess a little history brief history is
I had a small freelance visual effects
Studio business that I did all the
visual effects movies Tov was commcial
commercials worked on big names worked
on Netflix HBO my Niche was a very
high-end part of the in the pipeline
after they filmed it it was so niched
that I kind of niched myself out
existence when the industry collapsed
last year or 18 months ago and I've been
trying to pick myself up out of that
it's been tough trying to rebuild my
identity and all that stuff yeah how do
you keep going on and lifting yourself
back up and recovering from burnout too
I just feel really burnt out that I
guess that's that's my two questions
thank you Robert ber thank you for

[09:00]
thank you Robert ber thank you for
leaving that question brutal I can hear
the sadness in your voice I'm sorry that
you're burned out I'm sorry you went
through that it sounds like you're in a
tough spot right now but man I will tell
you what I've never been through a tough
spot that didn't make perfect sense to
me later on down the line at some point
in the future you're going to look back
on this burnout and be so grateful that
this happened that this experience
happened so your question was two-part
how to keep on keeping on like Joe Dirt
said when you keep on failing how to
recover from burnout here's what I think
Robert you have to love the game more
than you hate the failure so I have been
through some brutal failures partnership
fallouts business failures friendship
fallouts related to business failures
and I can honestly say quitting never
really crossed my mind and that's not
because I'm I'm so tough I've quit
plenty of things I've quit lots of stuff
it's because I love love the game when I
say game I mean business
entrepreneurship zero to one startups
marketing all of it I just love it right
and so I manage these failures
by putting a very deliberate and

[10:01]
by putting a very deliberate and
intentional chip on my shoulder that
just drives me forward if someone steals
from me or pushes me out or stabs me in
the back that action will directly
correlate to success I have in the
future there was this wrestler on my
wrestling team back in high school and
he was pretty good on the mat but when
he got mad he was really good and his
dad used to scream at him from the side
of the mat get mad get mad and it's kind
of hard to for for someone to get mad
just by yelling that to him but when he
did get mad he was five times better
than his average day on the mat so if
you're feeling burned out then that's a
signal that what you were doing wasn't
giving you a whole lot of energy in the
first place work is an interesting thing
because it's it's work it's called work
I sat down at this chair every single
day for 9 to 12 hours same chair and
it's work and it's intellectually
stimulating and it makes me tired which
is kind of weird weird in the way that
chest players can burn 6,000 calories a

[11:01]
chest players can burn 6,000 calories a
day just sitting there playing chess cuz
the brain uses a lot of energy but it
doesn't feel like work but it still is
work at the same time I'm saying two
opposite things that are both true I
need a break from work even though I
enjoy it but I know that I will be doing
this forever because it's addicting and
I love it so if you're going through
something tough I think now is the time
to take inventory on everything you
think about on a daily basis when you
don't have to think about anything I
mean literally take inventory open up
your Notes app and as soon as you start
thinking about a topic write it down
what is that is it cooking pizza in your
pizza ovens barbecue woodworking running
metal working reading it doesn't matter
what it is it can be anything gaming I
don't care what do you think about when
you don't have to think about anything I
talked about this a week ago in my Q&A
episode you've got to follow your
passion camp and then you've got to suck
it up and do what you have to do camp
and there's truth in both of them if I
were to guess based on your 90c question
you've enjoyed the work that you've been
doing but it hasn't truly been your

[12:00]
doing but it hasn't truly been your
passion this is a perfect example of how
not doing your passion is not scalable
so if your passion is something specific
like woodworking then you got to find
out a way to make money on that but most
likely you have five to 10 different
passions so pick the two or three that
you're most likely to be able to make
money on whether by starting a business
in that field or by getting a job in
that field or by doing it in the
evenings while you have a job that you
don't really love if you love business
if you truly love business then you got
a million options at your disposal then
you just pick any business which is why
you're probably listening to my podcast
in the first place but to use another
Sports analogy there are athletes that
love to win and there are athletes that
truly hate to lose and if I were to
guess the ones that hate to lose usually
perform better which is another way of
saying they have a chip on their
shoulder so find what your chip is put
it on your shoulder refer to it often
use it to fuel you start listening to
optimistic people try to put yourself 5
years in the future where you'll look

[13:00]
years in the future where you'll look
back on today and you'll just know
you'll just know that this ended up
being for your betterment it's hard to
do it's really really hard to do it's
easy to give you that advice it's very
hard to do try to put yourself in the
future because I know this will turn
into a win for you and you're going to
make it all right let's go to Scott
mobile oil change business we go to you
we provide the oil the oil filter we do
everything there we remove the oil when
we're done I need help with pricing and
any anything else you think that I
missed Mobile Oil Change business I love
it first of all this whole industry is
blowing up we've got a couple clients at
our agency that are doing this and they
are blowing up why would you go to an
oil change place and wait in a stinky
Lobby and read old magazines when you
could have someone come to you okay you
need help with pricing there's several
different ways you can price something
number one what is the hourly rate that
I want to make if it takes you an hour
to do an oil change including driving
and your time is worth $50 an hour to

[14:01]
and your time is worth $50 an hour to
you your costs on the oil change are $25
then you got to charge $75 an hour or
you can look at market pricing call up
your competitors specifically Mobile Oil
Change competitors because one school of
thought is oh my costs aren't as high so
I don't have to charge as much a fixed
facility might cost a millionar to build
or $10,000 a month to rent but my Mobile
Oil Change van only costs $40,000 one
time and my monthly payment is $500 so I
can charge less no no no no no that's
one way to look at it the other way to
look at it is you are offering a
convenience a luxury it's kind of why
food trucks are so dang expensive even
though their overhead is 90% less than a
fixed restaurant it's convenience it's
right there and the food might not even
taste any better in fact it usually
doesn't so call up your competitors and
they don't have to be your direct
competitors they could be in a different
city or state entirely but what is the
market price and then do the math to
figure out how that pricing shakes out
to your preferred hourly rate and then
you've got to figure out if and or when
you scale this can you afford to hire
someone to do it for you and still make
a decent hourly rate you're not going to

[15:00]
a decent hourly rate you're not going to
make 50 bucks an hour but if you make 25
bucks an hour and you have three trucks
out at one time you'll make 50% more per
hour without having to do any of the
work the other way you can price it is
just by looking at your costs what are
your fixed costs what are your variable
costs your fixed cost is going to be
your monthly payment on your van your
insurance and your variable costs are
your gas and your oil and your materials
that's how you price it and here's a hot
tip for you Facebook groups I know I
talk about Facebook groups a lot but I
know for a fact I have proven evidence
that Mobile Oil Change and or mobile
breake repair and replacement Mobile
Mechanics do really really well in local
Facebook groups that's not a theory I
know that firsthand all right let's go
to rahon all right if you are watching
this clip right now you are watching
this on YouTube and if you are a fan of
podcast please check out my podcast
while you're at it because sometimes I
have podcasts that aren't on YouTube and
sometimes I have YouTubes that aren't on
podcast so check out the ker office on
any podcast platform or you can go to
TKO .c also my newsletter will throw

[16:01]
TKO .c also my newsletter will throw
that in there there are no ads It's
weekly it's different content than my
podcast and YouTube newsletter. chrisj
cerner.com You'll see the link and we'll
see you there hey Chris my name is ran
I'm from Toronto Canada so I come from a
background in it more than 10 years of
experience recently laid off about I
have about $20,000 Canadian dollars that
I'm looking to invest in the perfume
Landing business now I have a family
with three young kids a wife and myself
and I about like 3 months of living
expenses do you think it's worth it can
explore the the perfume ending business
or try something else by the way I have
a meeting with the the perfume lending
folks the link that you have on your in
one of your YouTube videos so what do
you suggest okay great question you have
20,000 Canadian dollars saved up which
is about
$177,000 you have three months of Runway
you want to start a business and you're
wondering if you should buy a perfume
vending machine from us to start this
business well I'm the most biased person
you could ask never ask a barber if you
need a haircut never ask a real estate
agent if it's a good time to buy or sell

[17:01]
agent if it's a good time to buy or sell
a house but do ask Chris Kerner if it's
a good idea to buy a perfume vending
machine from Chris Kerner because he'll
tell you the truth and frankly he's not
so good at sales anyway okay so sorry
Terell I know you're the one that spoke
to him over the phone I don't know what
you said I don't know how the call went
but if you had your sales call with me I
would tell you not to buy a perfume
vending machine from us and here's why
$20,000 savings is not a ton if you had
a full-time job and $20,000 to invest in
a business I would say yeah this could
be a good fit provided you do your
research beforehand before buying it
which ironically is the hardest part
about selling these machines because I
go on social media and I preach do your
research do your research do your
research about buying a perfume vending
machine which that equals friction to
people actually buying one they start
doing their research they flame out they
lose interest they move on to something
else they never buy right which is why
the sales cycle is so long and the
funnel is so narrow at the bottom to
selling these things so I'm kind of Hur
myself there but it's okay cuz I want to

[18:00]
myself there but it's okay cuz I want to
be honest I do think this is a great
business for the right person in the
right Market but I would not spend your
last $20,000 or a quarter of your last
$20,000 on a perfume vending machine
because it's too risky if that's all you
have and you don't have any either
income coming in it's a too high of a
percentage of your savings and it's
going to take too long to ramp it up
that machine will probably do $500 to
$1,000 the first month call it 700 to
12200 the next month so you're looking
at at 3 four months before you get your
money back out of it and then you're
looking at a profit of you know1 to
$2,000 a month after that point that's
not enough to live on especially in
Canada so if I were you I would focus on
getting a job that can pay the bills and
then build a service business of some
sort either online or in person during
the nights and weekends until that
service business can make enough money
to support your job next question is
Sean now I'm going to do something a
little different here Sean this show
isn't interesting format because a lot

[19:00]
isn't interesting format because a lot
of the people listening are like me and
they're marketers and they salesmen and
they want an audience and they're trying
to sell something and Shawn was very
clever to drop the URL of his business
in his question because his business
would be the perfect fit for the people
listening to this podcast and so he
wanted a free ad Sean I see you I
respect you but I'm not going to play
your question but I'm still gonna answer
your question here's what Sean's
question was so there is a popular
website that acts as an accountability
partner for people to meet their health
and fitness goals they charge between
$400 $900 a month for a one-on-one call
upfront and for daily check-ins
accountability coaching nutrition and
fitness plans etc etc etc and they have
a mobile app and Sean was asking if he
could SL should do the same business for
a business accountability partner okay
so maybe you're starting a business

[20:01]
so maybe you're starting a business
maybe you're running a business and you
want someone to check in with you hey
did you make a 100 cold calls yesterday
did you send the cold emails did you
file your LLC did you get your logo done
he's wondering if this would be a good
business would people pay for this here
are my thoughts my gut thought my gut
take here is this could be a good
business my second gut take my
pessimistic take is this would not be a
good business because of the fact that I
don't know of anyone doing this and I
don't like that I want someone to be
doing the business that I'm starting I
don't want to be first okay you know how
many other search engines were first
before Google Apple wasn't first
Facebook wasn't first these are outliers
but we don't even need to look at
outliers look at any business I want to
learn from the first through fifth
iterate on what they did right and wrong
and do my own thing okay so I don't like
that this isn't being done as far as I
can tell it probably is somewhere but
it's not a thing it's not on my radar I
think this is a really hard price point
there are gurus all over social media
selling coaching packages both business
coaching and life coaching for5 to 20

[21:01]
coaching and life coaching for5 to 20
$50,000 Crazy Prices why because they're
hoping that that will be the kick in the
butt that they need to do the thing that
they actually know they need to be doing
all along and you know what usually it's
not usually it doesn't make a difference
they're still not going to do the thing
same with health coaching or Fitness
coaching and then on the other end of
the spectrum you've got automations and
apps that are $9 a month10 50 a month
that do similar things and then you've
got the messy middle the $400 to $900
price point that's tough it's tough to
sell at that price point I just don't
know that business owners struggle with
accountability as much as they do with
Direction I think there's a reason that
business coaching is a wellestablished
industry and business accountability is
not anyone can hold a business owner
accountable but I think a business owner
wants an accountability partner that is
as or more experienced
than them at business and how are you

[22:01]
than them at business and how are you
going to hire someone to do that for you
at $300 or $400 a month and still make
money I think the better play here is
more of an AI powered app a chat GPT
rapper so to speak that keeps them
accountable maybe something that they
have to deposit money to that's
interesting huh you deposit $1,000 to
the app and if you don't do what you say
you're going to do then it will donate
that $1,000 to charity at the end of the
predetermined time period or it will
keep $1,000 and that's how you make
money from the app maybe the app is free
and that's the only way you make money
is banking on people failing at their
goals so Sean I'm going to say what I
say all the time and that's test
everything except drugs I know you
already have a landing page put up smart
I would see if you can get some
customers how long does it take before
they churn you got to learn these things
but if I were you and I was excited
about this idea and interested in it you
better freaking believe that I would
launch it I would test it because that's
what I do next question question from
Jack hey Chris love your stuff my name

[23:01]
Jack hey Chris love your stuff my name
is Jack I'm in Austin Texas I really
want to start something build my own
business I came across your newsletter
in December of last year regarding the
clavio opportunity about learning clavio
charging monthly retainers to help
optimize that for businesses help them
make more money I was curious if you
still think this is a solid opportunity
I'm super interested in it I'm currently
in sales right now and you know
marketing and whatnot so this caught my
attention I'm wondering if this may be
too saturated right now if there may be
too many agencies already doing this or
if you still think there's uh enough of
an opportunity to pursue something like
this so would love to hear your thoughts
and appreciate all you're doing thanks
Jack I love your question so he is
referring to a newsletter I wrote one
year ago almost exactly it was December
8th
2023 if you go to newsletter. chrisj
cerner.com
and go to the very last page find it

[24:00]
and go to the very last page find it
December 8th it was one of my highest
rated newsletters it's called your exact
path to 20K per month and three months
it's about starting an email marketing
agency specifically one built on clavio
or clavio which is a publicly traded
email marketing company basically built
around Shopify so if you have a Shopify
store and you want to set up all kinds
of email marketing automations you're
you're probably going to use clavo
there's another one called s lane
there's a couple others that are
specifically e-commerce CIO does a
really really good job I log in every
single day so there is a complete
business you could build around managing
someone's clavia just like there's a
business built around implementing and
managing Salesforce or slack or whatever
do I think this is still an opportunity
absolutely it's a framework I have I
think almost every opportunity sticks
around it doesn't go anywhere okay it's
only been a year Shopify is doing great
e-commerce is doing great but you can't
go about this the traditional way you're
going to have to do this for free you're
going to have to join some Facebook

[25:00]
going to have to join some Facebook
groups with e-commerce store owners
there's a lot of them in there and well
let me back up before you ever do that
you got to learn clavio you can start
like a dummy account for free because it
is pretty expensive software go in the
dummy account and just start learning
how to use flows there's two types of
core features within cavio you got flows
and you've got campaigns a flow is an
automation for instance if someone
visits my website they subscribe to my
newsletter but they never buy anything
then they would go into a flow where you
follow up with them period ially until
they buy a campaign is just sending a
one-off email to a list or a segment
this is really really fun software to
use okay if you like marketing email
e-commerce it's really fun it's very
intuitive it's not that difficult to
learn you'll enjoy it but you need a
test dummy right so go find a friend
that has an e-commerce store I'm sure
you have one do it for free with him or
her install clayo on their site watch
all the tutorials there's a zillion
videos out there on how to use it and
start actually moving the the needle
clavio will show you exactly how much

[26:01]
clavio will show you exactly how much
revenue you're generating through clavio
use your friend to get a case study okay
then use your case study to go to
strangers through Facebook groups that
own Shopify stores preferably you're
already finding people that are already
using clavo because it's much harder to
convince someone to use it than it is to
find someone already using it but not
fully taking advantage of it which I
would bet you 80 plus perc of cavio
users are only scratching the surface on
its capabilities so after your friend
let you have a stab at it ask a couple
strangers to do the same do it for a
month show them proof that you made them
more money then ask if you can start
charging 500 a month 200 a month
whatever it takes do it for a couple
more months raise your prices ask for
referrals use those case studies on your
website to keep doing the same thing I
promise if you're doing a good job which
you will be you'll get natural referrals
and that's the best kind of business but
if you really want to get creative you
can go to builtwith you can scrape a
list of all Shopify stores stuff that
I've talked about a million times this
is a solid solid opportunity but it's

[27:03]
is a solid solid opportunity but it's
going to be hard if you just start cold
emailing Shopify Plus stores because
they get emails from people like you all
the time so you got to go fish where
others are not fishing like Facebook
groups okay one last question from
Anonymous I like this question hey fan
girl here I want to say love you my
husband and I are really interested in
the biking juicing thing and we even
found a $14,000 camper which has room on
the back for bikes we live in a super
super rural area so our idea would be to
go to the different festivals that they
have in our areas to capitalize on where
people actually are the question is what
do I do next how do I even figure out
what the licensing is to do this kind of
business thanks hey I'm so happy to
answer your question because you sound
so nice and thank you for being a fan
girl and I love you too okay all right
for anyone that isn't familiar I posted

[28:01]
for anyone that isn't familiar I posted
a real a month or two ago about this
concept in Dubai that I thought was
amazing picture like a 20ft shipping
container kiosk food trucks type
situation and out front of it were
parked about three stationary bikes and
situated on the handlebars right in
front of your face is a blender okay the
blender is attached to the chain on the
bike so you pedal the bike you put fresh
fruit in the blender and you blend your
own smoothie with your bike with your
own energy okay and this is just such a
perfect business because the business
owner is saving on labor cost sure they
need still need someone to put the fruit
in the blender they still need someone
to accept your payment but generally
speaking there should be two people in
that trailer one collecting payment one
making the Smoothie but now they only
need one okay so your labor cost is cut
in half but on top of that you can
charge even more okay you get to you get
to have your cake and you get to eat it
too it's brilliant because you're
charging for the experience and then you

[29:00]
charging for the experience and then you
know what we're going to have our cake
we're going to eat it too and then we're
going to eat some more cake because this
is a visual business people will post
videos on Instagram of your bike
hopefully with your logo all over it
which is going to Dr bring more people
to your bike okay so Anonymous I wish I
knew your name the trailer's cool I like
the trailer concept but don't even go
there yet you need to start at farmers
markets you live in a rural area I don't
care where you are there's going to be a
farmers market on a Saturday Satur
morning somewhere within an hour of you
okay it generally costs between 50 and
$250 to post up with a 10 x10 tent at a
farmers market how do I know because
there's a farmers market one mile away
from me and my wife goes there every
other Saturday she actually doesn't have
to pay anything because we're residents
of the city that puts on the farmers
market but this is a great place to make
a million dollars no no to get direct
feedback face to face from your ideal
customer base and you can make some
money while you're at it and so you're

[30:01]
money while you're at it and so you're
going to work out the Kinks if it
doesn't go well guess what you're at a
100 bucks if it does come back the next
week and work at some more Kings get
some more feedback write it all down run
it through chat GPT all the feedback you
get run it through chat GPT and have it
tell you what you should change in your
business based on your feedback okay
then you're going to get a little
revenue from this you're going to get
some feedback you're going to make some
changes maybe the bike is too flimsy
maybe it's too hard maybe they have to
Pedal too long because there isn't
enough torque or whatever maybe the
fruit needs to be fresh instead of
Frozen maybe the smoothies don't taste
that good because your ingredients
aren't that good you're going to learn
all this stuff okay and then you can
scale however you want then you can go
get that $14,000 trailer you can go to
festivals then you get even more
feedback from a completely different
customer base and then you can post up
where food trucks go that's like the
second or third tier of your business
and if it continues to go well then you
can open a permanent a fixed location
somewhere hopefully that would support
your bike Smoothie business but I love
that you're trying this I hope you go
through with it and if do I want to hear
about how it goes thank you all for

[31:00]
