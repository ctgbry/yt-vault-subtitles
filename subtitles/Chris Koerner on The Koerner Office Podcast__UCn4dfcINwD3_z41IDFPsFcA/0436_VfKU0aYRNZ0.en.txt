tell me this isn't a brilliant idea all
of these things are true number one
every day gen xers put their parents in
nursing homes America's aging number two
if a nursing home is mostly full it
makes an additional $7,000 in net profit
per month for every patient that they
take on because they overhead is already
taken care of average nursing home
patient stays 3 years so if you do the
math on that that's almost $300,000 of
net profit that one additional filled
bed is worth to a nursing home and the
third thing that's true we are growing
increasingly interested in genealogy
what are the stories from our parents
and grandparents we want to know we want
to take record of that and now we have
ai tools that can help do that so here's
the idea you take a pod like this you
can buy them in China or you can build
one they're not that expensive and you
get permission to place it in a nursing
home for free then you put a screen in
there and AI prompts patients to sit
down and tell their life stories cuz
they really need to be prompted or else
they might not know what to talk about
their stories are recorded and they're
automatically sent to their children
free of charge you prove the concept
with one to three nursing facilities and
then you train them on how to sell this

then you train them on how to sell this
concept in their onboarding interviews
with the children that are placing their
parents there and once they report back
that those pods increases the occupancy
of the nursing homes you can charge
whatever you want for them because it
will enable the nursing homes to stand
out you preserve records you help small
businesses make more money you make more
money it's a win-win all the way around
