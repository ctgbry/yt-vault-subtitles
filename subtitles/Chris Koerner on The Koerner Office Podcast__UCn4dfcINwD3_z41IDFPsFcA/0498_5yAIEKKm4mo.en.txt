look at this freaking thing right here
here's what this business is how you
should profit from it what the framework
is that makes me love this day 19 of
showing you 2025 is best business ideas
so follow for more so the framework I
have is this whenever you see a new
business or new idea that just looks
stupid that's the exact moment you
should look twice at it a few years ago
who would have thought that twitch or
watching other Gamers play video games
instead of just playing yourself would
ever be a thing who would have thought
it's a multi-billion dollar industry now
so if a business idea gives you a vis
reaction that it's stupid then that's
probably a signal that it's not this is
a mobile dog gym in Canada and they
charge $80 per session and they're
packed and look at what's inside that
van you can't tell me that costs very
much money to build out go post up at a
dog park outside of PetSmart and profit
what's their value proposition your dog
can get much more exercise inside this
van in 30 minutes than they can get in
hours at home because of their equipment
is it true I don't know I don't care but
I want you to profit so get the full
business plan for this right here
