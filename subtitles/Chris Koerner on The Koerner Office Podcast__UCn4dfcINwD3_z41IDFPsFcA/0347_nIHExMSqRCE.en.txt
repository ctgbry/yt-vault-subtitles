I haven't been on a run in months I've
worked out about four times total in the
last 2 months and I'm currently running
a half marathon why because of one
Japanese word I can't get out of my head
it changed my life and it can change
yours but before I get to that some
background I spent all of my 20s obese
see for yourself and then at 31 I said
what are you doing I lost 60 lbs and
started running ultramarathons over the
next 2 years I ran 14 ultramarathons I
won four of them and I set records in
three of them and I've never been a
runner in my life the Japanese word is
misoji in Japanese culture a misoji is a
purification ritual that they take on a
basis which is a fancy way of saying
they do really freaking hard things to
shock their system but we don't need to
do that anymore we have all the Comforts
in the world and this Comfort is killing
us 2025 is 58 days away and I challenge
you to go do your misoji don't wait till
you're ready don't wait till you're in
shape just freaking put on some shoes
and go run 10 15 20 miles if you can't
run walk if you can't walk crawl it'll
change your life
