[00:00]
If you're looking for something that is
basically [music] free, that has a low
time investment, and that you could do
with only your phone, the book arbitrage
is so [music] wild. The barrier to
entry, it's non-existent cuz you don't
have to buy a palette.
&gt;&gt; You turned $1 into [music] $5,000.
&gt;&gt; Since then, we've bought more pallets
all for a dollar. I was spending maybe 3
hours a week [music] on this.
&gt;&gt; You had no presence, no account, no
following. $75 an hour. If you were
doing this as like a full-time business,
40 hours a week, that's 150,000 a year.
&gt;&gt; He has a over a million dollar book
operation. [music] The time constraints
of being a mom, there's only so much
time in the day that I can dedicate to
this. [music] I snap the pictures and
then AI literally does everything else
for me.
&gt;&gt; Oh, your husband's a firefighter. You're
a stay at home mom. You just had your
fourth child. You're limited [music] on
time, limited on resources, but there's
no excuses. So, I applaud you for that.
So, last week I came across this lady on
Twitter that is buying pallets of books
for $1 and selling them for $5,000. This

[01:02]
for $1 and selling them for $5,000. This
can be done in any market on multiple
different platforms. It's not sexy, but
it's very, very profitable. And it's
kind of funny because this business
wouldn't even be possible before ChatGpt
cuz there's a lot of tediousness to it
that ChatGBT completely solves. So, if
you've ever wanted to make thousands or
tens of thousands of dollars from
getting free books and selling them, or
if you want to learn more about what not
and live selling and how to take $6
items and sell them for $40, this is the
episode for you. Please enjoy.
&gt;&gt; So, my husband was looking to build a
home gym. We bought this property. We
live in a, you know, really small town.
We have some acorage. So, he built his
dream shop, this big 40x60 shop, and he
wanted to make a section of it into a
home gym. So he's on gov deals looking
at liquidation equipment. Schools are
getting rid of their gym stuff all the
time. And so he finds one that's nearish
to us and he had been trolling this site
for weeks and weeks looking for this

[02:00]
for weeks and weeks looking for this
equipment. And I had never paid
attention to it, but he was like, "Hey,
this is interesting. They have they have
some kids stuff on here." So I get on
there and I start looking and they have
these book palettes. And [snorts] like
being a homeschool mom, I have this like
book addiction. It gets weird. You're
like, "Oh my gosh, I'm my home life."
&gt;&gt; We're not even homeschoolers, but we
have the same addiction.
&gt;&gt; It's just a beautiful part of childhood.
Just having like a rich literature
environment has been super important.
So, I see these pallets of books on
there and I'm like, "What? You can buy a
whole pallet of books for a dollar?
Like, what is this?"
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow. They're just throwing them
away, basically.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. At this point, I I didn't realize
the scale of it and the accessibility of
it because this this entire thing is
brand new to me. So, I make an account
side by side sitting with him at the
dinner table and I throw a bid on it cuz
I don't know that a bid is binding.
Like, you put a bid on there and you win
it. You [laughter] got to go get it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And he's bidding on
&gt;&gt; What was your bid for?
&gt;&gt; A dollar. I just bid a dollar. I'm like,
there's no way I'm going to get this for

[03:00]
there's no way I'm going to get this for
a dollar.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. He's bidding on all this exercise
equipment and anyway it comes to the
closing of all these auctions. He lost
every single exercise equipment that he
had put on and I won the dollar book
pallets [laughter]
&gt;&gt; and he'd been investing weeks into this
and you're just like I don't know. Let's
freaking throw a dollar bid in there.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. He was like we have to drive
like we have to tow the trailer to go
pick this up. What are we gonna do with
all these? And I'm like so excited. You
know, my home library is like about to
be so epic. So again, at this point,
like I'm not even thinking about selling
these. I'm just thinking this is a
treasure trove. This is going to be so
fun for me and the kids. So we drive
out. It was actually three and a half
hours from [laughter] us. So it's like
not a small jaunt.
&gt;&gt; We get these pallets. We bring them
home.
&gt;&gt; The kids and I are going through them.
And I was like eight months pregnant.
So, these ended up sitting for, I don't

[04:01]
So, these ended up sitting for, I don't
know, several weeks. We're in the middle
of this big remodel. We added like an
entire second level to our home. We've
got kid number four coming in hot. And
so, my father-in-law is over. This is
like weeks and weeks later, right? So,
we've we've combed through it all. We've
put stuff on our bookshelves and there's
all this curriculum that I'm like, "What
am I going to do with this stuff? I have
no idea what any of it is." So, we're
in, you know, the downstairs. My husband
and his dad are cutting sheetrock and
I'm sitting on the floor so pregnant
looking at all this curriculum. I looked
on eBay, which again, like had no idea
people were still using eBay. eBay is a
wild place, like for how long it's been
around and how how heavily it's still
used. So, I get on there and I take a
picture, you know, they have their
little AI thing and I look up this
curriculum I'm holding and I see all
these listings for like $375. $400.
&gt;&gt; Oh, $375.
&gt;&gt; $375 for it was like a six book set. And

[05:02]
&gt;&gt; $375 for it was like a six book set. And
mind you, I know thousands.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, I was like, "Oh my gosh, you guys,
this someone's selling this for 375."
So, I throw it up for 350. Sold 5 days
later. And then I was like,
&gt;&gt; "Okay,
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; now tell me about how many books were on
this palette, just so I have some idea
of scale."
&gt;&gt; I ended up bidding on two. So, I got two
pallets each for $1. So, my investment
now is like $2.26
taxes or something. And there was
hundreds and hundreds of picture books,
probably at least 15 or 20 boxes of
curriculum, and then a lot of chapter
books. Is that kind of like the three
categories of books? Chapter books,
picture books, curriculum.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say so. The other piece of
this is most of the time when you're
purchasing these from a school district,
liquid liquidating anything that they
have, you have no idea what's inside.

[06:02]
have, you have no idea what's inside.
So, there's two pieces to it. It's
pretty boring. It's a boring category
for most people, right? I I would say
I'm more of an anomaly. It's like sounds
freaking awesome. [laughter]
That's why you and I be fast friends in
the wild. But there's this element of
like you have no idea what's inside,
right? Like it could be it could be
anything. It could be dictionary.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But it's a dollar. Worst case, you
throw it away. Like
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; whatever.
&gt;&gt; I mean there's a lot of stuff all
sellable that I've got, but a lot of
things that like for me with the time
that I have and the time that I wanted
to dedicate to this, I didn't want to
sell oneoff chapter books and one-off
picture books. There's a lot of big
sellers on eBay that are doing that. I
think it could be really successful on
Facebook Marketplace, but it was just
not something that I necessarily wanted
to create the time for. And so, my local
library was stoked. They took off so
much of off my hands. And they'll use it
for community fundraising at events, you

[07:00]
for community fundraising at events, you
know, where they set up and do, you
know, pay by donation or whatever. But
the gold in there for me was the
curriculum. And I found that out so fast
when I made that first sale that was
$350. And so from there, I started just
piecing out the curriculum and I'm
taking all of these different sets and
chat GBT was was my assistant. I got the
$20, you know, like upgraded membership.
I would take a picture of it. It did all
of the time consuming nitty-gritty work
for me. It told me what it's selling
for, what pieces go together. Because a
lot of times, you know, you'll get like
these boxes and it's like teachers
manuals and student manuals and all
these handbooks and then readers that go
along with it and I have no context for
it. So, I don't know what's a set and
and what isn't. So, Chat GBT did that
all for me.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, with those three categories,
picture books, chapter books,
curriculum, what kind of percentage
would you say was, you know, each
category give or take
&gt;&gt; on the palette? Yeah,

[08:00]
&gt;&gt; on the palette? Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I had a full pallet of novels of like
middle school novels and then the other
palette was probably 50% children's
picture books and 50% curriculum.
&gt;&gt; So 50% chapter books, 25 picture books,
25 curriculum. When you say picture
books, you mean like children's books,
like ages like 2 to six or whatever. 2
to 8.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, from just elementary age
typically.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And it was just a really broad
variety. A lot of these like I had a lot
of teacher classroom sets where these
are like teachers purchased these or
were they were handed down to them which
is super common within schools and so
you know they had really limited
markings on them which is excellent for
resale and then a lot of them were ex
library copies so a little bit heavier
wear but still I mean there's so much
opportunity if you live in a market
where you can sell on Facebook
marketplace and you can bundle these
together for me that's living so rurally
people oddly don't really use Facebook
marketplace. So that's why I sold

[09:01]
marketplace. So that's why I sold
exclusively on eBay. But I think there's
huge opportunity for somebody that has
access to or lives in a metropolitan
area. And that's kind of, you know, why
I started sharing about this is the
opportunity to make money here is
significant. And the barrier to entry,
it's non-existent because you don't have
to buy a pallet. You could hop on
Facebook Marketplace right now and find
endless listings of people trying to get
rid of books. It's like the book
arbitrage is so wild. Or you can go to a
thrift store and and buy a, you know,
paperback book for 10 cents.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's not like you just found this
random two pallet gold mine deal and
like no one else can find anything that
good. Again, like these deals
everywhere, not just on Gov deals, but
all over the place,
&gt;&gt; right? You if you have a phone, you can
do this business and you could literally
do it today.
&gt;&gt; Real quick, please subscribe to my
channel. I know it's kind of lame to
ask, but it means a lot. Thanks.
&gt;&gt; I saw a guy recently, actually, this is
how we connected. I had commented on
Saul. I don't know his last name, but

[10:00]
Saul. I don't know his last name, but
OnX I think is a big Amazon seller now
and I I could be misspeaking there soon,
but anyway, he started in book resell
and he just posted a flyer up said we'll
pick up free books and he that's how he
like made his entrance as an
entrepreneur.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; And I feel like that's still very
doable. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; In 2025. So, of the 75% that were
picture books or chapter books, did you
sell or attempt to sell any of those or
did you donate all those to the library?
&gt;&gt; I donated almost all of the chapter
books. The picture books I have done
bundles of and sold it's very few by
comparison. The bulk of what I do I
would say is like 98% curriculum is what
I sell on eBay. Okay. There's a lot of
classroom sets where you have, you know,
many copies of the same title and I'll
sell those sometimes on eBay. So, you
know, somebody's picking up 20 copies of
one picture book.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz one listing is 20 listings,
right, in one basically, right? It's
easy.
&gt;&gt; And then the quantity, too, is you know,
sometimes I'll I'll get a palette that

[11:01]
sometimes I'll I'll get a palette that
has like I just since then we've bought
more palettes all for a dollar. I think
I paid a dollar for one,
&gt;&gt; but you know, there's like 350 copies of
a hardback picture book, Stella Luna,
which is like super popular children's
picture book. So, yeah, that you can
bundle and and sell to somebody that's
running a co-op, somebody that's doing
homeschooling in a group or a teacher. I
have oftentimes teachers will message me
and say, "Hey, I'm looking for this. I'm
a new teacher. My school is underfunded.
Can I buy this from you or do you have
this?" and I can put together custom
listings for them and give them
something that's incredibly affordable
because it's coming out of their own
pocket. So, it's cool that way, too. You
know, you're supporting like so many
different situations.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So, when it comes to selling
like bundles of the picture books, what
are the unit economics of that? Like,
how many books are you putting together?
Are you grouping them together like by
age or like Stella and Luna? And then
what are you selling them for on
average? And is it eBay, Facebook

[12:00]
average? And is it eBay, Facebook
Marketplace or both?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So this is this is where it
gets really good and where AI has been
incredibly supportive for me. Again, the
the time constraints of being a mom,
right? Like there's only so much time in
the day that I can dedicate to this. So
what I did was I put the picture books
and the chapter books in boxes where you
could see the spines. I took pictures.
So I lined it up like 20 boxes. I took
pictures of each box. I uploaded all of
those pictures into chat GBT and I gave
it all of these metrics. I want you to
create a master manifest. Include the
box number. Tell me every title, author,
reading level, and then create bundles
of 10 by reading level, genre. I had all
of these different ways that I could mix
and match. And then I had it create me a
picklist. So then I have a PDF
spreadsheet that says, you know, this is
the bundle title. It gives me a complete
SEO listing for eBay and it'll tell me

[13:00]
SEO listing for eBay and it'll tell me
this title in box number one, this title
in box number five, this, you know, and
you just create the pick list. I rubber
band it, throw the listing up. You know,
pictures are important. I use literally
a white poster board on a foldup Costco
table. I snap the pictures so that
they're clean and that you can see
anything. And then AI literally does
everything else for me. Oh,
&gt;&gt; another kind of important piece to this
because I think it's important for I
think it's pretty prevalent that you
have a stay-at-home mom that has this,
you know, like desire to contribute
financially in some kind of a way. And
time is a big thing when you're a
parent. And so for me, how I made this
work is I would spend an hour every
couple of days. I mean, my time
investment in this is so significantly
low. And I think that's important for
people to know. So I would take an hour
during nap time. I would have a batch of
books that I'm going to list. I hammer
it out really quick, literally in my
living room. And then at bedtime, my
kids go to bed. Instead of laying and
scrolling Instagram or scrolling

[14:01]
scrolling Instagram or scrolling
whatever, I would do eBay listings. I'd
spend 30, 40 minutes throwing them up.
And I just did that every week over and
over and over again.
&gt;&gt; And then before you know it, you've got,
you know, you wake up to three sales,
then you wake up to four, then you get
seven during the day. And it just
compounds over time, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally. And the eBay algorithm
too, it favors if you're, you know,
consistently showing up and posting
things. Yeah. And I saw that reflected
significantly in how much I was selling,
the velocity and how quickly things were
moving. Depends on how frequently you're
posting them. So, I would do those
batches and then, you know, I'd throw
three listings up and then the next
night I would do the next three. And so,
it was just kind of consistently adding
to my storefront that way. Yeah. Again,
most of this business has been the
curriculum and the picture books. I did
do one whatnot show trying to live sell
them just to kind of like offload them
to get more space since the curriculum
is the main focus. And I think that
that's there's a big opportunity there

[15:00]
that's there's a big opportunity there
too, especially if you don't have a
market where Facebook marketplace is
utilized cuz I think that's probably the
best place to sell picture books and
chapter books. I could be wrong.
&gt;&gt; And you can use media mail when shipping
them, right? So, it's a lot cheaper.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's something else that I
did. It's free shipping on every single
one of my listings. There's something
about the psychology of that. You know,
when you're looking at something, even
if the price point is like ends up being
the same or [clears throat] more, if
it's free shipping, people just tend to
favor the listing.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, on eBay, when you're selling
these bundles of picture books, roughly
how many per bundle, and what are you
selling each bundle for?
&gt;&gt; There's a big spectrum, and it depends
specifically on the curriculum. Like
there are certain curriculums that
schools are offloading that are really
easy to move and at what I would think
is a high price point especially when
your investment is like a penny.
[laughter]
So most of the time what I what I sell
is like a three to six book curriculum
bundle which is like a teacher guide, a
student guide materials and my average

[16:02]
student guide materials and my average
sale price from when I started so over
the last 6 months I think my average
sale price is oh I have it right here
$45. There's a pretty broad range. I try
not to list anything that's like under
$15 because at that point it's like
you're paying for shipping and it's, you
know, you're not really making the
margins aren't great on that. But then I
have, you know, these other curriculum
sets that are $350, $200. I picked one
up today, actually this morning. A
school was auctioning off these specific
curriculums that I've sold multiple
times. They're 50 bucks a pop and I
picked 10 of them up for a dollar
literally this morning on
&gt;&gt; sales. Oh my goodness. Oh my gosh. 99%
off. like 98% off. So
&gt;&gt; that's so crazy.
&gt;&gt; Rough roughly you're selling these
bundles for like4 to $400, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Closer to 40 if they're picture books,
closer to 400 if they're curriculum.
Maybe 200 or 300. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So of the two pallets, hundreds of books
or thousands of books. Are we talking
the first two pallets?

[17:00]
the first two pallets?
&gt;&gt; Definitely over a thousand.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; I think I had 600
600 chapter books. Best guess is like
2,000 books were on those two pallets.
Okay. And how long once you actually
started working on them, because I know
you took a little break right after you
got them. Once you started like moving
them, how long did it take you to get
rid of them? I'll either give them to
the library or selling them. And then
what would you say your revenue was for
those first two pallets in total?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. About 2 months it took me to move
through the bulk of the inventory. And
that was Yeah, that includes me donating
that lot to the library. And my total
revenue at that point was around $5,000.
&gt;&gt; Whoa. Okay. So, in two in two months,
you turned $1 into $5,000. And $4,999
of that was gross profit. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Like you had like time. You you had to
drive to the library to donate them,
right? Whatever. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But
&gt;&gt; there's, you know, the platform fees and

[18:01]
&gt;&gt; there's, you know, the platform fees and
my shipping fees. And so my net is is
&gt;&gt; lower than that. However, the kicker to
this is I was spending maybe three hours
a week on this.
&gt;&gt; It was just so minimal once I understood
how to look within these boxes for
certain things. Once I sold a few
things, I kind of started to understand
what that market was.
&gt;&gt; The time investment was so small.
&gt;&gt; Let me guesstimate here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; correct me if or when I'm wrong. So 3
hours a week, let's just say it's four.
Let's be conservative. 9 weeks, right?
So that's 36 hours, give or take, of
work. Let's say 40 hours. So it's like a
full work week worth of work. 40 hours
of working. Let's say your platform fees
are 15%. Your shipping is 15%. So 30. So
70% net margin. Is that kind of
accurate, give or take?
&gt;&gt; That's about uh 60 about 60%.
&gt;&gt; We'll say 60. 60.
&gt;&gt; Cool. Then that is uh what's that?

[19:00]
&gt;&gt; Cool. Then that is uh what's that?
$3,000 profit for 40 hours of work.
Divide 3,000 by 40, $75 an hour, which
is pretty dang good. If you were doing
this as like a full-time business, 40
hours a week, every week, which you're
not even trying to do, that's 150,000 a
year without like really like trying to
optimize or scale. Like that's your
first deal. Like it only gets better
from there. Right.
&gt;&gt; Right. Right. And I many times have
thought, "Oh my goodness, what would
happen if I doubled my time on this?
what would happen if you know I had
children that were going to school
during the day like the possibilities
are really really huge if you're willing
to do something that maybe isn't super
interesting to you right it's a very
niche market
&gt;&gt; I always tell people that you need to
fall in love with business and like then
it doesn't matter what you do you're
selling portaotties you're selling books
it's it'll all be interesting to you and
I think the people listening to or
watching this are interested in
business. So, I I do think maybe the

[20:01]
business. So, I I do think maybe the
average layman weirdo on the street that
isn't a a serial idea generating
entrepreneur, right? Maybe they find it
boring, but we don't care about them.
We're not making this podcast for them,
right? So, I think people will find this
interesting. I mean, you could hire like
a high school kid to come in in the
afternoons, pay him 15 bucks an hour and
you're you're still making 60 bucks an
hour not having to do the work. And
that's something I I thought about, you
know, there's some kids that are a
little bit older. My oldest is eight, so
like not quite there where he's going to
take high quality photos of inventory,
but I thought, man, have like one of
these 12 or 13 year olds come over and
they're, you know, at at at that age,
you're so excited to make any amount of
money and have them take pictures and
then at night, you know, I I'm spending
an hour listing them. There's
significant opportunity for sure and I
would be doing that if I wasn't dabbling
in another space [laughter]
&gt;&gt; which is the next
&gt;&gt; get to that
&gt;&gt; yeah evolution of the story but real

[21:01]
&gt;&gt; yeah evolution of the story but real
quick I wanted to tell you one more
thing that I that was is super helpful
for me now that I know which I didn't
when I first started because you know I
mentioned a lot of the times you don't
know what's on these pallets. So I got
on gov deals this morning just to like
see what's what's happening on there
with books and other markets. There's a
lot on there right now that's in
Georgetown, Texas. You're in Texas,
right?
&gt;&gt; Just outside of Austin.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, this is elementary classroom
resources. It's up for 10 bucks. There's
no bids on it. And the pictures on this
are actually they're extremely good
because you can actually see what's
there. So, if it were me and I was in
Texas, I would screenshot this listing
photo. I would send it to ChatGBT or
there's probably other AIs that may be
better at this. I don't I haven't
dabbled much in that space, but for me,
I'd send it to ChatGpt and I would just
ask it tell me the names of anything
that you can see on this palette and
then I take that. I go into eBay.
&gt;&gt; Why don't we do it right now?
&gt;&gt; Let's do it.
&gt;&gt; Let's do it right now.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Send Send me the picture. I might buy

[22:01]
&gt;&gt; Send Send me the picture. I might buy
this myself. I I hate to cut you off.
I'm just like so excited. I want you to
finish that thought.
&gt;&gt; How can I send this to you? Email.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Email. And then I'll share
my screen and I'll I'll show everyone
what chat GPT spits out.
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool. Do you have to pick these up
yourself or can you organize shipping?
Right now is actually the perfect time
to start something. And you guys know
I'm always talking about starting local
newsletters, local newsletters for your
city, job listings for your field, a
weekly roundup for your hobby, you know,
just taking whatever you know and
sharing it with people who want to
learn. This is one of the lowest risk
ways to build something that pays you
over and over. And Beehive is by far the
easiest way to do it. You can monetize
and grow your subscribers with their
built-in ad network. You can sell
digital products or paid subscriptions
directly to your audience. And yes,
they've even got an AI website builder
and a podcast integration. Now, I've
been using Beehive for 2 years and I
cannot recommend it enough. It is not
just a newsletter platform anymore. It

[23:01]
just a newsletter platform anymore. It
is the entire creator infrastructure.
So, don't wait for January. Start now.
Head to beehive.comris

That's beehiv.comris.
&gt;&gt; I've never seen shipping on the books
and I think just the weight of them
probably would it would be so
significant wouldn't be worth it.
&gt;&gt; So these are local pickup and that's
what you would want to do on um on gov
deals or like public surplus is another
one that does school auctions. You can
set your search radius,
&gt;&gt; you know. So, I'll always do like 250
miles and it'll show me what's what's
within that for me.
&gt;&gt; I might need to make a trip to
Georgetown. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; I'm serious. Is it one pallet?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not quite a full pallet. It
makes it more interesting because it's
more reasonable for somebody that's
brand new, you know? Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's like you could fit this in the back
of your minivan.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Or whatever you
&gt;&gt; When you say Yeah. When you say
classroom resources, I feel like they're
hinting at like it's more of like a

[24:01]
hinting at like it's more of like a
curriculum thing than just a bunch of
worthless books.
&gt;&gt; Totally. And that's what that's what
this is. The other thing GovDills is
really good at answering questions. And
so you can ask like any idea what's
inside, what level this is? Are they
teaching resources or are these re are
these reading books? You're showing your
hand a little bit then because then
somebody else you know that maybe didn't
know that can see have insight. But I
watch these auctions constantly and it
is a very rare occasion that these
pellets are getting bit up. They're
usually going for their opening bid,
which is most of the time a dollar. This
one's 10 bucks.
&gt;&gt; If someone were to only focus on gov
deals, it's so nice that you are able to
talk about this cuz like this is a very
localized thing and so like I I'm
assuming I'm making an assumption here.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but like the
fear of someone like competing against
you directly, that risk is not very big
because it's such a local thing. You got
to go pick it up and you're in Eastern
Washington, right? So, it's like
&gt;&gt; anyone can go do this in any local
market. How how many listings are there

[25:01]
market. How how many listings are there
on Gov deals in any given market for
books like these?
&gt;&gt; It really varies. For some reason,
Washington state has a lot. I'm not sure
what drives that. It might be funding
where they're, you know, like I
&gt;&gt; I've noticed when I'm shipping things
out, a lot of my orders are going to the
Midwest and the East Coast. I very
rarely have anything on the West Coast.
So, I think maybe it has something to do
with how schools are funded and how
rapidly they're replacing things. This
is really interesting. Shannon Gene, who
you've had on multiple multiple times,
he always talks about find out what you
can sell it for before you buy it.
What's interesting about the curriculum
space is when you go on eBay and you
look up sold listings, oftentimes there
either aren't any or they're so
infrequent. And so, if I didn't already
know this from experience, that would
make me a little apprehensive. The
reason why that is is because there's so
few people selling these resources on
eBay. There's one curriculum in
particular, I think I'm one of three

[26:01]
particular, I think I'm one of three
sellers on the entire platform that has
it. And I sell it.
&gt;&gt; Wow. because I'm one of the only people
that does.
&gt;&gt; So, you know, I think I think it's
important obviously to do your research
before you're bidding on stuff, but
again, the risk profile on this is so
low. It's not
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I mean, you're sacrificing some of your
time and, you know, you got to be able
to lift the boxes and stuff to load
them. So, that counts for something, but
that's
&gt;&gt; fine. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But, yeah, there's not a lot of people
that are doing this on eBay.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, you think I should upload
these three pictures to Jad GPT?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what I would do. I would
screenshot it and just say, "Tell me the
names of the resources that you can
identify in these photos."
&gt;&gt; All right, let's do this. So, basically,
what can you tell me about these books?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would say what can you identify
any titles of these books? [gasps]
&gt;&gt; All right. Units of study by Lucy

[27:00]
&gt;&gt; All right. Units of study by Lucy
Caulkins plus units of study in phonics
and units of How does it get that from
this picture? I can't see anything.
&gt;&gt; Isn't that wild? I've had many good
vibes for that reason. To my eye, I
cannot see what it is, but Chad GBT
somehow can.
&gt;&gt; Right. I love this business because this
wasn't nearly as intriguing 3 years ago
before Chad GBT. Like, this is a lot of
tedious stuff before Chad GBT.
&gt;&gt; Oh, it would have it would be such a
slog. I I would have donated everything
that we didn't keep for our personal
library. Like there's no way. I was just
telling a family member recently. She
was talking to me about like her
apprehensions about AI and I was like,
well, let me give you a different
perspective. This has created a business
for me. It is my $20 a month assistant
that saves me. I mean, it would have
taken me the better part of a year to
identify all of those books and group
them together. Like, there's just no
way. It wouldn't be worth it.
&gt;&gt; That is crazy. So
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; it says right here it says the grades,
it says what they are, and then at the
bottom it says could be worth 10 to

[28:00]
bottom it says could be worth 10 to
25,000 in retail, which obviously this
is not. Should I ask like what could
they be worth like used on eBay?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, that's that's where I would
go next. You know, schools are paying
top dollar for these because they're
buying them directly from the
publishers. But to me, immediately as a
potential purchase, I'm seeing that
price. That's what the schools paid for
it. That's very interesting. What's like
the most you pay for this stuff? Or is
it always is it kind of like a $1 to $10
or bust
&gt;&gt; for a palette?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Or a listing?
&gt;&gt; The most I've ever paid for a palette is
$32. And that's because I could see
what's on it and I really wanted it.
Like I knew at that point I had sold so
many things, you know, I could identify.
I'm like, I sell one book off of that
and I'm I'm like, you know, whatever
five, six times my investment.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Have you ever lost money on a
pallet or a deal or a listing?
&gt;&gt; No. That's crazy. How many palettes
would you say you've purchased so far?
&gt;&gt; I've bought 11. And that is truly like
three months of time.

[29:01]
three months of time.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's incredible. $100. Does this
seem right like these prices?
&gt;&gt; Let's see.
&gt;&gt; Might be hard to see.
&gt;&gt; They're very, very good. $100 for the
three grade bundle. Yeah. So, so I
popped a couple of these into the eBay
research tool just to see if people had
this listed and it's anywhere between
like $45 to $100. That's one thing that
I will say is the pricing that chat GBT
gives you is sometimes pretty off. And
so I always ask it because I want to
know do you does it see any value
anywhere on the internet? And then I'll
always double check it. But a lot of the
times I'm looking for are these listed
like current listings as well as have
there been sold listings because it's so
niche. You know, there might ne not
necessarily be very many recent sold
listings. So I base a lot of my pricing
off of what the current pricing of other
sellers are on there.
&gt;&gt; Gotcha. And this makes sense to me. As
good as Chad GPT is for organizing and
researching, you don't really try to
rely on it for pricing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, for this one, it's like one of

[30:01]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, for this one, it's like one of
these boxes in this picture, you know,
like this top one that has the number
two on it. You could probably sell that
for 100 bucks. How many of those boxes
are on this palette? Like in these
photos, I can see 1 2 3 4 5 six. Seven
from one angle. It's very interesting.
&gt;&gt; This could be $1,000 palette for $10.
&gt;&gt; Oh, 100%. I think you could easily make
$1,000 off this palette. It said, did it
say Heinaman on there
&gt;&gt; on Chad GBT? Yeah, when I identified it.
&gt;&gt; I thought I That does sound familiar.
Oh, yeah. Lucy Caulkins.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've sold quite a bit of Heinaman.
Not this specific one, but that author
or publisher, whatever. I don't even
know, actually. So, it's very
interesting. And they just, like I said,
they pop up frequently. I had actually
there's a school district that I've
bought multiple times from that's in
Washington. I won't say which one it is
because I this could be upsetting I
guess to some people but I had their
purchasing person purchasing manager
reach out to me last week and say hey we

[31:00]
reach out to me last week and say hey we
have 50 pallets of curriculum it's going
to the trash you can take whatever you
want
&gt;&gt; do you want any of it
&gt;&gt; oh that could be 50 grand
&gt;&gt; it could be so many things and you know
the this particular one I actually there
was somebody that I connected with
through Shannon Jean's mastermind that
is he has a over a million dollar book
operation and
&gt;&gt; wa
&gt;&gt; I connected with him on X and he was
really gracious with his time and he
talked through it with me to kind of
look up a couple things cuz he sells on
Amazon and like is there any you know
wholesale opportunity with this cuz it's
such a large amount but my point in
sharing that is the opportunity is so
significant and the alternative to
people not purchasing these is they're
going to a landfill which is just like
it's so sad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, you're doing you're doing a dual
purpose. You're making income and you're
also you're doing something really
significant for the environment.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. There's no losers in this.
&gt;&gt; I mean, I just looked up books on deals

[32:00]
&gt;&gt; I mean, I just looked up books on deals
and there's
&gt;&gt; 1300 results.
&gt;&gt; Obviously, they're they're not all going
to be relevant, but
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But there's like I mean, if you
see if you ever see anything that says
like classroom materials, learning
materials, textbooks, there's there's a
couple textbook deals. Let's see. Or
like there's one elementary teacher
resources. That's super interesting.
Those are usually high ticket sellers.
And textbooks can be hit or miss, but
usually you can see a textbook on the
pallet or you could ask could submit a
question on there.
&gt;&gt; There's a pallet of textbooks in Wville,
Missouri for 10 bucks. And it looks like
it's a pre-calculus textbook. They're
all the same. So I don't know what
that's worth. You could find out really
quick and then it's that's an
interesting because you list it one time
quantity 100 or you bundle them and ship
them as a box.
&gt;&gt; Are you willing to share what your eBay
name is?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's homeschoolie. So homeschool
and then IE at the end.
&gt;&gt; I want to look at your listings and then
I got to hear about what you've been

[33:01]
I got to hear about what you've been
doing here lately.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And what does your husband do for work?
&gt;&gt; He's a firefighter.
&gt;&gt; Oh, awesome.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, that's been super
supportive to doing this resale stuff is
his schedule allows me, you know, to
have time when he's home. So, he's home
for, you know, it's stacking his shifts.
So, he's gone for a few days and then
home for a few.
&gt;&gt; Did he ever find his workout equipment?
&gt;&gt; No. [laughter]
The poor guy. His shop's full of books
instead of his workout equipment.
&gt;&gt; He can lift the books.
&gt;&gt; Totally. Yeah, he's he's getting his
workout in for sure.
&gt;&gt; Okay. 100% positive feedback. That's
awesome. pictures look great. A lot of
uh curriculum. Okay. Tell us what you've
been doing here lately. So, I'm driving
one day and my husband sent me one of
your interviews with Shannon Jean and
I'm listening to this and at this point
I had no like I'm trolling gov deals
looking for books every day, you know,
but I had no idea that there's an entire

[34:00]
but I had no idea that there's an entire
world of auctions and arbitrage that's
available outside of GV deals. So, I'm
listening to this interview and I'm
like, what in the world? like what is
this? And that week I had started
thinking about just my husband had
mentioned like what if we you know added
on to this like could we add toys to
this or what else could you sell under
the homeschoolie brand on eBay and I had
all this money from the books that I'm
like what am I going to do with it? Like
I want to do something bigger. Do I want
to scale the books or should I dabble in
something else? And so I ended up
landing on these this Rent the Runway
auction. So Rent the Runway, you know,
when they have a piece of clothing that
is slightly blemished or maybe
significantly blemished, they're not
going to rent it out anymore and so they
get rid of it.
&gt;&gt; Tell us what they do. For those
listening,
&gt;&gt; it's a a women's clothing. I believe
they also have handbags and accessories

[35:00]
they also have handbags and accessories
now where you can pay a subscription fee
and you get to pick high-end designer
pieces and they ship them to you. You
wear them for whatever the occasion is
and then you ship them back. So, you're
paying literally to rent a high-end
piece of clothing, which makes so much
sense, right? like they have a, you
know, a $1,500 designer dress that maybe
you want to wear to a gayla or a wedding
or whatever and you just wear it, rent
it for, you know, $80 and send it back.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, you bought a a Rent the Runway
listing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, they liquidate anything that
has a slight blemish on it and there
were a couple pallets that came up on
betock and so Rent the Runways on there
and so I see this I'm like, well, this
is super interesting. this, you know,
MSRP on these two pallets was, I think,
$355,000.
So, I took my book money and that's what
I bought. And I got it with the
intention of listing it on Poshmark. And
then it arrived at my home and I
realized, oh my goodness, I there's no

[36:01]
realized, oh my goodness, I there's no
way I have 900 items. Most of them are
unique items. It's not like I have 10 of
the same thing.
&gt;&gt; It's going to take take me the rest of
my life to sell this. And so I learned
about live selling. I had no idea this
was a thing. And so that's what I'm
doing now. I'm live selling high-end
designer clothing on whatnot.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. Did you ever think you'd be
doing that?
&gt;&gt; Not in a million years.
&gt;&gt; You said it was like MSRP was like
350,000. What did you pay for it all?
&gt;&gt; $6 an item.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; I'm nervous to say it. So much.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I think $5,400 was
my total investment for $350,000 of
merchandise.
&gt;&gt; So, like 98% off again, just like the
books.
&gt;&gt; The margins are insane. And the thing
with whatnot is people are looking for a
deal. Have you been on there?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's addicting.
&gt;&gt; It's
&gt;&gt; as a buyer, it's addicting.
&gt;&gt; It is a wild wild west of shopping. It
is so crazy. But people are looking for

[37:02]
is so crazy. But people are looking for
a deal on there. And so it's like, I
have this really valuable merchandise.
What do I sell it for? And ultimately,
I'm like, well, I paid $6 for this, so
let's find out. I don't know. You know,
I'm brand new. I've done six shows.
Like, I'm by no means like established
on there. You know, I think it's a grind
to get established and get a following
and, you know, start seeing higher
prices on things.
&gt;&gt; But the risk for me financially was it's
so low. I took Yeah. I spent a dollar on
some books. I made some money on that. I
took it and I rolled it into something
else. And I ran numbers on this.
&gt;&gt; You're playing with house money still.
Like you spent everything you earned,
but you started with a dollar basically,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; You were saying you ran some numbers.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I ran numbers on, you know, but
like what's my what's my bottom? You
know, if I You do start prices on there.
So, a lot of people, you know, it's
enticing to start at a dollar. I'm I'm
not doing that yet. I think I will at
some point, but I ran numbers on, you

[38:02]
some point, but I ran numbers on, you
know, if I start at $29, if I what if I
sold every one of these pieces for $29,
I'm easy. We'll clear $30,000 after
fees.
&gt;&gt; How long will that take me? I don't
know. Couple months. And that's if I'm
like s consistently showing up and doing
it. But I've done six one-hour live
streams on there. I've done $1,200 in
sales with zero following. And to me,
I'm like, these are small numbers,
right? In the long game, they're small
numbers, but it's again like just what
you're willing to put into it. And I'm
putting such minimal time into it cuz
that's what I have. I'm a mom. I'm I got
four little kids. So, I'm putting
minimal effort and minimal time. And I
think the opportunity for literally
anybody to do this is there. Guys, I
hate to break it to you, but you're not
very likely to actually start a business
based on something you see or hear on
this podcast, unless you spend a little
more time with me and with other people
that are doing just that. So, come check
out TK Owners. That's tkowners.com where

[39:01]
out TK Owners. That's tkowners.com where
hundreds of people are launching,
starting, testing, experimenting with
business ideas that they heard from this
podcast. If you want to go fast, go
alone. If you want to go far, go
together. Check out tkowners.com. We'd
love to have you.
&gt;&gt; Anyone can make a seller account on
whatnot. You had no presence, no
account, no following. And you've made
200 in an hour so far.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; 1,200 in six hours, right? And like, of
course, you're you paid $6 to $10 per
item, but Okay. Sorry. $180 profit per
hour so far, right?
&gt;&gt; With no following.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Before you before you continue that
thought, I have to run to my closet and
show you my whatnot regret that I
bought. It's You're going to laugh. I'll
be right back.
&gt;&gt; Good. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Okay. All right. So, I have a good
friend, his name is Jared. He sells a
lot of stuff on whatnot. I think he has
40,000 followers, multiple
[clears throat] shows a day.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do a lot.
&gt;&gt; Sports cards, watches, clothing,
handbags. Anyway, we were talking about
it and he's like, "You got to come to a
show. You got to come to a show." So, I

[40:01]
show. You got to come to a show." So, I
downloaded whatnot. I'm out of breath
cuz I sprinted to my closet, but
[laughter] I downloaded whatnot and I
was on a show and they were doing
t-shirts, like vintage t-shirts. and he
pulled out this shirt and uh [gasps] I
just fell in love. It was this shirt
that was just so ugly but so cool at the
same time. And my wife was next to me.
She's like, "Don't you buy that shirt."
Like, "Don't you buy that shirt." And
most of these shirts are going for like
$5 to $10. And this one just started
going crazy. And I was committed. I was
going to buy this shirt no matter what.
And I think I paid like $70 for it. And
are you ready to see it?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's see it.
&gt;&gt; So, here we go. And it's way too big, by
the way. It does not fit me. So,
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; yes.
&gt;&gt; That's the epitome of what whatnot is
right there in a t-shirt. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; I'm sad you didn't wear that for this
interview.
&gt;&gt; It's so good. It doesn't fit well. It's
huge.
&gt;&gt; But I don't even think I've ever worn it

[41:01]
&gt;&gt; But I don't even think I've ever worn it
and I paid way too much for it, but it's
my whatnot memory. Of course, it smells
like a thrift store. It's weird, isn't
it? Like when you because I've, you
know, I played around for like a solid
month. I'm trying to learn like how does
this work? What works? What could I do
better than, you know, certain shows
that I'm watching or whatever. And I did
the same thing. I'm like, "Oh, I'm going
to bid on that." Oh. And it's so fast.
&gt;&gt; It is.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's like your heart starts racing and
you're like,
&gt;&gt; and like it's almost kind of sad cuz
there's like a lot of people that spend
way too much money on there.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sure.
&gt;&gt; Like they're addicted to it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Anyway. All right. So, you're selling
these dresses. Are these kind of like
are these like nice formal dresses?
&gt;&gt; A lot of them are. Yeah. It depends. Um
the lot that I got had a pretty
significant amount of like sweaters and
outerw wear and jeans. The makeup of
them are always different and it'll tell
you. It gives you a full manifest of
every single item that's on there and
it'll break it up by category. But

[42:00]
it'll break it up by category. But
there's a significant amount of dresses.
And
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; I would say uh maybe like 50/50 of like
really formal dresses versus a more
casual like cocktail type attire.
&gt;&gt; Oh man. So you're so far you're glad you
did it. I mean you've made like a fifth
of your money back already. A fourth of
it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And are you going to buy more stuff or
are you just going to like work through
this until it's gone and then buy
something else?
&gt;&gt; This is such a good question. I think
the whatnot platform is extremely
interesting and I am very invested on
establishing myself on it right now.
They just got, you know, this huge round
of funding. I think like $250 million at
the end of last month. So, I think the
platform is in its infancy still and
there's significant opportunity as a
reseller on there. And so,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; I'm committed to that. I don't know. I
don't know if the high-end designer if
I'll continue with it or not. I guess it
kind of is going to depend on how
quickly I can move through it. Some of
the lower retail items might be more

[43:01]
the lower retail items might be more
interesting and it might work better. I
think it just kind of depends. It's hard
to know right now. Like who is my buyer?
I'm not sure.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I'm I'm just so new
&gt;&gt; now. I picture like your traditional
whatnot seller as being like super
outgoing, like super high energy, all
over the place. Is that you or is there
hope for people that are not like that
naturally? Oh man, you have the full
spectrum on whatnot. There are
70-year-old women sitting at their
dining room table selling jewelry and
then you have [clears throat] this guy
that's in a full Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory Willy Wonka outfit
packing, you know, races into into a
flat rate ship box. I think truly and I
was I'm a pretty extroverted person. I
you know I feel pretty comfortable in
just like having conversation with
people but I was nervous to get on
there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And something that calmed
[clears throat] my nerves was watching
all these other shows and seeing such a
broad spectrum of personalities. And

[44:00]
broad spectrum of personalities. And
there are people on there that
absolutely, you know, are more
introverted. And if you are that person
and you're looking for an additional
stream of income and whatnot is
interesting to you, but you don't want
to show your face, there are tons of
shows where people are just setting up
their camera and you never see the
person. You're only seeing the product.
And so I think it's that's the barrier
to entry. Again, it's it's so accessible
and reasonable and you can make it
whatever you want. You can be a
personality on there and those shows do
great or you could never ever show
yourself and you could also make a
killing.
&gt;&gt; That's amazing. What would you suggest
other people do? Like how could someone
learn from your mistakes? It doesn't
really sound like you've made any, but
like what would you have done
differently? How can people make money
at this that you haven't already touched
on?
&gt;&gt; It's a great question. Knowing what I
know now with the books, I think you
could make a more educated buying
decision based on visual, like what you
can see on a palette. And I didn't do
that. And again, my intention when I
bought it wasn't to sell it. So, I
didn't really have that on my radar. I

[45:00]
didn't really have that on my radar. I
was just excited about, [laughter]
you know, like this instant huge
library. That would be like one of my
top things to tell people is I [snorts]
think that you really can do your due
diligence in getting a decent idea of
your profit margins on a book purchase.
When it comes to live selling, my my
biggest piece of advice is figure out
the shipping. No matter what you're
selling, the whatnot back end of the
shipping can be really confusing as a
new seller. And if you don't have that
dialed in right, you can make a big
financial mistake right out of the gate.
&gt;&gt; You can literally lose your shirts. You
can
&gt;&gt; literally lose
&gt;&gt; lose your shirts.
&gt;&gt; You could be so upside down so fast cuz
you're going to eat the shipping if you
do it wrong. And I've heard that story
told multiple times. So I spent more
hours than I would like to admit
watching YouTube tutorials on the
shipping. And so that's really
important. My encouragement to people is
if you're looking for something that is
basically free, that has a low time

[46:01]
basically free, that has a low time
investment, that doesn't require a
significant amount of space, and that
you could do with only your phone. You
don't have to hire anyone. You don't
have overhead costs. Hop on Facebook
Marketplace and throw up a post to your
local community. Go on a community page
and say, "Hey, does anyone have any
curriculum that they're looking to get
rid of or does anybody have any books?"
however you want to do it and start by
spending nothing and just see how it
goes. Pick up some free stuff or if you
have the space and you have a truck and
you're willing to lift some boxes, pick
up a G deals auction
&gt;&gt; or go rent a truck from Home Depot or a
trailer. It's like 30 bucks. What are
like some sure tells on these books like
like the condition or like the brand,
the publisher? Like we've talked about
the curriculums or the money makers, but
like is there anything else that just
quickly passed the eye test for you?
&gt;&gt; That listing that you pulled up that we
looked at that has visible sets, you
know, it has the original packaging of
the sets of books. Like you can tell

[47:00]
the sets of books. Like you can tell
that there's that's probably a complete
set. That's a tell for me that that's
valuable. There's two different kinds of
buyers, too. There's people that are
supplementing what they already have and
they're looking for only one thing.
What's really interesting about this for
me as a potential purchase is that
there's so much on this palette of the
same thing that you could take part of
it and individually list it and you
could also sell complete sets. So,
you're hitting two different types of
buyers within the same curriculum set.
That's a tell for me. There are certain
curriculums and publishers that I know
will move fast for me. So, I'm I'm
always looking for those. like that one
that I told you this morning that I saw.
I've sold multiple of those already that
came mixed on another palette. This just
happened to be a palette of all the same
thing. And so I'm always looking for
that. I'm looking for, you know, I've
I've sold this before like SR is an
example of one that moves super quick at
a high price point. I sell them left and
right for $60 to $100 a set and these

[48:02]
right for $60 to $100 a set and these
are I mean they cost me seven, eight
bucks to ship. That's amazing. Mindy,
this was incredible. Even better than my
high expectations expected.
&gt;&gt; That's really kind to say.
&gt;&gt; Well, it's true. Where can people find
you if they have questions, they want to
learn more, etc.
&gt;&gt; I think X is the best place.
&gt;&gt; Okay, that is
&gt;&gt; we can link to you there. What's your
name on there?
&gt;&gt; It's Hey
Mindy.
&gt;&gt; M I N D I like igloo.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's kind of the melting pot cuz
you know these are two. This is kind of
a wild combo. I'm a book seller and I
sell high-end designer clothes. So, I'm
marrying those two on X. I feel like it
works there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, you sell whatever people
are buying. That's that's how it should
be.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The beautiful thing about this is
I have this book business going almost
in the background. So, you know, I'm
throwing listings up periodically here,
but that money is what's funding
whatever I'm buying on Btock or,
&gt;&gt; you know, whatever I'm going to do next

[49:00]
&gt;&gt; you know, whatever I'm going to do next
on whatnot. my book money is going to
fund it and that pretty cool. I don't
really have a lot of skin in the game
risk-wise, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; there's skin in the game. I shouldn't
have said that, but
&gt;&gt; No. Right.
&gt;&gt; It's all it's all very mitigated risk.
&gt;&gt; Uh there's a lot to be impressed with
here. Like your husband's a firefighter,
you're a stay at home mom. You just had
your fourth child. Like you're limited
on time, limited on resources, but
there's no excuses. Like you're making
it happen. Like you're living the
American dream and you're showing other
people's how to do the same. So, I
applaud you for that.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thank you for this.
I'm I'm absolutely flattered for the
invitation to come here and chat with
you.
&gt;&gt; So cool, Chris. What you what you built
is incredible. And I'm so excited to
talk about this more and kind of use X
as a journal, right? And tell people all
the things what I did right, what I did
wrong, make it easier for the next
person that's going to buy a big old
pallet of books.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I love it. All right. Well, thank
you, Mindy.
&gt;&gt; Thank you. All right, what' you think?

[50:01]
&gt;&gt; Thank you. All right, what' you think?
Please share it with a friend and we'll
see you next time on the Kerner
