if you don't know how to code but still
want to scrape a ton of free customers
for almost $0 you have to know these
four scraping tools built with is
awesome because they have hundreds of
millions of websites and all the owner
contact info and with a couple clicks
you can filter by the Technologies the
website is built with high intent
keywords built with is expensive but
I'll show you how to save 90% on it at
the end this Chrome extension is amazing
because it can scrape these random
one-off websites that aren't generic
like an Amazon or a Google search result
listing outs scraper does a bunch of
different stuff but it is abs absolutely
best with Google Maps listings and
reviews you want to send cold texts or
emails to a bunch of roofing business
owners you can scrape everything in your
city for about $3 to4 my personal
favorite go to either of these websites
and post a job looking for someone that
already has a paid built with account
because built with cost $300 to $500 a
month but you can scrape an unlimited
amount of leads so pay a virtual
assistant $20 to run a scrape for you
