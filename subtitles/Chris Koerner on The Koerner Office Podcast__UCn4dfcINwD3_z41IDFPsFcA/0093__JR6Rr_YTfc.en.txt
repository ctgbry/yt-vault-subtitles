here's a genius Arbitrage opportunity
and I'm begging you to steal it from me
I've done all the research there are 43
cyber trucks listed for rent on turo in
the state of Texas only 15 of them are
available today average daily rental
price 425 bucks average price on
AutoTrader to buy one used 118 Grand
that sounds like a lot you hear me out
2022 Tundras there are 47 in Texas on
turo almost the same amount but 24 of
them are available at only 70 do $72 a
day average rent price and it cost 40
Grand to buy one on auto trader so
what's the conclusion cyber trucks on
turo have 50% more demand fetch six
times the daily rental income and only
cost three times as much that's what
Arbitrage looks like will it last
forever no way but it never does there's
a reason that turo only has a cyber
truck on their homepage
