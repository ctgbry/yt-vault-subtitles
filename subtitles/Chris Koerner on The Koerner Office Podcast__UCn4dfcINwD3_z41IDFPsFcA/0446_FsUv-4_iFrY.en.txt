look at this freaking thing right here
I'm here in lagona Beach California at a
tide pool with my four kids and we love
tide pools but I can't help but think
why isn't anyone building a business
around this I've got two business ideas
for you and I know I know I know what
you're thinking before you say man this
guy just wants to monetize everything
that makes me sick if that's you then
keep scrolling or if you're the guy that
says man this guy just wants to monetize
everything that's my spirit animal then
keep listening because yes that is me
why aren't tide pull tours a thing I
looked it up and there are some
nonprofits that do it which is great
good for them but I think that you could
monetize this in one of two ways number
one give stem tours to kids or to
homeschool families I know that parents
would pay for it especially in these
coastal towns where everyone has a lot
of money number two this could be an
ecotourism attraction yeah we can
explore tide pools as a family for free
and that's cool but I'd pay money to
someone to show me how to find octopuses
yes it is octopus is not octopi how to
find different types of Wildlife and
animals or to explain to me how all this
stuff works you could test the concept
using Facebook or Instagram ads you
could grow using Instagram because look
how much beautiful content there there
is out here to post I made a full
business plan for this right here
