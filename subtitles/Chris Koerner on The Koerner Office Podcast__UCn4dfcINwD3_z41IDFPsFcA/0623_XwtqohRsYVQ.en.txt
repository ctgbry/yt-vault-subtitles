[00:00]
they go out they go and get business
let's say they generate a million dollar
in business the pest control company
these large pest control companies will
pay them $1.3 million they're out there
are whole businesses of guys who just
rent out their licenses there's not a
right or wrong way to do it it's just a
spectrum right they'll go and they'll
sell for the summer and they'll make
like 300 Grand he told me there's guys
who make seven figures doing summer
sales which blows my freaking money in
his first year he made like 100 Grand in
3 months he's like holy crap this is
amazing I think when you teach yourself
things it's more painful the lessons
sink more deeply and you're able to
learn a lot faster in the
[Music]
future we're on an AI kick right now I'm
going to start with a non- aai kick
because I talked to somebody this week
on my podcast economics was freaking an
incredible conversation I had a
conversation with the pest control guy
on Twitter I think you've met him before
I can't remember Corey Casey Casey I
haven't met him in person but I see him
it was close it was close anyways dude
you and I are LDS we're Mormons so we've
grown up around sales Bros solar roofing

[01:01]
grown up around sales Bros solar roofing
Windows Pest Control alarms all of that
right like because because we come back
from our missions and it's like I have a
skill set I have a very particular set
of skills we know how to knock doors and
get rejected and so like you go to these
door to-door and you become doorto door
sales Bros did you ever do summer sales
you act like we haven't been best
friends for 17 years you don't know my
life I'm teeing you up bro no I don't do
these fake questions let's do real
questions okay
I never did Summer sales either but
we've obviously had friends who've done
summer sales and they and they've done
exceptionally well sometimes I have a
lot of friends that didn't do well but
the guys who do exceptionally well that
like do it year after year after year
they'll go and they'll sell for the
summer and they'll make like 300 Grand
something ridiculous so anyways I've
been we've both been infatuated by this
business model but we've also both kind
of stayed away from it because we feel
gross about it am I right is that fair
oh yeah there's a direct correlation
between the how much money a sales guy

[02:01]
between the how much money a sales guy
makes and how slimy he can be yes well I
would say that's my perception well
there are exceptions but I think that
the rule is the more money you make in
sales the kind of more you flirt in the
gray area and there are exceptions that
are very ethical men and women that do
really well at cells they're very
forthcoming and ethical but I think
they're outliers and exceptions
personally interesting you're saying
sales in general so would you say the
stuff that you do is very gry hat it's
just different what do I do I mean
scraping lists of people who didn't opt
in to have their texts notified uh
ringless voicemail drops emails that
aren't publicly available that you
figured out a way to get right like
people would look at that and be like
that's not ethical yeah I think that's
gray hat that's interesting I wouldn't
put those in the same category I don't
know why I feel grosser when it's like a
guy who's at the door hard selling a
single mom you know what I mean yeah no
I definitely agree all else equal the
door-to-door sales guys are the much

[03:00]
door-to-door sales guys are the much
slimier than an average sales guy but
I'm just saying in general like a car
sales guy or a course sales guy like the
more effective they are like they're
persuasive they're convincing they're
tactical and like that just gets in the
gray okay well I went off on a tangent
there I thought that
was for those of you who have done
summer sales we're sorry for offending
you anyways Casey did Summer sales he
worked for this company he did Summer
sales and in his first year he made like
100 Grand in three months he's like holy
crap this is amazing he told me there's
guys who make s figures doing summer
sales which blows my freaking mind I
don't know what they're selling but
they're making a lot of money so he saw
the inside he's saw the economics of
that business and he decided to start
his own pest control company and I want
to tell you the economics of the
business because I don't know if you've
ever I'm sure you have but I don't know
how much you've dived into this it blew
my mind are you ready first first you
asked me if I've done simmer sales then
you asked me if I know anything about
Pest Control when I literally worked
that job for four years selling No Pest
Control yes

[04:00]
Control yes
I asked you if you knew the economics I
didn't ask you if you knew about the
business yes anyway all right so here we
go here we go the average
customer they have them on this like
yearly maintenance program right it's
pretty normal so if I'm a customer and
I'm like oh I have pests I need to have
my house sprayed I don't want spiders
and ants and scary things they can do
some upgrades they'll do rodents they'll
do whatever else but I'm just talking
about strictly pest control every
quarter I want you to guess how much a
customer pays them for that quarterly
Main
it's like 180 134 a quarter okay is what
an average customer pays him all right
so what are they paying them for they're
paying for them they're paying them for
a treatment so the guy goes out sprays
around the house how long do you think
it takes for them to spray around the
house I did this four summers in a row
took me about three to six minutes okay
so Casey told me 20 but well including
drive time like I would think it would
averages out at 20 if you include if
it's because I would I would clock in

[05:01]
it's because I would I would clock in
and I'd get a route for the day you're
doing these 23 homes and so if I were to
take the hours I work divided by 23 it'd
probably shake out to 20 minutes but
most of that is drive time okay did you
do any like he said they do like some
cobweb cleaning they do some like I'm
saying like Light maintenance maybe
something inside did you do the same
thing we would do that just as like a
sign of Goodwill but it wasn't like
strategic or anything okay so you're an
hourly employee making 20 bucks an hour
and I'm going to I'm just going to say
it's 20
minutes all right so about about a
third so it's about $7 in labor and then
four4 is what he estimated for the
chemicals so if you just do the
math 134 gross and your gross margin is
$120 it's like an 88% gross
margin then after that like once a
business is stabilized there's not a ton
of administrative costs these are like
40% net margin
businesses and

[06:00]
businesses and
they can expect 30% year-over-year
growth while still maintaining a 30%
margin net margin so like they're
insanely profitable insanely profitable
and he told me about these companies
that will come in and they'll either buy
a business but but most of the time they
don't buy a business they'll come and
they'll say hey we're going to hire a
sales team we know it's going to
generate X in sales we're willing to pay
you 1.3 times first Year's sales in
order to do that so there're these like
professional sales Crews they're just
like mercenaries they go out they go and
get business let's say they generate a
million dollars in business the pest
control company these large pest control
companies will pay them $1.3 million
they're out and then those customers
stay on for forever because the the
lifetime value of these customers is so
long and they are very sticky I just
have so much to say I'm so glad we're
talking about this oh okay I'm sitting
up in my chair first of all I agree the
lifetime value of these customers can be
very long and in case his case they
probably are because he's doing a good

[07:00]
probably are because he's doing a good
ethical job at selling them what they
actually think that they getting but I I
had a long conversation with Matthew our
friend who does this uh every summer
about the LT of customer go ahead he
does pest control or does did he did he
sells it yeah okay and he said that the
shadiest companies do the most sales and
their LTV is the worst they will have
cancellations out the ying-yang because
they're promising whatever they need to
promise like just outright lying to the
customers just to get them to sign on
the dotted line and then 3 six months
later half have churned but if you do it
right like Casey probably does the LTV
can be amazing the lifetime value oh so
if you go out and just hire these
mercenaries they're like whatever I'll
sign up anybody and everybody because
I'll get 1.3x of whatever I sell in the
first year yeah like they don't care
about the Fulfillment side of things
yeah and a lot of these there's like
three to five Nationwide companies that
sell pest control and some have a good
reputation some have a bad reputation
the bad reputation is don't buy those
contracts like if you're Terminex you

[08:00]
contracts like if you're Terminex you
don't want to buy from XY or Z company
because the multiple stinks because they
churn so fast so it all comes down to
how ethically you sell them at the door
when you say there's five companies in
the country that sell Pest Control are
you talking about the Terminex or are
you talking about those like Hired Guns
I'm talking about like the guys out of
Utah that are building multi-million
dollar businesses they're just building
a book of business door Todo engineered
to sell to a big pest control company
never intending to actually serve with
those contracts yeah and like those guys
are just constantly looking for new
assignments right constantly looking for
new markets that they're opening like
that is just their whole thing they're
just going and they're selling cold here
were a couple other things that I found
really interesting about it Casey was
saying if you're an investor and you
want to get into the space you could
just go and say hey I'm gonna invest a
million dollars and know that that's
essentially going to get you about a
million dollars worth of business but
because it's sticky

[09:00]
because it's sticky
you're essentially spending a million
dollars to get a business that has like
$2 million
of enter receivables yeah yeah yeah not
just receivables but it's like okay I I
built the business I spent a million
dollars I got let's just say a million
dollars a business there's 40% net
margins I'm getting $400,000 a year in
cash flows five times cash flows is a $2
million business right like that's just
generally how they're how they're valued
so I thought that was interesting from
like an Arbitrage standpoint the other
thing I thought was interesting is there
are whole businesses and I didn't
realize this of guys who just rent out
their licenses so in order to spray
these chemicals you have to do it under
somebody who's licensed and in order to
be licensed you have to have done it for
a certain number of years and then pass
certain tests right and then guys who
have done that they don't even do it
anymore they don't they just supervise
it and they sell their license to the
companies that are getting up and
running so a I thought the business
model was super interesting but B I
thought this like idea of finding

[10:01]
thought this like idea of finding
professionals who have specialty
licenses could be a contractor could be
you know Pest Control guys like this in
the Skilled Nursing Facility World they
hang licenses on the wall as well and
then working as a Marketplace or a
middleman to place the license licenses
with license demand now I hate
marketplaces but I thought this would be
a really interesting idea for somebody
who's very ingrained in a specific space
that knows about licenses just working
as the broker between the demand and the
supply side what do you think it's a
great idea and then just take a cut it's
almost like Equity right like I need 10%
equity in your business and you're going
to I'm going to hang my license with you
and the broker could say all right of
that 10% you you have I have 3% or just
give me 30 grand today right and conect
I asked Casey I was like hey how did you
find your guy he's like oh he was a
family friend and we just had some
conversations it was just somebody he
knew somebody right but how many
companies are there who's like they want
to start up and they don't they don't
even know where to find somebody like
this or the other end of the spectrum
guys who have these Liv is maybe they're

[11:00]
guys who have these Liv is maybe they're
not maybe they're an owner of a pest
control company or maybe they're not
doing it anymore and it's like there's
still value there they could be
supervising and getting paid something
for it but they don't know who to go
place it with right like you could be
and I think you could rank for this
pretty easily through either
programmatic SEO mainly programmatic SEO
was my idea or if you wanted to spend a
lot more money you know go to like paid
ads but I think programmatic SEO would
be the place to start and just focus on
those keywords and those specific
markets of like that you know it's going
to rank so the regul to start a pest
control company veryy by state but in
Florida it's so funny because you and I
have talked about this a lot Danny was
my boss in the pest control business it
was called Quantum Pest Control he sold
the Terminex while I was working there
like I was there as they were doing due
diligence they were going through all
the tickets like I cut my small business
teeth in this industry and I just like
smile thinking back on it because I had
no idea at the time how transformative
it would be on my life but I just
remember driving around in this this WRA
truck asking like how do you sell
contracts like what are they paying per
contract how much and I wasn't using

[12:01]
contract how much and I wasn't using
these terms I didn't know these terms
like what was your churn like like what
was the LTV asking all these things in
very ignorant ways and I found these
questions interesting since the day I
was born right but that gave me like a
fertile playground to learn and ask
these questions then in my 20s I
actually got to start doing those things
myself so Danny's partner was named
Glenn and Glenn had no operational role
in the business but he graduated from
the University of Florida an entomology
degree which is like bug sciences and in
Florida at least as I remember you had
to have an entomology degree to launch a
pest control business because I remember
asking Danny like I'm gonna start one of
these when I get out of college he's
like it's not that easy like there's a
lot of barriers to entry yada Y and
that's exactly what you're talking about
with the lure requirements so that's
interesting and then I'm you're talking
about the margin on the actual chemicals
and he said $4 and I bet you anything
it's like way less than that he just he
didn't want it to sound I'm speaking for
him I could be wrong he didn't want

[13:01]
him I could be wrong he didn't want
sound because he's in the industry you
know there's some conflict of interest
but as someone who's not in the industry
this is what I would do this was my job
I was 16 years old I had a an a Chevy
S10 and every morning I would I would go
to Ted's Diner in Orman Beach I would
eat I would have a country fried steak
covered in gravy with two cans of coke
with all the pest control guys and Danny
then we go to the office we'd have our
morning meeting we' talk about all the
tickets for the day and then I would get
like a stack of tickets there's like 10
to 15 of them uh like the carbon copies
and I'd go in the truck and I I had a
physical map like there was no Google
Maps right this is 2000 like summer of
0304 so video is cool but you know
what's better long form audio via
podcast and my newsletter TKO pod.com go
there to subscribe for free to my
newsletter it's one email a week very
tactical and then go to my audio podcast
three episodes a week stuff like this
you're going to love it all free no
sleazy sales TKO pod.com I had

[14:01]
sleazy sales TKO pod.com I had
this physical map and I would drive all
over New smna Beach Daytona Beach Orman
Beach Holly Hill and just service these
accounts and I would roll up and these
guys I had the same amount of tickets as
like the 40 50 60 year old dudes but I
would finish by like 11: am or noon and
then like go home and play NCA football
right I got paid Nick I got paid $5 an
hour $5 an hour to spray yeah below
minimum wage oh my God I was not
licensed I had I was not on the books
$200 a week 40 hours a week and then I
got my meals paid for biggest ripoff
ever but honestly not based on how much
I learned but this is my whole job this
was my job this is it okay you're
talking about all these different bugs
this is Florida more bugs than anywhere
on the planet I had a metal can with
like a a manual pump it was like a one a
one gon can and I had picture like like
a protein powder container a small or

[15:02]
a protein powder container a small or
like a supplement container it was like
that maybe like 16 ounces of powder with
a scoop and I would roll up to a house
open the can go up to the customer's
hose fill it up with water scoop one
scoop per can shake it like this you
know it's really hard to shake and then
I would manually pump it and I would
just go I would just hold the trigger
and walk around the perimeter of the
house once and then leave so tell me how
long it takes to walk around a two ,000
foot house that's it that was the the
job do you ever like think about not
just this instance but any instance
where it's like that powder could have
been nothing yeah it could have been
flour yeah for all you know and you went
and sprayed around the like you could
see a business owner being like oh we
don't need this much the people don't
even know anyways I think they're going
to get their bug sprayed jokes on them
you know what I mean just like trying to
save costs and I remember going to Danny
and I was like after a month or two I
was like
Danny is this is this all I'm doing did

[16:01]
Danny is this is this all I'm doing did
you give me like the easy job or is this
what everyone's doing like we're just
talking like you think that like I have
a whole toolbox full of different
powders I'm like oh you're seeing you're
seeing banana spiders I'm going to use
this like a whole recipe and it's like I
had one ingredient and a can of water
and I remember asking he's like yeah
that's it and I went to my co-workers
and I was like is this really is this
the whole shtick and one of my
co-workers he was like listen man Pest
Control is a scam okay I'm just gonna
say it it's a scam like this is just a
scam this thing that we're spraying you
can buy a Home Depot anyone can buy it
at Home Depot I never forgot that
sentence Pest Control is a scam and
that's like from the quote inside and so
I tweeted about this like six months ago
Pest Control is a spam scam go bu
Spectra side for $99.97 at Home Depot
spray your house once a year and you're
good and like Casey got super triggered
by that he quote tweeted me all these
reasons why I'm wrong and ignorant and
insurance and all this but like 95% of

[17:02]
insurance and all this but like 95% of
the comments and there were hundreds of
comments were like yeah it's a scam this
is exactly what I do I haven't seen a
bug in years so it's like they're
outliers there's like well in this area
and that area sure they're outliers but
by and large that's all I do and it
works maybe this is a framework as well
many businesses are a scam if you're
looking at scams with this framework I I
agree it's not actually scam but right
right but like the point I'm making I I
go to McDonald's well you could just
make your own food at home that's true
or I mean this is more of a scam the
water filtration systems in your house
where it's like oh here let me test your
water oh yeah you got arsenic oh my gosh
you have cancer right now oh wow it
right now yeah right now you just got it
here take a sip of your water real quick
yep now you have cancer how many
businesses are there that are quote
unquote scams Bas but like basically
we're assigning scam to something that
is a convenience business where you

[18:00]
is a convenience business where you
could do it yourself but you decide to
pay for somebody else to do it like P
control you could do it yourself but you
pay for somebody else to do it once a
year because of the framing well are you
licensed oh wow do you even know what
kind of bugs are around here yeah oh
you're buying peace of mind you're
buying a third party support an quote
expert exactly so in a in a strange way
I think that's an interesting framework
to look at and think what kind of
businesses are there that are
convenience businesses cuz those can get
probably spun up pretty quickly make
some really good money I dude I talked
to a lady yesterday Christmas lighting
mhm she started it she was a hustler
year one she starts it in August
November 30th they had $150,000 in the
bank it's crazy and she ran this
business for 13 years it became an eight
fig business and she ended up selling it
and like it did exceptionally well even
when it got to scale it was doing like
30 40% net margins that's a convenience
business right and she focused on where
the convenience demand would be the
strongest she went to like very wealthy

[19:01]
strongest she went to like very wealthy
areas she was like yep I went to the
best neighborhoods I Liv at the best
houses I literally parked my van in
those neighborhoods it was in San
Francisco parked my van in those
neighborhoods it was free advertising I
placed flyers on every single door and
guess what when Mary Jane down the
street started getting her lights up and
her neighbor comes out and it's like
Mark Mary Jane's putting up her lights I
think we should put up our lights
retention was 85% she's like the
business just grew every single year and
it was high margin but it's a business
that is not maintenance what's the word
a nice to have right like like we're
talking about with P control it's a
vitamin not a painkiller oh is that a
framework I've never heard that before
but like yeah the word scam gets clicks
right like that it's salacious but like
it it's not literally a scam like I
would I would hire a pest control guy to
come get a raccoon out of my attic right
I wouldn't pay him 15 bucks a quarter to
do something I can do almost for free
like I feel like that maintenance is
like the high margin an upsell for

[20:00]
like the high margin an upsell for
having to do the crappy stuff of like
come get the snake out of my house
you're like okay I'll do that at Cost
but I'm I'm charging you an arm and a
leg Yeah because I hate
snakes here's a you I mean you mentioned
Christmas lights I got a little side
hustle idea for anyone out there you
ready for this okay okay you heard of
jellyfish
lighting nope jellyfish is a I don't
know eight or nine figure brand and it's
a franchise and they sell permanent
lighting through franchises that own
territories across the US permanent
lighting of of permanent yeah they're
per it's like per it's not permanent
Christmas lights because you can use
them year round but it's an alternative
to Christmas lights that stay up year
round that are LED that you can control
with your phone you can change colors
they can do patterns you know on St
Patrick's Day you make them green
Valentine's Day you make them red it's
growing in popularity and it's
interesting like $1500 to $3,000 to get
them installed but you never take it
down so really it's an it's an
investment in your future
because you true you're just adding

[21:01]
because you true you're just adding
$3,000 in value to the house well that
and you don't have to pay $400 to the
Christmas light guys every year so after
five years you break even right this is
good point a deal no but seriously like
anyone listening to this jellyfish is
going to hate me for saying this but you
can find the equivalent of this on alib
Baba and AliExpress of this permanent
lighting it's probably low hundreds of
dollars you buy by the foot couple
couple bucks a foot as soon as November
hits you you go door too only to the
houses that already have Christmas
lights and you say hey beautiful
Christmas lights how about I take them
down for free and you can return them to
whoever maybe they're yours put them in
the Attic whatever and I'm going to
install permanent Christmas lights XY
orz price you can install an app on your
phone to control them leave them up year
round and you'll never have to pay $500
every Christmas ever again that's a
pretty cool sales channel it's great
because you're fishing where the fish
are you know that those people value
Lighting on their homes they're probably
going to 85% chance as you said Nick

[22:00]
going to 85% chance as you said Nick
that they're going to do it again next
year especially when you've hired a
company because many times those
Christmas tree Christmas I keep saying
Christmas tree the Christmas lighting
companies they do install some Hardware
on your house so that when they come the
next year it's just way easier right
like they're not just hanging the lights
and then taking everything down they're
they're putting in some type of an INF I
don't even know what what I would call
it but some type of infrastructure I
mean I have Christmas slides every year
and they they we plug them into that we
just freaking plug them in there's
nothing special there's nothing up top
that just makes it easier for them to
lay no they just clip them in they could
be different both of my brother-in-laws
have it and that was like the thing is
like year one they come out and it costs
more because there's the setup fee which
in the first year I guess is expensive
because they've got to put all of that
stuff in and then each year it's it's
cheaper because they don't have to do
the setup it's just pretty plug andplay
it makes sense for the tree the tree
freaking a it makes sense for the
lighting company because it it's way
quicker every single year for them to
put down the same lighting along the

[23:00]
put down the same lighting along the
tracks that they've already laid that
could be one model but how they do it
here is it's more expensive the first
year just you say because you're buying
the lights but then they store the
lights they keep them every year so you
pay for the lights up front once and
then you know let's say the first year
is $700 every year after that will be
350 because you've already bought the
lights you're just paying for the labor
but there's nothing like there's nothing
different being done every year no
Foundation being laid anyways the point
I was making with that is I was so her
name is an McGinty and she reminded me
of you a lot in this sense they had the
idea in July they launched it in August
and by November 30th they had $150,000
in their bank because they'd done the
work right she just did it she just went
out and was like yep I'll figure it out
and they you know they wrapped their car
they bought some equipment they they did
pay for a course so they took a course
and they figured out how to do it yada
yada so that's like one end of the
spectrum of Entrepreneurship those are
just just like the hey make hey while

[24:00]
just just like the hey make hey while
the sun shines and then there's like the
other end which would be probably a
little bit more me which is well I'm
sure there's a franchise that does it I
don't want to reinvent the wheel how do
they do it oh maybe I could go sign up
oh jellyfish exists cool I'll go see
what they're doing and I'll buy a
territory from them but it's like if
it's July me Nick I'm not going to have
that Christmas lighting business up
until December of the following year
whereas Chris you're going to have it up
by December of this year but you're Al
going to have to go through all the
headaches you're going to have to like
yep I'm going to have to go to L to
figure it out I'm like it's probably not
going to look as good for the first
couple of customers Etc but like you
just you got in and you and you got it
done I just think it's interesting how
there's this broad spectrum of
entrepreneurs within entrepreneurship
right like we're just not we're not all
the same I just talked about the same
principal on my podcast two days ago
with a guy that owns a pressure washing
business and he started doing Christmas
lights but it took him five years to go
from pressure washing to his second
service which was window washing five
years like I'm only doing and he said no
to every you know everyone was like can
you do landscaping nope nope nope and

[25:01]
you do landscaping nope nope nope and
then he did window washing and then two
years later he did Christmas lights but
he did what this lady did an he took a
course and he actually learned how to do
it and we had this conversation I was
like I wouldn't even pay for a course I
would just freaking go by a ladder and
start hanging those things and it would
look like crap and there's no there's
not a right or wrong way to do it it's
just a spectrum right right so he pays
for a course and I pay for refunding my
first few customers because it looked
terrible that's an interesting way to
think about it yeah I'll just refund my
customers instead of paying for the
course this is just an interesting
question do you not think courses help
you skip the line I'm sure they could
I'm just cheap sometimes to my
detriment H interesting has that changed
over the years at
all can't teach old dog new tricks tiger
don't change his stripes
Nick are you any more likely today to
buy a course than you
were 10 years ago no that's interesting
I am I'm way more likely today to buy a
course than I was 10 years ago like I
would have never bought a course I think
when you teach yourself things it's more

[26:01]
when you teach yourself things it's more
painful even though it's more affordable
it's more painful but the lessons sink
more deeply and you're able to learn a
lot faster in the future that's my
hindsight bias it could be differing
perspectives as well because like I did
a hospice from scratch and you like you
screw up the lure within a hospice MH
literally a a t not Crosser an ey
straight to
jail well you can go to jail that is
very true you can go to jail but you
have to prove int
but even if you don't have intent and
you just mess up you could be billing
for a year and then they come back to
you and they're like oh all that money
you bu for you have to pay it back it's
like well I took care of these patients
well it doesn't matter you actually
missed this on the form and so because
of that you got to pay all this money
back yeah so I think just having that
experience with home health and a
hospice in particular has probably made
me more concerned with getting started
and making sure I'm not missing anything
I'm not at a knowledge deficit just
because the risks were so high if you
missed anything right whereas the stuff
you started up it's like they're

[27:00]
you started up it's like they're
asymmetric bats yeah I can remember a
couple times where moves move fast and
break things hurt it was a little
painful what when not even in business
when I was on my mission in Hungary for
our church I was serving in chopon in
Western
hung and I you know as missionary
sometimes we get asked to do things like
in our local congregation in addition to
being a missionary and I was the clerk I
was in charge of the money okay and so
we hosted a smoothie bully and Bully is
Hungarian for
party and we used church funds to do
that which would be fine if they were
not tithing funds and they were tithing
funds so we didn't know we didn't know I
didn't know any better and so we threw
the Smoothie party they had never had
smoothies before they loved it smashing
hit and then I had an audit with other
Valentine and he's a very kind man and

[28:00]
Valentine and he's a very kind man and
he was looking at the books and he's
like smoothie
bully ker what is that and I was like oh
it was a party we had we had a party it
was so fun he's like you use sacred
tithing funds for that other ker that is
very bad that is very very bad so never
been a clerk since you're like I know
buas for Action what do you want me to
say move fast and break things move fast
and get break I'm good right what's the
problem is my name still in the Book of
Life am I still I'm not oh huh whatever
he'll get it all right what you think
please share it with a friend and we'll
see you next time on the ker office
