look at this freaking thing right here
I'm here in Pigeon Forge Tennessee and
this Trump store makes way more money
than you'd ever believe even though the
elections already happened I'm about to
go in pick the owner's brain find out
how much money they pay to Trump to
operate this store what are their most
profitable items what's their daily
volume let's go on in together I was
able to do a deep dive via perplexity
and find old articles about this store
when they've been interviewed by
reporters and when reporters have camped
out interestingly enough these Trump
stores operate in a legal gray area by
selling unofficial Trump merchandise so
they are not required to pay any
licensing or royalty fees to Donald
Trump but supposedly they say they
donate a small percentage of their sales
to his campaign the average ticket size
seems to be about $64 for the store they
can do between 5 and $15,000 a day in
Topline Revenue ironically their items
seem to mostly be imported from China
what are your big sellers everything is
there a hat or like a t-shirt that
stands out the most no all of them knows
appar what do you like and the manager
did say that the white privilege card is

did say that the white privilege card is
one of their best sellers and at $10 the
net profit margins on that thing have to
be at least 95% shirts and hats are all
between $30 and $35 socks were $15 a
pair stickers were $5 and while we were
there we probably saw about 20 customers
come in and out now this is not a
political statement I'm about as
moderate as you can get but as a devout
capitalist I love everything about deep
diving on these stores
