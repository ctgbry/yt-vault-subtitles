trust I'll tell you how one of them
talks about things you could do in
generalities oh you could do this click
on this you could do this you could do

the fakers even put out good content but
the good guys put out good content too
but that's how you can tell they're

doing and what they've actually done not
just about what other successful people
are doing or how to do things based on
what they read in one of the good guys
