if you want to find out how much an RV
park is worth and how you can find cheap
RV parks I'll teach you in 52 seconds
how much is an RV park worth find out
what the net operating income or the
profit is of the park and divide it by
the asking price so if the profit is
hundred grand and they're asking a
million dollars that's a 10% cap rate
and that's too expensive in my opinion
you want a 12% cap rate or or more so if
it does a 100,000 in profit you don't
want to pay any more than 800 Grand okay
how to find parks that are off market

good deals I buy Parks every month with
