[00:00]
and this is going to take half a day and
then you're going to all this data and
then you will literally know more about
the pack and ship industry in Columbus
Ohio than anyone on the earth over the
course of a half a day which is nerdy
but
cool this is exactly what I did when I
opened my iPhone repair store 15 years
ago the principles still apply and then
we opened three more and we did the same
thing and all of them were successful
and we sold the
[Music]
business welcome to the ker office so we
have a quite a few new people joining us
so I wanted to break down the release
schedule of these episodes because I
really have three different types of
episodes the one you're about to hear
today is the Q&A call-in live show
episode and those will only be released
on Mondays I also have the hold cob Bros
style episode where me and my business
partner Nick just talk about business
ideas those will come out on either
Wednesday or Thursday and then I
interview cool entrepreneurs that have
really cool interesting businesses and
those are released on either Wednesday
Thursday or Friday so I either do two a
week or through a week either uh Monday

[01:00]
week or through a week either uh Monday
and Thursday or rather Monday Wednesday
Friday so please enjoy today we did five
segments with callers all kind of
shorter I think you'll like it the first
one wants to open a pack and ship store
so I taught him how to see the
competitive landcape of his area and I
also advised him on that business model
in general next guy has a local
newsletter in Winnipeg Canada that is
growing like crazy and I gra I gave him
a couple growth hack ideas and I love
the local newsletter business I love it
by the way anyone in the world can start
a local newsletter business so we talk
about the promise I see in that the
third segment is uh an insurance
software business and they want to build
Connections in the insurance industry
and they don't know how the fourth
person has a web design business and he
wants to Pivot to a zapier automation
business because in the web design
business you only make two grand per
website in the zapier automation
business you make two grand every month
and really anyone can learn zapier in a
few hours the last person is retiring
from the Navy and moving to Japan and he

[02:01]
from the Navy and moving to Japan and he
wants to consult people on taxes
specifically he wants to consult
Americans moving to Japan or Singapore
on their taxes very Niche very unique
and so I walked him through how to find
customers there anyway enjoy and then we
will see you later this week Michael how
we doing good how are you good it is
good to talk to you let me pull up my
notes
so yeah why don't you ask me your
question I've got something here but I
let's hear it from the horses M so to
speak yeah no problem I was just uh
wondering how do people evaluate whether
whatever the business is if that
opportunity is saturated in a particular
area or if there's opportunity like
whether it be I don't know an ice cream
store or a independent pack and ship
store you know like how do you find out
whether there's an opportunity in a
given area great question so are you
able to say what you're looking to do so
my advice can be more specific that
independent pack and ship store is what

[03:01]
independent pack and ship store is what
I had in mind but yeah I've sorted
through different business ideas and for
a while I was searching for land for
self- storage facilities and I know
there was like a tool that those kind of
people use to find something like
thish yeah they have a lot of tools out
there so what about the pack and ship
business model do you love I like that
it's uh relatively cheap to start for
me50 $660,000 I think gets the job done
rather easy to scale out of it is my
understanding yeah and where are you
located
Indianapolis okay what type of market
research have you done already and is
that where you feel like you have to or
want to open or are you flexible to
moving I'm open to moving basically I
just tried to look myself where do these
stores currently exist and get a feel
for how many of them there are and I
mean maybe I could take that and compare
it to different areas but yeah it's just

[04:00]
it to different areas but yeah it's just
anecdotal experience at this point I
would say what first gave you the idea
to to start and you're looking to start
a pack and ship store not not buy one
right yeah correct I mean possibly
looking for either but yeah I guess I've
just been interested in starting a
business and I'm not sure how I know a
little bit about your background how you
became interested in the cleaning but
kind of these things just seem to be
populating all my Twitter feed honestly
cleaning remote cleaning business pack
and ship store all right so I'll tell
you how you can find out if it's
saturated or not and then I'll tell you
something else so if I were you I would
go to use
outcraze in the US too so I'm asking
Chad GPT what cities in the US are
comparable in like average income
population

[05:00]
population
um Etc to Indianapolis so Columbus Ohio
very similar population similar size
similar cultures obviously their
neighboring states so let's do this so I
would go to Columbus Ohio and I would go
to use outc scraper.com and I would go
to their Google Maps scraping feature
and for Columbus and all of the outlying
suburbs because the way it works is it's
by City and so if you just typee in
Columbus then you're only going to get
pack and ship stores in Columbus proper
but you want to know like the Greater
Columbus area because you want to know
about the creater Indianapolis area and
so I would run a CRP it'll just it'll
cost 10 bucks take an hour and then
you're going to get a spreadsheet of
stores I would remove all of the results
that are not relevant right you're going
to get a FedEx store NH that's not a
competitor you're going to get you know
Staples or whatever take all those out

[06:00]
Staples or whatever take all those out
and just look for independent pack and
ship stores okay then you want to find
the ZIP code that there in and then go
to Google and get a list and I've done
this before of populations by ZIP code
and you want to place those populations
next to the ZIP codes in your
spreadsheet so then you can say all
right how many stores per person per zip
code and then you want to find a
Baseline and then you got to take it a
step further because you're if you're
going to spend 50 or $60,000 you really
really got to do your research so this
is like phase four and then you go in
and you say all right okay now I know
which zip codes have the most stores per
capita not just the most stores but per
capita and then you want to know the
demographics of those zip codes so then
there's like a website that's like
usstate data or citystate dat.com you
want to know which zip codes have what
their crime levels are what their
average incomes are what their uh
population density is all of these

[07:00]
population density is all of these
attributes uh bunch of columns in the
same spreadsheets uh and try to figure
it out okay try to figure out like what
a good Baseline is for a sister city to
Indianapolis and then you're going to
take it a step further then you're going
to say okay based on this data it looks
like these three ZIP codes in Columbus
are undersaturated for pack and ship
stores so then you're going to get them
on the phone all of them and you're
going to say you're going to pretend
like you're a customer and say hey like
I'm looking for a mailbox or y y yada
try to ask questions and use chat GPT to
help generate more questions try to ask
questions that give you a feel for their
volume and be as bold as you want
because who cares if you're going to
offend some guy why you being a nosy
about my business who cares you're never
going to talk to them again they're a
stayed away and so just start brewing
down with them and you have any
mailboxes what are your hours what are
your costs get a bunch of data and get
all that data on as many stores as you
can

[08:00]
can
so now you're going to see all right hm
zip codes with high crime are actually
more busy or zip codes with high crime
are less busy or zip codes with a higher
population density are more busy which
makes sense and try to find holes in
that market holes being where you might
be able to open a store in Columbus if
you were to want to that would be the
most likely to be successful and then
like phase six or seven you're going to
go read their reviews okay you're going
to go to the web archive
and you're going to go to who is.com
you're going to type in the URLs of
these stores how many of them have
websites look at the reviews when was
the first review how many years ago was
it so how New or Old were these stores
and this is going to take half a day and
then you're going to all this data and
then you will literally know more about
the pack and ship industry in Columbus
Ohio than anyone on the earth over the
course of a half a day which is nerdy
but
cool this is exactly what I did when I
opened my iPhone repair store 15 years
ago the prin principles still apply and

[09:01]
ago the prin principles still apply and
then we opened three more and we did the
same thing and all of them were
successful and we sold the business so
then you're going to take that data and
you have to make the assumption that
same data is going to be true for a city
just a few hours away in a very
comparable State and then you're going
to do all the same research and then
you're going to find you're going to
know by this point what the Baseline is
okay in other words 50,000 people in a
1hour radius that make an average of
$40,000 a year that has a crime rate of
4% or whatever it is you're going to
know with 70 80% certainty that a store
in that area will be successful and then
you start looking for real estate in
that area and when you're negotiating a
lease you want to be sure that you have
a short-term lease with an option to
extend because if this thing doesn't
work out you're going to know within a
year and you want to be able to pull the
plug in a year without being on the hook
for a four more year of a

[10:00]
for a four more year of a
lease awesome that's fantastic advice
thank you yeah is that kind of what you
were looking for yeah absolutely I guess
just any other thoughts on the general
pack and ship store you might have I'd
be of course open to well I I know a bit
about that industry because I've been in
the logistics industry I don't really
like that business that much just
because of the opportunity cost of your
time and money I don't like retail
businesses cuz I'm an introvert and I
don't like dealing with customers Maybe
the opposite I don't like like I it's so
maybe I'm saying this because all I do
for a living is look at opportunities
and business ideas and so I'm pretty
picky right but most people don't right
they don't their their brain isn't sick
and hardwired in the wrong way like mine
is so most people get a few ideas and
they gravitate to one and that's great
but I if I had 50 or 60,000 to work with
I would rather start a service business
that doesn't have any overhead a gutter
cleaning business landscaping business a

[11:00]
cleaning business landscaping business a
tree triming business I'm recommending
what I know it doesn't mean it's the the
right option for you that's just that's
a lot of money you could buy a small
franchise for
$50,000 so I also recommend that you go
to entrepreneur.com start reading on all
the franchises out there and see if you
can find a lowcost franchise that's
growing like crazy that has really good
unit economics really good numbers that
is not in your area yet and start
looking seriously into
that awesome well thank you so much
you're welcome yeah let me know how it
goes I'm excited for you either way will
this be uh available to view anywhere
yep it'll be on YouTube and my podcast
awesome thank you so much yep thanks
Michael see you
bye hey man yeah I mean super nice to
meet you officially I know we've chatted
a little bit on Twitter yeah and so it's
been super nice following you and of now
also write a little bit of content on
Twitter so my main question today is

[12:01]
Twitter so my main question today is
base around my local newsletter that I'm
trying to build here in Winnipeg before
that I'll give a little bit of like
quick context just so you have some
background I'm 23 right now I graduated
with like architecture degree decided
not to follow it currently I my main
thing is I am the operations guy for
offshore hiring company okay where I'm
trying to grow that that's my main thing
but have started this newsletter on the
side um not sure if you know who Ryan
Seldon is he's also on Twitter but he oh
yeah he's been on my show yeah so he's
he also grew a local local newsletter as
well naptown CP yeah exactly so kind of
following his footsteps I started this
thing in like a Canadian city it's
called Winnipeg not sure if you know
where that is but it's right above it's
right above Minnesota here so started
that and I started that probably about
three-ish months ago and what got like a

[13:03]
three-ish months ago and what got like a
few subscribers like 150 from Reddit
just got down the format and how it was
doing and then started when he paid ads
to it I would say May 22nd as that's the
main source of acquisition for most of
these newsletters how much are you
spending per subscriber yeah so
currently I'm spending about a do25
Canadian um that's good that's really
good yeah which is well below what most
app position to happen at but the reason
for that is there's a unique opportunity
in Winnipeg I would say where it's a big
city in terms of population so it has
like a population of 800,000 people
900,000 people or something like that so
it's a big city but the thing is that
it's not a tech forward City so it's not
like Calgary or Vancouver or something
where people know about like how to run
newsletters and marketing and everything
it's still I would say are fairly run on

[14:00]
it's still I would say are fairly run on
Old like old Tech in a sense right like
there's not that many people that know
about things that are going on so it's
pretty easily if I were to let's say
even just replicate things from Twitter
onto what's happening on in Winnipeg
like it's there's a lot of Arbitrage
opportunities I guess you can say so I
started this newsletter because I saw
that there were similar newsletters in
like Calgary Ottawa and other Canadian
cities but there wasn't one in Winnipeg
so I've grown that to about in a month
of running ads to now having 500
subscribers and then also so I send it
out three times a week right now and in
terms of Instagram followers we started
Instagram account on
June 1 and what's the name of the
newsletter it's called Winnipeg digest
okay anyway sorry Instagram page grew to
what it's to at 8K now so 8K in a month
oh wow in a month wow yeah so well I
have a little bit of background growing
Instagram pages and stuff like that too

[15:01]
Instagram pages and stuff like that too
so that's played to my advantage I would
say but we're right now posting like a
real a day just talking about events and
stuff that are going on around the city
yeah so I've grown that to 8K and now
the not the struggle I would say but the
thing that I would like help with is how
do I go about monetizing this thing
should I even monetize this in the
beginning in terms of what I'm doing for
it right now I have had like I would say
four or five
sponsors okay I've talked to other local
newsletter people and they've said hey
building an Instagram audience gives you
like local Authority so then you can
talk to businesses and they'll take you
a lot more seriously first is that
second is you want to sell this as like
a package deal rather than selling it a
cpms because most local businesses don't
know what a CPM is yep so that's General
feedback that I've gotten for now I have
had a few sponsors right now going about
the way of like hey first three sponsors
get like 80% off next three sponsor 60%

[16:00]
get like 80% off next three sponsor 60%
off than 40 until we're at full pricing
yeah that's generally the L okay so
you'd rather know how to get more
sponsors or how to grow faster or both I
think growing faster generally is like
for at least from what I understand is
like Facebook ads for now is like going
to be the main bread and butter with the
second thing being like referrals so
I've started now incorporating not lead
magnets I guess you can say lead magnets
where okay you refer two people you'll
get like the top 150 restaurants in
Winnipeg or something like that so I
started doing that and that started
generating like a referral system slowly
and more I'm getting very good
engagement I'm getting folks saying this
is amazing you know there wasn't a place
like this it's kind of the first time
that we're able to see what's actually
happening before the event is H going to
happen and so on and so forth so that's
been like super good engagement and
everything now the main struggle is like
how do I go monetizing this yeah and can

[17:02]
how do I go monetizing this yeah and can
I monetize this at such a small scale or
do I have to hit like 10K subs or
something in a 800,000 City to then be
able to monetize it what have you
charged your three sponsors so far so
I've been going at a CPM of $100 so
right now my my my open rate is about 53
is%
54% um so I've gone see click rate is if
I focus on it in an email then like I
can take it to about 12% if I don't want
to focus on it then I can keep it at
like 4% as well yeah like it's really
depended on how much do I want to keep
the reader on my email versus how if I
want to drive up the rate and then in
terms of Engagement we also have a poll
at the end of each kind of uh email just
to see how if they liked it didn't like
it um and usually the engagement on that
is like let's say 1,500 people open the
email around 50 to 55 people will answer
that poll at the end that's pretty good

[18:02]
that poll at the end that's pretty good
yeah yeah because I mean I use beehive
you're using beehive I have a poll I
have an open rate that's a good that's a
really good poll rate I don't know what
they call it a poll percentage so I just
got a unique idea that could be
brilliant could be stupid have you
thought about approaching so first of
all I love the Lo local news better
newsletter business idea I've thought
about doing it myself I almost did it a
couple years ago have you reverse
engineered uh the capital daily Andrew
WI and Victoria in terms of what so I've
reverse engineered like a few
newsletters in terms of like format and
what they do and even like in terms of
Instagram content I follow like Boston
New York pages and so on and like we do
my spin on those versions of content in
terms of longer Vision as well the goal
here for me is like I don't know if I'm
going to do ads for the next two years
or three years or whatever it is but
then eventually I would like to spin off
other businesses from this as I
local buil audience yeah you know seeing

[19:03]
local buil audience yeah you know seeing
potentially what ads do the best for me
and then going off based off of that I
can just spin those businesses up myself
or partner with them yeah okay first of
all I would go back to Capital daily
because they're literally doing exactly
what you're doing and it's the same
country I would go look at like their
first 20 newsletters not just any 20 but
their first and you already have the
format down so don't worry about that I
would look at like when they added their
first sponsor spor and what that sponsor
was was it a bakery was it a SAS
business and I would just take notes of
all that and say like okay whatever
Andrew Wilkinson's doing I'm gonna copy
because he's a pretty smart guy so I
would just kind of look to that as
inspiration another thing I would do
that kind of just came to me is you can
knock out two birds with one stone if
you approach local businesses in
Winnipeg and say hey you've got what I
need I've got what you need what do I
have I have an audience of 3,400 people
plus 8,000 on Instagram and that's only

[20:00]
plus 8,000 on Instagram and that's only
over 28 days who knows where we'll be in
the next you know 28 months I want to
advertise your auto repair shop I want
to write about it in my newsletter and
these guys are I know my demographic is
high income their white collar yada yada
yada like they're highly engaged they're
involved in their Community it is the
type of audience that you want and that
you need so I want to talk about your
auto repair shop in my newsletter what
do you have you have an email list of
23,000 people of your customers what if
we do this what if I like I advertise my
newsletter to your email list or you
share your email list with me share in
quotations as in give it to me and then
I give you a highly discounted
sponsorship or free or think about what
like if they had an email list of 20,000
that's worth $20,000 to you that's 10
times more than what you would get from
them as a sponsor so you could give them
a free sponsorship placement they don't
care like they don't care about these
emails they probably
hardly ever use the email list and you

[21:01]
hardly ever use the email list and you
can send them one email up front and
just like you could do it one of two
ways you can do it one way which I don't
recommend where you just like work them
into beehive and now beehive has import
limits you'll have to get around but
work them into beehive and just start
emailing them as if nothing happened I
don't recommend that because you're
unsubscribed and your bounce rate is
going to go wayi first of all no matter
what you do run them through an email
Checker because a lot of those emails
are probably old and dormant and you
want them to be I would run them through
three email check I use bulk email
Checker there's hundreds out there run
them through three or four of them and
only accept the cleanest greenest ones
that have no DNS issues or they're not
like catch all emails and I would either
give them a free sponsorship or a
discounted sponsorship and just say I
want to just add them to my email list
so sorry I didn't get to the second
option what I recommend doing is
emailing all of them once and say Hey
you know this is who we are yada yada
I'm partnered with owner of auto repair

[22:01]
I'm partnered with owner of auto repair
shop I'm just going to start sending you
the local news if you don't want it go
ahead and unsubscribe right here and
then work them into your
flow so just for reference here actually
so what we've started doing is another
version of that so there's a shop called
for example the locals they put on like
a huge like 300 people local vendor
event type of thing and they have a
email list of like 10,000 people we're
doing something similar with them but
the the way we're doing it with these
folks is like they're just going to send
out an email after the event saying hey
if you're looking for local news like go
subscribe to this or something like that
for in return obviously like us giving
them a free sponsorship and making like
a reel for them or something I'm also
doing that with another concert host
person who has a bunch of these like
past people emails right so people that
have bought tickets in the past or
whatever and he's basically saying that
he has about 16,000 people as well and
he reached out to me saying hey I would

[23:01]
he reached out to me saying hey I would
love to work together in some way now I
don't know how much I don't know if I
want to Target that demographic or not
right because it's because right now the
email is more focused on like
familyfriendly events and so on and so
forth in compar to like his email list
is more like people that like to go to
Raves and all that stuff so but yeah so
we have been trying to dable in dabble
in that world and I think we're trying
to go more more that rout
yeah I would just not even like I would
look at any literally any business in
Winnipeg as a potential referral partner
with their email list because everyone
has an email list most people don't
utilize it like they should and if they
could trade something that they forgot
about for something worth actual dollars
that could bring them more business it's
a no-brainer killer offer for them and
so it's like you a Marketplace issue
you've got you need to sell ads but you
need to grow subscribers I would focus
more on growing subscribers because
that's going to make selling ads even

[24:00]
that's going to make selling ads even
easier and I I like the idea of of you
know sharing emails with other local
businesses noted yeah I think we'll
definitely start going more in that
route and then what would you say is
like a good number in like I don't know
if it's a specific number if it's like a
feeling that we'll have but what's like
a good number to like okay now we're
established enough to like okay we don't
need to do discounts and all that but we
can we have a big enough email list that
we can actually start now focusing on
sponsors so what do you think would be a
good number even right now with 3500
folks right what I'm scared of is me not
being able to deliver a return on
investment for that Advertiser right
first is that and second is like I would
obviously like to build a longer term
relationship with these folks and trying
to like I don't want to chase the short
dollars if I can't deliver on the
results just yet right and with such a

[25:01]
results just yet right and with such a
small email list of like let's say 3500
people right now my pitch has been the
same or like hey we have this many
people let's say a dentist you have such
a big you have such a big like value
that even if we bring one client to you
that you by just spending let's say $200
with us and we can even get you one
client that's a huge return on
investment for you right so that's
generally been what my payche has yeah
so one last thought and then I'm like
almost out of time that I'm glad you
said that because that led me to
thinking this that's one reason why I
think you should reverse engineer the
capital daily because you're going to
see what types of customers that they
accepted as sponsors and then you can
see over time like maybe you see for the
first three months they only did
restaurants and then two years later
they're only doing dental offices and
that's probably because they learned
that dental offices have a high Roi
because you made a great point and that
like you've got to sell this to people
where it actually works if people don't

[26:01]
where it actually works if people don't
click and if they don't buy then it's
not going to work and you're going to
have beat your head against the wall so
I think you should find the type of
customers that the capital daily is
finding and I think you should
experiment and find the right balance
between either a customer that just
wants brand exposure that doesn't care
about tracking and they exist right like
a Coca-Cola billboard how do you know if
that works you want to find customers
like that and then you want to find
customers that have the right mix of
high ticket and high volume and sold
$100,000 sports car that's probably way
too high ticket it's like if you only
sell one then it pays for well you're
probably not going to even sell one
whereas a dental office might be a great
mix where they could sell two and it
only cost them $200 and that brings them
$8,000 in Revenue so you've just got to
find that right mix because if you're
trying to sell appetizers for a
restaurant then they might sell $100
worth of appetizers for a $300 ad
placement and it's too cheap right makes
sense makes sense I would experiment
with yeah I would experiment I would
take like a list make a list of 10

[27:00]
take like a list make a list of 10
different types of industries that fit
that mold and just try all 10 of them
honestly and just test it and just keep
the data yep yep
track all right thanks man good luck by
thank
you all right
Rome I'm Rome I'm a Sofer engineer I
work in financial services graduated two
years ago got my CFA done but now I'm
thinking of more of trying to start my
own business with my friend I started
watching your content about a few months
ago and I learned a lot about just
thinking about business case studies
really marketing classes really about
how you think about marketing it was
amazing to and now we have settled on
this idea to with my friend who is who
works in insurance and I am a software
engineer and we trying to start a
business as co-founders as it which is
the idea is basically an underwriting AI
co-pilot for insurers so basically it
allows them to do two things in the

[28:01]
allows them to do two things in the
commercial and Specialty Insurance it
allows them to write more insurance with
the same amount of Workforce because AI
does a lot of work for you and the
second thing it Alles them to do is
better due diligence using your manuals
and guidelines better and being able to
do you would upload all that beforehand
uh exactly so the basically the when the
broker sends you all the information you
feed it in and the AI does the work to
present it present the information in a
good way to you to help with some of the
due diligence also look up online use
your manual and all these things take
all the information and put it to you in
a presentable way and it really speeds
up the operation of doing the due
diligence and being able to find things
that you wouldn't even have thought
about questions you wouldn't even have
thought about using AI so that's the
idea we're trying to go for now we are
basically to broke people who work
fulltime and we trying to that's good
you have a PhD you're poor hungry driven
yeah yeah yeah so I am working on

[29:02]
yeah yeah yeah so I am working on
building the MVP as a software engineer
he's helping me with the technical
specifications in networking and
thinking about how we go about our plan
investors and our current plan is that
we want to build the MVP for this
particular Niche because there's a lot
of competitors out there but there's a
lot of fragmentation too in the industry
because AI is so new that there isn't
like a perfect solution that everyone
uses that is standard across the
industry as an under writing workbench
as we call it or an underwriting AI
co-pilot and they are all mammoths with
like 15 million $30 million in funding
SAS companies and and like literally MIT
phds as CEOs MIT rocket scientists so we
competing with the biggest mams you can
possibly imagine so I really like your
idea about how you think about niches
right you try to solve for a niche
expand from there and then I can go
around finding more customers and my
question for you is how do I try to
build more Connections in the insurance
industry me as an outsider first of all

[30:01]
industry me as an outsider first of all
and my friend is an Insider but and we
based in Toronto but he has a difficult
time networking and telling people about
the idea because he's working full-time
in his company and he doesn't want his
company to know that he's working on
this idea so what we want to do is
really find some person with a really
big problem for example they're really
struggling with construction insurance
or directors in operations insurance and
we want to solve this Niche specifically
for them and Market it to them that we
are the best at this so that we can
expand from there and I really want to
learn more about sales and marketing
from you getting in the right places
making the right connections and
expanding to find the right person with
the MVP and for the MVP and build the
product around them and then have them
love it then expand to more users and
then think about getting investors as we
have
traction okay so is your partner able to
find customers or do he just kind of
speak the language of the industry he
speaks the language he's basically we
started off like also talking to people
in the us a lot because us people
wouldn't know him and they wouldn't like

[31:01]
wouldn't know him and they wouldn't like
there's a chance that someone in Canada
knows him and talks to his boss being
like oh this person is up to this so
he's really scared about losing his job
like that but we talking to people in
the US basically C Outreach through
Linkedin and that's their methods right
now this gold our p through Linkedin to
Underwriters and finding potential users
and are you a did you say you're a
student right now I Was A student two
years ago I'm working fulltime since the
past two years
who's is your customer a a a company
that is having insurance issues or is
your customer an insurance agent it's an
insurance company or an NGA a managing
General agent and basically companies
that write insurance to uh write
insurance to
businesses okay so it can be an AIG or
any kind of middle or small insurance
company that justes insurance could one
of your customers just be like Joe Smith
in you know Plano Texas that owns a
State Farm agent
could that be a customer not sure but

[32:01]
could that be a customer not sure but
basically it's like a it's like a SAS
right someone who sells Insurance
products to homeowners or car owners is
is that a customer of yours it's not
brokos it's insurance company so if it's
an insurance company or an MGA then yes
yeah so like you have to sell this into
a corporate setting or into a small
business setting basically a small or
medium a med small medium siiz insurer
or an MGA
H do you know of any of not a competing
product but another SAS or another app
that sells to the same customer maybe
something different completely but the
same customer does anything come to mind
yeah so basically are you talking about
like other software products out there
that these insurers use is that what
you're asking uhhuh yeah yeah yeah so
there's like tons of big products that
these insurers use like guidewire to do
their policy management or there's
basically a few different SAS providers
that help with basically the entire

[33:01]
that help with basically the entire
Insurance workflow within the industry
okay so I if I were you I would find the
guidewires there's probably a couple
dozen of them these types of software
that they might be selling a CM right
but it doesn't matter like they just
need to be selling something to the same
type of customer the same job title as
what you're selling to and see if you
can find as much info as you can find on
the founder like the original founder a
podcast that he was on a Blog that he
wrote a social media post anything where
he talks about how he started his
business how he got that's what actually
we're doing right now because like I
said there's fragmentation in Industry
right so we using the leverage of my
friend working in the insurance company
and being like Oh I need to buy this
underwriting co-pilot from you and we
literally getting our competitors on
demos and basically have had a few demos
with our direct competitors about who
are doing the exact same thing to
understand what they're doing their
Journey
product but on those demos are you

[34:00]
product but on those demos are you
learning how they found their first
customers or are you just learning more
about the product they are usually
people who are so well established in
the industry with tons of connections
who are 10 20 years in and have like
millions in funding so I guess like it
it's I I didn't think deeply about it
being a hard challenge for them to find
that first customer but yeah I should
think about that too I I would like I
would find out before they had funding
but when this was just an idea how do
they find their first customer and then
their first 10 customers what methods
did they use was it maybe their dad
owned a big insurance company and they
had a cheat code maybe they just did
Cole aage on LinkedIn maybe they texted
people maybe they cold calleded people
maybe they went door too I would find
that like it's out there you could find
that even if you just got someone on the
phone and were transparent with them and
said listen I'm not competing with you
like I'm young I'm hungry I'm driven I
just want to know what would you do to
get your first customers well we did
actually we went to this one trade show
we went to 10 trade shows but this one
brought us 80% of our customers it's
like oh I need to get to that trade show

[35:01]
like oh I need to get to that trade show
I think that will be your best bet like
outside of learning Google ads like it's
so Niche it's so specialized you're
selling to something very specific so
just copy what worked for someone
selling a similar or selling anything
into the same type of customer okay okay
and I guess like how do you go about
networking and cold Outreach after that
like in general to connect with more
people in the industry as me being
become an Insider in the industry how do
you go about that go to Google type in
Twitter advance search uh that's the
only way you can find it go to a window
will open open up in Twitter do an
advanced search for my username for the
phrase cold email and I wrote like a
thousand word multiple threads on
exactly how to do that cold email at
scale that works very very effectively
and read
that
okay all right man well I wish you the
best of luck and I want to hear how it
goes thank you so much thank you for
your time yep no problem see
you Stephen stevenh Chris how are you

[36:03]
you Stephen stevenh Chris how are you
doing good how are you doing good okay
so tell me about what you do and uh like
what type of customers you have so I've
had a web development company for about
10 years now and I'm trying to do this
new I have some clients who I do a lot
of automation Consulting for and I'm
trying to scale to a larger than just a
web development company that Services
you know a small number of clients
and I realized I need a product and so
now I'm thinking okay everybody's using
zapier so instead of trying to get
people on zapier why don't I try to get
people off of zapier at a lower cost and
so I have my own automation platform
that is comparable to zappier it's on my
own system and setup and that so I'm
want to move people to my own automation
platform get them off zappier I can
guarantee that I cut their cost at least
in half and then we you know we keep
that client and uh we service their
automations and then we have a whole

[37:01]
automations and then we have a whole
engineering team that is experts at
automations so we can build automations
for them for very cheap like 40 bucks an
hour or even less so that's what I'm
doing I'm just looking for clients who
use zapier at a large is kind of scale
probably spend 500 to a thousand a month
on
zapier and so now I'm trying to figure
out how do I find these people because
my whole business for 10 years has
always been Word of Mouth and it's
worked but it's I realiz it can't scale
that way yeah so now I'm trying to
figure out I've done tons of marketing
before email marketing Facebook
marketing Google ads I'm just not quite
sure exactly how to find the right niche
market for this target okay so can you
speak to how many active customers you
have verse how many like total people in
your email database you have active
customers for for my web development
company I mean
30 30 and then I've got probably five

[38:01]
30 30 and then I've got probably five
who are super consistent that are
basically the majority of my
business okay so 30 that are like paying
you
regularly yeah in a in let's say six
months probably 30 okay but you know
probably 70% of my income comes from
five sure solid clients and of those 30
let's just kind of separate them five
and 25 so like of the five what size
business do they have versus the 25 if
you know you might not know exactly but
ballpark yeah well they're under all the
five are under 100 employees except for
one one is like a giant corporate but
yeah all five are under 100 employees
over than more than 10 employees and
then the rest of the 30 are basically
single one or two employees are just by
themselves you
know so they're kind of a different
Market well yeah a lot of more
politicians do lot of politicians and
stuff like that so but yeah or

[39:00]
stuff like that so but yeah or
solopreneurs or very small
shops how often do you speak on the
phone or on Zoom to the 30
customers not very often I mean some of
them I've never spoken on the phone to
some of them it's just all email okay
and I'm mostly doing their web
development not really any automation
stuff so it's kind of a little bit
different and what CMS do you use for
most of them
WordPress okay only WordPress
I use webflow too if someone wants to
pay for it and they want some Advanced
nice looking website but 99% is
WordPress or some custom application
like node.js or something we build that
out too but it's a different kind of a
different kind of client okay and how
many automation clients do you
have so that's probably only about four
yeah probably about four where I'm doing
in addition to the 30 or are they part
of the 30 no that's part of the five
that's basically what I'm doing for them

[40:00]
that's basically what I'm doing for them
is running their whole automation
operation mhm do you think that the 25
have a budget for automation on a
monthly basis they don't need it I don't
think no I mean they could possibly have
the budget if I had something magical
for them I just have a hard time
understanding why how anyone could not
use Automation in some way let's talk
about a customer that you have
specifically that you don't think would
need automation okay let's like judge
for example trying to get elected they
need a website I do a lot of those you
know political websites things like that
it just needs to sit there collect
donations and the only thing that they
might need is social media marketing
automation I can see automation that
they would need but it's a very you got
to get into that market so if you're
going to do lawyers you got to get into
the niche market of lawyers and build
automation that you can works with them
and works with other lawyers but you
know I do lawyers HVAC roofers it's all
over the place
I'm just thinking like with a judge
that's collecting donations he's more

[41:01]
that's collecting donations he's more
likely to collect more donations or
recurring donations if he's checking in
with his donors regularly and he doesn't
have time to do that manually I mean so
you could set up an outbound SMS or
email Automation and you can even use AI
to personalize it like hey man I was
just checking in on your family like
really just once again wanted to thank
you for your support or just updates
right like things going well in the
campaign here's the progress we've made
like marketing updates because I know in
my business I I raise money from
investors which isn't too dissimilar
from accepting money from donors and the
more updates I give them on their
investment the more likely they are to
reinvest on future deals it's difference
between like 40 and 60% reinvestment
rate and that takes automation so I just
like I I think that if you really if you
held their hands and got them on the
phone specifically and said hey I was
just thinking man like I think you could
really benefit from this and here's why
yada y y statistic one statistic two
statistic three and this won't take any
more time for you but it I mean it will

[42:00]
more time for you but it I mean it will
cost a little money there's a little bit
upfront and a little ongoing because
things always break yada y yada I bet
you anything like you should be able to
convert a double-digit percentage of
your current customers to be a recurring
automation Customer because you've done
the hardest part and you've sold them on
why they should trust you and why they
should pay you money and it's a very
tangential service right you're not
saying like hey I want to come clean
your gutters it's like it's all Tech to
them like it's all things they can't
comprehend and it's all things that you
can do for them I would think you should
like I would take those 30 people and
put them on a whiteboard and just start
like just send them an email like hey I
just want to check in on how
everything's going like we send them a
cly link and just keep following up
until you get them on the phone but
already have these ideas for them when
you get them on the phone because
they're not going to know about this you
have to plant the ideas and tell them
why it's beneficial and then maybe the
conversion rate is crap or maybe it's
60% but I would exhaust that first
because that's the lowest hanging fruit
and then start thinking about like how

[43:00]
and then start thinking about like how
do I tack the legal industry how do I do
Google ads or paid ads or go outside of
Word of Mouth right I mean you could
double your business just by converting
yeah that'd be nice I mean that's what I
want to do so okay really appreciate
that it's a good thought yeah yeah I
would give that a shot and let me know
how it goes all right thank you I know
you're on tight schedule here so all
right yeah see you guys thanks Stephen y
all right bye see you
Andrew that was perfect timing so you
were looking for a career
change that's right I just finished 20
years in the Navy and I went through the
ranks got as high as you could go in
that time and I don't really feel like
working for a large organization anymore
so I started my own financial adviser
and tax preparation business which is a
great business in the long run but in
the short term when you come from a very
different field like the military it's
very hard to get started so I'm looking

[44:00]
very hard to get started so I'm looking
for your perspective on you know things
to do to like kickart yeah so you're
going to be collecting retirement
forever and you want to do something
else because you know we're not meant to
sit around all
day correct now what ideas do you
already
have well I I've already formed the
company first of all okay and so I've
got some practice with just like friends
and family in terms of a niche I was
largely like
undefined uh of who I want to serve but
I think I finally know and I think my uh
target market is serving Gen X and
Millennials who are living in or
dreaming of living in Japan and
Singapore because actually I know I've
lived in Japan myself as part of the
military my wife's Japanese we got half
Japanese kids and we understand Japanese
law and I'm also a licensed tax preparer
so I understand about like foreign tax
credits and things like that that
Americans need to know because once you

[45:02]
Americans need to know because once you
live overseas I don't know if people
realize United States is one of like one
or two countries where you still have to
file every year it doesn't matter that
you left you still got to file your
taxes yeah so yeah just being a
generalist based on all the
conversations I've had is is probably
going to get you nowhere but if you can
clearly Define a target market by age
and interest that tends to lead to where
all your marketing and social media
content goes and I was really struggling
with that but it just came to me uh
yesterday that you know I'm similar to
that age group I've been through a lot
of those pain points we're even thinking
of moving ourselves to Japan in the next
year so I think that might be a smart
way to go now did you say Gen X or gen Z
Plus Millennials uh Gen X and
Millennials cuz I'm 45 so I was just in
the bottom part of the Gen X
yep okay so you specifically want to

[46:02]
yep okay so you specifically want to
find gen aers and Millennials that are
about to move or have recently moved to
Japan uh or Singapore and you want to
monetize by helping them with their
yearly tax prep or helping in with that
plus other things PLUS Financial
Planning because I'm also registered uh
with the
state which state uh Pennsylvania but
you're allowed to take clients from all
over
okay and then as long as you follow the
rules of fincial planning not Financial
advising well it is financial advising
but it's not just Investments it's like
the holistic approach that you see on
Twitter from Thomas coppelman and other
people yeah it's just like Investments
are in there but they're pretty far down
the list compared to other things in the
person's life and is that monetizable by
taking one% of their investable assets
or whatever that's one way to do it you
could also just do a flat subscription
fee I'm already approved to take 450 a

[47:00]
fee I'm already approved to take 450 a
month in financial planning fees from
clients are you thinking flat Fe lines
yeah I think I'd prefer that I if people
want to have me manage their Investments
I'm also licensed to do that and then I
can take that What's called the asset
under management fee the AUM as you were
just describing instead in lie of that
but I think most people who are around
my age and younger probably feel
comfortable just
typing in their own trades like they
just really need a coach for the overall
experience more so than to actually
manage the
Investments okay and are you pretty set
on this idea I mean you filed your LLC
is is this where you're headed or you
open to other things not I'm not saying
that because I don't like this idea I'm
just within certain parameters I'm
pretty set okay because I've been
already talk you know I filed more than
a year ago so in my last year in the
Navy I was doing both I was like

[48:00]
Navy I was doing both I was like
networking with other CPAs and and
financial advisers trying to understand
the business and my thoughts have
evolved a lot since a year ago but I
mean it's only in the big picture it's
only confirmed strategically that I'm on
the right path because I'm always the
numbers guy anyway since high school and
these sorts of businesses are a slow
burn but once they get going it can the
clients tend to stick with you for 30
years and never leave if you prove your
competence at least so so that appeals
to me I like helping people with money I
like serving people oneon-one and and so
that's where I'm at okay I like it now
have you what are your marketing ideas
for getting to for finding this unique
yes category of people I'm already on
Twitter that's how he found you
but barely post ever and I don't have a
lot of followers so that would be one
Avenue if I could just like buckle down
get serious about posting once every day

[49:02]
get serious about posting once every day
especially with this more specific
message to a specific audience think
could would probably get some better
traction we've already had a YouTube
channel too and it kind of suffered from
the thing same thing we weren't really
speaking to anyone specifically so we're
basically speaking to no one so yeah so
I like the videos we did but it just
they just never went anywhere so those
would be my two main ones I'm not sure
you could really do much paid
advertising at least in the beginning
and get any success it's it tends to be
Word of Mouth
referrals getting in front of people I
would think that there's a decent amount
of search volume for very specific
things like yeah you know moving to
Japan or stuff like that right like
Google search volume yeah so that could
be one area just the paid paid search
option where certain keywords get me
elevated in the list and that doesn't
cost that much so I'd be open to that

[50:02]
cost that much so I'd be open to that
yeah do you have any idea about how many
people are moving to those two countries
per year I don't but I have a feeling
after the next election there might be a
big wave and but there's already already
I looked it up this morning there's
about 60,000 people living in Japan
Americans and there's about
30,000 Americans living in Singapore and
it tends to be you know you got a big
Hub of people
mostly working for compan American
companies earning pretty high wages
living comfortable lives a lot of
Bankers a lot of investment bankers a
lot of people at uh like Japanese car
companies like Nissan would also have
American employees at their headquarters
self-employment in Japan is quite
complicated there's I'm sure that I've
met a few of those people and I would be
one of them if I move but I have a huge
Advantage cuz my daughter's already
Japanese but just be a regular
run-of-the American and say I just want

[51:00]
run-of-the American and say I just want
to move there yeah maybe not but that's
why I include Singapore too because they
actually have a program where it's just
income based if you can show that you
have a certain threshold above like
about $15,000 a month in american-based
income you can get a three-year Visa so
there may be that population more so in
Singapore of self-employed Americans
compared to Japan so I think it's enough
of a base and I like Singapore a lot
I've been there a few times but I really
know Japan like backwards and forwards
so what about I I'm sure there are
dozens of Facebook groups dedicated to
this have you thought of EI at least
posting in there or approaching those or
even buying a Facebook group and just
taking it
over yeah no I haven't I'm not a big
like meta guy but maybe you need to be
if you're going to start this I I think
there's a massive opportunity for people
to buy
Facebook groups because most Facebook
groups are just a passion project some

[52:01]
groups are just a passion project some
random person started it and it just
grew on its own and it actually has
value and 90% of them are not monetized
and even if they are there's not really
an open market for it we bought Facebook
groups for2 to $700 that had tens of
thousands of people in it these were
Bucky Facebook groups so I think you
should find Facebook groups for Japan or
Japan Japanese xats us xats and
Singapore PS or even just like Singapore
or Japan like fan page Facebook groups
that seems to be American based and you
you really got to play the long game on
these I've done it I've tried it both
ways and if you just like C DM the
administrator or the moderator they're
not going to be receptive but if you
join it and just start contributing and
you get like the top contributor badge
in there it's could take a couple weeks
it's not as hard as you might think to
get like a badge in those groups and
make a name for yourself and then start
reaching out and just say like hey man
like I love your group just so you know

[53:00]
like I love your group just so you know
like you're doing something great it's
very active Kudos that's it and then a
week later something else and then a
week later it's like Hey listen you know
have you ever thought about X Y or Z and
a lot of times you can leave them in as
a moderator but you have to be
transferred ownership of the group or
they could still kick you out after you
buy it so a lot of times you can buy it
and then pay them a very menial amount
to just keep moderating it or just keep
them as a moderator so they can feel
good about themselves I would go that
route cuz this is so Niche and then I
think the I think there will be targeted
Google ads that you could do for this as
well another thing back to YouTube I
have a friend that has a really really
good YouTube channel it's called two and
20 those are number two and 20 and they
make really high quality long form
YouTube videos about like geopolitical
events in other countries so they based
in Canada but they make them about
Australia the US politics economics and

[54:03]
Australia the US politics economics and
they have like eight videos but they've
gotten hundreds of thousands and
millions of views and they're faceless
there's just them talking it's like a
news channel and so there is precedent
for someone making and it takes them a
long time to make these but they didn't
get any Boost from Mr Beast they started
at zero they didn't do any growth hacks
or marketing they just put out really
high quality long form YouTube content
about these other countries and economic
events Etc and now they're monetized
they're making thousands of dollars just
from Google AdSense or YouTube AdSense
and you could totally do that just focus
on Japan and Singapore and just be like
age crisis in Japan explained 20 minute
long video or where did Singapore get
all its wealth from stuff like that and
it's not going to be as targeted but
it'll be pretty dang
targeted yeah you just it's just
YouTube's hard right it's a hard n to
crack but um I tell you the story as
precedent that someone is doing

[55:01]
precedent that someone is doing
something very similar with a lot of
success without any paid ads or growth
hacks or special
knowledge yeah no that sounds great man
cool well I hope that's helpful and I
want to know I want to know what you do
I want to know the
followup that'd be great I'll let you
know in about a year okay thanks Andrew
all right thank you yeah bye by bye
