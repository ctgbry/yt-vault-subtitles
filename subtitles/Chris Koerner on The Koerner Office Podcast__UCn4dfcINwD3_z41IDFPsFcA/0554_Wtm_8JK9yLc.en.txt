look at this freaking thing right here I
know how you could launch this business
but before I tell you here's a framework
every time you think of a new business
idea or a way of making money think to
yourself how can I use a farmer's market
to validate this idea and get immediate
feedback from people standing right in
front of me and if you can think of a
way to do that then launch that business
because the risk of launching a business
at a farmers market is a few hundred but
it's a Priceless education now you're
going to laugh when I tell you this but
imagine getting these casting molds
posting up at your local farmers market
for a couple hundred bucks in a day with
a 10x10 10 you see some kids walking
around hey Mom let me dip your kid foot
it's some pink slime so you can remember
how cute it is forever that didn't
really roll off the tongue like I
thought it might you get what I'm saying
the mom rolls up she pays 80 bucks drops
her Kid's Foot in this pink slime month
later you mail her her own foot that
sounds really dumb when I say it out
loud but so did hopping in strangers
cars and Uber is a hundred billion doll
company full business plan right here
