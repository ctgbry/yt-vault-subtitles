[00:00]
to me this seems like the perfect
opportunity for you because it's
enabling you to basically start a
startup with no
[Music]
money welcome back to the ker office we
are back to our normal format of me
answering questions from entrepreneurs I
took three questions today one from
Aaron Alejandro and Daniel Aaron is an
ex- mechanical engineer to software
engineer and he wants to learn some
marketing skills so he can help a family
friend with their eight figure business
that sells grills Alejandra was next and
he wants to help his friend grow her dog
training business so I had a unique idea
of reverse engineering social media
posts to find out how to do that and
Daniel was last but not least and he
owns a print shop in Brooklyn and he's
making good money six figures plus
printing wedding invitations and Bar
Mitzvah invitations but he feels trapped
he's working 15-hour days and he wants
to scale his business maybe he wants to
buy another business he just feels
trapped cuz he feels like he can't

[01:01]
trapped cuz he feels like he can't
afford to hire someone to replace him
but he's just kind of in that messy
middle so I talked him through his
problems and that was good one I think
you'll like it enjoy all right so what
you wrote to me was I'm a wantrepreneurs
software engineer developing consumer
electronics mid-30s make 185k I already
trade my time for money I don't want to
start a side Al so that requires more of
that I already tried cleaning gutters I
want something that scales I read your
newsletter and I'm desperate for my
first dopamine hit hit of someone
willing to pay me for something I didc
created and I will add it does feel
really good so you're on the right track
I would love to sell something online I
have no e-commerce experience I have no
experience trying ideas I have no sales
experience or online marketing
experience Etc but I would love to get
this experience question one should I
prioritize getting experience with
something like clavo which is a a
marketing email marketing software that
gets me exposed to marketing and testing
ideas or work for a company parttime

[02:00]
ideas or work for a company parttime
selling their outdoor grill product
commission only and learning how to
generate my own leads question two I
love spreadsheets but I have no
accounting background can you recommend
a resource to learn the business lingo
important metrics Etc so my first
question to you Aaron is two- part one
has anything changed since you submitted
this question and two I would love to
hear more about this side hustle
opportunity to sell grills yeah so I did
the only thing that's changed since then
was I approached at through a family
friend who's done very well for themsel
and they have some sort of stake in a
company that makes a really nice um
Grill and they gear it very much towards
like the yachting industry it's an
electric grill that's approved for
marine use I was and and so they're
trying to get into other markets namely
like the condo Market where you're not
allowed to have a gas grill on your
porch if you own a condo or the RV space
so they're trying to find some hungry
people to get their product into these
areas so that's kind of been the only

[03:00]
areas so that's kind of been the only
thing that's changed and I forget the
second question I'm sorry has anything
changed since you submitted this
question yeah no nothing's changed I'm
still yeah everything's still basically
the same okay so this grill company how
are they currently marketing is it kind
of an old school business with Boomer
owners or are they pretty Savvy at
marketing very much like old school
marketing as far as I know and how are
they doing with that they go to trade
shows and things like that I don't have
any sort of insight into how they're
doing it but it's made in the USA so I
would assume I believe they're in some
very I won't mention the name but
they're in some very popular like voting
stores that are common okay so they're
mostly just doing the old school stuff
trade shows retail are they doing any
direct to consumer or e-commerce
shipping through their website at all I
think they have e-commerce through their
website from what I understand I've
looked into it and you can purchase one
online as far as I know but I don't
believe they're on any other platform
like Amazon or anything like that okay

[04:01]
like Amazon or anything like that okay
so they've kind of sought you out
thinking oh this guy he's young he can
help us and you're like I want to know
how to help you but I'm not quite there
yet do I fake it till I make it do I use
this as a learning opportunity do I say
nah no I'm going to try something else
is that kind of where you're at yeah
they're very much I think they would be
eager to have somebody commission only
who's hungry on the team who's also like
my background is mechanical and software
so I can speak technically to their
product and explain that kind of thing
so they're eager for somebody
who has that background because it
doesn't seem to me like from what
they've said that's a a common thing
somebody going from the technical sides
who wants to get into sales so that's
what the pitch to me was so to speak and
how much do these grills cost I want to
say they started around $1,000 and go up
from there I think they may have a lower
budget one in the 750 range okay do you
know what their revenues look like yeah
I have no insight into any of those
details what about how many employees
they have a lot of times you can reverse
engineer their revenues I would say
probably between 50 and 100 they do all

[05:02]
probably between 50 and 100 they do all
their Manufacturing in the US and they
have I would say between 50 and 100
employees wow okay so I would think it's
probably like a low eight figure
business that sound about right yeah
that's a good guess I'll give you some
insight into why I'm asking these
questions because when it comes to
selling things especially on commission
only it's really helpful to find a sweet
spot right like there's always a
trade-off between the ticket size that
you're selling call it swimming pools or
vers t-shirts in an American Eagle store
verse the difficulty of the sale and
occasionally you can find a sweet spot
where it's like a the sales cycle is not
too long B the ticket size is high at
least in the thousands and C it's not a
very hard sale right but like it it
occasionally you can find like some
Arbitrage there but usually if you're
selling $100,000 pool it's going to be a
six-month decision it's going to be
really hard it's going to take month
months or years before you earn your

[06:01]
months or years before you earn your
first dollar but then once you get that
pipeline full you can make some really
good money that's usually how it works
so I'm trying to understand what would a
commission look like and how successful
is this company already and if they're
thousand
grills I see this as a perfect type of
product that you could sell with Google
ads just direct Google ads because your
cost per acquisition is probably going
to be
like4 to
$140 but if they've got good gross
margins then they can for to scale that
and to pay you a commission okay would
you say that like a number of your
newsletters and podcast and stuff you
mentioned outs scraper and different
online tools that you can use to
generate leads just being that Boomer
owners I don't know how far down the
rabbit hole they've gone this and me
being a software engineer I'm very eager
to write some of my own scripts or use
like outs scrapers API to have a server
running in the background that's like
trying to find the owners of a
condominium per se and get leads that

[07:02]
condominium per se and get leads that
way for a customer who might put a grill
on in every single one of their condos
or mandate that all their tenants have a
gr that meets certain requirements I'm
trying to find a succinct way to ask
this but I guess I'm wondering if this
organization has not gone down this
route yet to employ some of these tools
do you see that as something that I
could use to set myself apart trade
shows work right I'm not going to dog on
what they're doing but their eyes just
aren't opened to the the new ways of
finding customers right right if you
were to be able to bring them new
ideas and say to them with respect hey
what you're doing is working keep doing
that don't you obviously don't want to
dog on what they're doing but then say
why don't you let me try this and just
start throwing a bunch of terms at them
that's going to confuse them but make
you sound smart right like I'm going to
run an outc scraper API to pull up the
owners of these condominiums on the
backend and then I'm going to go to
Google ads go to moz.com and get a paid
account and I'm going to learn where the
Arbitrage opportunities are because some

[08:00]
Arbitrage opportunities are because some
longtail keywords have high competition
but low volume but other ones have high
volume but low competition and so I
really want to start bidding on those
and they're G to be like whoa yeah that
sounds amazing I assume they're going to
be like that and to me this seems like
the perfect opportunity for you because
it's enabling you to basically start a
startup with no money now commission
only that's fine because the alternative
to this is to like start Drop Shipping
someone else's grills and you're gonna
have to learn with that and you're going
to lose money on your first few orders
or first hundred orders and it's just
going to be really hairy but if they're
willing to pay you uh for Success then I
don't think you have much to lose but
your time and you don't even have that
to lose because you're the reason you're
calling is because you want to learn you
want to develop new skills so I would
think this is the perfect opportunity
because they're a family friend and if
you didn't have this opportunity I might
very well suggest suggest that you call

[09:00]
very well suggest suggest that you call
a company like this and ask if you can
do something like this but you already
have someone offering so that part is
done being more specific if I were you I
would take them up on that offer give
yourself a 60-day out just in case you
don't like it that way you could be
respectful to them in 60 days and to
yourself and there won't be any hard
feelings especially since it is a family
friend and give yourself 60 days to
really see if you can move the needle
and move some of these grills but
conversely if they are requiring you to
be um commission only ask for an ads
budget and just tell them direct like
can I just have like a, a month that
goes straight to Google ads like I can
set a cap on the budget and I'll tell
you straight up I'm learning but it's
going to cost a little money for me to
learn but I can't spend my own money on
your Google ads do you think they would
agree to that I think so they would be
willing to do something like that and I
guess that prompts me to want to ask you
as an engineer with no sales experience
what is Fair commission look like for

[10:00]
what is Fair commission look like for
somebody like me wanting to get started
but bringing a little bit of technical
experience to the table it's tough
because a commission on a grill that you
had to pay $50 to get through Google ads
is going to look different from a
commission on a grill that you acquired
by Cult calling a condo owner right okay
and so I would try to work out those
details side by side with them and say
and just go cover all your bases say if
I cold call a condo owner and sell a 100
grills what does my com condition look
like if I spend $40 in ads to sell one
Grill what does a commission look like
if I find an influencer to make a video
of your grills and he sells a thousand
but I have to pay him a 100 bucks per
Grill what does my commission look like
so I would just make a structure that
covers basically take all the ideas of
what of everything you might want to do
to sell these grills and try to see if
you can get uh a commission and a budget
attached to each one okay that makes
sense yeah completely a lot of
influencers are going to be like yeah oh

[11:01]
influencers are going to be like yeah oh
wow you want to give me a percent of
every grill that I sell you and everyone
else that means you don't want to take
any risk I'm going to need some money up
front and so some influencers will be
willing to take that risk but usually
the best ones are going to want some
money up front so they feel like their
time is is being guaranteed understood
okay great this is definitely some food
for th I really appreciate you talking
through uh this with me and I think
that's a great idea about the 60 day
let's try this out and see how it goes
cuz some of my questions to you in the
email right I have some other interests
in things I was wondering too if I
should pursue those and I can call back
about that another time I think that's a
great idea so I really appreciate you
mentioning that yeah absolutely and I
would recommend I think it's moz.com or
ahrefs.com pay for something and it's
usually going to be 50 to 150 month a
month you can cancel anytime where you
can do keyword research specifically and
find those Arbitrage opportunities where
people are searching for it but not a
lot lot of people are bidding on it and

[12:00]
lot lot of people are bidding on it and
then use that data to bring to the
owners you sound like you're more
knowledgeable than you already are but
you have the intent to become that
knowledgeable by the end of the 60 days
gotcha right okay awesome Chris yeah and
then I would take like a a Google ads
course or something just find a guy on
YouTube or find a 00 a udemy person yep
if you're a data guy you will love it
like Google ads is just fun okay it's
just really fun and if you can crack
that code you'll never run out of money
it okay Hey listen I'm so grateful that
for you having me on definitely going to
try to come on in the future and ask you
is are doing is awesome and your partner
as well so thanks again thank you Erin I
appreciate that a lot and good luck all
right talk soon bye all right see
you all right we have Alejandro in the
lobby okay so you wrote in and said I
just started some doing some digital
marketing work for some friends and
happen to connect with a dog trainer
who's trying to grow her business in the
Dallas for Worth area she asked if I had
any ideas to help her grow she's on

[13:01]
any ideas to help her grow she's on
social media but doesn't put any time
into it she let her website expire she's
actually a very good trainer she's has a
good track record of past clients from
what I can tell I'm convinced she needs
to take social media gooogle my business
seriously which is step one to get a
digital footprint and reviews but what I
really want to do is some out of the-box
ideas for marketing like events
giveaways
Etc some ideas these are your ideas
setting up a free training day at a
local dog park and maybe run ads post
flyers or Outreach partner with rescue
organization two go on local dog
Facebook groups mom groups and share dog
training content to those looking to get
training I've never done this so not
sure if there's a certain code of
contact that needs to be followed okay
so can you add any context to those
questions or tell me if anything has
changed since you submitted them so
nothing has changed and I feel like
that's as much context as I can give off
top of my head other than any questions
you might have on specifics

[14:00]
you might have on specifics
how big is her business do you
know I would say it's pretty small she
probably does
maybe 1,500 to 2,000 a month in dog
training she typically will do about
four or five sessions at like 500 bucks
for a total right it's about 125 bucks
per session 125 bucks per session okay
and is this her full-time slon thing yes
does she want to scale it or is this a
dream that you have for her no she wants
a skill okay and she just just doesn't
know where to start she done 100% word
of mouth and she's never really invested
much in the digital space never really
done any kind of advertising or
marketing on her own end other than a
couple Instagram posts here and there
but she just has she's good at what she
does but the business aspect the
marketing aspect is not her thing right
has she or have you
identified direct competitors in the
nearby

[15:00]
nearby
area very I have very Loosely I've even
worked with some other dog trainers in
the DFW area that I was not impressed
with at all spent three four 5,000 for a
boarding train $10 10day boarding train
which was not worth it in the end um but
as far as specifics I don't have a list
I don't have any kind of specific info
yet okay and do you know how much work
she's doing right now to grow her
business or is she just trying to run it
she is really just trying to run it she
has not like I was saying before not put
a lot of effort into any kind of
marketing or advertising doesn't do a
lot of the Social Media stuff she's
trying to get in the social media thing
trying to do Instagram which has kind of
worked a little bit kind of driven some
traffic to there but not much just
running the business do you mind telling
me the name of her business so I could
look it up and I I can also edit it out
if you would prefer that but I'd like to
get more context here absolutely it's a
dog trainings a c n

[16:02]
dog trainings a c n
d all right let's see what we got here
is it in
Arlington
yes all right okay
so how long have they been
opened that's a good question I'm not
100% sure it's over a year for sure
she's been dog training for a number of
years but this specific business I'm not
I couldn't give you exact time okay does
she use any software for managing her
bookings or anything no no
is there not a a Marketplace for dog
trainers is there anything like that
like an Uber for dog trainers where they
match you with customers there might be
I'm not familiar with one well every
time I've looked up anything I've never
seen anything like that but that's an
interesting idea I would look into that
a lot of times there is a random Niche
Marketplace for something like this that
people they just they don't think to
look for it another question I have is
would it be that hard for her to get her
website back up and running again is she
against that I'm actually working on
that so we are her domain name she

[17:00]
that so we are her domain name she
really wants to keep the same domain
name she has and so somebody else had
bought it so we're working on trying to
get that back and I'm building up the
website right now what about Ascend
trining decom if you can't get that one
back is that one open do you know I
don't know that one specifically open I
do know as send dog training TX for
Texas is open she was not too interested
in doing that one but she's open to it
she's still trying really hard to get
her old domain name back so okay yeah
if I were her I would invest in a tripod
and simply let a camera start rolling as
she's training these dogs just to
document and 95% of the time nothing
special or interesting is going to
happen but occasionally something will
happen and she can just start by posting
that to Instagram to any short form
video
platform and I would also suggest that
she makes a list of her five biggest
like most direct most local competitors

[18:00]
like most direct most local competitors
and then start reverse engineering how
they got to where they are today looking
at the web archive scrolling way back on
Facebook and Instagram and look at those
first posts look at the popular post on
Facebook and Instagram that got the most
comments specifically so I'm kind of
obsessed lately with reverse engineering
why certain things go viral and it's
always in the comments and it doesn't
she doesn't have to find something that
went viral right I'm just using that as
an example look for the posts of her
direct competitors that have
outperformed okay so maybe she has a
competitor named Arlington dog training
and their average Instagram or Facebook
post gets seven likes and six comments
then you see a few that get 70 likes and
comments don't just look at what they
posted to get that but specifically read
the comments on that post of what they
are saying and then create social media
content that helps regenerate comments
like that on her own post does that make

[19:00]
like that on her own post does that make
sense yes yep so like for instance maybe
one of our competitors posted a video of
them training a dog how to heal and they
had a choker caller in the video and all
the comments were like oh those are bad
those are unethical you can use that
right maybe now her brand is like
ethical dog training or kind dog
training um you know what I'm saying
yeah yeah yeah that makes sense okay
it's kind of like what people do what
Amazon sellers do they will go to
competing products and read the negative
reviews and see oh okay everyone's upset
that this plastic widget always breaks
around week three okay so now not only
are we going to make sure that part of
our of our widget is metal and not
plastic we're also going to talk about
that in the title and in the top of the
description so it taking the pain points
of a competitor and highlighting those
of your
own got it okay yeah I think that should
be enough to get her going and of course

[20:00]
be enough to get her going and of course
like get any website back up I wouldn't
worry about getting the exact website
I'm sure she wants it but it's really
hard to convince a domain owner to get
them to sell their website unless you're
really willing to pay up yeah that's
what I've told her and I'm pretty sure
we'll go with a different name but she's
just she's new to this whole thing so
once she kind of gets into once she
realizes it may not work out I'm sure
we'll find some those yeah I get it
anyway I'd love to hear a follow-up once
you make these changes absolutely I
appreciate your help thank you no no
problem have a good day thank you sir
yep see
you Daniel how are you I'm good I'm
doing good all right so what you said I
have a business I own and work at
full-time it is set up as a hi-touch
service heavy business I would like to
buy another business that I can use to
increase my income since my current
business takes up so much of my day what
type of business should I be looking for
so I'd love to hear about your current
business more basically it's a print
shop that's the forward facing uh type

[21:00]
shop that's the forward facing uh type
of business but we really specialize
only in printing for wedding Bar Mitzvah
and similar events that's it we know
what the the uh event planners want we
know how to design it the right way um
other print shops that just do
commercial things they don't know
necessarily how to design it the way
that the event planners like it they
don't stock the funny papers the blush
pinks and the metallic taes all the
different things I like we have those in
stock all the time and we have some
specialty cap AB ilities that a standard
printing business might not have and and
you're in Brooklyn yes in Brooklyn yeah
okay we are able to to get a higher
margin because everything for a wedding
is always gets a A markup that other
things don't whatever service or product
you're providing and printing is no
different and the downside of it is that
you're dealing with a lot of last minute
things that's why I'm here all the time
I'm basically here 14 15 hours a day the
rest of the time I'm either with my
family or doing other different
obligations that I have and how long
have you been working that
much that many hours yeah at least three

[22:02]
much that many hours yeah at least three
years it's been like this I had a really
great employee before Co during Co
immediately after covid but then he said
I could move someplace else and get the
same apartment for about a third of the
price so that's what he's going to do
and since then I've had a couple people
that are not just not competent enough
and I found that I'm paying them but I'm
still coming back at night so there's no
point like when I had the other guy it
really took a load off and it was just
it was so much easier but then after I
lost him it's hard to get people to to
work here that either they're
overqualified and they think that oh
this is so easy printing is just control
P file print what's the big deal or
they're underqualified and they're
watching Netflix while they're doing the
work and then I see it afterwards and I
got to fix it all or things like that
it's just not it's not it's hard to find
a good fit that's the thing with with
this type of business okay so you've
been working this hard for two to three

[23:00]
been working this hard for two to three
years how long have you been in business
and what is your annual revenue like
I've been in business for about 10 years
a little more than 10 years 10 and a
half years my annual revenues are about
650 700 something like that but because
of the high margin I'm able to take home
a substantial portion of that so my
income is good but I could always I need
more let put it that way definitely need
more yeah and when you said take over
did you buy this or what was that
like 10 years ago it's interesting my
mother-in-law had this business but not
at the same it wasn't as built out as
what I have now she had it and she was
using it just as a business to print
addresses on envelopes guest addresses
and that is a high margin service after
a few years of my being married she said
you know what maybe your wife wants to
come work with me we'll expand the
business and after did they took it they
expanded it to offer everything but most
of the work was brokered and when I took
it over she called me one day and she
said she wants me to take it over she

[24:00]
said she wants me to take it over she
can't handle it anymore she'll give it
to me debt free I just walk in it's all
mine I can do whatever I want I didn't
have to pay for it um so I was like why
not I brought a lot of processes in
house and it's been good every year
we've seen growth every single year last
year was our best year ever this year
we're a little off on the numbers I'm
not sure why every month our revenues
have been down but I'm still able to
take the same salary okay do you have
any employees I have my sister-in-law
comes in for about 4 hours a day 3 days
a week to do some graphic design but I
don't need her to come in I'm able to do
it all by myself Are you purposely
trying to grow right now or are you just
getting business because of your
reputation right right now I am trying
to find some new people until for the
last couple years I've had good
customers and I haven't needed to expand
over the last couple years I've been
experimenting with some different things
I tried to say let's move out in New
York let's go someplace else buy a
different business that's more 9 to5
then I was trying to figure out a way to

[25:00]
then I was trying to figure out a way to
take this to more of a commercial
Direction and hire somebody and to work
with me I noticed over the last six
months two or three people have stopped
ordering almost completely and they just
tell me the reason they stopped ordering
is because they haven't had business I
see on social media they do have
business I'm not sure what that means
everything's really been good I don't
know when you say people you mean party
planners those are like part planners
event planners yeah I have a dozen that
come a couple times a month and they
spend a few thousand do each time and it
it works out the core of the business is
working with the event planners and
turning things around in 24 48 Hours
things like that okay so I have been
trying to grow that but I want to
replace those people yeah I'm really
trying to get to a point where I can
sell this business and just wash my
hands of it I don't have another thing
to replace my income that's the problem
all right so if your take-home is high
enough to where you could sell this
business for a good price it's also high
enough to where you could hire someone
right a replacement so it's interesting
I take home 250,000 a year I don't I
don't have any extra money to hire

[26:00]
don't have any extra money to hire
somebody at least not full-time what
people have been suggesting is do
part-time the problem with hiring
someone parttime is you don't know which
parttime because jobs will come out of
nowhere like Wednesday I didn't even
know I had this job that's taking me
four or five hours to do and now I have
the job so I I don't really know I need
someone that I can just call oh come
down I have a couple hours today or
tomorrow I I don't I can't find someone
like that so I'm trying to keep it in a
steady state where I'm able to still
make the same amount of money but build
something else on the side where in the
next three four years I could sell this
yeah I've been there you're in like that
messy Middle where you feel trapped
right yes you feel like I don't have
enough to hire but I have too much where
I'm like golden handcuffed to this
business it's hard to make a move in the
place that you're in without some level
of Faith right and I don't mean that in
the religious sense I mean that in the
oh I'm ready to take a risk I'm totally
ready to take a risk I I have no problem
I will take a loan I because as
terrifying as it is it's far more

[27:00]
terrifying as it is it's far more
terrifying to me to be in the same place
in 10 years like I can't do that like I
I I'm scared to to take a loan scared to
buy business but I'm far more terrified
of being exactly where I am now 10 years
from now I can't handle that that's not
a good I wouldn't this sounds harsh but
I'm glad you're terrified because that's
the opposite of complacent right you're
not complacent and so you're thinking do
I sell this business or do I double down
on this business both of them are going
to take a leap of faith in into the
unknown right right you said you had a
comment earlier where it's let's find a
business that that could act more of a 9
to-5 but honestly some Industries might
make it easier to be more like a 95 but
a quote I heard recently was a graveyard
is full of Irreplaceable men right like
any task can be outsourced some are
harder to Outsource some make you feel
more uncomfortable but really anything
can be outsourced and you've done it
you've done it yourself you had a rockar
and then they left let's say someone
came you right now and said I'll give
you 750 for your business three times

[28:01]
you 750 for your business three times
earnings but I I don't want to run it
what would you do because you're the one
running it right like how is it sellable
today if you want to sell it if you
don't have anyone working for you
really right that is a good point I
never even thought about that I never
thought about that that's a good point
if I don't have anyone else working here
who's going to buy it right exactly
you're selling a job and people don't
want a job they want to be a passive
income business owner whether that
exists or not I think no matter what you
do you're going to have to find some
good help and you're going to have to
take a leap of faith to get that help
because you can't sell it until you
replace yourself and you can't replace
yourself until you've decided what you
want to do here's my guut like I'm the
king of shiny objects I'm the king of
managing seven things at once whether
that's a good idea or not and I'm so
tempted to ask you all about this other
business that you want to buy but if you
still have to find someone to replace
yourself before you even think of that
then I want talk about that more what I
was thinking was like oh couldn't I buy

[29:02]
was thinking was like oh couldn't I buy
something like a laundromat but like
having aeromat and paying a guy $20 an
hour $25 an hour just to sit there what
could go wrong in a laat someone loses
their money they need their quarters
back something goes wrong with the
equipment you call the service
technician replacing me here is a lot
harder than replacing you just putting a
body that Scrolls his phone all day in a
laundromat that like how I always gotten
myself into a lot of trouble with how
hard Could That Be The Grass Is Always
Greener right this is the devil the
devils are in the details of this devil
you've der risked this devil as you're
talking I just Googled so there's about
a 100,000 party and event planners in
the United States and in New York City
that's about 3% of the US population so
all else equal and you could argue there
there's a higher proportion of partying
event planners in New York City but
let's keep it conservative there's 3,000
potential not end consumer customers but
3,000 potential wholesale customers that

[30:00]
3,000 potential wholesale customers that
are touching dozens of other customers
per week or per month right you you have
what 20 to 40 event planner customers no
not even I have probably like a dozen
about a dozen that come a couple times a
month yes but I want to ask a couple
more questions before I I for sure get
to that how many direct competitors
would you say you have in New York City
that focus on weddings and bar mitzvah I
don't think there's really anybody that
does it because there's a lot of people
that broker this kind of work I don't
know if anyone that's what I do
especially at the price I do it yeah
it's funny you mention prices because on
the YouTube live stream right now
someone AI home leads just said raise
your prices right same amount of worky I
did a little bit I raised my prices and
then you get push back they start
whining about it how much push back
right like 20% price increase 10% push
back you you win right that's a net win
so I would measure that before like
anecdotally saying you get because of
course you'll get push back but is it
more push back than the additional

[31:00]
more push back than the additional
Revenue that you're getting there's so
few people that if I lose the wrong one
that's what my feeling is like there's
three or four people that are the bigger
fish like of the 12 there's three or
four that are that like I'll do whatever
they say I'll come in whenever they want
if I lose one of them that's a big
problem that's why I'm hesitant all
right I'm gonna throw up a bunch of
stuff on you it's floating around in my
head okay you ready okay put your poncho
on so first of
all I completely understand what you're
saying about being hesitant to raise
prices because because you only have a
dozen customers and they're big
customers I think you could use that to
your advantage and say I only have a
dozen customers I'm going to get all of
them on the phone and have a very honest
and transparent conversation about where
I'm at in life right now and about my
prices and kind of feel it out because a
lot of people think about raising prices
and it's just you just send an email and
you raise prices crap I lost four
customers crap I lost a third of my
Revenue I'm screwed it doesn't have to
be like that because of the fact that
you have 12 customers you have the
luxury of being able to talk to all of
them in an afternoon and just feel it
out listen man I don't know what to do

[32:01]
out listen man I don't know what to do
like like we you've worked with me for a
long time like I'm just being honest
what do you think could you afford to
take a 5% price hike so that's my I'm
not advocating for you to raise prices
someone mentioned it in the comments and
I thought it was an interesting idea and
you've already thought about it but I
think you should explore it uh a a
little more okay there's that second of
all let's say I asked how many people do
what you do none now I know you're kind
of exaggerating there could be one or
two other guys that you're not super
familiar with one that does it but he
charges a lot more than me there's your
precedent for raising prices right
there's your case study I get is what I
get is I get some of the people that
want sort of his aesthetic that he
provides like he does provide an
exceptional product like people in the
industry know the party planers they
know yeah okay so let's be super
conservative and say there are 10 people
there are nine other people in Brooklyn
New York City that do what you do if
that is the case then there's 3,000
party planners and event planners in New
York City let's divide that market up

[33:01]
York City let's divide that market up
equally proportionally and there's 300
for everyone okay so ba basically if you
were to 4X your business go from 12
customers to 300 so let's let's call it
let's say you have 10 customers if you
were to 30X your business then that puts
you at a proportional share of the
market are you with me if there are 10
direct competitors right so in my head
like you live in one of the biggest
cities on the plan Planet you also live
in a city where they're having a lot of
bar mitzvah and weddings I I just
Googled it there like 60,000 weddings a
year in in New York 56,000 marriage
licenses issued I think you need to
approach this differently as if like
your print shop like you're on the cusp
of your print shop 2.0 and not on the
cusp of your print shop 1.0 verse buying
another business altogether I would look
at the 2.0 version of your business as
another opportunity all together
and that opportunity looks like having a

[34:00]
and that opportunity looks like having a
competent person to replace you that
looks like growing your business Maybe
by raising prices Maybe by finding more
customers when it comes to Growing your
business I think there are some uh High
leverage low effort things that you
could do I think you should when you
have that same transparent conversation
with your 12 customers I think you
should offset the awkwardness of a
potential price increase with the
promising aspect of potentially offering
a discount in exchange for some sort of
shared marketing initiative and what I
mean by that is you have a viral
marketing aspect built into your product
because your customers are Distributing
your product to hundreds if not
thousands of people and so maybe you say
hey I'll give you a 10% price break or
20% price break if you distribute my
business card with all of your
invitations or if you let me print like
my logo on the bottom right corner and
maybe they freak out like that'll never

[35:00]
maybe they freak out like that'll never
work because it's yet but maybe they
don't maybe they have price sensitive
customers that wouldn't mind that right
if you're a web designer you're like
listen it's going to be five grand to
make your website or it's going to be
three grand if you can just let me put
my name in the footer that way I get a
backlink and then maybe one day someone
sees it and clicks and I'm able to sell
them a $5,000 website have you ever
tried something like that yes I did I
did that I did it for probably two years
on all the day of thing that we do for
weddings I put my phone number and email
address in Sixpoint font on the back
very small I got one phone call and that
phone call was only to they wanted to
know if they could use a a portion of my
work without paying me anything for it
so that was the only call I got from
that um in two years about it had it's
at least two years and I ask every
single person that comes in or calls or
emails how they found out about me I ask
every single person all Word of Mouth
everything it's all referrals but no one

[36:00]
everything it's all referrals but no one
called me back based on that tried a lot
of things yeah no matter what you try
you you do have to have multiple touch
points right and maybe it's the same
venue like maybe you cold call them 10
times and maybe it's 10 different types
of touch points but if you try that
again by printing your name and number I
would try printing a different number
that you only use for that because if
most of your business is based around
referrals a lot of times leads don't
come back in the door for months or
years right right have you tried using a
different email address or a different
phone number for certain initiative to
track it more directly I haven't tried
that I should try that okay that's one
lever right but you could hop on upwork
and find someone in Argentina that has
just a slight Hispanic accent or it's
like Latin accent and have them start
cold calling events and just very low
pressure hey we're in the area and just
like eight bucks an hour you could have
them doing that 10 hours a day and
sending you a daily report at the end of
the day how many did you talked to how
many people showed interest how many

[37:00]
many people showed interest how many
people said never call me again like you
just you need Hooks In The Water right
like you need a lot more hooks in the
water if you want to grow and if you're
having operational issues with this
business which it sounds like you are
and I do too no judgment then that's
gonna carry you on to the next business
right so it's almost like you have to
you're in this is maybe a bad analogy
you're in kind of a toxic marriage right
now you don't know how to get out of it
but you want to yeah it's really what it
is I tell my wife like I have another
woman it's crazy it's yeah it's really
crazy so you're in this toxic marriage
you're like I need I need a better wife
I need a better woman but you really
need to fix what's going on there and it
might not be your fault but you still
have to confront a head on and then once
you do you're either going to learn you
know what this marriage wasn't toxic I
was just looking at it wrong or you
learn this is toxic and I figured out
how to fix it so I'm going to go into
another marriage and I'm going to be
that prepared like you're not to that
point yet you're just at the toxic point
you need to go get to the point where

[38:01]
you need to go get to the point where
you answer that question for yourself do
I need another business or did I just
fix my business in the process of
getting ready to sell my business and
now I don't even want to sell it right
it's you're just like you're asking the
right question but you're too
early yeah this is what PE basically
everyone's been telling me that you're
saying what everyone else has been
saying like why am I running away from
this like why would I get rid of
something that's making me money
everything that I see is such a big
problem is really very surmount very
surmountable it's not none of the stuff
is insurmountable and I should just I
should just figure it out instead of
running from it but you are figuring it
out right like the fact that we're
talking means you're figuring it out
yeah I've streamlined so many things
part of what's been difficult is it's
been me a lot of my employees majority
of the employees have always been family
my wife my sister-in-law my
mother-in-law worked for me for a little
bit in the beginning and it's hard to
get family if you try to Institute a
process you can't discipline people that
aren't conforming to the process cuz
they're your family so then if they

[39:00]
they're your family so then if they
don't want to do the process they're
just not going to but since my wife left
in November after our sixth kid and my
sister-in-law's has less hours I've been
able to make things very streamlined I
just want to give you a couple more
things okay I want you to make me a
promise that by the end of the day you
will have two posts on upwork one for a
cold caller one for a bookkeeper on
upwork will will cost you 300 bucks a
month and I have a guy I'm working with
already
someone to clean up your books cuzz you
said your books are are ugly and I get
that I've hired vas for everything and
I've had very hit and miss experiences
but when it comes to financial stuff
like binary categorize this or that I've
had a lot of good luck so yeah have a
guy told me what to do like I have a
QuickBooks I just have to classify the
transactions and I set the rules and for
some reason the rules are not
automatically classifying the
transaction I'm not sure why that is I
have to figure out what I'm doing wrong
in that case I would open QuickBooks
start Loom hit Loom and say hey here's
what's going on I'm classifying it it
doesn't I don't know what to do take the

[40:02]
doesn't I don't know what to do take the
that link go to upwork post that in your
job posting and say someone fix this for
me please $50 and it could be fixed by
the end of the day or by the end of the
week I've been in your shoes you're
feeling overwhelmed the only way the
only antidote to that is to take action
and you are we're talking you're doing
it the so like to not to zoom out too
much but you're in the game just stay in
the game just keep caring keep grinding
keep doing what you're doing keep
worrying about this and the answer will
come like the only thing you shouldn't
do is just throw your hands up and watch
Netflix all day right you're you're
getting there the main problem I have is
that I'm working too much on the
day-to-day and not taking care of the
bigger picture things so I've been
trying to work on that the last two
weeks an antidote to that is to do
whatever it takes to this sounds you're
going to you're going to hate this
overwhelm yourself even more try to get
more business because then you will be
forced to find help you will get to that
point where it's I'm literally going to
die if I don't find someone right now
right lean on your email list like how

[41:01]
right lean on your email list like how
often do you send drip marketing
campaigns like how much are top of I
want to do I I thought of that last week
I said why am I not sending a newsletter
at least once a month have to yeah I
need to send a newsletter yeah I try to
to send out emails to my whole list
about seasonal things like holiday items
things like that and I do get a little
bit of a response but not enough once a
week you send them something once a week
an email if I were you I would literally
just write a journal of what you're
doing document what you're doing the
stresses the insecurities the wins the
successes the the picture of something
that you just printed that you're really
proud of and spend 30 minutes on it a
week and email it out to every single
person that you have even if they're not
a customer and it's your Aunt Nedra send
it to everyone and I promise that good
things will come back to you you just
have you're not top of mind for nearly
enough
people yeah okay this is what I want to
hear yeah I was hoping to get advice
about the other business okay okay fine
