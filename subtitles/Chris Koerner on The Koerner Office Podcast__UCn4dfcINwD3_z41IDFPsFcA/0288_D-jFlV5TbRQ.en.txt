America is facing a massive problem
right now and my neighbor Hector is
making $2.5 million a year fixing it
here's what the problem is and how you
can profit from it too there's a massive
shortage of trade workers right now
Plumbing HVAC electrical construction it
and sales and there aren't nearly enough
trade schools to fill this demand what
Hector did was he found a government
grant that provides up to
$155,000 for someone to attend one of
these trade schools so what Hector does
is really smart he doesn't want to start
a trade school or make a big course so
he just buys an HVAC or electrical
course from for $1,000 from someone else
ships them metav VR goggles and the
state government gives him a $15,000
grant for that same course that's what
you're watching in the background
someone taking an HVAC course via
virtual reality this is called White
labeling you take a product or a service
that another company makes you slap your
label on it and you just resell it
