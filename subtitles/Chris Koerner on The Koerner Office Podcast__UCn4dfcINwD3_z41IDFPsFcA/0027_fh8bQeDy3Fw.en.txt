I've invested over $50 million in RV
parks and I think they are the best type
of real estate to invest in for three
reasons number one 10,000 Boomers are
retiring every day and Millennials are
buying RV parks and traveling like never
before and those are the two biggest
Generations number two you can still buy
RV parks at great prices what is a cap
rate it is the net profit of a park
divided by the purchase price they're
still great number three they are a
hedge against the economy when the
economy does great you have more
short-term stays which are more
profitable when the economy tanks you
have more long-term stays because people
have to live in their RVs fulltime I
have nothing to sell you I just love RV
parks follow me for more info like
