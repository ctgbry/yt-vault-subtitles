and it's a platform for launching a paid
community and so we broke down
everything I scraped and if you
subscribe to my newsletter at ker
office.com you can get the scrape I'll
give it away for free it's really
interesting to see what types of groups

communities so we talk about that for a
little bit we talk about more lead
generation business ideas with and
without programmatic SEO we talked lead

[Music]
grandma all right so we've got a friend
of the Pod he doesn't know us but we
know him really well and he goes by
swoll mosy the tank top Titan Hulk mosy
Alex gain train horos bronos the no
strip negotiator the tank top Tyrant I
don't know how you to refer to him but

[01:01]
don't know how you to refer to him but
we strip trip gonna dip dip horos I get
it cut that out Muhammad okay you know
what I didn't have time to look at Chad
gbt like you did all right get the freak
out of
here anyway so for those that don't know
he recently invested in school which is
like a course platform right and it's
interesting because how many things did
he say no to before he invested in that
so he must have seen something here that
we don't see it's cool right I'm sure he
knows what he's doing but I was very
curious Nick I'm a curious man right
don't say
it you have I'm not gonna say it say it
you're by curious okay all right I had
to let you get that
joke I'm not that but I am curious glad
that everyone now recognizes that you
act like oh Nick don't say that but deep
down we know you want it cuz you're a
diry boy aren't you you are so diry for
those that aren't watching on YouTube

[02:01]
those that aren't watching on YouTube
his face didn't change like he was very
good he was locked in but I knew you
wanted to say that so I let you say that
all right keep go anyway so he bought
school and so I was curious so I scraped
every school group I wanted to learn how
much money are these guys making what do
you mean you scraped every school group
I don't know else to say are there
groups public yeah you can see how many
members how much they cost what the name
is I didn't know the Creator is so I put
them all in a spreadsheet how do you
scrape it with the help of uh Pakistani
oh okay say yeah so if anyone wants that
scrape go subscribe to my newsletter at
Kerner office.com okay and I'll send it
to you anyway it's super interesting
because I wanted to see what are the
commonalities between the most
profitable groups okay and it's not
going to surprise you hold on so I'm
sorry I'm sorry yes I'm assuming the
listener feels the same way so you can
scrape it you see it how do you know
that that they're the most
profitable oh because I can see how many
members and how much they charge and I
can multiply okay

[03:00]
can multiply okay
but like most Mr yeah so it is very
unsurprising some of the results and
some of the results are quite surprising
so about
80% of the top 50 groups are all about
either how to get rich or how to look
better or how to get girls are you
surprised by
that how to get rich how to look better
or how to get girls yeah and of those
three categories the 8020 is how to get
rich so like the target demo for school
are I don't know 20 to 34 year old males
yeah that's so funny yeah so but then
the 20% is what was really interesting
the 20% of the top 50 so first of all of
the top 50 Nick I want you to guess what
the mrr is for the top 50 School groups
like on average on average yep and then
guess what the most is I'm going to
$150,000 monthly recurring

[04:00]
$150,000 monthly recurring
Revenue okay and what the most is I
would guess the biggest school group $3
million in mrr okay so this is a little
old I did this a couple months ago so
it's probably changed by now but as of a
couple months ago the average of the top
50 School groups is $53,000 per month
okay and way overshot it and yeah but
you were consistent in your overshooting
the most profitable the most the biggest
is 555,000 ,000 a month and that is
$1,000 month group with 555 people in it
and the name of the group is road map to
100k with your personal brand we have a
friend in the podcast who's on school
that's where his community is I won't
say his name is he in the top
50 I don't know what his name is because
you didn't say it oh I don't know never
mind I'll ask you after this go okay
anyway one thing I found surprising is
the 20 7th biggest group is a jazz

[05:02]
the 20 7th biggest group is a jazz
guitar
accelerator and it's this guy named Mark
a coach Mark Andre who has a YouTube
channel with 72,000 subscribers and this
homeboy is making 55 grand a month by
teaching people how to play jazz guitar
yeah $200 a month and there's about 250
people in it that's crazy did you look
at his website at all jazz guitar yeah
website is jazz guar
lessons. it's AET and he's 55 grand a
month yeah plus YouTube ad Revenue plus
he sells a course and plus he has
another community on a different
platform that I'd never heard of isn't
that incredible I gotta go talk to Jess
she said I'd never make money he's a
musician there's no way I couldn't do
that there's no way I gotta make a call
but seriously though like that is a
profession that pays nothing that can
pay a lot with the internet with good

[06:01]
pay a lot with the internet with good
distribution it's a profession that pays
nothing if you're not in the right
geographies so like their whole industry
that supports the music industry that
are not the famous rock stars you know
Ed Sheeran Coldplay Taylor Swift or
whatever they're Studio musicians
they're people who teach at universities
like in the LA area just it's a massive
industry but if you don't live in LA
yeah what do you do you like offer local
lessons to people like there's not
really the same industry you either have
to be in one of those markets where
there's massive demand for musicians
below just the top tier touring Acts or
else you're not making much money
there's like a big gap here but this guy
like where does this guy live does it
say where he lives I don't even know I
would bet he lives in Middle America
it's GNA be my total guess and if he
lives in La I'm gonna be super but hurt
because it's like the rich get richer
well his name's is he's got kind of a
weird name and so I wouldn't be
surprised if like he's in Europe or
something oh like European yeah okay I
found him on Instagram okay we're going
deep and stalking

[07:00]
deep and stalking
uh he's in Quebec he's in Quebec oh he's
in Quebec yeah okay okay neighbors to
the north okay so I love it anyway I
love it yeah okay you don't need to be a
jazz guitar teacher to make money here
but what's stopping anyone from
approaching music teachers and saying
hey let me help you build a community
and take like you're like an agent to a
music teacher right I'm going to take 20
30% of everything you make and I'm going
to reverse engineer what Mark Andre did
I'm going to go back back and look at
his first YouTube videos I'm going to go
to the web Archive of his website jazz
guitar lessons. and I'm going to reverse
engineer it and I'm going to do that for
you I'll do all the work and I'm gonna
take 30% or 50% what's interesting is
like how many years into the internet
are we 30 years like 30 years of it
being main somewhat mainstream
right and we're still
finding use cases that they didn't even
think of 30 years ago like school is the
technology really that different than it

[08:01]
technology really that different than it
was let's say even 20 years
ago no but but this is new like people
getting on school and creating
communities that allow them to make a
living to teach other people how to do
their craft that's a new thing like
that's not something that's been around
for 30 plus years and and you see like
school is exploding like hosi is just
the latest investor and a series of
investors this is going to be a billion
dollar plus company because it
facilitates learning at scale within
communities but it like it just boggles
my mind 30 years in we're still finding
original use cases to the internet this
isn't mobile this isn't apps this isn't
web 3.0 like where we're talking about
crypto this isn't even AI this is like
the original freaking internet providing
this level of opportunity to people it's
crazy I know I was just listening to a
podcast with the founder of Groupon and
his first hustle was like in the late
90s early 2000s and it was making
websites for restaurants and he started

[09:01]
websites for restaurants and he started
it and he found a little success but
then his roommate slri started doing it
or he heard about someone else that was
doing it and he literally
thought great and he quit it because he
thought it's taken my idea is taken
making websites for businesses and it's
like today 30 years later you can still
make a lot of money making websites for
businesses in 30 years there will be a
zillion more AI tools that do that with
one click and some human will still make
a lot of money building websites for
businesses this is totally different but
it's like oil a hundred years ago you
just went kind of anywhere guested found
some oil and pumped it out of the ground
and it was super easy right but it's
gotten harder and harder and technology
has evolved over time and then I don't
know 20 10 years ago fracking gets
discovered like it's not the same I just
dig one hole and I pump oil out it's I
dig a hole and then it sort of disperses
and I'm able to draw a ton more oil per
square foot or per square mile out of a

[10:01]
square foot or per square mile out of a
field than I otherwise would have using
traditional methods but you're still
doing the same thing right you're still
pumping oil out of the ground but
they've done it in an economical way
like that's how I kind of view the
internet like in the beginning it was
just an oil rush like oh there's oil
here I can just get anything that I can
let's bring book resellers online Amazon
let's take music and bring it online or
videos and bring it online YouTube but
now we're getting to the point where
it's just continuing to Niche down and
Community I think is one of those things
where it's still an unexploited
opportunity for people on the internet
yeah and it just goes to show that as
long as we're inventing things we will
never run out of new innovative ideas
business ideas or otherwise like a lot
of people have said oh well all the good
ideas are taken like that might become
true if we stop innovating
altogether but as long as there's new
technology there's new ideas around that
technology yeah agreed can I hop to an
idea not yet I just want to say a funny
thing about one of these School groups
little anecdote

[11:01]
little anecdote
so like basically half of these groups
are how to get rich right or more of
them for sure and there's one called
your journey to zero to $10,000 a month
starts here and this is a couple months
old right okay and the Creator he got
100 paying members to pay 150 a month
which is 15 grand a month and the group
no longer exists so it's like one person
did it and he quit he
[Laughter]
dropped so good speaking of horos have
you seen the meme where it's like the
random 20-year-old sends you a text
would you be opposed to me generating
hundreds of leads for your business for
free right like because everybody reads
hundred million doll lead leads or
hundred million dollar deals and like
that's one of the things that horoi says
basically is like give away your
services for free and then like
eventually you'll be able to charge for
them but you need to get some reps under
your belt Etc all right if you are
watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on

[12:00]
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there setting this up for the audience
can you explain what a lead magnet is a
lead magnet is like a landing page or
something an offer like a PDF something
enticing that makes people want to give
you their info they're lead here are
some examples of lead magnets there are
calculators that you can do online right
I wonder what my business is worth okay
Google what is my business worth here's
a business valuation calculator and then
you enter in here's my Revenue here's my
profit here's how many employees I have
here's how fast I'm growing and it spits
out a valuation but in order to get that
valuation you get the email there are
white papers or ebooks you Google how do
I start a tree trimming business and
then all of a sudden there's an ebook or
a white paper that you get like lead
magnets are nothing new right but it's
surprising to me how many businesses
still do not use lead magnets they may

[13:02]
still do not use lead magnets they may
use things like pay-per-click ads right
they're paying Google or they're paying
Facebook to rank higher in search or to
show up in someone's feed they may be
doing things like SEO search engine
optimization where they're paying
somebody to create content for them or
to optimize their website Etc but easy
things like a lead magnet I don't see a
lot of local businesses doing a lot of
digital businesses I see doing but I
don't see a lot of local businesses
doing so I think this is like the
perfect idea for somebody who either
wants the side hustle or who is like
trying to get into entrepreneurship and
I think there are like one of two routes
I'd love to hear you build on this
option one is you find one business that
you really like and you build one Great
lead magnet and you then go out and sell
it to a hundred of those types of
businesses right so like you and I we
did the tree trimming course we're like
hey how to build a tree trimming
business and and we now have this white

[14:00]
business and and we now have this white
paper or this ebook and we go to 50 tree
triming businesses and we say hey we've
built this lead magnet would you like to
buy it from us and you can put it on
your website for free and you can pitch
them and say let me track the conversion
I want to see how many clicks this link
gets I want to see how many emails you
get like we'll track this together and
then we can assign a value to it on the
back end or you can assign a value to it
up front that's a one cookie cutter sell
it to a bunch of people the other option
could be you just called Contact a lot
of local
businesses um show them the data on how
important lead magnets are in order to
generate more leads and then offer to
build them a lead magnet for free you
then charge either a percentage or a per
lead fee on the back end once it's
implemented so I go to my I don't know
local Gardener or I go to my local
Soccer Shop and I'm like hey I want to
figure out a a lead magnet for you and
so you sit down you work with them and
you come up with this lead maget can be
a survey a quiz a calculator whatever it
is so I think those are like two options
that somebody could take but I think

[15:01]
that somebody could take but I think
especially as local search is becoming
more and more important helping local
businesses with just that one Niche
right you don't have to be a marketing
agency to everybody you're just one
thing I'm going to do lead magnets for
these businesses could be a really
really cool thing what do you think I
like it I think High ticket would be
better because the value of every
lead should be worth a lot more right
it's going to be an easier sale like you
got a land if you were to do it you
would focus on high ticket service so
like not Landscaping but like foundation
repair where it's like a ebook free
guide of how to know if your foundation
needs fixing I actually made when I
partnered with Ed to do a custom home
building business I spent like 12 hours
making an ebook of like how to pick a
custom home builder because I picked a
custom home builder once and there was a
I'm cheap right and there's so there's a
lot of nuances and we interviewed a lot
of them and there's a lot of questions
you want to ask and so this was our lead
magnet to find people that want want to
use us as a custom home builder it took

[16:01]
use us as a custom home builder it took
forever but it was really high quality
like I probably could have sold it as in
fact I'm just giving me myself the idea
I should probably sell that as like an
Amazon book dude totally could sell it
like an I already have I never even used
it like we never launched dude and think
about optimizing I love how we're going
on rabbit hole on this you could easily
optimize search for that you could
easily rank for it right like you could
find it dude that would be such an easy
category too for you to go onto like a
lot of people do this in Amazon where
they're like I'm an Amazon besteller and
it's like the C in the category was like
hack it yeah you know yeah cat toys or
something you know like I don't even
know I think that'd be yeah I think
that'd be a really good idea so I like
it I think the struggle here is
convincing the people not that they need
a lead magnet because they might see the
value in that but convincing them or
teaching them how to actually use the
leads because if they're going to be
paying for the lead Magnet or for the
leads you got to get them to change
their behavior from then on out and if
it's a 62-year-old roofing business

[17:00]
it's a 62-year-old roofing business
owner he's probably pretty set in his
ways you know so I thought about this
Okay the reason I like this business I
wouldn't want to do this business but I
think somebody who's like starting out
and they want to get into this space
it'd be a great opportunity for them to
meet a bunch of different businesses and
create lead magnets right and just
understand how to implement it because
it's trackable you can actually see
who's clicking on it you can get
people's emails it's fun too yeah
because it's like the instant dopamine
hit right it's like oh I got it ding I
got an email oh I can't wait to see like
what they actually filled out but for me
that's where step two comes in right
like you start capturing all these leads
and you stay consistent with the
business owner and you review that and
you're like hey this month we generated
10 leads but only two of them converted
or you sit down with them and ask them
what was the conversion like because you
don't necessarily know who converts to a
customer you just know what happened to
the leads and then you have an
opportunity for those business owners
who aren't converting well to talk to
them it's like hey you know in your
industry you should be converting like
80% of these and you're only converting
20% what does your sales process look
like after the leads leads come in well

[18:01]
like after the leads leads come in well
they sit in my inbox and then Marie
looks at them she and usually she sends
an email to response but honestly she's
just been sending cat pictures to them
on accident you know like you know what
I mean yeah you get your foot in the
door with that business owner and it's
the typical Venture saying of land and
expand right like you you offer one
offering and then you're able to offer
expand those offerings with those
business owners if the leads are not
converting and if the leads are
converting great you can go find other
customers who are just going to pay for
the leads and then you can implement the
sales on the back end as well but I
think in particular for people who want
to get into this space it's a really
good foot in the door and opportunity
for them to expand Services as they
continue to grow so that's my answer to
your objection yeah it reminds me to
your podcast interview with Maddie mlan
because he did this with bariatric
surgery centers and I think people
should do the same strategy with this
where they should pick one Niche one
high ticket Niche because you're getting
your foot in the door by saying hey
here's a lead magnet you can frame your

[19:01]
here's a lead magnet you can frame your
offer as a consultant for the industry
and that might be a lot more enticing to
a 62y old Roofing a business owner
because he knows what the young guys are
doing he sees what their competitors are
doing he probably has some fomo so if
you go in the door and say hey like I'm
only going to charge you based on every
lead I bring in but like I'm worth $600
an hour to you because I know what
everyone in this industry is doing right
now I think the application of that's
super interesting you could have it's
like one of two people number one could
be the industry expert like me I work at
home health and hospice for the last 10
years and I want to be an entrepreneur
and I'm trying to figure it out cool I
could Target home health and hospice
agencies with a lead magnet offering
just to get my feet wet and understand
how to grow a digital agency let's say
but I'm coming from a place of expertise
like I know their industry and I can
offer it I'd say the other end of the
section would be the 23-year-old who's
maybe they just graduated college or
maybe they're just getting exposed to
the stuff I would probably pick the
between five and 10 Industries test it

[20:02]
between five and 10 Industries test it
to see where you get the best response
and then Niche down on one I wouldn't
necessarily Niche down too early a you
don't have a skill set yet and B you
don't know which one of those is going
to kind of take off but once you find
the one that's actually paying off the
most then I would like kind of forget
everything else and double down on that
one you know who does lead magnets the
very best it's like a SAS tool for
instance when I first started the
podcast I was trying to figure out how
to edit something I looked for these
free tools because I'm cheap I didn't
want to pay anything like web enabled
video editing tool you're not cheap
you're Frugal Chris thank you Mom thank
Nick these tools are so good because
they'll let you edit the entire video
they'll do every you'll go through all
this and then at the end it's like okay
that's $49 please it's like what you
can't exp until you pay 40 oh it's so so
good it's strategically introduced

[21:00]
good it's strategically introduced
friction and it's like a bait and switch
in a way and it's the sunk cost fallacy
right I already did all this I spent all
the time editing this video now I have
to pay the $49 and most people do for
people who don't know like marketing
stuff is new for me I've like bought and
sold businesses and operated existing
businesses the growth hacking just has
not been my tool set that's your tool
set right and so what I'm about to say
you might roll your eyes at but
strategically introducing friction is
freaking that just hit me like a ton of
bricks because we've been talking a lot
about friction recently I was like we
don't want friction we want as many
leads as possible we're trying to reduce
friction because friction means less
sales but like flipping that on its head
strategically introduced friction
probably also in can increase sales like
the inverse of that can also be true it
like did I just stumble on something
that is known by everybody or is that no
I don't I like I coined strategically
introduce friction other people call it
other things I wrote a whole newsletter

[22:01]
other things I wrote a whole newsletter
on it a while ago I'm obsessed with the
concept of friction we've been talking
to a mutual friend about me writing a
book and I have like a whole chapter on
friction both using it and avoiding it
in certain instances so when I lost
weight if I walked out in the kitchen
and I was going to the office I have to
walk by the kitchen island and if my
wife had a plate of warm cookies right
there I was for sure going to eat three
of them right whereas if I'm still
craving cookies and I walk by the same
island or there's no cookies and Jesse's
like hey crumble is giving out free
cookies and it's a 5-minute drive I'm
not going I'm not going to make that
drive I'm not going to eat those cookies
because there's friction so it's like
when I lost weight I had to
strategically introduce friction so I
didn't eat those bad things what you're
talking about is why I like this idea of
just starting with the lead magnet is
because in the process of understanding
how to craft a lead magnet create it
place it track the data you're going to
learn stuff like this you're going to
learn about friction and you know
introducing strategic friction and
reducing as much friction as possible

[23:00]
reducing as much friction as possible
like these are just things you don't
know or and they definitely don't teach
you in school like we both got our mbas
they're not sitting there there isn't
like friction 101 I learned about
friction in my undergrad
though but like there isn't there isn't
sorry sorry there isn't friction you
know 101 like how to reduce friction in
the sales process that it's just not a
thing but anybody who's actually gone
boots on the ground and done this stuff
and is a practitioner they know what the
best tools are they know the strategies
they know what works and what doesn't so
yeah I think this is a really good idea
to just get your feet wet and then
expand from there yeah this is the type
of stuff we're talking about with
perfume vending and with the form right
removing friction the people that do
this the best are like the those online
IQ tests you can take or personality
quizzes you go to the landing page and
it will ask you the first question they
don't need your name your email or
anything you'll spend 30 minutes filling
it out and then they get your email at
the end and you better believe that like

[24:00]
the end and you better believe that like
99.9% of people that get to that put in
their email because that's how they see
the results totally it's genius yeah I
love it while we're talking about lead
magnets I got a little segment flows
right into it you
ready lead
magnets we I've talked about
programmatic SEO a few times over the
last few months on this podcast and we
have a stealth project right now that is
programmatic SEO and it's going very
well and it's a lot of fun and for those
that are just tuning in programmatic SEO
is programmatically creating thousands
or tens of thousands of landing pages
specific to uh a market a thing a a
problem to be solved so you can
organically rank for 1 to 10% of those
10,000 landing pages it's super cool and
we've actually kind of on the side
without announcing anything we're doing
agency work for other people wanting to
launch programmatic websites right
programmatic websites are expensive from
an agency perspective five to 15 grand
but the margin is high the cost of

[25:00]
but the margin is high the cost of
Performing the service is not very high
so Nick I want you I've talked about
introducing programmatic SEO to like
Searchers right so or people looking to
buy a franchise they're going to buy a
$300,000 franchise why don't you say hey
here's a lead gen business it's not
really a business it's just a website
but we're already getting leads it's 20
grand and you just got to go find buyers
for these leads because the leads are
already coming in organically you want
to push paid ads spend behind it you're
going to get even a lot more it's like
huh I can spend 300 Grand to buy a
roofing franchise or I can spend 20
grand to buy a Le generation business
AKA a programmatic website okay I talked
about that a couple weeks ago let me ask
some questions clarify questions both
for me and the audience when you say
programmatic SEO I know what SEO means
search engine
optimization we're either optimizing a
website's flow and or adding content to
that website because the more content
the more backlinks the the higher that

[26:00]
the more backlinks the the higher that
Google will rank you organically when
somebody search searches for something
that your a product that your company
provides product or service okay so I
get the SEO part what does the
programmatic mean does it like is it
automatically generating using
artificial intelligence is it we've
created a template and we're just like
copying and pasting it a hundred times
over help me understand a little bit
better like the programmatic part of SEO
so picture a Google sheet a bunch of
columns one column has the top 10,000
cities in the United States by
population the other column has a
keyword such as Grill cleaning grill
replacement grill removal or whatever so
it's like a keyword that is highly
searched preferably with low competition
for people bidding on the keyword
another column has a city state and
another column has a fun fact about that
City the programmatic part is clicking a
button and having an automation not even
AI something like zapier put all those

[27:02]
AI something like zapier put all those
things together to create a landing page
with a lead magnet with a form on the
landing page so if there is no company
cleaning grills in Clarksville Tennessee
you're probably going to rank first
eventually because there's no
competition for so it's just a shotgun
approach you'll never rank for 90% of
these landing pages and for 10% of them
you're rank quite High okay and so you
want to have programmatic SEO for
services that aren't necessarily
geographically constrained so for
example what was the company that we
wanted to start was it the kitchen
cleaning soap that we wanted to sell
wholesale de Greaser yeah de Greaser
okay so if we wanted to start that
company we would use programmatic SEO
because it doesn't matter where our
customers are but what does matter is
their local like if I'm in Clarksville
Tennessee and I'm searching for
Degreaser I want to be able to R rank
organically in Clarksville Tennessee it
doesn't have to be tied to a geography
it could also be tied for

[28:01]
it could also be tied for
instance how much do graphic designers
make that graduated from Cornell right
insert every University name insert
every University name insert every job
and you've got thousands and thousands
of landing pages that will rank like it
so it doesn't have to be tied to a
geography or service it could be a
product or a service or like how much do
Bay Area engineers make make how much do
Minneapolis engineers make so there's a
zillion ways you could do it let's say
in in the example brokerage somebody
wants to start a brokerage we would
build out a programmatic SEO campaign I
don't even know what to call it that was
just focused on generating organic leads
for people who want to sell their
business right for owners who are like
how do I sell my business on Google we
would rank early there would be a lead
magnet they would fill out that lead
magnet we would take those leads and
then we would then talk to a Searcher
and say hey look we've got this
brokerage lead gen company the leads are
there we don't have anybody to actually
go and run down these leads do you want

[29:00]
go and run down these leads do you want
to take this and run with it is that
kind of what you're saying yeah for
here's an example there you could go to
bis by sell you could scrape every
single business broker they have you
could put their name and their location
in columns in a Google sheet and then
you could programmatically generate
thousands of landing pages that says
best business broker in Minneapolis in
Orlando in Tampa and then you could just
list them out like everyone in Tampa
that you scraped you could just list on
that website with a lead magnet all the
leads come to you and then once you get
a lead for a business broker in Tampa
Florida then you can programmatically if
you want you don't have to reach out to
that exact business broker because you
have their email from when you scraped
it and say hey I have a guy that owns a
plumbing business in Tampa that wants to
sell how much do you want to pay for
this lead or do you want to give me 25%
of your commission for this lead so are
you thinking that this would be
something sorry I think there's two
things here but like you said we could
do this and then hand it off to somebody
are you thinking this would be like a
business in a box where we're like hey
searcher I know you've been looking for
a business you haven't closed on it yet

[30:00]
a business you haven't closed on it yet
you know the process of talking to
Sellers and working with Brokers so you
might like this idea that we have buy it
from us or is it like a REV share
agreement where we're sharing Equity
with them like what would it look like
for the business relationship on a
different podcast I talked about
offering this as an alternative to
buying a business to like a Searcher or
someone right and it's a lead gen
business like we're doing with our
stealth project right where you can say
hey what we're giving you today is like
it's kind of the equivalent of this is a
good analogy of instead of starting a
restaurant from scratch you're leasing
um a building that has all the
restaurant equipment all the chairs
everything there you still got to bring
customers in the door you still got to
cook the food but instead of paying 500
Grand to buy all the stuff and build it
all almost like a ghost kitchen that you
can rent the space out well kind of but
instead of like taking an empty shell of
a building and turning into a restaurant
you can just rent like this old old
restaurant pizza restaurant just failed

[31:00]
restaurant pizza restaurant just failed
just be our new tenant you could use all
of his equipment right so you still got
to do the hard part but you're going to
save 90% going into it you got to do the
hard part in either scenario what do you
think are the best types of businesses
to do this with are they products are
they services are they geographically
constrained are they you know things
that don't matter with geography like
how would you think about the types of
businesses you would apply the
programmatic SEO to okay my preference I
don't know if it's the best but it's
what my preference
Geographic service businesses our friend
Sam Thompson built out a programmatic
site for a company that was delivering
alcohol and they did it by neighborhood
because they had to go state to state
until they got regulatory approval so
they'd go into Dallas and the okay
oakcliff Highland Park Preston Hollow
and that's how they drove a ton of their
business just free organically I haven't
even gotten to the ultimate idea yet
sorry sorry that's okay it's okay we got
ADHD both of us so mostly you but I do a
little bit
so the idea here is instead of offering

[32:01]
so the idea here is instead of offering
it as a business for sale you could find
a company a midsize to large company
that could use programmatic okay that
could be a buyer for this and let's say
a Searcher might pay 20 grand for this
but if you go to a company like let's
say Baker Brothers you heard of Baker
Brothers they're like a plumbing compan
they're like two or three hundred
million do plumbing business really big
right okay and so you spend the time UPF
front to build out a programmatic
website for Baker Brothers and then you
approach them you get the CEO on the
phone somehow and say I want to sell
this to you like I guarantee you it will
bring in x amount of New Leads per month
or per week I've already built it it's
done it's branded for you and if they
don't buy it you could basically do a
find and replace Baker Brothers with the
person you end up selling it to and so
well how much is it what's 100 Grand so
it's the same amount of work the same
product but you you've already built it
and you're selling it to someone that

[33:00]
and you're selling it to someone that
you know could afford it and so the
price is different the framing is
different and the value to that end
buyer is different because he has so
many locations where he can serve all
these end user customers that make sense
yeah and it's almost like you could say
all right I'm going to do this for the
western United States right I'm not
going to do it for the whole United
States I'm going do it for the West who
are the top five largest plumbing
companies in the Western United States
and then you you just Target them and
you create you could create kind of like
a bidding war right like show them hey
this is how many leads I'm getting per
week you know Harmon Brothers says that
they're willing to pay I don't know
$20,000 and the Johnson team I'm
terrible with like Plumbing names
they're all like Brothers Mario the
Luigi brothers the Mario brothers are
willing to pay $50,000 what's your offer
it just introduces the competitive
bidding Dynamic to that service and it
kind of Dr risks you spending the time
to build it out
that's
interesting and if no one buys it now

[34:01]
interesting and if no one buys it now
you have a plumbing lead gen
business and you can just sell leads to
these same companies a lead to you is
worth like $20 right let's say a
plumbing company will pay $20 for your
lead okay but if that plumbing to that
plumbing company if they were vertically
integrated and own the programmatic
website it's worth like $900 because
that could be the lifetime value of Any
Given customer yeah that's interesting
so it's a dual prong approach if let's
say that you offer it and all of them
only offer like 10 grand for it and
you're like nah no this is worth 50
Grand then it's like cool if you don't
want to buy it or you can't afford it
would you be one of my partners in these
leads like in servicing these leads
right so it's like okay yeah my main
goal is to sell it and just be done with
it but if I can't sell it for what I
want to sell it for cool we'll just have
an affiliate relationship where then
I'll send you the leads and the first
person to respond to the lead gets the
lead and you pay me on a pro lead basis
that der risks it even more and you know
what's even more genius about this that
I hadn't thought of oh let's say you go

[35:01]
I hadn't thought of oh let's say you go
to the the baker brothers and you're say
100 Grand what are it's a website and
it's like they're like well dude we
could pay our developer five grand to to
copy this it's like yeah you could but
that means there will be two of them and
you're going to competing with one other
person in all these far-flung markets
which will reduce the effectiveness of
all these leads both for me and you I
don't really care I don't have a
plumbing business
what you can copy is not going to be as
good as what I'm offering you isn't that
smart yeah that is smart yeah it's a
very very interesting value
proposition yeah so there's so many
things you could do it's like you could
copy this okay I don't care I'll sell
this to your competitor or you could
just buy all my leads okay anytime I get
a lead that's in these four states that
you have a territory in I'll sell them
to you for 20 bucks a piece or you can
buy it to me today for 100 grand and
then pay me $1,000 dollar a month to fix
things as they break it seems like a
no-brainer for me when you consider the

[36:01]
no-brainer for me when you consider the
local importance of search moving
forward is a no-brainer did you say
local see see seor it's like local
search we got to buy that website locco
search I know I know okay if it seems
like I cut you off early part two will
be a week from today well we'll see you
then
