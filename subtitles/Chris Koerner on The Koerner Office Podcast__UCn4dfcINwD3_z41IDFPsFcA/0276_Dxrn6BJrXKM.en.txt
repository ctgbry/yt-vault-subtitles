you guys have to see what I found so
this couple made a pallet bar for their
wedding cuz they were too cheap to buy
one it took them about 3 hours they
spent about $ 20 to $30 in stain and
screws and they got the pallets for free
from Facebook Marketplace look at all
these free pallets on Facebook
Marketplace anywhere you live they're
free and look at here I'm seeing pallet
bars listed on Facebook Marketplace for
$350 to $500 free materials plus 2 to 3
hours of work plus $350 to $500 yeah
that's a pretty good hourly rate oh but
what if no one buys it then post a
picture of someone else's right now for
$400 when someone buys it then you go
build it and sell it sell it before you
have it
