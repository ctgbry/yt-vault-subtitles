okay picture this in your head real
quick I walk up to John McAfee's door
yes that John McAfee yes the one accused
of
murder Palms Trembling Hands sweating
and I knocked and I was about to ask him
to be my business partner in a crypto
project 6 months later we had a $30
million crypto project that is the story
that I want to tell you to today and I
think you will find it interesting why
do I think that cuz my mom does and my
mom just doesn't miss Buckle in you're
going to love this story it's one of my
favorites and share it with your
[Music]
friends here is the story so when I was
s years ago
2017 the fall of 2017 I had been in
crypto for about a year and a half

[01:00]
crypto for about a year and a half
I first bought Bitcoin around
$600 and I was just a Speculator I was
trying to get rich like everyone in
crypto and the fall of 2017 I had a
thesis and that thesis was there are no
fundamentals in these tokens
specifically altcoins and if you're not
familiar an altcoin is any
cryptocurrency outside of Bitcoin and
ethereum so I thought huh how can we
predict the price of these altcoins on
Reddit and Twitter everyone always goes
nuts for they're always talking about
them and or they're not talking about
them so there's this website called
coinmarketcap.com that will tell you the
market cap of every coin hence the name
and then I was able to find out what the
hype level was of a specific
cryptocurrency and I used an API for
this and I took all this data and I put
it together in a Google sheet so I
actually I'll tell you where I got all
the data from I got the API from a site

[02:00]
the data from I got the API from a site
called crypto compare and they had their
own kind of hype score I took that and
altered it a little bit to fit my needs
I imported that to a Google sheet and
then I took the market cap of all these
altcoins over a thousand of them and I
put it in that Google sheet and then I
divided the two numbers against each
other and when I say I I really got a
ton of help from my friend Brian when I
say a ton of help he basically managed
all the smart parts of this process
whereas I was just like oo money go up
money go down me want more money Brian
was really the smart guy behind all
these apis and math etc etc and then I
was just the guy pitching it anyway I
wanted to give Brian a fair shape
because he's a good friend so Brian and
I put these altcoins together in a
Google sheet and we sorted them in
groups of 100 so one through 100 was
Bitcoin first by market cap then
ethereum and then 3 through 100 whatever
they were at the time and then 200
through through 300 300 through 400 and

[03:01]
through through 300 300 through 400 and
so on and so forth and so we got all
this together and then we started
watching them and so the thesis was this
if a crypto had a very high market cap
but very few people were talking about
it then we predicted that it would go
down in value whereas if a crypto had a
low market cap maybe it was brand new
maybe just no one was talking about it
and everyone was talking about it then
the price of the crypto currency had not
yet caught up to the hype
okay that was a thesis so we put this
together and then we started watching it
and I even started investing money in it
and it worked period atend end of the
day it worked and I was very excited at
this because I thought man I found Alpha
I found an edge in the market that no
one else can find so I need to get this
out in the world but hey one problem I
was a nobody I didn't have any following
I was not an influencer I had 200
Twitter followers if that and this isn't
something you can push paid ads to
because Google and Facebook at the time

[04:01]
because Google and Facebook at the time
hated uh crypto and so I needed a
partner with someone that had a crypto
audience and at the time that guy was
John McAfee he was by far the biggest
crypto influencer on Twitter and he had
8 or 900,000 Twitter followers but
here's a problem with John McAfee he
doesn't want to be found hence mcafe
security he's very secure and he's kind
of psycho and he's dead now as we all
know so I started looking for his email
address and I usually have no problem
with this I've cold email Mark Cuban you
name it I've cold emailed half the world
basically and it's not hard finding
theirs or yours or my email address for
that matter McAfee was hard I just had
to start guessing it John mca.com JM
mca.com J McAfee John M like I tried all
of them and I used software to tell me
if these emails were open or not but my
software wasn't even activated because
most of these emails just kept bouncing
back until it didn't I don't remember
which one it was but one day uh I Got a

[05:00]
which one it was but one day uh I Got a
notification that my email Not only was
not bounced back but that it had been
opened so this was big I was excited but
he didn't answer so I kept following up
over and over to that same email until
finally John McAfee himself responded
and he responded from a like a forwarded
email and I'm going to try to put some
pictures or screenshots up of these
emails because I still have them saved
on my phone so if you're watching on
YouTube you should see them but
he responded from a forwarded email it
was like Johnny Be Good 77224 yahoo.com
or something and he said something to
the effect of and you you'll be able to
see the screenshot exactly what he said
I don't believe you this is stupid
everyone pitches me the same thing
you're no different you're not special I
don't believe you this won't work so I
kept persistently following up till
finally he said even if God himself told
me that this works I would not believe
him and I said John let me me show you

[06:00]
him and I said John let me me show you
in person okay cuz I knew or at least I
thought that if I could get him in a
room just the personal aspect and this
is just a good business tip if you ever
have a big partnership or a big deal or
something fly across the country and get
in front of that person because it is
worth it and it makes all the difference
in the world you're there you're showing
initiative it's harder to say no to
someone's face than a call or an email
or even a zoom it's just a million times
better and so I knew that if I could get
this in front of him I could convince
him and it did work it worked I was
making money on this and I wanted other
people to make money on it too and so
finally he said Chris I believe it was
February 28th or February 29th he said
February 28th show up at my house it's
in Lexington Tennessee show up at 1:23
p.m. and I will hear your pitch but if
it does not work I will kick you out of
my house I was like you got it let's go
and and so Lexington Tennessee was a

[07:01]
and and so Lexington Tennessee was a
couple hours from Huntsville Alabama
where I had good friends at the time and
I flew to Huntsville and I stayed with
them and I told him the story and that
morning the next morning I had uh
breakfast with a mentor of mine and he
loved the story and I still didn't have
John's email he was paranoid about
sharing his address with some Rando
which yeah I can understand that and so
I just started driving toward Lexington
and I emailed him and I said John I'm
coming as promised here I come let's go
and he didn't didn't respond I just kept
driving checking my email nothing
checking checking nothing finally
probably around I don't know 12:50 1:00
he responded and he said here's my
address and so I pulled up to his house
around
1:15 I wasn't about to be late and it
was so funny it was such a funny house
because he lived in a very typical
Southern neighborhood I grew up in the
South so it looked like any other
soummer neighborhood not super wealthy
but not middle class definitely upper
middle class

[08:00]
middle class
red brick houses the standard southern
style home but he had a Spanish style
home of course he did he's very
different he stands out he had a Spanish
style home and he had a bunch of cars in
his driveway there was a yellow Hummer
there was a beat up Nissan Ultima there
was a truck there were cars out in the
street and I just knew man this guy's
HOA must hate him this is John MC's
house and I was nervous I was sitting in
like a like a Toyota yurus or something
parked right out front walked up hands
trembling knocked on the door and he
opened he himself opened and I was like
John how are you and he just looked at
me who is this peasant hey is Chris
kerer what I'm the guy that was going to
show you those alt coin
picks he just he was stressed out he was
flustered annoyed his wife Janice came
to the door she seemed very pleasant and
and she said what's going on he oh it's
this guy from he emailed me he says he

[09:02]
this guy from he emailed me he says he
has this stupid altcoin predictor
algorithm I don't believe him it doesn't
work but I I I told him I'd give him a
shots Chris come on in we're about to go
to the liquor store I was like oh okay
so I I get rushed in and I'll never
forget what I see I see bodyguards I see
guns I see
AR-15s I see cameramen I see a boom mic
people running here and that okay this
is what I saw you've seen Home Alone the
original version you know the night
before they're going to Paris in the
beginning all the cousins and all the
aunts and uncles are there and they're
all running around the house crazy
that's what his house looked like it was
Kevin McAllister's House John mcab style
and so he escorted me to the kitchen he
said do you want a drink I said I'm good
the countertop was littered with alcohol
and I I'll put a picture in the video so
you can see there was no room for food
on the countertops it was all alcohol
and so he sat me down at the breakfast
nook a small dining room table right off

[10:00]
nook a small dining room table right off
the kitchen and as soon as he was there
he was gone and the camera crew followed
him and all he said was go to the liquor
store and the bank and that they'd be
back and as soon as I get there it's
just quiet I'm just sitting there and I
I thought at the time that I was there
alone which weirded me out so I'm
sitting there and I I took a video I'll
include this as well I took a video and
some pictures and I texted my wife I
said here's my address I love you in
case I don't um case you don't hear from
me again cuz as you may know John was
accused of murder in Central America and
he he probably did it can't sue me
because he's dead but that's my guess
but who knows who knows and so I'm
sitting there and I'm just thinking
there are hard drives all over this
glass table and I'm thinking like what
is going on why did he put me in his
house alone with these hard drives it's
they're probably full of cryptocurrency
when he's like the most secure dude on
Earth so I was just looking around weird
and then I heard like cough like that

[11:01]
and then I heard like cough like that
and I thought huh I guess I'm not here
alone and so stand up take a right go
around the corner and there is uh Jimmy
Watson Jimmy was his like main bodyguard
listen guys I don't do ads ads are dumb
you hate ads I hate ads all I ask is
that you subscribe and like this that's
it that's it and maybe share with a
friend okay I'm done Jimmy was his like
main bodyguard sitting at the table on a
MacBook and he's hey man hey who are you
what are you doing here he was pretty
nice and I was like hey I'm Chris ker I
have this kind of algorithm he's oh yeah
I think I heard about you yeah I have a
seat man super chill and we just start
talking he's tell me what your thing
does so I open up my computer and I show
it to him it's all right right there in
Google Sheets and he's okay okay and he
how does it work okay and I spent about
half hour and finally oh so it like
predicts the altcoin prices because if
everyone's talking about it but there's
a low market cap then it's about to go
up in value if no one's talking about it
and it's a high Market market cap like
Ripple or something then it's going to

[12:02]
Ripple or something then it's going to
go down value I was like exactly oh this
is good oh Mr McAfee will like this yeah
Mr mcafe is going to like this a lot
awesome hey like whatever good word you
could put in I really appreciate it
because I think I need it yeah no
problem no problem so we're sitting
there just browing down and then they
all come back in and it was an
Australian film crew and it's basically
like the 60 Minutes of Australia and
they were filming a documentary U that
never aired by the way I looked it up on
YouTube and there's the trailer for it
but it never aired and I don't know if
it's cuz crypto crashed and so they
didn't want to air it when crypto wasn't
caught anymore but it's a bummer because
they ended up filming me and so they all
come back in and John's oh yeah he's
just so annoyed to see me and he's okay
yeah Chris what do you got all right so
we're sitting at the other table now a
bigger table right outside the kitchen
like what you got so I open up my
MacBook I'm like all right John got
these altcoins there's no fundamentals
unlike stocks I just think that if
there's a cryptocurrency with a high
market cap and no one's talking about it

[13:01]
market cap and no one's talking about it
then it's going to go down in value and
if there's cryptocurrency with a low
market cap and everyone's talking about
it it's going to go up in value what's
the time frame exactly I don't really
know yet but this works I've been
putting my money into it and it works
and just immediately he probably cut me
off in sentence and I'll never forget
his words is Chris this is brilliant
you're brilliant he called me brilliant
I felt so good about myself he's of
course this works this is of course it
works surely people people are doing
this this is so obvious why Haven I ever
thought of this of course it works is no
one doing this I was like no if they do
I if they are I don't know about it and
he's yeah okay and it like his whole
demeanor changed and suddenly I just had
his respect it just everything changed
from that moment on Chris what do you
need for me what can I do for you Johan
I want you to tweet about this regularly
and I'll give you a cut of the profits
how much 25% done I don't remember he
could have negotiated I don't remember
honestly I don't think he did and we

[14:01]
honestly I don't think he did and we
shook hands and he tell me just tell me
what you need to do and I'm happy to
help anything you need I like okay so
that was it and then from that point on
he was like do you want some Mexican
food Janice is going to go get Mexican I
was like I love Mexican food let's do it
so I was there for8 hours I was there
all day they brought back some pretty
garbage Mexican food sat in the kitchen
ate it talked to the bodyguards heard
some crazy stories um and then like the
film crew set up like a whole studio in
his living room and they filmed this
long interview and I sat off to the side
in the dark with everyone else and
watched it so that's when all the fun
stuff happened so I got in the car
called my wife and I was like babe we
made it we did it we did it we're going
to be so rich this is done this is a
done deal like I I'm done by the way as
an entrepreneur I've thought that same
thing about 100 times I've been sure I'm
going broke or sure I'm becoming a
billionaire about 100 times each so
that's life entrepreneur anyway I told

[15:00]
that's life entrepreneur anyway I told
her what happened she thought it was
crazy drove back to Huntsville told my
friends who I was staying with they
thought it was crazy and we were Off to
the Races so about a week later I had
everything set up and so this was a
whole business model it was to set up a
free group like a community if you will
on Discord because that's where all the
crypto communities were and
to invite have basically have McAfee
tweet about this idea and then his
tweets would drive traffic into the
Discord group and then we basically get
a bunch of people excited about these
picks we give away a percentage of the
the predictions for free and then we
would charge a premium for people to get
access to all of the predictions that
was the business model and at the time
you could charge 4 to 500 bucks a month
to be in these communities right so the
communities were not unique there were a
lot of communities that had secret Edge
on the market or secret picks but this
was supposed to be the only one that was
like data driven right and I'll never
forget I was sitting in this exact same

[16:01]
forget I was sitting in this exact same
room where I am right now in my office
and I set up the Discord group and I
called John I said John we're ready to
launch I'm ready to launch yeah what do
I tweet and I sent him the link and I
sent him I told him exactly what to
tweet and he tweeted and I will never
forget this moment as long as I live so
I'm in the Discord group he tweets and
then it's 500 people 2500 people 7,000
people 18,000 and it just starts growing
and growing and it was put yourself in
these so it was early 2018 crypto had
just gone from 3,000 to 20,000 in 34
days at the end of 2017 it started
crashing but no one knew it was crashing
you don't know until it's a crash until
it's years behind you we all thought it
was just dipping a little bit it was
like at 17 grand down from 20 and we're
like oh great time to buy little did we
know it would be back at 3,000 in about
a year and so people were hungry for
these picks it was late but it was also

[17:00]
these picks it was late but it was also
the perfect time to launch because we
didn't know it was a bare market yet and
so thousands of people start flooding in
and I'm like oh I made it I'm here this
is incredible and then all of a sudden
just as soon as they joined the group
they start taking over the group and
what I mean by that is discord's default
settings at least they were at the time
were that anyone that joins can make
themselves an admin I don't know who at
Discord thought that was a good idea but
admin were blue and just regular users
were white that was their screen name
color and so I see all these blue names
start popping up and there's like
Russian lettering and there's like porn
and just terrible things flooding the
feed and then I was not at admin someone
like degraded my my user status and as
as fast as it had grown it was overtaken
by Bots and spammers and scammers and I
was completely deflated and I was like
what did I do I am so stupid what did I

[18:04]
what did I do I am so stupid what did I
do why didn't I lock down the settings
why didn't I do more research why didn't
I get some people in this room to help
me moderate this stuff so I called John
and I was like John I'm sorry but you
got to delete that tweet what no way no
way I never delete tweets it is against
my core values I never delete tweets I
refuse to delete tweets anything I say
is out there for the world to see it's
public free speech like John you have to
delete a tweet this tweet because I just
deleted that whole group and now your
link is dead all these people are
clicking on a dead link why did you
delete it hackers took over I don't it's
I need to change the setting what he was
like annoyed but not like really angry
not as angry as he could have been and
so he's like all right fine send me a
new link so immediately I created a new
Discord group I locked down all the
settings I sent him the link
and this tweet I believe is still live

[19:01]
and this tweet I believe is still live
on Twitter if you do an advanced search
for it hackers took over the channel if
you search for that under mcavey you
should see this tweet still and he guys
I'm so sorry I haers took over the
Channel Please join this group instead
and people started joining thousands but
not as many and not as quickly as they
had been joining before because you only
have that one shot to launch anyway so
over the next weeks and months twice a
week I would text John exactly what to
tweet maybe it was hey our new picks for
this week were released or maybe it was
hey we really think this altcoin will do
well and he would tweet about it and we
would get a couple thousand more people
in the group every time he would tweet
and pretty soon we had 60 70 880,000
people in the group and then crypto just
kept crashing so we were always up
against this bare market so then we're
like all right we got to launch the paid
group but it just made more sense at the
time to launch a token like a community
centered token instead and so we
launched this token there was no Ico

[20:01]
launched this token there was no Ico
initial coin offering there was offering
there was no token sale it was just an
airdrop it was a free airdrop because
listen if I do an Ico I got to get the
SEC involved I got to fill up his
paperworks I'm probably going to get
sued by someone let's just give away
some free tokens to build loyalty we can
get them listed on exchanges get them
trading and we'll see what happens so we
did we launched a token and the purpose
of the token was to be like a Yelp for
crypto projects where a community m
members could do due diligence and vet
crypto projects and list them on our
Marketplace so it's oh if you want to go
invest in an Ico or to buy a piece of
crypto software or join a crypto paid
group like you could see is it a scam is
it high quality is it not you can see
reviews on it pretty good uh idea I
think a lot of other people had the idea
I wrote a huge 18-page white paper
everyone loved it in crypto during what
is perceived as a bare a bull market
everyone loves everything everything is
bullish everything's great there could
be no wrong crypto just keeps going up

[21:00]
be no wrong crypto just keeps going up
and up and up forever so everyone loved
it we did an
airdrop and I my brother inlaw Justin
he's a brilliant programmer he created
his own custom like viral referral
marketing engine where it's like all
right it's a free airdrop but you got to
work for it okay if you want uh 100
tokens then give me your email if you
want 500 tokens then give me your email
and retweet this the announcement tweet
the airdrop announcement tweet if you
want to like it you comment on it you
get tokens for sharing with for sharing
and or interacting or engaging with the
announcement tweet and so that tweet
blew I'm talking like it was either 15
or 50,000 retweets I don't remember many
thousands over 10,000 retweets millions
and millions of Impressions went
massively viral huge success tens of
thousand I don't think we broke 100,000
maybe 100,000 I don't remember at least
tens of thousand 60 70 80 plus thousand
people claimed uh free airdrop a lot of

[22:01]
people claimed uh free airdrop a lot of
scammers lot of bots I learned that most
of the scammers are in Nigeria and
Vietnam fun fact because we were able to
track the IP address of everyone that
opted into this and so either the Bots
were in Vietnam and Nigeria or the
people were I don't know I'm not super
technical but those are the two
countries of all the countries on the
Earth but it was successful we had a ton
of token holders we burned a bunch of
tokens we got listed on exchanges coinex
Forex not like we we never got on like
binance or or Kraken or coinbase or
anything but like definitely B and C
tier exchanges we got listed on and our
Peak was like I believe it was the $30
million market cap now that is a click
bity number doesn't mean I had anywhere
near that much money personally it was a
free token airdrop but that was the
cumulative value of all the tokens that
were in circulation and then we ended up
doing a burn a token burn uh which was a
massive nightmare uh because we when I

[23:02]
massive nightmare uh because we when I
say we someone on my team clicked the
wrong button and instead of burning like
20% we burned 80% just literally by
clicking the wrong button and so it was
like oh crap okay there's no reversing
that so that was a nightmare several
stories like that this video could be
many hours long but it was a wild ride
we EV we were almost launched a
in-person crypto conference in Nigeria
believe it or not um and we had whole
teams worth of people we had multiple
telegram groups with hundreds of people
in them managing crypto projects we had
this worldwide crypto team and it was
wild and it lasted it we went going like
12 or 15 months and it just kept getting
harder and harder and then finally the
original idea remember was to launch the
paid group we finally got around to
launching that and we had three pricing
tiers it was like 79 a month and 2 79
and 500 or something and we worked so

[24:01]
and 500 or something and we worked so
hard on this me my brother-in-law my
other brother-in-law my cousin random
guy in Montana who's super cool named
Ryan and then four or five other people
we worked day in day out on this finally
launched it huge launch massive failure
like we expected 10 20 grand on launch
day and it was like 800 bucks and I
literally it was such a massive failure
for how much time we put into this I
literally cried
one of four times in my life I've cried
about something business related it was
depressing um it actually ended up being
not that bad because launch day wasn't
great but we got quite a few tricklin
customers uh but it still was it did not
meet
projections and so that was the nail in
the coffin for me I was like okay we
could wait out this Market it will turn
around again but I got bills to pay
right I like I can't just wait out this
market and go all in on this crypto
project for the next 24 months before I

[25:01]
project for the next 24 months before I
earned a dime so I ended up making a
little bit of money on it despite the
flashy $30 million market cap that
didn't translate too much money we made
money on the paid group we made some
money by selling our own tokens to fund
operations so it was worth my time it
was definitely not the worst startup
I've ever done it makes for a great
story mcafe he was a character at the
end of this uh video I'm going to put in
some voicemail some voicemails that he
sent me that are still on my phone to
this day I just can't bring him myself
to delete him he would call me at all
hours of the night with crazy business
ideas about seating tokens with car
dealerships and tattoo parlors mes of
all things he was just as crazy as
honestly he was a an older version of
myself if I liked to do drugs and had uh
no standards and was not a member of the
church that I am a member of he was just
just a Serial entrepreneur at heart and

[26:00]
just a Serial entrepreneur at heart and
he loved business he loved making money
and he had high energy probably from
illicit drugs and he was just a very
polarizing figure and it was it was
quite the story to to work alongside him
for 18 months but he's dead now so that
is life but thank you for listening to
this story that's one of the best
stories of my life I love telling it I
hope you enjoyed it as well and if you
liked it please subscribe that would
mean a lot to me because I put a lot of
work into this content and I hope you
have a great day hey Chris John um
macine the I'd like to chat for a little
while but to to prep you I'm looking at
this as um seeding about 200 million
coins with businesses massage parlors um
tattoo shops uh car dealers you know for
um you know come in and test drive our
Audi and we'll give you five of the you

[27:01]
Audi and we'll give you five of the you
know whatever uh and look at the process
of doing these things as mining the
coins and if in fact we give enough
coins so that they I'm going to I know
it's ridiculous I'm going to price the
coins because I you can price it anywh
you want at $10 a
coin um and I
intend uh shortly after seeding all of
this um you creating a website and
selling coins again to the businesses if
you know if if it makes sense for them
um and um so people collect these coins
in the process of like mining you
actually do work you go out you do
something sometimes you have to pay
money but that's okay you get some
experience uh and then after the
seating um maybe air dropping to you
know a bunch of users maybe another 200
million coins uh and then reserving for
the um
um the encounter uh Foundation X number

[28:03]
