welcome welcome to episode 11 of the
Kerner office this is one of my
favorites it was completely different
from episode 10 where I covered 13
questions and only 31 minutes today I
covered four questions in over an hour
but I think all four of them were super
high quality the first guy I spoke to
was named Nick and he was really
interesting because he invests in book
and music royalties and he makes a
killing I think you'll really like that
one he didn't really have a question
he's crushing it but I just wanted to
learn about book and music royalties and
how you can make money passively so that
was cool next guy was my first caller
ever the first caller of episode one
Brandon he bought a street sweeping
business in the greater LA area it's
been three months he's crushing it he
has doubled his sales since he last
spoke to me he's implemented some of my
suggestions and we had an amazing call
and I'm really excited for him next
caller asked about how to grow his
dashboard business not a car dashboard
but like a digital dashboard so let's
say I own a bunch of short-term rentals
and I want to see their performance all
in one place he charges thousands of

[01:01]
in one place he charges thousands of
dollars to put that together for Real
Estate fund owners and really any
business owner that wants to see all
their metrics in one place so he didn't
know how to grow and so I helped him
come up with some good ideas and the
last caller was really fun it was a very
unique caller because he wants to
develop a physical product he's a tinker
he's an engineer he's an aerospace
consultant and he wanted some ideas on a
product idea that he has and how he can
sell it on Amazon Shopify Facebook
Marketplace he left the conversation
really enthused I left it really
enthused it was a great call so four
callers in total episode 11 hope you
enjoy thank you Nick for joining so Nick
is a little different in that he didn't
really come to me with a question he
just emailed me about what he's doing
and he's buying book and music royalties
and I thought that sounds really cool
let don't want we just brote down about
that for a few minutes on my show and he
said great so welcome Nick to the ker
office thanks for having me Chris I big
fan and yeah excited to chat about some

[02:00]
fan and yeah excited to chat about some
interesting Investments today all right
me too thank you by the way and tell me
approximately how many deals you've
invested in so far let's see probably
done about 10 or so and then
hold about six or seven well personally
in between with have a small little
friends and family investment fund okay
and then what dollar amount are you
investing in each of these on average
these could depend from you know as low
as 20 grand up to uh you 10020 Grand
overall okay so I should probably back
up and I'll let everyone know we were
already talking and I forgot to record
so I'm gonna ask Nick to uh repeat a
couple things so just tell us briefly
what the thesis is with investing in
book and music royalties why do you like
it compared to more traditional things
like the stock market or real estate and
what are your goals moving forward with
it totally I like it because it's weird
and a lot of people don't do it and and

[03:00]
and a lot of people don't do it and and
I like obscure uh Investments but more
specifically it's uncorrelated returns
so stock market goes down you might
cancel your country club but you're
probably going to keep your $10 a month
Spotify playlist the yields are pretty
attractive it's protected in the sense
of it's intellectual property so you get
revenue for the life of the author plus
70 years and a lot of these songs have
really good staying power if you buy
them an amortization tax benefits and
then the industry as a whole there's a
lot of pressure in support of artists
getting paid rather than some of these
big Universal Warner companies so
there's a lot of kind of upward pressure
and we're buying those same rights from
a songwriter or producer and yeah it's
not very volatile it's not very crazy
pretty similar to a corporate bond in
terms of kind of the risk structure yeah
what would you say the annual yield is
on your 10 Investments on average and
what's like the best and the worst we

[04:01]
what's like the best and the worst we
are doing low double digits it's fairly
stable growing slightly I think on kind
of the the group money that we have
we're about like 12% a year okay and
then what's the best and worst out of
that Bunch yeah the best is the I bought
a book asset off for book royalty off of
Craigslist like 10 years ago I bought
that for3 5 grand and it was paying 12
Grand then and that's doing 16,000 a
month or excuse me 16,000 a year I wish
it was a month currently so that's my
best performer okay that's probably like
the best opener of any party story I've
ever heard yeah I bought this book
royalty off Craigslist for 35 Grand once
so you paid 35 Grand and it's paying you
16 Grand a year today currently yep and
did you you just randomly found it on
Craigslist or how were you how did you
find this yeah I was few years into my
career I bought 1% down condo and then

[05:03]
career I bought 1% down condo and then
remodeled it myself got a 90 grand HELOC
and I was like I need to deploy this
Capital as quick as possible and my
other bu who I do this with he's a CFA
one of the kind of better analysts in
this space worked at royalty exchange
which is where can eBay for these things
music royalties and book royalties are
cool Investments so I posted on
Craigslist buying oil and gas royalties
music royalties I guess so that's the
post and I just kept posting that this
guy reached out to me and he said hey
I'm moving to Alaska to go fly planes
and fly fish and I used to be a literary
agent and I want to sell you this thing
I was like all right and he gave me
about 120 pounds of paper of for due
diligence I didn't really know what I
was doing but got some upwork attorneys
and figured it out and wrote them the
check that was it you were my kind of
guy man like I swear you're the same
this is totally something I would do
holy holy cow okay what year was this

[06:02]
holy holy cow okay what year was this
let's see maybe
2016 okay so you're just having this
one-off conversation with a friend and
he's you've got 90 grand to put into
something and you've got this sense of
urgency because it's burning a hole in
your pocket and coincidentally your
friend says look at royalties so you go
to Craigslist and you post in the
looking for royalty section which should
exist apparently and this guy wants to
move to Alaska and he wrote a book then
no so he was the agent
for a bestselling author so that author
still puts out it's CJ box so he does
Western kind of crime books and he puts
a new book in the same series out
there's been a few TV series yeah good
good books but he had an interest in the
first six CU he was the first agent and
then that author has moved on to a new
agent okay so now so for these first six
books yep the original author gets
nothing for them correct the author gets
considerably larger the agent the

[07:00]
considerably larger the agent the
literary the first agent yep had a 7.5%
interest in the net income of the books
and so he sold that 7 and a half%
interest to me so he doesn't receive
anything he got his check and he's fly
fishing and flying around in a plane
which sounds
awesome okay all right all right sorry
so he just needed to get liquid so he
could go fly some planes and
he what do you think the gamble was that
he took like that this these first six
books were past their prime or did he
just really need money and he wasn't
even taking a Gamble and he knew he was
selling something pretty good I think he
knew he was selling something pretty
good it's obscure in the sense of
there's not anywhere to go buy these
things especially for a book that's
music trades fairly regularly books I
don't know where I would go sell that if
I needed to and he I guess it's all
checks there's no Direct depos it for

[08:00]
checks there's no Direct depos it for
this book stuff so he's like where I'm
going there is no mail and I would have
to fly hundreds of miles to go get the
mail and deposit the check so that was
his main
issue you lucked out so you lucked out
in a sense you did because the the fact
that Logistics even played a role in
this is so funny like how many places
can one move to where there's no mail
you know I don't know yeah I got an
incredible deal and I had no clue and it
was scary for me I'd never written a
$35,000 check yeah you know in my life
so I'm like can I buy this is this
actually something that you can purchase
yeah so yeah it all worked out and it's
still growing so I'm stoked on
it geez so at the time that you bought
this what was he receiving per month
what did you think the ROI was on day
one first and I think you told me this
in the beginning but I can't remember
first what it is today it was so it pays
twice a year it was paying roughly

[09:00]
twice a year it was paying roughly
$112,000 a year back then so I knew I
was getting at a three times multiple
okay so 3x multiple okay
perfect man you can go to Omaha Nebraska
and buy an HVAC business for a 3X
multiple and then start driving all over
town swapping out condensers or you can
post a Craigslist and send a stranger 35
Grand and hope and pray that you get a
passive 3x multip this literally is
passive right like quote there's no such
thing as passive income but could you
get more passive than this I do nothing
so no I don't think that's
[Applause]
possible wow okay so this kind of wet
your appetite and you're like why even
invest in other things if this exists
yeah more realistically everything else
you buy in this space is not as good as
the first one so if we're buying now
really attractive price might be five
six seven times multiple and for really
high quality you're paying closer to 8 n

[10:02]
high quality you're paying closer to 8 n
10 so it's still attractive returns but
this isn't the go buy a business at
three times and see 40 50% irr or
whatever now what was the worst one that
you've done so far and do you think
there's a chance it could turn around
yeah we haven't boughten anything that's
there's a ton of junk out there so you
go on royalty exchange like most of the
stuff's junk so there's a big Decay
curve and you got to look look at is
this recurring revenue from Spotify so
you buy something that's old and
stabilized you know it's in someone's
Spotify playlist they listen to it once
a week or whatever and then it's pretty
consistent so we haven't had anything
that's like a clear loser we've had
stuff that has pretty much been flat or
slightly growing and our due diligence
process has been pretty good to pick out
stuff that does what we expect it to um
okay and is royalty exchange the deao

[11:01]
okay and is royalty exchange the deao
place you shop for these nowadays no we
go through Brokers we look on royalty
exchange just because there's a lot of
deal flow there but stuff tends to be
more expensive than we can get it off
Market which off Market is different in
that sense yeah do you think there's an
a business opportunity here for someone
to create a more streamlined Marketplace
or surely you've thought of opportuni to
make this industry more efficient yeah
from an efficiency play it would be
do there's a lot of companies that have
tried that and I think the biggest thing
the challenge is the actual deal flow
and transacting these because once you
say hey we got a deal you have to
go say hey I've got one and a half%
interest in this song from a producer
side and then a songwriter side and then
none of this stuff was ever made to
change hands so then you go to Warner
and it can be like a multi-month process
to just say hey the ownership ship has
changed so yeah there's some models out

[12:01]
changed so yeah there's some models out
there of crowd vesting and exchanges I
don't know what I would do I would
probably just raise a bunch of money and
then go allocate it and go with a fund
model I feel you ever studi the Lindy
effect or think about that are you
familiar with the the Lindy effect give
me the so the Lindy effect is basically
the the principle that however long
something has been around is as likely
as it's going to be around in the future
so if you buy an H business in Omaha
that's been around for 50 years
statistically speaking it will be around
for at least another 50 years okay sure
which two month a two- month old startup
statistically has two more months right
cool so I think of it like this where if
you're buying Bob Dylan that's a pretty
safe bet which means you're probably
going to get a lower return but if
you're buying some guy that went viral
on Tik Tok it's a gamble right but it
could be a really good gamble he could
be he could be dead of a drug overdose
in in six months or he could be the next
Taylor Swift the the overdose would

[13:01]
Taylor Swift the the overdose would
probably actually help the income that's
I was thinking that yeah I was thinking
that it's just a gamble you have to take
right just like anything what do you
think helped this six book deal that you
bought what do you think helped it
improve was it a CO like just a covid
phenomenon or did something happen with
the author or is it just you can't
attribute it to anything yeah so
everything we buy a minority interest so
there's someone else who's got a vested
interest in making the songs or the book
successful this author has puts out a
new book every single year in the series
at hits the bestseller and so I have the
first six and there's you know 26 books
in the series it got picked up Big Sky
was picked up and turned into a TV show
which is one of the other book series
from the same author and then there was
also TV series called Joe picket which
is the name of these
series um so that got a lot of interest

[14:00]
series um so that got a lot of interest
in it between the new books and the TV
shows that's been a consistent bump up
so that's where I would attribute the
the success of the the book
deal is there a world where you could
buy a minority or a majority interest in
these rights and then have some sort of
an in influence over how well that
artist or author does like maybe you're
in the industry and you're able to
affect the outcome more are people doing
that totally so that's kind of hypnosis
the big one of the the biggest
investment funds in the space their
pitch is hey we can pay 15x 16x and we
have a whole team of people who will go
out there and try to place this song or
increase its publicity
and that's their strategy and you
probably hasn't worked out as well as
they thought it would at least how the
numbers show but yeah they maybe they
overpaid for Stuff thinking that their
effect would be greater than it actually
ended up being especially if you're
doing it at scale right like you can
only promote so much totally now what do

[15:00]
only promote so much totally now what do
you think before I hit record we were
talking abouto Y whicho is like this AI
music generator how do you think that
plays into this at all I'm sick of
hearing people say AI is going to
disrupt this and that and then we learn
actually like people are pretty
important and AI can disrupt a lot but I
think that I look at it like
self-driving cars there's that last 5%
will take as long as the first 95% did
to disrupt so on one hand it's what is
AI going to do to all these rights if
you can replace Taylor Swift with a
click of a button but the other hand
it's h how easy will that be what are
your thoughts on that I'm with you just
like chpt now of the quality of writing
is not there I listen to AO make AO song
and it's fun but I I haven't listened to
Theo songs on my playlist ever um so I
think it's you know night and day
difference between a quality produced
song with someone who's experienced and
good background singers and good

[16:00]
good background singers and good
producer versus hey the computer's going
to go make some of the stuff I think
it's wildly powerful but I think we've
got a long time until we see stuff
that's like actually on par with high
quality music today yeah I actually when
I first discovered sunno I couldn't
sleep that night not because ofso but so
I I stayed up I came here in my office
and I pulled out my MacBook and I'm like
all right how can you use this to go
viral on Spotify and I went down this
rabbit hole and I found all these
articles about people that had been
doing this and trying this for months
now and and some with s some success
right there there has been some success
and soono gives you all the rights like
you you could make a a hit onso legally
and upload it to Spotify and make a lot
of money on it and I forget what the
roadblocks were
but I don't know I just think we're
still too early like I look at this
phase of AI as like the when I first got
an iPhone the best app was like this
fart noises app oh yeah and I feel like
we're still there in I and it's like fun

[17:00]
we're still there in I and it's like fun
and it's quirky but then Uber came along
years later and like harnessed like the
underlying infrastructure of the iPhone
to really change the game it wasn't just
like an app that appeared useful or
funny on the surface it was like the
actual utility in the technology totally
and I feel like that's what AI is doing
like it's the plumbing of AI is really
helping boost the the capabilities of of
companies large and small and it's
leveling the playing field totally more
yeah and there's still those second and
third level of facts out there where you
could you take advantage of AI so maybe
it's not making songs but it's I'm going
to go make ringtones or noises or or
something else that is an opportunity
for yeah like my newsletter talked about
just getting someone's attention with a
a custom sunno song it it's just like
replacing a quirky subject line of an
email and you're not going to sell them
the song maybe you do you're just using
it to get their attention especially if
it's someone who's over 50 years old and
probably won't know abouto for another 3

[18:01]
probably won't know abouto for another 3
or four years it's really novel and
unique totally yeah perfect example to
separate yourself get bying and exactly
like you said if I can do this imagine
what else I can do and add a ton of
value to someone who's out there doing
HVAC every day but would like more
business awesome Nick thank you for
coming if anyone wants to ask you
questions I don't even know if you want
to answer them but if you do want to
answer questions about royalty investing
where can they find you Twitter you can
send them on Twitter my way happy to
talk about it it's one stuff yeah okay
what's your handle it
is my first name and last name with the
first two letters switch so it's p p i c
k natri n a t r i c
k okay and we'll link to it in the show
notes as well cool thanks Chris I
appreciate everything you do keep up the
awesome content thank you thank you Nick
I appreciate it have a good day cheers
bye hey Chris Brandon how's it going
how are you man good been a couple

[19:01]
how are you man good been a couple
months yeah yeah we're uh a few months
since we last spoke and yeah things are
going pretty well a lot of what you
shared seemed I don't know mind-blowing
stuff at the time but now it makes a lot
of sense good so you were on my first
episode right or was it
second first episode yeah okay and you
were like my first caller of my first
episode weren't you I think so yeah I
think we got disconnected or something
like that yeah yeah that it that's crazy
and it's funny cuz it was like this is a
10-week test yada yada yada and here we
are on week 11 so yeah here we are
that's awesome so yeah thanks for doing
this and thanks for the time of course
so let's get everyone up to speed so
this is as I read your submitted
question and as I remember it you
purchased a street sweeping company in
Southern
California and you were selling some
residential some HOA construction
companies and you were just starting to

[20:01]
companies and you were just starting to
get into it
right correct yeah yeah I was about
probably four months into running the
operation and we had had it probably
since May last year so we're about
coming up on a year mark okay all right
now what did I suggest what was your
core question and what did I suggest
back
then I think I was just looking how to
grow it this is my first run at
entrepreneurship I just finished a
baseball career and came across this
business low risk and so you to I think
you took a look at our website you took
a look at our Google my business profile
you mentioned just get some reviews
start working on SEO double down on the
Google ads that that had been working so
keep doing what's working and then
figure out some sort of cold Outreach
which has been good like we've just
found some associations locally and all
that and yeah we're just doubling down
on all that awesome so what type of cold
Outreach have you done so a lot of it

[21:01]
Outreach have you done so a lot of it
has been just getting lists from I think
outs scraper things like that and
whether it's homeowners associations
commercial property managers and then I
joined a contractors Association that's
like local and so that'll get our
construction side going so it's just a
mix of cold calling cold emails and
following up on any past leads things
like that do you have any stories like a
specific customer or instance you
remember of a time that cold Outreach
worked and what is that story the cold
Outreach has been slow one of them we
have we have a big construction company
in our area that it could lead to a lot
of jobs and they weren't even aware that
we were a company and yeah just a phone
call led to that and then I had a a
phone call with a gentleman that he
owned a parking lot in our area and I
asked if he had some other property as
well and he pointed me to yeah he wanted

[22:02]
well and he pointed me to yeah he wanted
some pressure washing for a parking
garage that's at near LAX it's like a
seven story garage working on getting
that one hopefully and that would be
probably a month of Revenue just in
itself yeah that'd be nice like it would
be the equivalent of a whole month of
revenue for your company yeah wow yeah
now do you do and we would Outsource all
of it nice that was my so you don't do
pressure washing you would just sub it
out
yeah yeah now what on that job
specifically what did the unit economics
look like what would the Top Line be and
what would it cost you to sub it out so
it took a bunch of research but I found
that I could get someone who I could
trust not to like flood this thing and
put me in a lot of trouble who's done
these size jobs before and it probably
would cost me about 30 to
35,000 and I actually had asked the
customer like hey have you done this
before I don't know if you understand
how big of a job this is and he said
yeah we did it two years ago but we only

[23:01]
yeah we did it two years ago but we only
did half of it and I think we we did it
for 30,000 so he gave me the number
which was really nice very helpful and
yeah so I quoted him I think 55 or
something like that for the whole
building okay which I confirmed with a
bunch of other guys that are I think
mostly through Twitter and they said
anywhere from the 50 to 60 range would
probably be based on the square footage
and everything man man pressure washing
parking garages I didn't even know that
was a thing that is a lot of
money yeah that's the next Avenue that I
want to add to so I don't have to
Outsource it all because we've gotten
probably four or five leads on it in the
last two months only one of them has
landed and it was a pretty small job so
I'm waiting until it makes sense for us
to invest in that what would it cost you
so he didn't bulk at the 55 grand
no he he has to his thing was he has to

[24:02]
no he he has to his thing was he has to
go get it approved by his BP or whoever
uh is above him and he said they were
planning for either mid to late summer
for this job okay and what's it going to
cost you to Outsource that about 30 to
35 man for everything so you have to
pressure wash the entire thing or they
will it's most yeah it's mostly pavement
so I have to sweep it came from a
sweeping job that I I would sweep it
first get all the debris and then yeah
they would it's basically get all the
oil stains up and then it's mostly just
the pavement not any of the building or
anything okay um and then making sure
all the gum and just stuff that gets
stuck over time now is this just for
aesthetic purposes or is there like some
regulation requiring this I'm not
totally sure on the parking lots like
what is regulated as far as the pressure
washing I know
the first couple of levels are like

[25:00]
the first couple of levels are like
their VIP section so he was like hey I
need a like a deep clean for this so I
think it's more for looks of it but I
think there also is like an element of
not having to invest in more pavement
resurfacing and all that over time if
you maintain it so I think long term it
saves you money I know that's the case
for sweeping at least for asphalt and
all that that stuff but so so I I would
say there's some sort of benefit other
than just
looks man my mind is buzzing with this I
feel like you're an you're in La how
many parking garages are in La like this
is such a high ticket item you could pay
a full-time guy to just chase down these
parking lot owners and Chase down these
five figure jobs all day every
day yeah that's what I'm realizing so
we're in ventur about probably an hour
and a half yeah hour and a half outside
of LA but yeah the if I even if I could

[26:01]
of LA but yeah the if I even if I could
get these jobs and sub them all out like
it would be less of a headache and um
pretty decent cash flow so I love the
model of subbing everything out until
you you feel comfortable enough to do it
yourself and you've drisk so we do this
in the tree business we sub everything
out we literally don't own a chainsaw
but at this point we're looking to buy a
tree company in DFW that doesn't sub
anything out because we feel confident
enough that we know how to run the
business that we could just boost our
margins so our perfect scenario is buy a
a cash flowing Tree Business that's
doing a million dollars a year in net
profit come in there put our marketing
on it put my operating partner on it
who's an amazing operator and just boost
the margins boost the topl line with
better marketing and so back to you I
think street sweeping and commercial
pressure washing go hand inand because
you're going to have to do a run through
this first anyway and I feel like yeah
anytime you do a job like this you're

[27:01]
anytime you do a job like this you're
going to have to run through it and so
if I were you I would get a I would go
to Ramy which is a website that I like
to use for scraping data and honestly
you can scrape with a virtual assistant
everything you need during their onewe
trial they're not going to like me
saying this but whatever you get a
because it's super expensive you get a
onewe trial okay and I have a VA um that
I can refer to you that I've used for
this and he can go in and you can make a
very specific search for uh LA County
Orange County whatever you're doing for
parking garages or for parking lots or
whatever it is maybe just everything
over an acre or under an acre and scrape
it all out get as much data as you can
and then just start hitting that list
with someone local not a VA either you
or a partner or an employee and just
start learning learning how much of a
need there is for this I think four
leads over two months for something
that's this High ticket is pretty dang

[28:01]
that's this High ticket is pretty dang
promising I I usually try to dissuade
them from expanding into other verticals
because they you they usually have a 1%
market share of the vertical that
they're already in but yeah from what I
understand this a goes hand inand with
what you're already doing and B is much
more High ticket because what would if
you were to just sweep this seven story
garage nothing else what would you
charge him it might take Maybe
five or six hundred bucks 100x
difference yeah yeah that's crazy and
the capex for the pressure washing is
much lower and replacing something on my
sweeper if something goes down it might
be a
$15,000 um expense so that's the real
part that's difficult with this but yeah
this so the person I was subbing it out
to he actually reached out to me and I
found out he'd been doing this for about
10 years and he's about he said his Top

[29:00]
10 years and he's about he said his Top
Line this year will be around 7 to 8
million just with 80% commercial and
then some
residential holy cow so is open my eyes
to what's there is he specializing in
parking garages or just any pressure
washing any pressure washing sand
blasting so like getting any of the
stenciling up they do like some fleet
washing for commercial tractors and
vehicles so they do a little bit of
everything yeah I have to imagine that
it's really easy to sit here on this
call and be like oh yeah do pressure
washing I have to imagine it's very
competitive especially in LA but the
fact like if you were to get on these
cold calls and say we only do pressure
washing for parking garages in LA county
I feel like that sells so much better
than just another pressure washing guy
calling them and first of all I I doubt
that any pressure washing guys are
calling these guys because they're
probably pretty busy and they're like
people don't want to get on the phone so
they're not competing with cold call
right I had to call probably 10 people

[30:01]
right I had to call probably 10 people
to find someone and each one when I sent
them the address they said no that's
that's way too big for me I can't do
perfect and yeah so it took me like this
guy told me there's probably three or
four within Southern to Northern
California like that could handle a job
this size so yeah I think the
competition definitely goes down once
you start getting into those bigger jobs
what do you think a truck would cost to
do jobs this big if you were to buy it
yourself the guy told me how he would do
it and it was two trucks I think the
equipment if you're getting it like new
and G to keep it for a while would be
anywhere from
40 probably 35 to 40 Grand per truck
like with a truck trailer everything I
think you could probably get it around
3540 so maybe 75 grand to be able to do
two Crews on a job like this that'll pay
for itself in two two three job
jobs yeah if you were to only sweep this

[31:01]
jobs yeah if you were to only sweep this
how often realistically like I know how
often you'd like to sweep it how often
realistically would someone invite you
back to keep sweeping that only sweep it
would this like a parking garage not it
would only be when they pressure wash
because they're charging people for
airport parking and so they don't want
to if I go and sweep it it's going to be
completely full and we're not anything
done with it so they're going to have to
empty the lot for us to pressure wash it
one or two levels at a time
interesting okay how often do normal
parking lots need to be swept a normal
one it depend like a commercial grocery
store can be I I had one that's every
night but that's a very low margin
you're it's just a race to the bottom
and then the HOAs the nicer communities
are probably once a week or once every
other week okay I'm just thinking I know
this isn't even why you called but I'm
latching on to this because it's a this

[32:01]
latching on to this because it's a this
still recurring like you don't give up
the recurring aspect it's less recurring
it might be 10x less recurring but 100x
bigger ticket size so to me this is the
exact type of asymmetric risk that you
should be taking you don't have to take
any risk but your time and your pride to
talk to these guys and at least learn
and then once you've subbed it out five
or 10 times you really don't have a risk
at that point because those 5 to 10 jobs
hopefully you've been the one in inter
facing with them you are the one with
the relationship with them and they're
going to recur in one two 3 years right
so even if you buy a truck today and you
never get another job you're still G to
be able to do those jobs again in one
two or three years yeah am I missing
something or is this a big
opportunity I think it's a big
opportunity which is I've been on the
whole YouTube Rabbit Trail for the
pressure washing since this came up the
other pressure washing leads have been
like much smaller but they're still you
know any anywhere from 2500 to 5 grand

[33:00]
know any anywhere from 2500 to 5 grand
for these commercial jobs and yeah I
mean with a sweeper truck like if I'm
sending him to a construction site I'm
pretty happy if each truck is doing
about 2500 a day that's like best case
scenario so yeah to have a a pressure
washing job that I can do after
hours pretty low paying employee and to
be able to do that and get three or five
grand per job I I think there's
definitely a big interest there yeah
okay think of it this way because I've
talked trash on pressure watching in the
past because it's one of the very few
home services that have gone viral on
Tik Tok so there's all kinds of high
schoolers and college kids which I love
out there buying pressure washers from
Home Depot and hustling and I love that
right I don't love it as a competitor
which is why I'm not going into that
business but I love that they're doing
it so let's just take this business and
compare it to something with less
competition like fencing
let's say every year in the fencing
industry you've got just to keep the

[34:01]
industry you've got just to keep the
numbers clean 100 guys coming into the
market and 50 guys going out of the
market maybe they're closing their
business entirely and let's just say
that's like a the average attrition into
and out of the fencing business
statistically speaking unless Americans
are getting 50% more fences every month
then at some point in the
future those companies are in for a
world of hurt and a lot of competition
let's say in the pressure washing
industry it's three times that because
it's gone viral on Tik Tok and fencing
hasn't let's say you've got 300 coming
into the market every month and
150 what that says to me there's
actually a barrier to entry with what
you're doing because of the ticket how
much it's going to cost to buy one of
these ding trucks right and so all else
equal if the top of the funnel is three
times bigger the top of the funnel for
the $50,000 truck parking lot pressure
washing industry is the same size which
means that if you're in an overall

[35:02]
means that if you're in an overall
industry that's much more crowded and
you find a sub segment of that industry
that's ignored then you will
statistically be much less crowded than
an average industry like
fencing does that make sense yeah
because yeah definitely I would wager
that exactly zero% of these guys being
inspired from Tik Tok are spending 75
grand on a truck but there still is a
growing need for that market because the
economy is growing and so if you're the
guy that takes that on then I think
you'll be even better primed for Success
than someone starting a fencing business
which is not going viral on Tik Tok
right yeah and I think that's been my
hesitation is I don't think we would do
or I wouldn't pursue uh residential
pressure washing unless I just got leads
out of nowhere but it I would focus on
these higher ticket items or the
sweeping yeah yeah so if I were you I
would make uh I would buy a different
domain name entirely just something

[36:00]
domain name entirely just something
cheap 10 bucks regarding parking garage
pressure washing and maybe that's what
it's called parking garage pressure
wash.com or La parking garage pressure
washing and it's a long domain it's not
pretty but then take your credentials
how long has your company been in
business like before you bought
it uh about 30 years perfect leverage
those credentials on your new landing
page and talk about on this new landing
page how all you do is LA County Park
and garage pressure washing and it can
be a simple website you can put pictures
in there it could be a one pager even
but then when you get on these calls or
I would even throw Google ads at this
landing page and just see what happens
because there's probably very low
traffic but very low competition on
these Google ads and just separate that
and it you could put on there like a
subsidiary of your current business name
or something I would really explore that
while you're doing everything that
you're currently doing just to see what
comes from it yeah it would take one job

[37:00]
comes from it yeah it would take one job
basically to pay off any sort of thing
like that and two jobs probably to pay
off all the equipment yeah and there's
thousands of those things in the county
I'm sure yeah what did we not get to
that you had a question about with the
street sweeping High cap X we've gotten
it to about 60 Grand a month and it's
about I would say 8 to 12% net margins
because we're definitely investing a lot
into making sure the equipment's back
updated we got a lot of old equipment
when we bought it ads all that sort of
stuff so personally I have a decent
Runway financially a couple years or so
and this is my first go at
entrepreneurship so I don't necessarily
want to take my my chance of two years
or whatever to focus on something that
might not be my highest leverage or best
opportunity but it was just the
opportunity that kind of fell in my lap
I have a background obviously in
baseball played 10 years professionally

[38:00]
baseball played 10 years professionally
I haven't done anything really with that
or growing like a brand or anything like
that so I don't know I'm not really sure
if I should just continue just roll on
this learn all the skills of running a
business at like Marketing sales all
that that I didn't know beforehand or if
I should continue to pursue other things
I know you've had a couple of segments
on the shiny object syndrome lately but
yeah I'd be curious to hear your
thoughts I think that you are in the
exact right place what what was your if
you're at 60 Grand a month today what
were you three months ago when we first
spoke I would say probably 28 to 30 at
that point and then when we bought it we
were at about 15 to 20 okay
so I'm a big advocate of shiny object
syndrome as I talk about but I would
like there's a difference between shiny
objects inside your industry and outside
so like in my industry quote is
entrepreneurship and so I'm always

[39:01]
entrepreneurship and so I'm always
chasing shiny objects and I have a a
vehicle called co-founders where I can
place these shiny objects with operators
right I think you're doing something
really special and amazing and the fact
that you have a 30-year-old business
means that it's likely to stay in
business for another 30 plus years
statistically speaking you're in one of
the biggest economies in the world
that's a growing economy that's by the
ocean which means it's not going
anywhere it's not as prone to market
bubbles like Phoenix or Vegas I would
imagine there's dozens of other
competitors you could buy in that market
I would lean hard into street sweeping
and or street sweeping plus like
commercial pressure washing because it's
not going anywhere it's not going to be
disrupted by AI one day there's going to
be a self-driving street sweeping truck
and you can buy it and you can cut your
cogs down right like you are almost
immune from technological advances in
fact they're only going to benefit you

[40:00]
fact they're only going to benefit you
so I would keep doing exactly what
you're doing and when you get to the
point where you feel like your growth
has stalled then start looking at
acquiring other businesses in the same
space maybe you acquire a commercial
pressure washing company instead of
starting one from scratch I would also
take your customer list like as soon as
possible and reach out to them and ask
if they have any pressure washing needs
because you could have a whole other 60
Grand a month of Revenue already in your
email list
yeah okay that's really helpful yeah
that's what I would do but I think
you're doing something really really
special and I want you to come back on
in a couple months and let's talk
again yeah yeah that'd be great I
appreciate it okay thank you Brandon
good luck
Thomas Chris what's going on man how are
you good hey sorry for making you wait I
appreciate you having me on and it's
good to see you again of course you're
in Birmingham right yeah that's correct
I'm in Birmingham so it's funny enough
tonight I have to think about what I'm
going to eat for dinner and it's either
tacocasa or Surin oh dude you got to go

[41:01]
tacocasa or Surin oh dude you got to go
to you got oh man eat it in memory of me
I agree oh it is so good yep oh man I
want to go back to Alabama just for sure
and I'll send you some it's funny you
say that because I had a friend that
visited from Utah like 12 years ago and
he's a big foodie and I took him to Sur
and he was addicted and he sent me
honestly this was so long ago I think
mailed me a check for
$35 to buy some Nom talk beef and ship
it to him and I never did like I kept
his money it's so much friction to go to
the restaurant and dry ice and all that
so I owe him after inflation probably
about $3,000 at this point but it's a
good investment for him it is it's good
he did all right it's good all right so
you've got you've got this dashboard
business so tell me I read your question
but let's talk it through so let me know
if I understand your question correctly
you have a startup fairly new that

[42:01]
you have a startup fairly new that
creates dashboards for any business
owner but your first kind of case study
was for a short-term rental business
owner that really loves it because he's
able to see the performance of specific
metrics across a dozen different
platforms all in the same place and
across a few different properties as
well y that's correct and so they're
actually a small fund that's I think
around $80 million assets or management
and they just operate in experiential
hospitality is what they call it and and
they're pretty well known too and so we
felt like we got we proved that there
was a demand for this right because the
platforms they were on not only did we
figure out we could provide better
reporting than them by just actually
digging into the guts of the API but
it's we're providing them better data
like we even found mistakes that their
platform was making on their metrics
they were providing so we're like our
dashboard is the gospel to them compared
to their the actual platform they run
off of so it was like our data is better

[43:00]
off of so it was like our data is better
and so surely we could go after anybody
right we would be happy to take after
any Customer because it's apis combining
the data it's that full business
intelligence kind of elt kind of
pipeline but yeah just the fact that we
had success with that firm we were like
why don't we just lean into that and use
their their big name to try to provide
some Authority and it seems to have
worked I've gotten some DMS from people
that in similar Industries and people
who have told me they're impressed by it
by saying a few things about it on
Twitter we just haven't gotten like a
ton of inbound yet so I'm thinking all
right I got to go on the offensive I've
never really launched anything before so
I'm trying to figure out like how do I
find these funds or do I pivot to
somebody else am I do I need to be
sending the emails what else should I do
am I pricing it correctly it's like
you're working through all that stuff at
the same time inevitably exactly you're
pulling levers at the you don't know
what's working and what isn't exactly so
exactly let's talk about your economics
cuz that kind of helps drive my decision
making CU if you sell a $20 widget that

[44:02]
making CU if you sell a $20 widget that
cost you $10 you have to be extremely
efficient with how you promote that
thing but I know this is a higher ticket
item and so that'll help drive my
decision- making on how much money you
can spend to acquire new customers so
what is what are what are your cogs how
many hours and I know you don't really
know yet it's still new ballpark how
many hours and it's all labor I assume
maybe a little bit of zapier or Tech on
the back end but how many hours to put a
really clean dashboard together for an
average size
customer yeah for an average size I'd
probably say 10 hours however we've got
a gentleman who's become sort of my
right-hand Mann on this and we were
basically saying we'll agree to probably
just a flat rate per dashboard because
if it takes him five minutes to build it
I don't care if it takes him 20 hours I
don't care like we'll just flat rate it
and that way it's very he knows exactly
what he's getting into so we we just
thinking we'll pay him a th000 bucks a
dashboard and he's pretty happy with

[45:00]
dashboard and he's pretty happy with
that and then as we grow and he's doing
other things like we would also put him
on some salary because he'll be helping
me do operational stuff as well because
he wants to get out of his job and he
wants to move and this is like his
ticket out of that if it's a thousand
bucks and then there's a little bit of
tech cost 250 bucks maybe a tech cost
just for easy math I suppose we're
thinking of charging 3,000 for an
implementation fee just right off the
bat and then we just capture recurring
on the back end to maintain to auto
reports to make changes and stuff so if
I'm sitting at 65% gross margin and then
I also have recurring on the back end
that's very high margin then I almost
think to me it's I don't care if my cogs
are are 99% of because I get the
recurring on the back end so that's in
general how it works how much is the
recurring and is it just like a service
contract to fix things as they break and
maybe months go by with nothing
breaks correct yes but then also we say
hey like if you want to add a dashboard
that's on top of your existing data

[46:00]
that's on top of your existing data
sources great like we can throw that
together because we're already pulling
the data it's just manipulating it a
little bit more if they were doing
something like in the case of the real
estate fund we worked with if they
bought a new property and brought it
online it would just be a small $500 fee
to take the same dashboard but Implement
with a new property because we got to go
pull new stuff so then if they were to
add a data source we might say all right
like we'll charge like a $500 fee or
something like that to go add that say
because that's the hard work just
getting into that new source and pulling
that data but yeah in general we're
flirting with price a little bit I was
thinking a$ 3.99 maybe $4.99 but I'm
open to ideas some people might tell me
you should charge a th000 bucks or maybe
I should charge 200 I don't know yeah
but I'm thinking like 3.99 at the moment
and it also depends on who your customer
is I I like that you're playing in the
real estate fund space because they have
money and most of those costs if not all
of them they're just passing on to their
LPS anyway and they do not bulk at the
price because I've asked a few of them I
said does this price give you heartburn
and they're like no not at all but there
are other people I've asked and they're

[47:00]
are other people I've asked and they're
like you when when they start like
Heming and Hauling over 3,000 bucks
there's my answer we probably exactly
what other people have bed like what
type of Industries one was in they were
one of the like 8 million Global Talent
staffing agencies he was running that as
well as something else and he was the
main one that bulked at the moment we
had some other people that said that
they thought it was fine we've had some
people tell us we should charge more on
implementation just depending on the
complexity behind it yeah but I'm just
trying to keep it simple right now just
like it's a flat fee capture recurring
and just move on and then maybe we can I
thought about even creating different
landing pages for different industries
that all go to the same cly and if they
come from like the real estate landing
page it's I'm going to charge you five
but if you come from this one I'm going
to charge you two what am I even here
for that's exactly what I would
suggest okay well great so I'm happy
with that but I guess to me it's I don't
know how to go find these real estate
funds I've got an instantly set up I can
verify leads and I can fire off emails I

[48:01]
verify leads and I can fire off emails I
figur out how to work that but I don't
know how to go find these people because
some of the standard lead finder tools
I've used if I search for Real Estate or
something like that it's going to pull
up like lenders it's going to pull up
property managers that's not who I want
I want like I want the hundred million
and under assets under management like
real estate funds or even PE companies
because we can work with their portfolio
companies so it's like how in the world
do I go find them how do I get their
attention how do I make them like trust
me how do I sell them etc etc but then
also is this even a good idea I guess we
can go back the beginning we even
believe that this is a good service to
offer I think it is I'm biased I think
it's a great service I'm a general
partner in a real estate fund and we buy
two RV parks and campgrounds every
single month and I don't know if my
partner John uses something like this
but I bet he doesn't and this seems like
something we could use and I I would be
a Target customer I think if you're
looking for potential customers have you
looked at Apollo where you can search

[49:01]
looked at Apollo where you can search
for people on LinkedIn by their job
title because I would go to someone that
has the industry of real estate and the
job title of General partner and I bet
there's thousands of guys like
that gotcha and then just upload them
all and just fire off emails hit them
with a couple sequences a few days later
and just try to hit them cuz cuz I was
trying I was thinking something like
that but I was like does is Apollo a
good Apollo and Linkedin is that the
right way it's just I just have no idea
what route to take because I'm like
there's Zoom info there's Apollo there's
clean leads and there's eight million
tools am I even thinking about it
correctly because it's I'm ready to hit
the ground running and I'm ready to help
this other guy get out of his job and
I'm ready to sprint on this because I've
got seven other ideas I also want to get
to and so it's I need to stabilize this
one so I can move on to the other stuff
yeah I would use Apollo to get their
data but I wouldn't use Apollo to DM
them this pitch on LinkedIn I would try
to get as much because this is you're

[50:01]
to get as much because this is you're
going to make one to three grand UPF
front on each customer and so I would
try to reach these guys outside of the
traditional channels even try to get
their cell phone number find them I bet
you anything 60 70% of these guys are on
Strava I would look for them on Strava I
know that sounds crazy but no one is
reaching out to them on straa like so
I'm that goes back to your white whale
right it does it does you were at the
conference right uh I wish I was but no
I wasn't but I I I get your newsletter
and I went and referenced it yeah
talking about it I talked about this
like I so my Twitter account I get a ton
of DMS and I ignore most of them but I
just started on Instagram and nice the I
whenever I get a DM there it's oh I got
a new DM oh I got a new DM hey babe I
got a DM you're right and I'll read it
and I'll I don't respond to the ones
that are obvious spam but like it's just
it's new it's exciting to me and so I
respond to them and so if I'm a general

[51:00]
respond to them and so if I'm a general
partner that's getting pitched stuff
every day in LinkedIn and in my email um
I'm gonna ignore most of it and that's
the name of the game right that doesn't
mean it doesn't work people make money
on LinkedIn and cold email all day every
day but I would start at those R random
one-off places especially find the guys
that have unique names that are easier
to find because then you can cross
reference them on straa and like you
might maybe you send them a cold email
first okay and then reference the cold
email on straa and they're going to feel
sufficiently stocked but that's okay
that's okay yeah whatever because if
honestly if you have what they need and
I think you do then they'll buy anyway
and you're just trying to get their
attention sure sure yeah no that that's
fascinating and so I guess I hadn't
consider it as going after a bunch of
mini whales right where I could
potentially like use use that strategy
cuz I wasn't going after McAfee right
for this I didn't need one when I just
need 100 and if I get to 100 we're doing

[52:00]
need 100 and if I get to 100 we're doing
great the thing is about Wales though
like if you go after if you just take a
sample size of a 100 there's going to be
five to 10 whales in there right you
don't you might not know today who they
are I know this is a fairly new business
but you're going to get one response
that's yeah we have this $50 million
Self Storage fund but we're the
subsidiary of this company that has A5
billion multif family fund and I could
see us using these in all 34 markets
that we're in you're going to get
responses like that and then you're
going to be like oh that's a whale
that's a white whale yeah okay so do you
think a thou back to the cogs question
do you think is that kind of what you're
talking with this guy about a $1,000
flat fee whether it takes a 100 hours or
one yeah yeah we've thrown it out there
and everybody seems to everybody seems
like we're okay with that it could
certainly change if we're cranking out
20 of these a month we might adjust but
I would also get him a Helper and so
it's you can get paid per dashboard even
on the ones like an overseas analyst
helps want so maybe it's a thousand for
the ones you do yourself 500 for the
ones an analyst helps you with I I want

[53:01]
ones an analyst helps you with I I want
it to be a little bit more like he can
eat what he he kills he wants to move to
Mexico lower cost of living and do that
so it's if he makes 120 Grand a year
doing this he's living very well and in
down in Mexico so he's happy with it I'm
happy with it that's what we agreed to I
would suggest that you do this with him
let's say it's a thousand bucks but
let's say you also lean into real estate
or to one vertical and it works you're
going to get insane economies of scale
here to where what what used to take him
20 hours takes two hours I would
definitely work in a tier where it's
listen man when we're doing five of
these a week or five of these a month
I'm going to need to bring this down
because I'm expecting you to get more
efficient it'll still be a net win to
you so let's say if it takes him 10
hours and he's making a thousand bucks
and then it ends up taking him five
hours you'll pay him 700 bucks so it's
still it'll still be a net win for him
but as the longer you stay in this
market and the more success you have
it's just like gravity there is a law
that you will invite more competitors

[54:01]
that you will invite more competitors
even if you're not bragging about it or
talking about it or using influencer
marketing you're going to invite
competitors and you're going to need to
protect those margins you might never
come down on price but you always want
to have that insurance policy to where
you can come down on price if you have
to or else you're G to have this really
uncomfortable conversation with this guy
making a ton of money in Mexico that you
should have had months or years ago but
you didn't so I would just lay that out
beforehand to day to get ahead of that
because if he is knocking out this many
it means he's going to get really good
at it and it means he's going to build
up all this institutional knowledge that
will be harder and harder to implant in
someone else as time goes on sure and I
guess the other a little bit of nuance
to that too is even like the hard part
is the platforms once you learn a
platform then it doesn't matter who's on
it and so that's like also the
Difference Maker so we had a lot of
success with Cloud beds in particular
was the one we worked on which is very
wide used and we could almost even do it
based off a platform it's like when you
start doing more Cloud beds as opposed

[55:01]
start doing more Cloud beds as opposed
to like real estate funds or plumbing
companies it's like if it's Cloud beds
right or it's service Titan as you get
more efficient on those and so that was
the other idea I had was like if we've
had success on cloud beds how do I go
found every cloud beds user like on the
planet and that's like another part
where I don't even know if that's
possible but oh it's possible that it's
possible yes it's all possible I don't
know how to do that but it's again like
that's like where I'm trying to I'm
trying to figure all at this is new to
me here's how you do that you go to
upwork and you ask you post a job asking
if someone can do that and just see what
happens it's an asymmetric bed it'll
take you three minutes and you never
know what comes in I I will say one last
thing I like the idea that you're doing
an audit I think you should test maybe
it's on a separate landing page maybe
not I think you should test a lower
price point even if it's with these guys
that have a lot of money anchor yourself
at a lower price point but with the
additional cost of a quote free audit
because it sounds like you're you have
to do an audit Anyway by nature of what

[56:01]
to do an audit Anyway by nature of what
you're doing and so instead of three
grand maybe it's 2500 with a $500 audit
or 2200 with a $1,000 audit and I think
you're going to learn that the majority
of people opt for that audit and if they
don't then you're going to learn that
your close rate is higher because it's a
lower price point cuz it's cuz you're by
audit just saying like evaluating your
systems are they any good should you
maybe move to something cloud-based or
more modern or is every is their data
firing correctly or you know what I'm
saying no that's fascinating that's
fascinating yeah that gives me a lot of
ideas to attack today and and next week
to start trying to figure out I'll throw
an upward lead on here in a second when
I'm in the car with my wife just go
ahead and throw it up there hey it's
you're a bit of a white will yourself
we'll we'll build a dashboard for you
for free okay awesome yeah so if you
want it just reach out you can also
reach out to to Connor as well he know I
am yeah I'll ask my partner John about
it and I'll get back with you I'll take
you up on that cool that'll work man I

[57:01]
you up on that cool that'll work man I
appreciate the time yeah let's have you
back on in a month and see how it's
going yeah I will come on every week if
you'll let me you're have to start tell
you're gonna have to start declining me
I've got so many questions so okay
sounds sounds like a good time thanks
Thomas yeah talk soon Chris see you man
see you appreciate it yep hey Chris hey
how are you man doing good okay so
you're a tinker you're an engineer right
yeah I would say I'm a engineer
transitioning into a tinkerer probably
so I worked professionally as an
engineer for about 10 years or so and
I've always been jealous of the maker
space people because they get to use
that and change their own lives and so
I've been diving into that over the last
couple years and in my uh little prompt
my kind of like moonshot idea is to come
up with a product that's sellable has a
good addressable market and then build a
company around it and doesn't need to be
right
away but and you have a uh W2 right now
right no right now I have a uh LLC and I

[58:01]
right no right now I have a uh LLC and I
I consult through my LLC with a couple
of Aerospace startups okay so you're
self-employed as a consultant
basically yep and that that pays the
bills that covers
you yeah yeah it's pretty solid right
now I'm actually I have a little bit
more work than I ideally would have
because I would love to spend more time
tinkering and stuff but yeah it's it's a
super solid gig and part of the reason
that I'm not in a rush is I don't want
to want to jump into something that I
enjoy less which I think could be easy
to do I love talking to people like you
that are I'll just I'll simplify it and
say you're a consultant is that accurate
enough yeah yeah because it's not all or
nothing A lot of times people have a W2
and they make a lot of money and they're
like I really want to do this but I
don't want to quit and I'm always like H
don't quit because I want to I don't
want to be the person to tell you to do
that but you have the flexibility of
saying ah I don't really like this
client I don't really like that client
let me keep these three core clients
that it's the 8020 for me and really
build something on the side is that

[59:00]
build something on the side is that
possible totally okay yeah absolutely
and I I'm doing that a little bit now
I've done little Ventures and and even
actually the people that I work with are
they're like good friends so they'll
like let me get away with little
interesting ideas so one of them for
example I I do like structural analysis
and design stuff but I sold one of my
clients a whole bunch of 3D printed
parts that they wanted on a short time
frame and it was like a great return on
investment I got them to pay for me to
get another 3D printer so I could like
up my production rate and up to get all
the parts that they wanted and all this
stuff I decided not to do it again
though because I ended up spending an
entire weekend onboarding a new 3D
printer and just running the thing all
night
um so I've dabbled a little bit with
stuff like that and trying to figure out
what are some other things that I could
yeah I super big pan fan of your podcast
because yeah I love all the like crazy
ideas that you have but thought it might
be interesting to uh see what happens if
you are thinking of that from like a
tinkerer angle yeah no I don't think

[1:00:01]
tinkerer angle yeah no I don't think
I've ever had anyone ask that question
like a specific physical product idea
yeah totally yeah because everyone wants
to do SASS and I get it like yeah it's
and there's a lot of easier ways to make
money I totally get it but I just have
always had a passion for physical things
and I've always also had a passion for
kind of trying to improve people's lives
in these like little simple ways um
something that I just did that was funny
is I got a like a programmable outlet
that you can plug in and you can put
like a timer on it and I hooked it up to
a space heater and then so my wife and I
have have been experimenting with using
like a heater as an alarm clock which
was I was like At first I thought about
that and I was like maybe that could be
a product idea but you can totally build
it with two things from Amazon for 50
bucks definitely solved but I still
think there's definitely room for
product ideas that you can build with
two products from Amazon for 50 bucks
because that's friction and you're
eliminating friction is a whole business

[1:01:00]
eliminating friction is a whole business
in and of itself you're making it easy
and you can even make that the angle
right like you can make that the selling
point whereas there could be something
else that does that exact thing but
their angle is an alarm clock right
that's their unique value proposition
your angle is you're more of you're a
better space heater that also has an
alarm clock does that make sense you're
just framing it different yeah that does
yeah and I guess I couldn't buy it yeah
one of the things I thought it would be
interesting to talk to you about is uh a
lot of people that are in my position
they're looking at it from this angle
where they're like oh what's a
technology I could invent and then I
could patent and then I could license
the intellectual property uh but I think
today the the kind of like threshold of
effort that it takes to get into
e-commerce is so much lower that there's
probably a whole field of things that
are not really protectable from an IP
side but you could still move a couple
hundred, units before all the imitators
catch up and this that's a interesting

[1:02:00]
catch up and this that's a interesting
thought that you had cuz I discarded
that idea cuz I think it would be
difficult for me to beat the bomb cost
of those two parts but maybe I could
just put a enclosure around like the two
two highly rated things from Amazon or
something to Market up yeah look at it
this way I wanted a light in my bedroom
like a programmable light that I could
in our bedroom we have four recess
lights and I wanted the one right above
my side of the bed to be able to turn on
and off with my phone so my wife could
sleep and so my point is I went and
bought there's hundreds of these on
Amazon and I bought one and it has to
come with a hub so you had to plug the
Hub in the wall over there and then you
plug the light in and so that's a little
friction a little janky but I know that
the technology requires it I what is
preventing you from finding a box
manufacturer that can make a different
box that frames it differently and has
your brand and your name on it and then
just getting a a plug and a space heater
and and then getting instructions
printed up and saying here's how you do

[1:03:01]
printed up and saying here's how you do
it you plug this into the wall and then
you plug the space heater into this and
it's you're just piggybacking off two
products that probably hundreds of
companies in China make both of them get
the ones that are the most generic
looking don't have any brands or logos
on them have them go in the same box
take a flyer on a container full of them
and see if you can move
them H okay so this is really
interesting I I guess like the short
answer is nothing right like I could
just go for go do that so some of these
ideas if you need to like inventory
$5,000 worth of parts that's like that I
could handle that it would hurt a little
bit if it all went nowhere it just I
guess not really I'd have to figure out
what to do with all of them so it's like
stuff like that I'm I don't have the
China the like China manufacturer
connections yet I haven't done I don't
know like third party Logistics or first
party Logistics like what it it sounds
like youan towards with this one if we
did if I did try this idea just buy all
the stuff put it in a closet at my house

[1:04:02]
the stuff put it in a closet at my house
and then go around and try and sell it
around town basically so if I were you I
was trying to think of this as you were
talking I would not take a flyer on a
container because that's going to be way
too much money so forget I ever said
that um I would just go to alibaba.com
and just start dming manufacturers of
these two different products and get
them to send you samples first of all
they'll usually do that for free so
you're z z find a space heater and a a
plug like it's just a smart plug right
that you like and get a dozen of them
most of them will probably be free find
two that you like then find someone in
the US that makes custom boxes they'll
probably be1 to $2 a piece get the
minimum order quantity of those printed
call it a 100 or two so you're at a few
hundred bucks now and then order the
same quantity of each the plug and the
space heater and then just print up some
simple instructions
assemble them in your house store them
in your closet and then go to Amazon and

[1:05:01]
in your closet and then go to Amazon and
find out what it takes to ship them
minimum quantity of items and they're
going to want you to label it
specifically it's kind of friction it's
a lot of headache but once you do it
once you can roll any product into that
same account and then you label them
correctly you ship them off to their
distribution centers and see what
happens and it's obviously you've got
some time because people aren't going to
be buy space heaters right now so that
buys you six months to really to nail
the timing on when people are actually
shopping for these things and in the
meantime list them on Facebook
Marketplace list them on Craigslist
people will be looking for used space
heaters so they'll find your just by
nature of the search term they'll find
your new space heers on Facebook
Marketplace you can do that at any time
like you could list that right now and
see if there's demand for it and then
it's just like the Facebook Marketplace
isn't really going to be scalable
because it's mostly local unless you it
could be if you do paid and and you
boost it and you ship but I wouldn't
you're using Facebook Marketplace to get
some feedback on the idea and on the

[1:06:00]
some feedback on the idea and on the
product and then I think it would also
behoove you to make a video that you
could plant with an influencer of some
sort just like a 20 to 30 second video
of just showing how it works and I'm
picturing you could even like you watch
the
office yeah so it's like that episode
where Michael Scott puts the George
Foreman grill by his bed because he
wants to wake up to the smell of bacon
you could superimpose that in the video
somehow and it's like that except for a
space heater and I think that would do
really well on social media but you'll
need to find someone that already has a
presence and just say hey can we take a
flyer on this video that's fair fair use
right yeah I I I don't know I don't know
but better to ask better to ask
forgiveness and permission but nice and
then find one person with 50 100 200,000
followers and just say hey I'll give you
10 bucks from every one you sell most
people will ignore you someone will say
yes and see if you can use the social
media angle as well because I do know a

[1:07:01]
media angle as well because I do know a
lot of people that have sent a random
product to Amazon and just made a ton of
money they're also survivorship bias and
people that have never sold one you just
don't know totally have you ever looked
at jungle
Scout no I've never heard of jungle
Scout check out jungle Scout it'll
enable you to do a ton of research on
competing products and they will tell
you with reasonable accuracy how many of
those products that that every company
is selling it's really cool yeah I was
literally like just wondering how to get
this data it's just basically like sales
data for Amazon products yeah I was just
I was like on Amazon and I was just like
I was like I guess they probably don't
want to like yeah I don't know how
jungle Scout figures it out but they do
that is dope that is really cool yeah I
love these uh suggestions what do you
think about combining Amazon listing
with social media so we if cuz the the
Amazon Seller like approach is nice

[1:08:00]
Amazon Seller like approach is nice
because it's very hands-off so I just
have to get my whatever their minimum
quantity is ship it off a couple times
to get a couple distribution centers and
then and then I don't have to keep them
in my house or mail it myself or
whatever so that's really appealing but
and then it I would think that I could
still do a micro influencer campaign and
then just have people link to my Amazon
page and then additionally I think
people are pretty comfortable with
Shopify websites now as long as that's
like the payment layer and everything
but Amazon's another way to make people
feel comfortable giving their payment
information and I know at least for me I
have a bias towards things that show up
on Amazon because it feels like it I
feel like I can trust the logistics more
you're correct but forget trust for a
minute because what makes Shopify such a
behemoth is the fact that you can really
push paid Facebook ads to these websites
and we'll talk about Shopify for a
second I would go to upwork find someone
that can make a one product Shopify site

[1:09:01]
that can make a one product Shopify site
and they have one product Shopify themes
too because it's very different to sell
one specific product as opposed to just
having a Shopify store that sells even
two to 2,000 products and it's a
different look it's a different feel you
want like countdown timers you need some
apps widgets so find someone don't
reinvent the wheel pay someone four 500
bucks that can make a one-page Shopify
site that's optimized for specifically
for Facebook ads and then use an app a
Shopify app that can ab test your price
points not enough people do this they're
like ah it's not really a clean I love
AB testing yeah I yeah already sold
here's the thing if you're selling a$ 30
to $50 product it's going to be almost
impossible to really scale with Facebook
ads because your cost per acquisition is
going to be about the same and so I
would try testing just stupid price
points $30 $80
$150 and the same ads the same copy to

[1:10:00]
$150 and the same ads the same copy to
different price points on the same
landing page and it will just split your
traffic and then see how that does I
wouldn't count on Shopify this can sell
well like there's so many not to offend
your product dumb items out there that
people make I threw this one out cuz
it's a dumb one I figured this one can
go in the air oh there are things like
uh a little cutter that like you take a
pie and it's like a better pie slicer
and how often does anyone eat pie they
make tens of millions of dollars because
people are stupid and they buy stupid
things right and it goes viral on Tik
Tok or Instagram so this is actually a
utility like we need to stay warm in the
winter it's better than just a normal
space heater I think you can do energy
right to have it kick on only when you
want to be awake yeah that's one of your
selling points yeah yeah I got to make I
could check and see if I didn't check
super hard to see if anybody was already
selling this but you know it passed the
5 Google test probably not going to
after the podcast oh I don't know no I

[1:11:00]
after the podcast oh I don't know no I
would do this though for real and let us
know how it goes okay that's cool and
then so what do you think about the
single product Shopify page versus try
to come up with maybe three similar
throwaway product ideas do them all at
once uh jump up into this is like
jumping into bigger scale you think I'll
that that it's most of the effort is
getting one thing set up so that I
understand the processes or do you think
that like everything that I add is going
to be a lot of extra
complexity it just depends on what types
of products it could be a lot of extra
complexity but if you're in the same
industry or if if you're just importing
space heaters for one idea and the other
one you're like 3D printing a a model
and then you're finding molds in China
That's they're almost two completely
different things so I lean just starting
with this just to learn and then ideas
two through three will go so much
quicker because you'll have learned so
much but if you have seven months until
winter then maybe do try two at the same

[1:12:00]
winter then maybe do try two at the same
time if they're not too
complex okay yeah right now my like
prototyping lab is in storage because
I'm like house hunting and we like move
States and stuff and so it's a better
time for me to try this like fully
external type thing import a space
heater import a timer find a company
that will do a casing for it so are
actually do you know any places to look
for us manufacturers that are interested
in these types of things what I was
Googling before is I was I found a few
companies by looking for injection
molding with direct shipment but
injection molding is more High run is
expensive did you have you were thinking
maybe of some 3D printing companies or
something like that yeah have you looked
at Thomas net no I haven't I've heard of
it though yeah I would check them out
there's that's a a great resource for
all kinds of stuff like this okay yeah
that's awesome yeah yeah yeah this this
been super interesting yeah and and
really fun it's yeah it's I've listened

[1:13:01]
really fun it's yeah it's I've listened
to every episode of your podcast so far
this was funny I yeah I've been like
imagining this conversation for a couple
episodes so well hopefully I didn't let
you down no not at all not at all this
was really fun cool best of luck uh
Clayton and follow up please that's all
I ask is that you follow up and let us
know how it's going yeah I will do all
right man have a good one you too see
you all right that is it for today's
episode of The kerer Office I had a ton
of fun this is one of my favorites we
didn't have as many callers but I think
everyone was really good and insightful
so I hope you enjoyed please like And
subscribe share with your friends yada
yada yada love you all bye
