this freaking guy right here this guy
invented a vending machine that sprays
cologne for $2 a spray with 88% profit
margins supposedly there's a grocery
store in Kazakhstan that makes six grand
a month from one machine if you really
wanted to get smart with it you'd put a
QR code under each bottle where people
can scan it and buy it with an affiliate
link that's drop shipped from someone
else's website you do no work and you
make 15 times what you'd make on one
spray you could put these outside of
bathrooms movie theaters restaurants gym
entrances walkable outdoor shopping
areas it's a brilliant business idea how
cool would it be to have a hundred of
these put them in a 100 different
locations see what works and scale it
from there
