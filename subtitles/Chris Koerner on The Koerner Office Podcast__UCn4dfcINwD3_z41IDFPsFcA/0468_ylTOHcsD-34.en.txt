you know I love a good vending machine
concept this is day nine of showing you
my favorite 2025 business idea so follow
for more here's why this is brilliant so
I'm here in the Seattle Airport and this
is a vending machine that employs a
brilliant concept that's called captive
audience because of the fact that we're
at the airport if you're a mom or a dad

have a pacifier $10 Gerber Puffs $5
yogurt melt $8 these literally cost
three to five times what you would pay
for this at a Walmart you need more than
a really good vending concept to make a
lot of money in vending machine you need
a good location and this is a perfect
location for a concept like this look
what's right next door a daycare this is
where all the parents are going to
congregate and they can't go anywhere
else to get their snacks get a full list
