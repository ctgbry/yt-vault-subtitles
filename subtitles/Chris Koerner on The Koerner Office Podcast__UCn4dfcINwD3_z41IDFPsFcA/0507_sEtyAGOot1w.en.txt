represented in this video that you can
apply to your life to be more awesome
this is day 20 of showing you 202's best
business idea so follow for more number
one no Pride this guy isn't ashamed to
train people out of a storage unit why
would he be believe it or not most
people would be dissuaded from launching
this business because of the fact that
they'd be embarrassed that they'd have
to do it out of a storage unit number
two he's creative most people would
never even think to have a personal
training business out of a storage unit
they'd work harder thinking of a
roadblock to not launch the business
than the work it would take to think of
something creative like this number
three there are always more creative
ways to start businesses you just aren't
thinking hard enough and you know what
bonus number four right here this guy's
going to be a multimillionaire one day
because you know what he told himself
you can just do things who trains people
out of a storage unit won't they think
