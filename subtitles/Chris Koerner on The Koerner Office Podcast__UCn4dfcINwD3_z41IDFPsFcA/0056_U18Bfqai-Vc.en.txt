the easiest way to start a big company
is to find a much bigger company and
borrow their users let me tell you what
I mean and at the end of this I'll tell
you exactly how to do it and list out
all the tools so I listed my RV for sale
on Facebook Marketplace and right away
someone DMD me and said hey we have a
website that sells RVs too can we list
your RV on our website we won't charge
you anything we'll just take a cut of
everything above your current asking
price you don't do any work I said sure
do I what do I have to lose so they did
it they found a buyer they managed all
the paper work they sold it they made
some money I made some money but here's
what I think you should do you should
try this for free do it with golf carts
trailers ATVs heavy equipment anything
Auto message people on Facebook
Marketplace give them the same pitch
send someone out there from Thumbtack to
take professional pictures for a hundred
bucks and you've got a business
