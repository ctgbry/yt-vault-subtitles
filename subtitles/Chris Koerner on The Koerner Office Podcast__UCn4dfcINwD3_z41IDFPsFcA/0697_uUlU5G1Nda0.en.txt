all right real talk most people trying to run
Facebook ads are just lighting money on fire
and it's not because the platform doesn't
work it's not because their product sucks
it's because no one ever sat them down and
explained how this game actually works so
what do they do they boost a post they pick 27
different interests and they throw 500 bucks
at it and then when it flops they blame the
algorithm or worse they give up and I've been
there i've done all that but then I figured it
out i'm still figuring it out but not from a
$10,000 course not from any YouTube rabbit holes
just by running real ads with my own real money
over and over and over until it clicked so this
series is called Facebook Ads for Noobs and if
you stick with me through all five parts I'll show
you everything you need to finally make ads work
especially if you're new but the real reason
to stick around today because at the end of
this I'm going to give you my favorite shortcuts
dirty little hacks and zero budget tricks that I
use to find winners faster than anyone else I
know this is stuff I wished someone handed me

[01:02]
on day one this is a series I needed when
I started now it's yours so let's dive in
here's what you're going to learn part
one foundations understand how Facebook
ads actually work you're going to learn campaign

ad you're going to pick the right objective and
build offers that convert in part two you're going
to build your first campaign it's a stepbystep
walkthrough on how to launch your first ad set
within Ads Manager from targeting and placements
to budget and creatives this gets you live fast
and clean part three is writing ads that convert
you use the hook to the problem to the offer to
the call to action formula to write punchy clear
high converting ad copy including headline tips
image best practices and full examples and part
four is my favorite testing and optimization
you're going to learn the 72-hour rule key metrics
CTR CPC CPM and how to AB test one variable at a

[02:01]
time you're going to diagnose problems and
fix them quickly and part five scaling and
automation how to go from $10 a day to $500 a
day without breaking your campaign budget this
includes targeting lead handling automation and
CRM setup and as a bonus you're going to get my
favorite hacks loopholes and shortcuts the bottom
line is if you follow this playbook you will never
guess what to do with your Facebook ad you won't
have to guess you'll know exactly what to write
where to click and how to scale okay so let's get
into it part one foundations here's what makes
Facebook ads work and why most people never get it
right story time i was sitting with a local HVAC
company owner last summer smart guy he'd been
in business about 12 years or so he asked me to
look at his Facebook ads account here's what I saw
wasn't surprising one boosted post from 2 months
ago a photo of his van and a caption saying "Hey
need AC repair we're here to help call today." No
targeting no strategy no results and that's how
most people run Facebook ads it's why most people

[03:04]
think Facebook ads don't work isn't that a shame
but here's the truth facebook ads still work like
crazy better than ever before you just have to
understand the machine that you're operating so
let's build your foundation right by the time you
finish this chapter you'll be able to run ads like
a grown-up like an expert step one here's what
actually makes a Facebook ad work it's not your
logo it's not your business card design it's not
even the photo although that is important we'll
get to that but what makes a Facebook ad work
is alignment these three things have to line up
number one a clear problem number two a relevant
offer and number three it needs to be shown to the
right person at the right time that's it here's an
example of a problem your trees are blocking your
driveway here's an example of an offer tree
trimming in 24 hours message us for a quote
and here's an example of the right person
homeowners in Mckin Texas with large trees

[04:03]
and disposable income that's it if you hit that
combo game over if you miss one you're burning
money if you miss two you're burning a lot of
money step two understanding the Facebook ad
structure there are three levels to every Facebook
ad campaign number one campaign think of this
as the why what are you trying to accomplish at
the campaign level is it sales is it leads is it
website traffic are you looking for messages more
page engagement most beginners pick the wrong one
and then they blame the algorithm stop blaming
the algorithm don't do that here's how to decide
every campaign has a goal use this objective to
book service calls via DMs drive messages drive
sales on a site maybe you want conversions to
collect emails or leads or just leads maybe you
want more eyeballs and maybe you want more reach
on your video which isn't very common and I will
say if you're a local business 90% of the time
you should start with messages it's the highest

[05:00]
intent it's the easiest to convert and it gives
you instant feedback after the campaign is the
ad set level this is the who when and where
who are you targeting where will your ads be
shown instagram Facebook feed Instagram stories
Facebook stories how much are you spending this
is where most of the money is made or lost here
at the ad set level we'll go deep into targeting
later but here's the short version you want to
start broad let the algorithm work dial it in as
you go if you start niche from the beginning then
you'll never know what you're missing out on and
the most granular level to this three- tier system
is the ad just to recap campaign ad set and then
ad this is the what this is what your prospect
actually sees it includes the creative which is
a fancy way of saying the image or the video the
caption which is the primary text and then the
headline also this is where you'll see the call
to action button maybe that's shop learn more or
message us now this is where the click happens
or it doesn't and 95% of people start here which

[06:00]
is a mistake if your campaign and your ads set
aren't right your creative will not save you now
step three you're going to pick the right campaign
objective so let's keep it simple if you pick the
wrong campaign Facebook literally optimizes for
the wrong people here's what I mean if you choose
traffic as the objective Facebook will show your
ad to people who are known clickers not buyers not
message senders in fact they're probably less
likely to click in fact they're probably less
likely to buy than the average clicker because
they're just clickers they're not clickers and
buyers these people don't convert they're just
curious scrollers here's a little cheat sheet
for you if you want messages in your inbox you
choose messages if you want to collect names and
emails you choose leads if you want someone to buy
something on your website you choose conversions
if you want views on a real or a video you just
choose video views but you got to know why you're
doing that first so that's a really easy way to
light your money on fire don't try to get clever
don't overthink it just pick one that aligns
with your goal now step four this is the anatomy

[07:03]
of a killer offer don't skip this if your offer
sucks your ad will suck doesn't matter how good
the creative is once again your creative will not
save you so here's what a good offer looks like
you want a clear solution to a painful problem
with a timeline and a path to action here's two
examples here's a bad offer we offer expert HVAC
services call today no too vague no timeline no
hook throw it out here's a great offer your AC
out we'll diagnose it in 60 minutes and fix it
same day message us to book your time the second
one sells because it solves a specific problem
for a specific person and it sets expectations it
gives them a reason to act now write this down the
tighter the offer the better the ad will perform
okay now step five avoid the boost post trap this
deserves its own section never boost a post ever
without exception boosting is Facebook's easy

[08:00]
button for people who don't understand Ads Manager
it gives you almost no control whatsoever over who
sees the ad what goal you're optimizing for what
your budget is actually doing it's like trying to
run a marathon with rollerblades on your knees it
looks like a shortcut but it'll wreck you always
use Meta Ads Manager it gives you full control and
once you understand it which you will by the end
of video you'll never go back and step six you're
going to build a strategic foundation before
you ever click publish before you ever open Ads
Manager answer these five questions who is this
ad for two what problem do they have right now
three what solution am I offering them four what
proof do I have that I can deliver and five what
is the one action I want them to take if you can't
answer all five of these questions then don't run
the ad this quick little 10-minute exercise will

[09:00]
save you $1,000 in wasted ad spend all right step
seven here's some real world examples from start
to finish let's say I'm running Facebook ads for a
local tree trimming company here's how I'd set it
up campaign objective messages ad set the location
is going to be 10 mile radius around McKenna Texas
the age 30 to 65 plus the targeting homeowners
no fancy interest needed the placement is going
to be manual and then Facebook feed Instagram
feed Instagram stories i don't want Facebook
to show it anywhere it wants to show it i don't
trust Facebook with this part of the system yet
my budget's going to be 15 bucks a day now my
ad creative once again creative is a fancy word
for your picture or your video i'm going to do a
before and after picture of a trimmed tree those
sell here's the caption branches over your roof
we'll trim clean and haul away in 24 hours get
a free quote in 30 seconds no pressure just
fast work headline: tree over your roof call
to action send message remember home services
you want the call to action to be send message

[10:04]
this exact ad has gotten leads for under $5 for
us if we go to Thumbtac to buy leads it costs over
$50 and I've used variations of this for home
service pros realtors HVAC even mobile dog
groomers you don't need to be clever you need to
be clear all right my final thoughts on part one
this is the foundation that most people skip they
rush into writing ads without understanding what
they're actually telling Facebook to do that's
like getting in a car and never checking the GPS
remember when Michael Scott drove the car into the
lake exactly here's your mantra for every ad you
ever run goal is better than audience audience
is better than creative in that order always if
you get the strategy right Facebook ads become
a cheat code if you don't you'll end up tweeting
Facebook ads are dead like every other frustrated
business owner they're not dead two we're going
to build our first Facebook campaign step by
step most people talk about Facebook ads like

[11:01]
it's rocket science it's not but you do need
to know what buttons to click and what traps
to avoid this chapter is all about execution if
you follow it word for word you'll have a fully
functioning campaign live by the end of the day
today it won't be perfect but it'll be running and
that's more than 98% of people ever do so let's
get into it step one open Meta Ads Manager don't
boost a post don't use your business page use the
real tool go to business.fas.com facebook.com and
ask and access Meta Ads Manager this is where all
the magic happens if it's your first time Facebook
might walk you through a setup wizard you can skip
most of it because you're listening or watching
this you want to get to the dashboard where you
can create a campaign set up an ad set and launch
an ad if that sounds intimidating don't worry
i'll walk you through each part step two create
a new campaign click the green plus create button
you'll get a list of campaign objectives here's
how to choose the right one use this cheat sheet
if you want to drive more sales on your website

[12:01]
click sales if you want people to message you you
click messages want to collect leads with a form
you click leads you want views on a video click
video views we kind of went over this on the last
section if you want brand awareness wrong book
close this tab let's say you're a local service
provider or coach or a consultant start with
messages you can switch to something more advanced
later name your campaign something that makes
sense i like this format service objective date
here's an example tree trimming messages September
2025 then you click continue step three campaign
settings most of these can stay default for now
your campaign objectives is set to your choice
like messages special ad categories leave this
blank unless you're in real estate employment or
credit ab test we'll talk about this later but for
now you're going to skip it and advantage campaign
budget leave that off for now now you're going
to click next to move into the ads set level step
four ads set this is the money layer this is where
most of your success will come from and here's how

[13:00]
to get it right number one conversion location
if you choose messages set it to messaging apps
number two daily budget start with $10 to $20 per
day if you're nervous start with five bucks just
know it's going to take even longer to learn
what works and time is money step three start
date that's going to be today no end date needed
but keep an eye on it four is the audience this
is where people get lost don't use Advantage
Plus audience yet it used to be called broad
targeting yes really if you're targeting locally
that's already your targeting facebook knows
who's likely to message businesses like yours if
you still want more control use these settings
location will be current city plus 10 to 15 mile
radius age is going to be 28 to 65 plus because
most conversions are coming from 30 plus year
olds gender is going to be all unless you have
a good reason to filter and on detailed targeting
you're going to start broad you could add one or
two interests if you must like home improvement
or landscaping or small business owner for B2B

[14:04]
services but just be careful facebook's algorithm
does better with more room to optimize it wants to
have control so narrow targeting usually hurts you
more than it helps you and then number five is the
placement you're going to click manual placements
and uncheck everything except Facebook's feed
Instagram's feed and Instagram stories facebook
Marketplace I could give or take depending on the
industry it often works pretty well for local
businesses but avoid Messenger inbox instream
video reels audience network etc these always
drive cheap clicks but not conversions then
you click next to get to the actual ad this is
the most granular layer of the three-level set
like we've talked about step five this is the ad
creative this is what people see this is where
most people spend way too much time and get too
little in return so here's how to keep it tight
and effective you want to make sure the correct
Facebook page and Instagram account are selected

[15:01]
this can get a little hairy on the format you
want to choose a single image or a video don't use
carousels yet cuz you don't know what you're doing
same to be said with slideshow keep it simple then
you upload the creative if you don't have a video
just use a clean picture that matches what you're
selling like a before and after if you can't get
a good picture use your iPhone real photos almost
always beat stock images and then your primary
text that's your caption this is going to be the
paragraph right above your image you're going
to use this framework hook to problem problem
to offer offer to call to action so for tree
trimming it's going to be something like "Tired
of that huge branch hanging over your house we'll
trim clean and haul it away within 24 hours."
Fast clean and no pressure message us to get
started within 30 seconds speak directly be
human solve a problem and then the headline this
is the bold line right under the image you're
going to keep it short tree over your roof get
a quote in 30 seconds ac not cooling we'll fix
it today and then the call to action button is
going to be send message for a home service if

[16:03]
you're pushing to a landing page just make it
learn more then step six of this section you're
going to review and you're going to publish and
on the adset location and budget the targeting
is going to be broad or advantage plus you're
only running ads on feeds and stories this is
stuff you're confirming right before you submit
it you're going to make sure your creative is
clear and connected to your offer and then you're
going to click publish you're going to take a deep
breath because you just launched your first ad
campaign what happens next well after you publish
Facebook is going to review your ad it usually
takes less than 24 hours sometimes it can take
longer and after it's approved your job is to not
touch it i know it's tempting you want to tweak
but unless something is obviously broken like a
misspelling or a wrong photo don't change anything
for 72 hours this is the learning phase it's
literally what it's called so let the algorithm
do its job and then step eight what you're going
to expect here is if your offer is strong and your
targeting is local you can likely expect to pay
$2 to $6 per message the click-through rate will

[17:02]
be about 1% or higher and you're going to get
your first lead within one to two days now the
quality of your messages is going to depend on
your ad copy and who's running your pages inbox
respond fast be human close the deal and step nine
if you don't get results this is where most people
quit don't here's how to troubleshoot if nobody
clicks your ad your hook or your photo is weak
so try something punchier a better line or a
better image if people click but they're not
messaging your call to action might be unclear
so simplify the copy make the offer stronger and
if people are messaging and you're not closing
these deals then you got to improve your speed
to respond even if you have to use a script you
want to offer clear next steps time slot price
phone call and then to wrap up part two here you
just launch your first Facebook ad campaign that
alone puts you ahead of most small business owners
but we're not going to stop here you're going to
get results yes but more importantly you're going
to learn fast and the more you spend per day the

[18:01]
faster you learn and after here we're going to
get into testing optimization retargeting and
scaling but don't skip ahead let the ad run let
it collect data let it teach you every day it
runs another data point then we'll tweak here's
how to write ads that actually convert even if
you're not a quote copywriter so here's the
part that everyone overthinks writing the ad
most people stare at the empty caption box like
it's a term paper then they either ramble like
a college essay or they try to write like a brand
and both of those approaches kill result remember
what I said you don't need to be cute you need to
be clear because at the end of the day Facebook
ads are a permission slip for someone to say "Yeah
I'll take a closer look that's it." So let's break
down exactly how to write high-erforming Facebook
ad copy even if you've never written an ad in your
life don't go buy a copywriting course step one
know what you're actually writing you're writing
for three things number one the scroll this is
the hook will this stop the scroll will it stop

[19:00]
someone in their tracks two you're writing for the
skim the structure can they understand the offer
without having to read every word and number
three the third S the spark the action does it
make them want to message you click or buy every
part of your ad should serve one of those three
goals all right now step two you're going to use
this four-part framework because every ad I write
has some version of this the hook the problem
the offer the call to action so let's break it
all down number one the hook the first line this
is the scroll stopper hopefully if the first line
is weak they're gone spend as much time on the
first line as you spend on everything else if
not more it should feel like something someone
would want to say out loud one example could be
"Tired of branches scratching your roof every time
it storms?" Or "Your AC shouldn't take three hours
to cool the house." Or "Your driveway should
be powerwashed here's why." Or "What's under
your carpet will make you cringe." All of these
statements offer imagery and it gets the reader

[20:05]
close to feeling something you're not trying to
be poetic you're trying to wake someone up and
never ever start your ad with something like "Hey
Plano friends," or "We're a local family-owned
business." Nobody cares they don't care about you
yet so start with the pain point or the curiosity
now you want to touch on the problem this is
where you empathize you show them you understand
for example we've all let our trees grow too long
but when they start scraping the roof or blocking
the sidewalk it becomes more than just a nuisance
now think about it you're not pitching them yet
you're relating to them two sentences max and now
your offer this is where you tell them what you're
actually going to do for them so be specific
use numbers include a time frame make it low
pressure for example we'll trim your trees clean
the debris and haul it away usually same day our
average job takes 90 minutes and quotes are always
free use real numbers fast doesn't mean anything

[21:04]
same day does and then your call to action tell
them exactly what to do next a good call to action
is something like "Message us for a quote in 30
seconds or click send message to get a price right
now or tap learn more to schedule your spot." A
bad call to action contact us if interested visit
our website let us know you're not asking you're
directing and for step three of this section how
long should your ad be here's the truth both
short and long copy can work but the rule you
want to use short copy when your photo does the
selling photos say a thousand words right so let
your photo do the work for you use longer copy
when your service or offer needs more explanation
here's an example of short copy ac out we'll fix
it today message us now for fast service this
works really great if your image shows the problem
clearly like a broken unit or a tech in a uniform

[22:02]
here's an example of long copy if your house takes
more than 20 minutes to cool off something's wrong
and your energy bill is probably suffering so
we offer sameday diagnostics fix most issues in
one visit and quotes are always free message us
now to get on the schedule so you're using the
longer copy when your service is less understood
and remember you're trying to build trust here
in a millisecond you're selling high ticket okay
quick pause what if you had an employee who worked
24/7 answering leads building funnels tracking
conversions and you didn't even have to pay them
a salary well that's exactly what you get with
Highle's new AI employee and right now they're
giving you 30 days free as part of their summer
of AI promo and after that it's just 97 bucks a
month way less than you'd ever pay a human and it
doesn't even ask for lunch breaks or vacation time
so check out the link in the description below
and let AI handle all the grind for you all right
now step four of this section headlines that hook
the headline is the bold line under the image it's

[23:04]
short it's visible and it matters more than you
think so here are some proven headline formats you
can go for the problem first option trees blocking
your driveway ac not cooling fast enough or you
can go for the results focused option fixed in
90 minutes or less cleaner gutters in 24 hours
or you can go with the offer forward option
free estimates message now $25 off your first
trim job the bad headlines sound like taglines
excellence in every cut here for all your HVAC
needs remember you're not branding here you're
not Coca-Cola you're selling use plain language
that implies value step five you want creative
that converts even if you don't have a video
team if you've got a great video use it but most
of the time a strong photo is all that you need
so here's what I consider to be the hierarchy of
what works again this is the third time before

[24:01]
and after photos always crush action shots you or
your team work you're cutting down a tree faces
work great they're relatable and selfie style
shots always convert better than a polished
stock photo product in use you want to show the
result not the product you're selling the sizzle
not the stake and on the graphics/ext overlays
only mess with these if you know what you're doing
and if you do know what you're doing then try to
test with and without if you're just a beginner at
this which you probably are and that's okay just
take 10 photos on your iPhone pick the clearest
one and run with it you can even upload all 10
to ChatGpt and say which one is the clearest
you'll make it prettier later but right now you
need data and step six here's a few different
ad examples that you can steal today i'm going
to be a little redundant in this to drive the
point home but stick with me please tired of
branches over your roof we will trim clean up
and haul it all away usually same day click send
message to get your free quote now the headline

[25:00]
for this one would be tree over your roof and the
call to action would be send message now here's
for a local cleaning service your home deserves
more than a surface clean we deep clean kitchens
bathrooms and common areas without harsh chemicals
or rush service our team is vetted trusted and
always on time message us to get your free quote
in 30 seconds the headline for this one would be
"Need a deeper clean?" And the call to action you
guessed it send message here's about a dog groomer
now here's what a dog groomer might use hate the
trip to the groomer we come to you bath cut nails
and more all in your driveway friendly team fair
pricing and your dog stays calm and happy remember
we're selling the result message now to schedule
your pet's spa day and the headline would be "We
come to you." The call to action you guessed it
send message all right step seven on this section
don't sound like a business sound like a person
people buy from people not from corporations this
is where most people blow it they write like this
as a locallyowned and operated business we strive

[26:02]
to provide top tier customer satisfaction with
over 15 years of experience in Stop stop stop
first of all you always want to use a fifth to
seventh grade reading level okay nobody talks
like that and nobody reads past the first line of
that but you're spending money for that first line
so instead write like this been in business 15
years still show up on time both those sentences
are five words long still return calls still clean
up before we leave that's how we do it just feels
different doesn't it that's how you want to
sound and my final thoughts on part three this
is the part that most people either overpolish or
rush through you're going to do neither of those
things your job is to speak clearly you're going
to solve a problem and you're going to make the
next step obvious facebook ads are not a writing
contest this isn't high school they're a clarity
contest so say less mean more use real words show
real proof and most importantly write like a human

[27:00]
who understands what your customer actually
needs that's how you win okay part four we're
getting through this testing and optimization
here's what to do when your ad either flops or
starts to work because launching a Facebook ad
is not the finish line it's the starting line
most people hit publish they stare at the screen
for two days and then they start tweaking stuff
with no plan they treat ads like slot machines
they pull the lever they hope it hits you're
not going to do that you're going to test with
purpose you're going to watch the right numbers
not all the numbers and when something works
or doesn't you're going to know exactly what
to change so let's get into it step one here's the
72-hour rule write this down do not touch your ad
for 72 hours unless it's completely broken like
the wrong photo a typo or it's rejected leave it
alone facebook needs time to exit the learning
phase that's when the algorithm is figuring out
who your ideal customer is if you change anything
major like the budget the creative or the audience

[28:02]
you're going to reset the clock so let it learn
step two understand the metrics that matter
you'll see a dozen different metrics inside Ads
Manager it's overwhelming i know most of them are
just noise here are the five that do matter ctr
click-through rate or choose the right how many
people clicked your ad after seeing it good is
going to be 1% or higher sometimes it can be much
higher than this depending on the industry if it's
under half a percent your hook or your image needs
work so start there first number two CPC cost
per click how much you're paying for a click or
a message under $2 great under $1 very great once
again this is industry dependent if you're selling
legal services under $20 might be great if it's
over three bucks all else equal something's going
to be off it's usually going to be the creative
or the targeting number three is the CPM the
cost per mill the cost per thousand impressions or
views this is your baseline and it's going to vary

[29:01]
by industry 10 to 25 bucks is pretty typical for
local service ads if it's super high like $40 plus
then your targeting is probably too narrow then
you've got your link clicks versus your landing
page views this is only going to be relevant if
you're sending traffic to a site if you have way
more clicks than views your site is either slow
or broken then you've got the rorowaz return on
ad spend this is the north star especially for
ecom and digital product sellers a $1 rorowaz
means you're breaking even it means you're getting
a dollar back for every dollar you spend but that
doesn't account for your other overhead or cost so
you're really losing money two to$4 means you're
profitable and you could consider it a dollar or
a multiplier i consider it a multiplier so if my
rorowaz was four I would consider that 4x i get a
four times return on every dollar I put in now for
services you're probably tracking leads instead
of net dollars gained but it's the same idea are
you getting more than what you're spending and
step three we're going to learn how to AB test

[30:02]
like a grown-up because most people quote test
by throwing up five different ads and hoping
that one of them works that's not testing that's
chaos you're going to be testing like a scientist
so only test one variable at a time that's it one
thing don't pull more than one lever at a time or
you don't know what lever made the difference
if you change your image your headline your
targeting your call to action all at once and
your performance improves great what did you
do you have no way of replicating that you want
clarity not chaos so here's what you're going to
test in this order start with the most impactful
the creative which is the image or the video this
has the biggest impact on click-through rate test
a photo against a video test two different styles
maybe clean verse cluttered bright verse muted
next you want to test the primary text or the
caption try a new hook a short hook versus a long
hook an offer verse curiosity then you could try
testing the headline clarity versus urgency which
would be something like free estimate today verse

[31:03]
tree hanging over your house and then you can
start messing around with the audience advantage
plus verse custom targeting cold interest verse
lookalike then you can test the placement feed
only verse feed plus stories only change this once
you have a winning ad because if the ad wins in
one feed it'll probably win in another and then
you can think about testing the objective this is
if you're stuck if messageages isn't working try
leads if leads isn't working try conversions just
know that every time you switch this it's going
to reset the learning now if you want to run
a true AB test the first option is to use Meta's
built-in AB testing tool which you can find under
the experiments tab and the next option is to just
do it manually duplicate the adset and change one
of the variables remember one of the variables
split the budget evenly between the two let both
of them run for 3 to 5 days keep the winner kill
the loser rinse and repeat all right step four

[32:01]
of this section here's what to do when your ad
isn't working so we're going to break down these
scenarios to know what to fix here's what to do
when nobody is clicking number one again check the
image first then strengthen the hook then make the
offer tighter more specific then shorten the copy
if people are clicking but they're not messaging
or buying your landing page is probably garbage
or your call to action is probably unclear now if
people are messaging you but you're not closing
you're probably too slow to reply or maybe your
prices are too high maybe you sound like a robot
in your replies maybe you're not answering their
core question maybe you're just sticking to the
script too much now if you're getting clicks but
they're too expensive then try broader targeting
or change your image believe it or not ugly real
photos often outperform clean Canva graphics you
can test shorter copy you can switch from desktop
to mobile placements only all right now step five
this is retargeting 101 once you've had a few
hundred clicks or messages it's time to build

[33:05]
your second ad this one is for warm traffic people
who saw your ad or visited your site but never
converted and here's why retargeting works people
get distracted there's a lot of competition for
attention nowadays they don't trust you yet they
need to see you twice or 20 times before they ever
buy here's a good example of a retargeting ad hey
saw you checking us out but didn't message if you
still got that big branch hanging over your roof
we're ready when you are don't forget we'll trim
it clean it up and be gone in 90 minutes and
you're going to only show this ad to people who
interacted but didn't end up messaging you you can
also show it to people that viewed your Instagram
profile or people that engaged with your website
or people that went to your website but never did
anything the budget you set on a retargeting ad
is going to be low $3 to5 a day it's just going
to run quietly in the background okay step six now
we're going to talk about your creative rotation
and ad fatigue because even the best ads will burn
out here's how you know your click-through rate

[34:05]
drops or your cost per click starts rising you've
seen this ad six times in a week yeah it's going
to get stale so what do you do swap the copy keep
the image just don't kill the entire thing tweak
one thing remember pull one lever at a time you
want to refresh creatives every two to three weeks
depending on how big your budget is just use the
data don't get emotional about it and step seven
here's what to scale and when to scale let's say
you've tested you've got a winner now what don't
double your budget overnight people do this all
the time that kills the learning phase you want
to scale slowly increase your budget by like 20 to
30% every 3 to 4 days or you could just duplicate
the adset and assign a higher budget to the new
one and then once again 72 hours watch the results
before scaling again and only scale ads that are
profitable getting consistent results not showing

[35:00]
signs of fatigue and once you've scaled the ad
start testing new audiences with the same winning
creative or you could test new creatives with your
winning audience keep that flywheel going baby
and to wrap up part four here testing is how you
stop guessing you're not here to be creative for
the sake of it you're here to get results so run
clean tests watch real metrics and optimize with
intention scale what works kill what doesn't and
do it all over again this is where the beginners
become pros it's the ones who treat Facebook
ads like a system not a slot machine those are
the guys who win okay part five we're going to
get into scaling and automation how to go from
$10 a day to $500 a day or $5,000 a day without
everything breaking so in parts one through four
you got your ad off the ground part five is
what gets it flying this is the part where
the I boosted a post and got nothing crowd starts
to fade and and you start building real leverage
you've launched you've tested you found something
that works now it's time to scale so let's talk

[36:03]
about real quick how to spend more money without
ruining your results because that's one of the
hardest things even for the most adept agency
owners and also let's talk about how to optimate
the backend so you're not glued to your inbox or
your screen 24/7 step one here's how to know when
you're ready to scale don't scale just because
you're bored don't scale just because it's been
72 hours you're going to scale when you've got
repeatable proof and here's what that looks like
your click-through rates above 1% your cost per
lead or message is profitable results have been
consistent for at least 5 to seven days you're
getting actual customers not just engagement not
just clicks and if all four of these things are
true you're going to be ready step two here's how
to scale without killing your ad again scaling
too fast is one of the most common ways to break
a good ad so here's your two options number one
you can scale slow and steady you can increase
your daily budget by 20 to 30% every 3 days you'll
monitor your performance closely if your metrics

[37:06]
hold steady or improve then you repeat if they
fall apart then scale back to the last stable
number that you experienced this is the safe path
but it takes more time option two is to duplicate
and scale duplicate your winning ad set again you
might risk showing the same ads to the same people
and Facebook not accounting for that properly
you'll want to assign a higher daily budget to the
new one the new ad which will be like two to three
times the original budget and leave the original
untouched let both of them run at the same time
and see which performs better this gives you speed
with a safety net and if the scaled version tanks
you still have the original chugging along and you
don't want to scale your creative that's over
three weeks old ads fatigue rotate the creative
first and then scale all right now step three this
is what I call the scaling framework you're going
to use this to decide how aggressively you want to
scale if your daily spend is $5 to $20 then your

[38:04]
scaling strategy should be to test and gather data
and run it for 7 days if your daily spend is 20 to
$200 then optimize your creative and targeting
and begin to scale slowly if your daily spend
is $100 to $250 then duplicate winners and expand
to new audiences and if your daily spend is $250
to 500 then layer in retargeting which we just
talked about add in new offers and rotate your
creatives every week so scaling isn't just about
the budget it's also about multiplying what's
already working more money only works when your
system is solid and step four here's how you're
going to automate your lead handling so you don't
burn out because scaling your ad is useless if you
can't keep up with all the leads and many people
get overwhelmed they get too many messages they
forget to follow up they have slow response times
and the leads go cold so you need a system here's
my three-part lead handling stack number one
autorely this is within Messenger or Instagram
meta has these built-in tools to set up an instant
reply such as "Hey got your message we'll get back

[39:04]
to you ASAP but if it's urgent call us you want
to buy yourself time and set expectations number
two is a CRM or a lead tracker like high level at
a bare minimum use a Google sheet you just want
to get their name the contact info and the date
contacted and the status are they booked closed
are they in progress or what and you're going to
update this every day no excuses better yet just
use High Level to make this easy you can get a
big discount with it at the link in the show notes
especially if you have multiple leads per day in
part three of my three-part lead handling stack
you need templates for fast replies so write out
five to 10 of the most common replies in advance
replies to things such as price time slots scope
of work let me talk to my spouse people asking
for testimonials etc store these replies in a
Google doc and copy paste them as needed this is
going to be your first step at removing yourself
from the inbox okay step five you are going to
automate your adfunnel without having to hire a
team here's how to build an ad funnel that runs

[40:01]
like a machine start with a primary ad this is
your cold ad it runs to new people every day top
of funnel your objective is going to be messages
or leads your budget $ 20 to $100 a day and your
audience is going to be a broad or a lookalike
audience then you're going to add a retargeting
layer this ad only runs to people who have already
seen or interacted with your original ad your
objective on this one is going to be conversions
or messages and your budget is going to be $3 to
$10 a day and then your audience is going to
be a custom audience of website visitors or
ad engagers video viewers etc the creative for
these ads is going to be even more personal more
urgency because these people have already engaged
with you before something like "Still thinking
about getting your trees trimmed we've got three
open slots this week message now to claim one."
And then this one's optional you want to add a
nurture layer this is going to be a follow-up
ad that targets people 7 to 10 days later with
valuable content testimonials or education so you
can stay top of mind you need them to see you more
than once cuz they're going to convert on their

[41:03]
own schedule not yours and then step six is going
to help you track what actually matters now that
you're spending real money you need to track like
a real business at a minimum use a Google sheet
to track daily spend leads generated cost per
lead sales made and revenue collected all right
now for step seven here's what scaling actually
looks like with real examples example one your
local HVAC company you start at 10 bucks a day you
ran one message ad for same day diagnostics and
within 10 days you dropped your cost per lead to
$3 then you scaled to $60 a day you hired a second
tech and you're cranking example two you're an
online course you started with a lead ad that was
$15 a day you built an email list with a free
guide you retargeted leads with a $97 offer
and then you scaled your ad spend to $200 a day
example three my personal favorite tree trimming
side hustle so you ran a single before and after
image ad to messages you started with $5 a day

[42:00]
budget and you booked four jobs in your first week
now you scale to $40 a day you've got two crews
running full-time none of these examples are fancy
but they're realistic and they're dialed in my
final thoughts on part five scaling is not magic
it's math if you can turn $20 into $200 then turn
40 into 400 but only if you can keep up with the
demand only if you've got a good system in place
and only if you know what you're tracking because
the difference between an ad that makes you $200
and an ad that makes you $20,000 is execution and
repetition so keep your foot on the gas but don't
press any harder until the wheels are straight all
right if you've made it this far you're not a noob
anymore you're dangerous now but I promised I'd
give you my favorite shortcuts this is the stuff
that shaves off weeks of your learning and most
importantly it gets you to profitability faster
so let's get into it shortcut number one stalk
the winners go to the meta ads library google
it search for your competitors sort by active
ads scroll through and ask are they running

[43:03]
video or static what are their headlines look
like filter these ads by active date if you can
find an ad for your from your competitor that's
been running for months that ad is a killer copy
it are they using long copy or short what kind of
hook are they using what kind of image if they're
spending money on it right now and they seem like
a sophisticated competitor it's probably working
shortcut number two the comment trap if you don't
have social proof fake it run what's called a PP
campaign which is post purchase engagement this is
the best way to warm up you're going to run this
campaign to your best warm audience people like
friends past buyers followers commenters engagers
then you're going to take the post ID from this ad
and reuse it in your cold campaigns now it looks
like a hot ad there's social proof there's
comments there's likes shortcut number three
you're going to duplicate the winners and fast
the second you see an ad perform above average

[44:01]
duplicate it change one thing a new hook a new
thumbnail new headline don't wait for 5 days
of data scale horizontally because the winners
fade fast shortcut number four if you don't have
creative then use testimonials ask three customers
to record a 15-second video about your product or
their experience it's got to be vertical it's got
to have bad lighting i'm telling you for whatever
reason these perform better authenticity wins
every time you're going to use these as reals or
story ads they're cheap they're fast they're high
trust shortcut number five you're going to skip
all those expensive testing platforms you may have
heard about you don't need highros or triple whale
or post-purchase surveys when you're starting
up just keep it simple run three ads look at the
click-through rate the CPM and the comments you'll
know if it's good or not so don't overthink it
you can also take your existing audience and run
interest mining tests these are going to be DMs a
poll or a survey even if just in your Instagram
story stuff like "What's your biggest struggle

[45:03]
right now and then if people vote on it DM them
and ask more specifics about why they voted you're
going to screenshot their answers and use that
exact language in your ad copy now you know you're
getting to the heart of the problems your copy now
speaks like your market because it is your market
shortcut number six you're going to run your ad
scripts as tweets this is a little wild but before
you spend a dollar on a video ad post the hook
or headline as a tweet or an Instagram caption
so you run these ads organically to test if it
performs well organically it'll likely perform
well in the paid if it flops you save money you
can delete it if it pops you got a winning angle
before you even launch and the last one this is
my favorite sell it before you build it run ads
for an idea before you even have the product make
a page use lovable or card to build a landing page
take pre-orders collect emails if no one clicks
you learn for cheap if you get orders but you
can't fulfill refund them you at least have proof
at that point that's it i mean you're pretty close

[46:04]
to being an expert now there's no fluff this isn't
theory this is what I've done it works so go run
an ad and if you get stuck watch this all over
