this is a brilliant business idea it's
called project Sky Drop and it is a re
life treasure hunt that lasts 21 days
they place 10 o of real gold in the
middle of the woods somewhere and then
on day one they show a circle that's 500
mi in diameter and anyone in the world
can go find the gold and every day the
circle shrinks a little bit if you pay a
$20 entry fee then half of it goes to
increase the Bounty and the other half
goes to the business owners in exchange
for the $20 you get extra Clues and tips
the general public doesn't get on day 21
the diameter of the circle is only 1
foot and it will surely be found by then
the winner must record himself finding
the gold and post it publicly to YouTube
as proof right now the Bounty is at
$87,000 but what's the most brilliant is
how people can copy this idea anywhere
they are you can even get local sponsors
to advertise the event to make even more
