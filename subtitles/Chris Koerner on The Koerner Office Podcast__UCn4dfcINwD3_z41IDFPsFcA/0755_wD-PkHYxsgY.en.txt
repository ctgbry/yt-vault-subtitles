[00:00]
Let's say someone's listening and they
want to get to 20K a month profit.
&gt;&gt; To me, these are easy oneperson [music]
businesses that can go and print that
degree of money. It's not a complicated
thing. If you're the average American
working for somebody, stressed out on
the clock, [music] no freedom, no real
road map to making more money, now is
like the best time to shrink your goals
down and say, "If I could double my
income and cut my stress in half." It's
the prito principle of what we do.
That's it. I haven't even gotten married
yet and I made money selling a divorce
product. [laughter] Like it's I think
the best way to win with this or any
lead genen business is to
you ever notice how there are certain
income levels that are like very
transformative for people. 10K a month
is a really good living in the vast
majority of cities in the world. 20K a
month that's just kind of a different
level of lifestyle. And I think a lot of
people aspire for that 20 to 30k per
month number. So we wanted to start

[01:00]
month number. So we wanted to start
there in this episode and work backwards
and come up with some creative ideas
that don't require employees, that don't
require a big upfront investment of
getting to 20K a month in net profit.
This is probably the 15th time that Sam
has been on the podcast. He's great. I
wouldn't keep having him on if he wasn't
great. You're just going to love this
episode. So, I'm sitting in the in the
Grow Faster call and I was talking about
how there's so many different like
verticals that you can go into and I was
talking about planning our wedding and
how on Etsy there's 9 million wedding
planning templates and books and like
checklists that you can buy, like all of
this stuff. And as I was talking about
it, I was like, well, the wedding market
is humongous. And at least the stats in
the United States is like 50% of these
John's are ending in divorce. So who's
got the divorce market, right? If like
&gt;&gt; a handful of lawyers,
&gt;&gt; right? You're like, dude, there's all
these like the not.com, like there's all

[02:00]
these like the not.com, like there's all
of these massive businesses built on the
wedding industry. Mhm.
&gt;&gt; And then the dark side of that is the
50% of them that end. And so you're
still having a massive market that's
sitting there on on the flip side. And
so, you know, just started doing some
keyword research, just kind of like
seeing what it was. And and to your
point, most of the material out there
was pushing to just like lawyers. Like
all of that is divorce attorneys. And
people don't really like their divorce
attorneys very much. And so I was like,
"All right, that's like that's something
somebody should do. Somebody should go
test that. Like it's a massive market.
You can run Facebook ads at it. It's a
super painful problem. Like it's
expensive. It's emotional, right? Like
there's a world that exists there. I
told a group of them, but I was talking
to one dude specifically and I was like,
"You should do this. Like this is right
up your alley. You're telling me you
want to launch this thing." And he
didn't for like six weeks. Then I told
another person about it. I was like,

[03:00]
another person about it. I was like,
"Dude, I think this one will work." And
then they didn't do anything about it.
And so you know me,
&gt;&gt; insert that Michael Jordan clip and I
took that personally.
&gt;&gt; And I took it personally, right? Same
with the hummingbirds. Like I took it
per like dude like I'm not lying to you.
Like I promise you that this is actually
like I see a lot of things. I have a lot
of ideas. That one is very legit. Like I
think that's a move. And so I was
watching some sporting event and uh I
think Lauren went to the gym or
something and I literally just sat there
with chatbt and was like write me this
book and I launched the first funnel
with perspective.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Love perspective. We use it for all of
our funnels.
&gt;&gt; Tell me and the listeners watchers what
you mean by funnel.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The landing page basically, right?
Like the the sales page for it. I use
the word funnel cuz it's two-step and
like that's just the language. So then I
I built the first one on perspective,
tested it out, priced the book at 29 for
an ebook, digital copy, which is

[04:02]
an ebook, digital copy, which is
awesome. Zero COGS, phenomenal. Ran, I
don't know, I probably spent like 500 on
ads in like the first few days. I was
probably, you know, me, I probably do a
100 bucks a day. So 500 to 700 bucks in
that first week. Fun fact, 80% of the
people that watch my YouTube videos are
not subscribed to me. And most of them
think they are. They see him in the
feed, but they're not subscribed to me.
So, please, it'll take half a second.
Just click subscribe and it would mean a
ton to me.
&gt;&gt; Let me drill in on that. Are we talking
meta ads anywhere Meta wants to show it,
or were you only doing like stories, re
&gt;&gt; super broad? Super broad. I do automatic
placements, broad targeting. Facebook is
smarter than us and will dictate the
spend based on what you're trying to
optimize for.
&gt;&gt; You didn't tell Facebook at all who to
show it to or on what medium to show it.
&gt;&gt; No, super broad. and I said, "I just
want purchases." And then I just kind of
let it ride.
&gt;&gt; You used a pixel on the thank you page.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Yeah. And so perspective is nice
because you can you can track specific

[05:00]
because you can you can track specific
conversion events.
&gt;&gt; We need to get them for this pod,
&gt;&gt; bro. I'm saying I'm already a
perspective. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. I'm
in. I'll promote you guys whenever. I'm
I'm a happy user. Yeah. So, basically,
it was like, all right, I spent five 500
600 whatever it was in the first week.
probably made I think I did like 400ish
in sales and so like not profitable but
like signal it's like oh yep like I'm
selling this thing for 29 bucks it's
costing me 40 bucks to get that purchase
and so then you just play the math game
right and so then I was like all right
dude let me transition this thing over
to Clickfunnels
&gt;&gt; because Clickfunnels has better like
upsell downell bump offers right stuff
that you can do to increase your I know
where you're going with this,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; Dude, what is what is the monetary value
of having a little edge at winning your
divorce? It could be millions of
dollars.
&gt;&gt; And so I launched the negotiation
training toolkit, $17 bump offer. They

[06:02]
training toolkit, $17 bump offer. They
add the the book to cart for 29. Before
they put in their payment details, it
says, "Do you want to add this thing?"
Yes. No. I think it's like 70% of people
are saying yes. And so
AOV went to if if they buy both you land
at like 48 I think is the math. 17 plus
29 whatever somewhere in there. Maybe
it's maybe I put it at 18. I think it's
47. AOV landed around 42
&gt;&gt; average order value.
&gt;&gt; Yep. And so that's on the first. Turned
the ads back on. Made some new
creatives. Basically running at break
even right now. like it sits at 40 to 45
on the CAC
&gt;&gt; customer acquisition cost.
&gt;&gt; Yep. This thing's done, you know, five
or six grand in sales at this point,
right? Like and and basically broken
even all the way through. And I started
getting some support emails, people
being like, "When does my book ship?"
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

[07:00]
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Geez Louise, dude.
&gt;&gt; It has like
Yeah. I was like, "Dude, email. Check
that. It's all good." The book also like
V1 was was not good. Like it was very
much AI slop, just like placeholder.
Hey, let's let's do it. And so at that
point, I was like, "All right, cool. I
bet you I could increase my conversion
rate if I shipped the books, like if I
actually printed real copies of this
book." And so I spent like 5 hours with
chat and made it good. Like I the book's
actually pretty solid. It's 200 pages. I
went to Printivity I think is the
because Printify is is print on demand
for clothing and stuff, but I think this
is Printivity and I ordered 300 copies
of it. It came out to like
maybe six bucks a book.
&gt;&gt; Okay. ish. So, landed to a customer, you

[08:00]
&gt;&gt; Okay. ish. So, landed to a customer, you
add shipping in there, and so you're
probably at like eight and a half. And
so ran those ads, turned them on, and
recently ran into a Facebook ads issue,
which is it got classified as targeting
personal hardship,
&gt;&gt; which is in I don't want to say the
nofly zone with Facebook, but what they
don't let you do is they don't let you
attribute purchases back to your pixel.
&gt;&gt; Oo, that's a super super annoying.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. and it won't optimize based on the
purchase event. And so I've turned the
ads off. I'm waiting to hear back on
Facebook. I understand that claim or
that like categorization. I'm a little
frustrated that that happened right
after I spent 3,000 bucks or whatever it
was on these books. And so without
having the optimization in place, really
challenging for me to to beat like a $50
CAC. it still gets purchases, but I
can't there's no line of sight really

[09:02]
can't there's no line of sight really
for me to be able to optimize that all
the way through. And so I turned them
off for now until I hear back from
Facebook. But all of that to say, like
again, another one of those examples of
like, yo, you can just like figure out a
problem,
&gt;&gt; wrap a solution in a book, and yeah, you
can just do things and you can start to
to sell them. Lauren might not be super
pleased that there's 300 copies of a
book called How to Win Your Divorce in
Our Garage 6 Months Before Our Wedding,
but [laughter]
you know,
&gt;&gt; one wasn't enough.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, it's like, no, I really
I'm really soaking up the material. Uh,
no, it's uh but yeah, I think again it's
it's one of those other piece of that,
too, is I was just using ads to do it. I
think there's worlds where like I could
go and launch theme pages around divorce
or crazy divorce stories or you know any
of those things that that would allow
for me to get through that inventory for
free.
&gt;&gt; Let me get this out, dude.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; First of all, I did a little prompt as
you were talking. I asked our friend

[10:00]
you were talking. I asked our friend
Chad GPT or as the boomers call it,
chat, which I kind of like.
&gt;&gt; I like it. I'm in.
&gt;&gt; I didn't at first because it was like
they're saying it wrong and then it's
like doesn't matter. That's cool.
&gt;&gt; No. Yeah. three less syllables.
&gt;&gt; I'm just going to hit chat.
&gt;&gt; I'm talking chat. So, also they own
chat.com now. So,
&gt;&gt; so good.
&gt;&gt; I asked, "How much do lawyers make from
divorces? And do they pay referral fees
if I bring them customers? And if so,
how much in referral fees is industry
standard?" So, first of all, I've looked
into this industry before. I almost
bought the domain name international.com
because I was going to have a directory
or, you know, programmatic site where I
brought leads to lawyers.
&gt;&gt; Yep. But there are some there's some
legalities to this, right? Certain
states allow you to accept referral
fees. Certain states require you to be a
lawyer to accept a referral fee from
another lawyer. Just like in real
estate, the same is true. But there are
ways around this. There are legal ways
around this. Number one, you're a
consultant.
&gt;&gt; You're a consultant that happens to

[11:00]
&gt;&gt; You're a consultant that happens to
refer them customers and he's paying a
consulting fee 30% of the total fees
that he collects, which are between
seven and $23,000.
the average divorce attorney charging
270 bucks an hour. So these little books
now it becomes a tool for you to have a
zero dollar, you know, a break even
customer acquisition and you can make
this a high ticket where 5% of people
that buy your book, you refer to a
lawyer that you just Google,
&gt;&gt; hop on a call with beforehand to say,
"Hey, Mr. Lawyer, I've got this
customer. What kind of I can't Are you a
lawyer?" No, I can't. I'm a consultant.
&gt;&gt; I don't need a referral fee. I need a
consulting fee.
&gt;&gt; Pay for lead, baby. It's all good.
&gt;&gt; What are we talking about?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, it's the same. And so the
other piece that I did was I added on
backend offer. So they hit the they pay
for the book, they get the bump offer.
So that pushes AOV up on the top. Then
on the back, I put it live like a couple
days before I turn the ads off. So I
didn't get any purchases on it. But I
put a $300
program on the back, which is very much

[12:02]
program on the back, which is very much
it's the financial protection protocol.
Right. Divorce is one of the most
expensive things
&gt;&gt; that Yeah. the FPP
&gt;&gt; for sure.
&gt;&gt; And so it's one of the most expensive
things that people go through in their
life. And so it's all like very targeted
messaging towards like how to come out
of this not financially destroyed and
have a plan for building wealth post
divorce. There's also to your point like
so many monetization models on the back
of that. You could pretty easily launch
like a support group with an annual fee.
You could, you know, I I already have
mock-ups for for the second book, which
is dating after divorce, right? And
like, you know, there's like
&gt;&gt; book DA DAD. And so there's there's a
bunch of
&gt;&gt; there's a bunch of problems within this
macro market that people can solve for.
And so it's like again, it's it's when
you think about low lift stuff to kind
of get off the ground. Sure, there's a
learning curve with some of the skills

[13:01]
learning curve with some of the skills
that you need to be able to do it, but
those are applicable to every business
you're ever going to launch, right?
Copywriting, landing pages, getting
comfortable in Facebook ads manager,
right? Like all of those different
skills. But like at its core, you can
apply that skill set to anything, right?
Like, and that's why I always just push
people to go do one because if you do
one, then all of a sudden, you've built
a landing page before and you're not
scared of it. You've written copy
before, you've made ads, you've ran ads,
like it is not the most complicated
thing for people to learn how to do,
especially if you just do it once and
then you can go and apply that to any
market ever.
&gt;&gt; Dude, we talk about this every time you
come on.
&gt;&gt; I know. Like I'm like every episode
&gt;&gt; for good reason. I'm like, "Guys, like,
just go do it because like I promise you
the next idea that you have is always
going to be like there's a problem that
needs to be solved. How do you convince
somebody and get attention?" And it's
like you write a landing page, make ads
that speak to the problem, you run the

[14:02]
that speak to the problem, you run the
like that's that same skill set all the
way through.
&gt;&gt; And like it turns literally every like I
haven't even gotten married yet and I
made money selling a divorce product.
Like [laughter] it's, you know what I'm
saying? Like
&gt;&gt; in the in the sizzle reel.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You know what I mean? It's like,
dude, that's not like like you just can
apply it to any market like without a
problem.
&gt;&gt; Let me ask you this. How did you go from
the nexus of this idea which was just
broing down in your community saying
divorce yada yada yada. You never
thought of it before. How did you go
from that to I have enough data points
now to put to invest three hours into
this? Like did you do much research? Do
you look at keywords or Google
translations?
&gt;&gt; No. Because I think I think people get
caught in that, right? Where it's like
everyone spends all this time. Yeah.
They like they like go so deep into like
figuring out if it's a good business
idea instead of just testing it. It's
funny. It's it's another one of the
conversations that's a recurring theme
in the Grow Faster community. And it's

[15:00]
in the Grow Faster community. And it's
like there are best practices within
business, right? Like there's an average
add to cart rate in ecom brands. Sure.
All right. All right, I want to pause
here just for a second to tell you why
I've used Beehive for 2 years. And I
just actually sent my 100th newsletter
edition. I love Beehive. And you see,
email's different from other platforms
because social media platforms own your
audience. In fact, YouTube just banned
me for a week because they didn't like
one of my videos even though it was
perfectly compliant. If Instagram
changes their algorithm, your reach
tanks. Same with Tik Tok, Facebook, and
anything else. You're building on rented
land. But with Beehive, I own my list. I
own my audience. I'm not at the mercy of
some nameless, faceless algorithm. Every
time I hit send, they just get my
emails. And Beehive makes this simple.
Growth tools, monetization, and a free
website. And I can't get enough of their
analytics and the data I get from
Beehive. This is data that I can
actually use and share with potential
sponsors. It's everything you need in
one platform. The smartest creators out
there are the ones that own their own

[16:01]
there are the ones that own their own
audience. So go to beehive.com/chris
to get 30% off your first three months.
That's beehiv.com/chris
and start building something you
actually own. What would you say that
is?
&gt;&gt; Add to cart rate.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is the question, right? It's
so dependent, right? Because like are
you selling a $6,000 sauna or are you
selling, you know, like are you a
fashion brand where people are adding
and kind of like keeping stuff in cart
and just like saving stuff, right? It's
so varied that it's hard to be like 22%.
Right? Because it's like, dude, Tesla's
add to cart is not, but their conversion
rate from ad to cart to purchase is way
higher because no one's reserving a
Tesla without wanting to buy it, right?
And so it's like
&gt;&gt; there's all of these metrics
&gt;&gt; that like are very uh unique to each
business. And like you might find ad
accounts that are doing better at
getting cost per click down that you're
beating that but you're not beating your
you know like there's so much nuance
there that it's hard for me to sit there

[17:00]
there that it's hard for me to sit there
and be like and with a straight face be
like these are the numbers you should
expect. The only way that I look at good
versus bad is really comparing it
against past owned performance, right?
Like did I improve my cost per click?
Not is my cost per click good or bad
based on the industry. It's like
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; do can I make this math work for myself?
Like
&gt;&gt; when you ask somebody what they're
seeing, take it with a grain of salt
because it's not your business. There's
different variables. There's different
pieces. go test something so you get
firstparty data and can make your own
decisions based on the data that you are
creating
&gt;&gt; of like if I drop my cost per click by
30% this should be profitable then you
know what you need to do right like just
get in the game
&gt;&gt; there's so much beauty to ignorance
because if we start doing all this
research we're going to read some AI
generated blog article that says like
what does cost perclick average in the

[18:00]
what does cost perclick average in the
e-commerce industry on Facebook ads $14
42 and then you start your Facebook ads
and you see your cost per click is $7
and you're like oh this doesn't work.
It's like bro you're selling $6,000
saunas
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; It's totally different.
&gt;&gt; Totally totally different. Like
&gt;&gt; so that research kind of did them in
&gt;&gt; it's the reason why everyone's like what
podcast do you listen to? What? And I
like I don't really
&gt;&gt; It's the Ker office. Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I only listen to one and it's you when
I'm on it obviously.
&gt;&gt; Right. And so it's like
&gt;&gt; like I'll watch him every once in a
while, but like I'm not I'm not taking
what people are saying as like, oh, to
compare against myself of like, dude, he
couldn't get it to work with this. But
but like no, like here's the problem I
need to solve for my thing. My AOV is
this. My conversion rate is this. My
cost per click is this. I know what I
need to do. I don't care what the other
ecom brand's doing. I can see my
numbers. And so I think that piece of it
is like it's again it's why we have this
conversation every single time which is

[19:00]
conversation every single time which is
like no I didn't do that much research.
I asked Chad GPT basically the same
question as you and how many people I
was like how many people a year in the
US go through a divorce. Cool. It's like
2 point whatever million or whatever it
is. And it's like that's a big enough
market that's interesting to me. Like
that's fine. I'll play that game. And
the markets are so big that it's like
dude even if there was competition it's
like I'll still try to compete. Like
that's fine.
&gt;&gt; Let me ask you this. Let's say someone's
listening or watching and they want to
get to 20K a month profit.
&gt;&gt; Okay, 250 240 a year profit. Let's use
your idea plus my tweak of it, which is
like referral fees to lawyers. Let's
backend into that. So, let's say you're
breaking you're selling these ebooks.
Let's just say it's only ebooks to keep
it simple. You're breaking even on your
ad spend. What do you think a reasonable
conversion rate is for someone that buys
a book and ends up going to the lawyer
that you refer to them?
&gt;&gt; No idea. So, you get a 100 purchases on
the book, right? How many do you think

[20:00]
the book, right? How many do you think
end up working with a with a See, and I
I would probably there's a risk level
that's involved with what I'm about to
say. One is you say to the lawyer,
you're only going to pay me when
somebody signs to work with you, right?
And the value of that is much higher.
Let's just for easy math, let's say on a
on a signed contract, they will pay you
$1,000, right? Sweet. Or you go to the
lawyer and say, "Hey, I'll send you
every single lead that comes from the
state of California, and each of those
leads you pay me $100. Less risk for
you, but you get paid less. More risk
for the lawyer, so they pay less,
right?" And so you can you figure out
where that math works. But then you
start sitting there and you say, "Well,
I've sent this guy a hundred leads and
eight of them converted, right? He's
paid me 10 grand. And of those eight, if
he were paying me a,000, I'd make eight
grand. Sweet. I'm going to keep paying
I'm going to keep selling him $100 leads
left, right, and center, right? But if

[21:01]
left, right, and center, right? But if
that number has changed and it's like 16
close, and I could have made 16 grand by
selling him closed deals,
&gt;&gt; then you go, I don't sell this anymore."
or you call three more attorneys in
California and say, "Hey, like for every
hundred leads that I send, 16 of them
end up signing up to work with somebody,
I charge 1,200, whatever it is."
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And so you just go deeper into it to
figure out the math. I think like the
question of 20,000 just comes down to
like really figuring out the math side
of that, right? Like similar with like a
take rate on that 300 purchase, right?
So, like if your take rate is 3%, right?
And on that one, you're breaking even
top of funnel. 3% take rate on the back
at 300 puts you at 900 bucks a day in
profit, right? And so you're like, okay,
&gt;&gt; a month,
&gt;&gt; right? And so you're sitting there with
a take rate of 3% meaning, cool, I need
to spend enough money on ads to push a
hundred orders of this book. Easy math,

[22:00]
hundred orders of this book. Easy math,
&gt;&gt; right? Like that's it
&gt;&gt; to me. These are easy like oneperson
businesses that can go and print that
degree of money if you just like commit
to doing that, right? Like cool, I need
to get this to 3%. Like it's not a
complicated thing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's like I need to improve conversion
rates and I need to run better ads.
That's what you're waking up doing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. There's a third option and that's
like uh give give me a quarter of your
revenue once like every time you invoice
them, give me a quarter of that. And the
risk there is that lawyer could run
away. Lawyers don't exactly have the
best reputation for being honest and
upfront, right? Which is honestly why I
love this business because it's not
capitalizing on people that's getting a
divorce,
&gt;&gt; dude.
&gt;&gt; It's capitalizing on lawyers which have
money to spend. No one's crying about
lawyers spending money, right?
&gt;&gt; For sure.
&gt;&gt; And if you can genuinely help someone
that's about to be divorced find a great
lawyer, then you're doing a good for the
world, right?
&gt;&gt; For sure.
&gt;&gt; But in any lead genen business, there's
going to be a trade-off between
handholding, how much you have to trust
someone, and the potential
profitability, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And you just got to find where

[23:01]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And you just got to find where
that line is.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think the best way to win with
this or any lead genen business is to
really just develop a good relationship
with like two to three lawyers that's
that you feel good about that's willing
to pass all the data back to you. So so
you know what's closing, who's closing,
because then you can leverage those two
to three relationships into a pricing
model that works for lawyers you don't
know very well and you don't trust very
well. Because at the end of that 3mon
relationship or whatever it is, at the
end of the first 3 months, you're going
to know, I'm just making this up. Wow,
just selling these leads for 100 bucks a
pop is amazing. That's the best and
highest use of these leads for me
because anything outside of that, I'm
having to only find lawyers that are
great at closing deals. And most lawyers
aren't great at sales. I don't want to
have to care if they're good at sales.
So, I just want my money up front. Maybe
they'll make a little more than the
other scenario. Maybe not. But,
&gt;&gt; yep. You've got to be like really
ingrained with their business and be
relentless about asking them for how
it's going. How's it did that did that

[24:00]
it's going. How's it did that did that
deal close? Did the lead close? You
know, yep,
&gt;&gt; etc.
&gt;&gt; And and there's the the degree of how
much work you want to put in,
&gt;&gt; right? Like if you don't want to deal
with all of that, you don't want to have
to. Then it's like, yo, cool. I'm just
going to run it off this like pay per
lead model and like I'm not even going
to worry about it. Like they can close
who they want, not close who they want.
The only part of that that impacts me is
if they're not good at selling, they're
going to ask me to stop sending leads
because they're paying for them, right?
Like, cool. And then you have the proof
and you can go to every other divorce
attorney in the state and say, "Let's
go." Like, "I'm doing this. This is
fine." I think it applies to every
industry under the sun, right? Like I
mean, we to be blunt, like we made a
massive bet on the payer lead model. I
spent thousands and thousands and
thousands of dollars on a domain payer
call.io
based on this of like we will go
generate the the calls, people calling
your business, you pay me for the call,

[25:01]
your business, you pay me for the call,
you close, you do it, we we debated
doing do we do pay per appointment,
meaning we pick up the phone
&gt;&gt; and we put it on their service and are
we right like are we doing that work?
&gt;&gt; And the answer was no. Like they and
they would have paid us more money if we
were to say, "Hey, we're pay per
appointment."
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Right. But like we didn't want to sign
up for the headache of managing a call
center or Right. Like we didn't really
want to get that ingrained. It was not
where we wanted to live. Quick question.

And the nice part is like a lot of these
million-dollar conversations and these
big business things, you don't even have
to worry about any of that stuff to make
20,000 bucks a month. Like you don't
even like all you really need is like a
good offer.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. Like it's a much simpler setup
that you really can run as a oneperson
shop
&gt;&gt; if you find the math and the offer that
makes sense there to like make 20 grand
a month. It's like not
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; it's not easy, but it's way easier than
making a million dollars a year by like
orders of magnitude. You've seen it.
Like you've been at all of those levels.
Like the jump from a one person business
doing $20,000 a month to a sixperson
business doing a million dollars a month
or a million dollars a year is like
there's a lot of work that goes into
that specific jump. You're changing what
the organization is.
&gt;&gt; Like that's a hard thing to get through.
It's four times more revenue for maybe
two times more profit and like six times
more work, you know,
&gt;&gt; 100% stress, work, people.

[27:01]
&gt;&gt; 100% stress, work, people.
&gt;&gt; It's a lot, right? And like we we found
ourselves in that slump for, you know,
12 months where we really were like,
dude, we've doubled revenue, but like
I'm not making any more money because we
had to commit to like I'm going to make
way more money 12 months from now if we
continue the growth curve because then
all my like that's when I will win
bigger
&gt;&gt; the compounding. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. And so it's like I think more
people should like take a step back and
be like what am I actually trying to
achieve here? Really easy to get
impressed by the yachts and the Ferraris
and the private jets and the Rolexes and
and all of that stuff. But like I would
gamble that like if you're the I'm going
to say an average American, right? If
you're making 120K a year working for
somebody, stressed out on the clock,
no freedom, no real like roadmap to
making more money, I think now is like
the best time to shrink your goals down
and say, "Yo, I'm really only trying to
get to a quarter million dollars a year.

[28:01]
get to a quarter million dollars a year.
If I could double my income and cut my
stress in half, that's like
&gt;&gt; that's the prao principle of what we
do." Yeah. Like,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; that's it. And so, I think again with
that prompt is like there's a handful of
those businesses that you can go and
make $20,000 a month on profit running
it just you and if it the emails are
slowing you down, go hire a VA for 1,200
bucks a month and like you could run a
very smooth operation and make that
money.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I feel like if someone is
about to launch something like this lead
genen business and they have to choose
between the higher touch, maybe
potentially higher profit option and the
lower touch, lower profit option, I opt
to go for the lower touch, lower profit
because if you get burned out on the
harder version, then you'll never even
see what could have been.
&gt;&gt; If you start with like, all right, you
know what? These leads are worth 300
bucks easy. I'm going to sell them for
100 bucks because it's easier and I
don't have to babysit these lawyers. I
don't have to trust them. They're going
to pay me on day one where they closed
or not. And then after three months,
you're going to be like, "Man, these are
these are closing a lot higher than I

[29:01]
these are closing a lot higher than I
thought." Like, I don't even need to ask
the lawyers because I'm asking the
divorce and they're telling me, "Yeah,
he's a great lawyer. I used them. I'm
good. Thank you so much. These are now
$150 leads or these are now 30% referral
fees. I'm going to double my money." But
if you start with that, you may never
find success.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's And it's like, yeah. People
biting off more than they can chew and
then being like, "It doesn't work." And
it's like, no, no, you just tried to do
too much. Like, you went too deep into
it. It's like, dude, it doesn't have to
be
&gt;&gt; that complicated. Like,
&gt;&gt; sell leads.
&gt;&gt; First of all, we both know that like the
lead genen business for lawyers is huge,
right? We're not inventing it on this
podcast, but here's what I think we
might have invented, which is mostly
credit to you. Using ebooks to generate
leads in a kind of roundabout way.
Because if I go to a lawyer that's been
buying leads for a decade, he's gonna
roll his eyes and say, "Your leads
probably suck. All these leads suck."
Yada. They're burned out, right? Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But if I go to him and say,
&gt;&gt; "I don't just use Google ads or Facebook

[30:01]
&gt;&gt; "I don't just use Google ads or Facebook
ads for that matter for leads like
you're used to. I sell books and these
are very targeted books." It might not
even be how to win your divorce. It
might be how does a mom of four win her
divorce in New Hampshire, you know, for
all I know. like something very very
niche where your your conversion rate on
10 of those books might be 20%. And your
conversion rate on a hundred of the more
general books might be 2%. You know what
I'm saying?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 100%.
&gt;&gt; That could be the whole model. You can
make a book for what to do after your
car accident. What do I do after my slip
and fall? What do I do if I'm in a
relationship with domestic abuse? What
do I do if I just got a DUI?
&gt;&gt; Right? and take all these leads and give
them to DUI lawyers, to domestic abuse
lawyers, you know, like that could be a
whole business that just starts with
divorce or starts with DUIs or whatever.
&gt;&gt; Dude, you just you write a book called
Erase Your DUI.
&gt;&gt; Oh, where's that domain? I'm sure it's
available.
&gt;&gt; You know what I mean? And it's like you
go make a mockup on Canva, you run some

[31:01]
go make a mockup on Canva, you run some
ads, you have chatb
like, you know what I'm saying? Like
it's it's all it's like not that
complicated. It's like what is the thing
that people want to pay for? You know,
the the the pay per lead model, all
you're trying to do is arbitrage it,
right? And so like you you have a CAC to
acquire that lead and the it's funny. I
when we talk about it a lot, we think
about wholesale retail, right? And so
like if you can get the retail buyers
that are willing to spend $100 a lead,
but you can go and get leads for $60
wholesale, whether it's self-divided,
right? Like you can figure that out.
Then you're like, "Oh, how do I create
more margin?" And by putting a book in
the front, you're actually revenue
generating on the top. Meaning that like
even even in this model, let's just say
like what I have, even if my CAC is $50
and my AOV is $40,
&gt;&gt; losing $10 per lead,
&gt;&gt; that cost per lead goes to $10. But if
I'm making a hundred, right, it's like

[32:01]
I'm making a hundred, right, it's like
you're still good.
&gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying.
&gt;&gt; You're a happy camper. The legal cost
per click on Google is like the highest
of any industry,
&gt;&gt; you might need to pay like
&gt;&gt; like if if you if you're looking for
like a trucking accident lead on Google
ads,
&gt;&gt; you might spend like legitimately $5,000
for that lead. Right.
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; But if if I can sell a book with $100 of
Facebook ads and my average order value
is $20, I lose $80. Like that's an $80
lead instead of a $1,000 lead or
whatever. What are we talking about?
&gt;&gt; I know. Like someone can go and do that
pretty easily.
&gt;&gt; All right, what' you think?
