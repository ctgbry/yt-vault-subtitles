how this
goes
hello hey Chris how are you good how are
you I'm good man thanks absolutely so
you are the one asking about uh
supplement business is that right yes

[03:01]
supplement business is that right yes
correct yeah okay let's hear it man so
uh we have uh two locations I'm in North
Texas and Southern Oklahoma and uh I've
been in business in Texas for 10 years
and Oklahoma for five years um the first
few years growing the business
everything kind of went according to
plan things were going great covid hit
and Co actually skyrocketed our business
uh we had more people than ever wanting
to be healthier taking care of their
their Health Fitness stuff like that now
real quick why why don't you back up and
just tell us about what your business is
what you do what you sell yeah so we're
a retail stores and we do any kind of
workout supplements vitamins like
proteins pre-workouts stuff like that um
all sorts of pre-made meals healthy
snacks um and then inside both locations
we have a full Smoothie Bar as well okay
so you're selling other other company
supplements not your own in corre yeah

[04:00]
supplements not your own in corre yeah
yeah okay okay so a supplement store SL
Smoothie Bar two locations one in north
Texas one in southern Oklahoma yes what
are the populations of the towns that
these are in and what are their
locations like within those
towns uh so they're uh both going to be
right around the the the town and
surrounding areas about 30,000
people okay and uh are you asking for
the location specifically No like is it
on a busy road um yeah yeah so um the
the first location we are right on the
main Highway um pretty prime location
couldn't ask for really a better spot um
the second location is in a a newer
upand cominging spot the last probably
two or three years a lot of businesses a
lot of new developments have come to
that area a lot of older businesses from
the same city have kind of relocated to
this part of town and uh and that one
that that Oklahoma location I'm in a

[05:00]
that that Oklahoma location I'm in a
shopping center with about uh 15 16
other businesses there okay just like a
normal outdoor strip mall correct okay I
actually pulled up your locations here
so without revealing you I'm looking at
where you are okay so sorry let's back
up you were saying you what year did you
open uh so Texas opened up in
2014 okay and then uh Oklahoma was
2019 and you said Co skyrocketed your
business
yeah it was crazy man we we about
doubled a little more than doubled our
uh normal foot traffic um everything was
great absolutely just like I said Co
affected a lot of people in a lot of
different ways and we were one of the
businesses that really benefited from
from it okay what made you want to open
that second store five years
in um honestly man so it's uh the
locations are about 40 miles apart and
as far as direct competition from the
original

[06:00]
original
there was nothing even remotely close
and I had a very regular crowd from the
city up in Oklahoma that came down about
once a month as a big group and spent a
good amount of money with us um and that
was one of the the main complaints I
guess was from people of that area is
that they wished we were a little bit
closer um so we went looking around and
and it took about uh eight months almost
a year of looking before we finally
decided to go ahead and finalize on that
spot or that location um but that was
that was the main reason I wanted to
open up a second location after about 5
Years anyway that was in the original
plan um and we had such a good
consistent following um from that
Oklahoma region that that's when that's
why we selected that location which
store is doing better and what are their
sales numbers
each um so as of right well so I mean as
a whole so the the Texas location
definitely does

[07:00]
definitely does
better um and then as a whole we do um
on the month the Texas location does
about 30k a month and the Oklahoma
location is floats around that 18 to 21
a month okay what are your uh net what's
your profit like uh we glow gross uh
month after month we stay between 25 and
30% gross or or margins sorry gross
gross margins yeah what are your net
profits
like uh so we're in Texas we stay around
s to 8K um a month and then Oklahoma is
going to be honestly closer to that 3K
Mark okay how many years left do you
have on each
lease uh Texas is now in a
month-to-month and Oklahoma has uh the
last part of a year I think there's six
months left on it okay and what are your

[08:01]
months left on it okay and what are your
sales like today compared to at their
Peak during covid uh significantly
slower what were they during covid per
month at at their Peak um so the uh
Texas location we were 55 minimum we
were pushing close to 60k a month in the
Texas location and then we were floating
around that 30k in the Oklahoma location
okay all right so Oklahoma's always been
kind of 2third to half as big and that
it stayed steady during Co they each got
about twice as big correct okay now what
are you what are you struggling with
what was last year like when did you
start to see sales dip are they flat
today or are they still dropping what's
going on yeah so and I guess that's um
my scenario I I'll lay it out for you
and this is where I kind of wanted to
hear your thoughts so um after covid
like like literally following the covid

[09:01]
like like literally following the covid
trend as the the The Fad or the the
worry of covid went away sales kind of
dipped a little bit like with that kind
of followed that
Trend um and then the one of the biggest
issues that I'm having is over the last
about year or so um so the the the towns
both of the Cities I'm in I would say
are very
political and uh so something I've had
issues with over the last year is I
found out from very close friends of
mine that there were uh groups of people
so I I'm originally born I'm from Texas
born and raised here I've been here my
whole life um my father is originally
Middle Eastern and so myself and all my
siblings we have like traditional Middle
Eastern
names and about a year ago I started
dealing with a big group of individuals
who were spreading a lot of negativity
about me and my businesses and they were

[10:01]
about me and my businesses and they were
pushing this huge campaign about how we
don't support middle
easterners and that was a uh a big hit
when when I started hearing stuff like
that um I I've noticed that traffic has
gone down and in our locations we do
have a standard free and a paid um like
Platinum like a membership program that
we offer and with with that uh a lot of
the people that I had heard were kind of
spreading or talking about those rumors
um about not wanting to support me
because of my background um I actually
saw a lot of those people who were
involved in that completely uh either
deleting accounts or unenrolling from
our membership account stuff like that
and and that's been something I've
really struggled with so let me let me
make sure I understand this correctly
you you are Middle Eastern
correct yeah so my father's side is
Middle Eastern my is originally from the

[11:00]
Middle Eastern my is originally from the
states um I was born and raised here in
Texas I ju I I literally just have a
middle eastern descent name yeah your
name okay now is it other Middle
Easterns that are saying this about you
that you don't support middle easterners
or no no so it it's the the local people
a group of local people saying that they
refused to support middle easterners
okay and they they're being racist
absolutely yeah okay and what Trigg this
like was it co was it something
unrelated to co no it all really started
when all the you know the the most
recent like political type stuff with
all the war and all that stuff started
happening um that's that's when it
started and it's just stemmed from that
I believe would you say that um like
what is the racial makeup of your the
majority of your customer base or is
there none is it representative of the
town it's very very white very Caucasian

[12:01]
town it's very very white very Caucasian
very Republican so representative of of
the towns where you are yes yeah
okay where is this where's this talk
happening is it on Facebook is it you
know like what is the medium for for
this so everything that I've I I've
heard like from mouths of other people
has been spread in two places and one of
them was one of our local gyms and then
one of them was in a business that one
of those people who did not want to
support me owned okay man well first of
all I'm I'm sorry this that's I can see
why you want to stay Anonymous I I
didn't expect that coming on this call
uh threw me for a curveball there but
yeah that's that's tough man like that
I'm I apologize that that's happening
especially minutes from where I live
yeah has it been was it kind of all at
once or is it
slowly kind of started affecting your

[13:00]
slowly kind of started affecting your
sales
numbers yeah it was a I would say a
slower Pace it kind of happened I
started noticing like the uh the the
negative talk and the loss of Select
customers and their their friends and
followers over the course of probably
I'd say four months five months maybe
and then it's just kind of I I kind I
guess kind of been stagnant since then
the last five or six months have been
stagnant since then so I guess if if it
helps you any so
I guess what I'm looking for is is your
thoughts or your recommendations on not
maybe not necessarily dealing with that
issue but but trying to in in a smaller
town like this where that is some
hearsay that's going on just trying to
generate more sales more traffic trying
to get more foot traffic in yeah what do
you want to do like if we were to never
talk three four six months from now
where do you find yourself
realistically uh you know in in six
months from now closing or

[14:00]
months from now closing or
I mean no not not now or not from any of
that like um in the near future like six
months um
ideally still kind of where I am now
just building out and growing the
businesses um my original plans were to
have two or three locations and then I
wanted to kind of to I guess figure out
what my last calling what my final
calling whatever you want to call it is
and my original plans back when I opened
everything up where I wanted to be out
of retail I wanted to be doing something
else I wanted to exit retail whether it
was close sell whatever it is I wanted
to be out of retail by the time I was
35 so that gives us about two
years have you thought of opening
different locations in a different city
Al
together in a completely different city
or in the same city in a different
location a different city third
store I I have thought about it yeah
yeah it's uh I would say the biggest

[15:01]
yeah it's uh I would say the biggest
hindrance is just right now with
everything that's been going on in
recent times with the decline of sales
it it
just I guess to be honest kind of scares
me yeah um finding other people are more
help to to staff the stores and me go
off and do a third
location has there been new competitors
open up these last five years like do
you compete directly with GNC not at all
no I'm I'm still in uh I mean in
Oklahoma there is a DNC relatively close
by but it's very poorly staffed they
have horrible operating hours they're
literally only open when there's
somebody available they're in a not that
great part of town as far as like
location um is considered um and they
were there before I opened up um since
I've opened up both locations there has
not been any direct competition that's
opened up within okay 30 miles or so
okay have you reached out to any local
media or news about any of this I have

[16:01]
media or news about any of this I have
not i' I've toyed with the idea but I
didn't know which direction that would
take it I didn't know if it would help
things or if it would make things worse
why don't you test that at your smaller
store in Oklahoma why don't you test
reaching out to just the local news and
just telling them your story exactly as
you're telling me and trying to get
someone on your side I would even go so
far as to do some background research on
the person that you'll be reaching out
to and try to find someone that seems
like they'd be more sympathetic to your
cause um because obviously you're going
to fight up against that too right like
the person the people you reach out to
might be just as racist as everyone else
right I would try to reach out to people
that at least appear to be more
sympathetic to your cause and I would
just fight back in public like if if you
have a month-to-month lease and you're
concerned about the viability of your
business or at least one of your stores
what do you have to lose right yeah
right if if the town in Oklahoma is just

[17:00]
right if if the town in Oklahoma is just
tainted permanently and it's like okay
either I close this or I just move this
to a completely different uh Metroflex
alt together and just hope that this
doesn't happen again or I just fight
back I just punch back and see what
happens and worst worst case my sales
drop more month-to Monon lease whatever
I get out best case the community
rallies around me and says hey I'm not
racist I'm not racist I'm not R you know
they kind of all raise their hand and
say I'm sorry that's happening to you um
on behalf of the town that is a minority
of us that is acting that way and we
support you you know the majority
support you uh I I could see some sort
of a ground swell happening if you were
to do that but people need to know about
it right right and you know worst case
you're in the same spot you are now
maybe sales are a little lower and and
you just pack up and move home yeah
that's true but what do you think about
that is that viable
yeah I mean I think like the plan as a

[18:01]
yeah I mean I think like the plan as a
whole is very viable and if it was like
to come down to something happening to
one of the locations or or whatever it
is um I I don't think that negatively
affects me or impacts me I don't have
any negative feelings towards it um like
I said originally the plan was to exit
these businesses at some point anyway um
so no I I I don't I see it being a very
viable option and I don't have any
negative feedback connotation towards it
yeah I would even make a video um I mean
you could write something but I would
make a video of you standing in front of
your store just pleading your case and
even be specific about your sales
numbers like hey there's there's been no
new competitors in this area people are
only working out even more um I don't
like help me out here what's going on
yeah um and you're going to get some
haters obviously but those haters will
just help spread the message even
further right nothing goes viral without
haters period yeah that's true so and

[19:02]
haters period yeah that's true so and
this is actually more likely to go viral
than a more vanilla message if you will
okay so that's what I would do but uh I
apologize that's happening either way
that it's tough to have forces like that
I'm going against you that aren't normal
right that shouldn't be there you know
right yeah but no I I appreciate it
absolutely I wish you the best and let
me know how it turns out either way I
will I'll keep you posted thanks so much
for your time Chris
yep no problem we'll see you later bye
bye
Brandon yes sir how are
you I'm good how are you good can you
hear me okay great to meet you
likewise yes okay I think there's a
little delay uh we'll just have to work
around that but I am pulling up your

[20:01]
around that but I am pulling up your
info now and it looks
like uh I have two words trailer
business I want to hear about your
trailer
business uh well basically I my
intention is to copy yours and uh set it
up in a way I have five uh grown
children four uh or two boys that live
outside of my town in Corpus Christi so
my thought was how could I set it up in
a way where I get to buy the trailer on
my credit them run it where they are pay
me back for the trailer but then
eventually build their business up to
where they can buy their own trailers
and
expand okay so let's back up um what
type of trailer
specifically those dump
trailers okay so you're looking to start
uh like a a hauling business with a dump
trailer uh with your
sons and you're willing to pay for rent
you rent it out by the day or the week

[21:01]
you rent it out by the day or the week
gotcha okay and you're willing to pay
for the trailer but you want to
structure it right with them so you get
paid back is that right right are do you
want equity in the actual business or
just to get your money
back uh my thought would be basically by
one trailer pay me back the cost of the
trailer and then I get a percentage
every month just like a royalty for
having lent them the
money yeah like for for general terms
$100 a trailer for 10 years or whatever
it is okay now what do these trailers
cost and how many do you plan to
buy uh they're about 10 grand each
depending on your uh U dis discount and
I would like to buy about three each to
get them started okay and how many of
your boys are gonna be that be six
total two initially okay
and do you have a plan for marketing

[22:01]
and do you have a plan for marketing
these or for actually collecting Revenue
like is there is there some sort of a
channel that you already have in
place
no is there a Marketplace that you're
going to list these for rent on or what
is the plan to to rent
them uh basically do the rent me
stickers on the back do Facebook
Marketplace and then both these two
particular signs have a number of con
connections with home builders
construction and fence building firms in
those particular areas around the Hill
Country of Texas okay are they what
what's the personality type of your sons
are they sales guys introverts
extroverts hard workers uh one's a sales
guy and the other one is very
knowledgeable about the construction and
stuff like that so he's he's a little
bit more of an introvert the other one's
more of an sales guy kind of go out
there
okay and what what will they be charging

[23:01]
okay and what what will they be charging
for these like what's an average job
like uh what they're finding in their
particular area is most of them are
going for about $ 150 to $200 a day my
thought to kind of get started is a $100
a day uh to to build that kind of
reputation and then do some sort of
multi-day
discount have they um have they been in
business
before no what about you
yes I've started a number of businesses
over my lifetime and uh I've always kind
of been the guy in the back where you do
most of the work but I fund it and then
you buy me out essentially okay which is
fine between two people like you and I
because I can yell at you I can call you
names and your mom's not going to get
mad at me but when we're dealing with my
direct Sons there's another person
involved mom makes me be nice to them
but also want it to be very clear and
legal so there's not disputes later on

[24:01]
legal so there's not disputes later on
either sure okay so I would start like
before you do anything I would have your
sons start marketing these trailers
before you buy anything before you spend
a dime all those marketing channels that
you talked about except for of course
putting a sticker on the trailer because
there is no trailer yet um get that
going put up a website use card C A rrd
to put up a landing page and see if you
can draw some interest first assuming
you do now they're going to they're
going to actually want to rent it and
then just tell them it's not ready yet
it's not available on that day whatever
we're not in business yet however much
or a little you're comfortable telling
them assuming you do see enough interest
to Warrant buying a trailer I would
start with one I know that's tricky
because you you can only rent out one at
a time but I think it's like I I think
you just want to head your bets here
right I think you'd rather have one
trailer that you have to load at a small
loss than three uh if it doesn't if

[25:01]
loss than three uh if it doesn't if
there's a downturn in the economy or
downturn in local construction or
whatever um I would head your bets by
just buying one and I like your
structure of you know $100 per what what
was your structure again $100 per what
for paying you back $100 per day and
then multi-day discounts for the week
well no for the structure for you
getting compensated for this oh
basically the trailer's 10,000 my
thought was probably do like $1,000 or
$500 a month until it's paid off and
then drop it to like 250 a month for 10
years or whatever just for like it's
kind of like your your royalty or your
equity in the business without actually
having equity in the business right
right what is the backup plan if they
stop paying you what is is there
recourse you just say you know because
it's family it's weird have you
thought yeah uh basically that was my
plan is to set up essentially a small

[26:01]
plan is to set up essentially a small
contract that said you know this is this
are the
pain I think you're breaking up there
Brandon Brandon you there yes did you
lose I lost you you said a small
contract that says what basically I
would repossess it at any time if
payment in full wasn't made and then I
would use the app tags on the trailer in
order to track
them perfect yeah I would put some
flexibility in there in case they have a
slow season slow year slow month um but
I I think that's great uh just have a a
very simple payback period I think
you're on the right track um a smaller
dollar amount once it's paid off in
perpetuity um maybe forever sounds too
scary so five or 10 years as you said
said um so the only real change I would

[27:00]
said um so the only real change I would
make to your plan is put more emphasis
on the marketing and less emphasis on
the structure you want to be sure that
you can actually rent these things out
because we hear things anecdotally all
the time or oh man I can't get a trailer
oh I should buy a trailer but that's not
enough research it's just not you know
so right I would start with one even if
you can get discounts for buying
multiple um start with a website start
with some marketing get some bookings
even if you're the book is for the next
day and you're not going to have the
trailer for a month just cancel it you
know get their name and number call them
back in a month um and go that
way that's a great idea I I like that
idea of just saying hey it's not
available for the weekend you wanted how
about this weekend and if I get enough
then hey let's go get one tomorrow and
we'll put it out there totally or you
could even um rent a trailer to rent to
them and just break even or even lose a
little money right that's true that's a
good idea as long as I'm charging them
at least what I'm paying or close to it

[28:01]
at least what I'm paying or close to it
there's not a much of a risk yeah we
were looking at the same thing in the
pet cremation business where we're going
to buy this you know $100,000
crematorium and then we realized man all
of our competitors are they're only
using this thing 10% of the time we
could just rent it from them hourly um
and that's what we're doing so that
makes sense and then if it gets to a
point you can always buy it but for
right now if it goes away it goes away
it's not that big deal I like that well
Brandon hope this helps it does very
much I appreciate it I appreciate all
your
help absolutely have a great uh weekend
you too take care all right
bye
David hey Chris how are you good how are
you man
good good welcome to theer office thank

[29:02]
good good welcome to theer office thank
you very
much well all I have here on you okay
okay yes so you were recently laid off
and you have a side hustle that
encourages dads to
cook right all right let's hear about it
yeah so it's a little bit of a The Meta
thing that's going on is that there's a
lot of options on the table and uh you
know like I've been looking at maybe
purchasing a business um and I've you
know while I'm doing that maybe also
looking for jobs I'm also just trying
I'm got my kind of fingers on a lot of
different pies right now uh so part of
this is about focusing uh a bit and so
but I've I keep finding myself drawn to
this this thing that I'm building to
help dads uh cook for their families you
know kind of reclaim family dinner U
make it less chaotic and whatnot so um
kind of like I guess at a high level
little curious about like your thoughts

[30:00]
little curious about like your thoughts
on focus and then you know I think in as
I'm like you know balancing joy and
energy and Harmony fighting with this
thing that I'm I'm doing um like it's
been really fun I've done some cohort
classes I've like helped a bunch of guys
um and now I have like a community that
I'm I'm I'm you know building up and
have a newsletter and all these
different things like how would I you
know I'm looking for kind of creative
ways to maybe grow it while I can maybe
maintain or do these other things or
maybe or maybe just stop it all you know
what I mean and uh you know yeah just um
yeah love love your love your thoughts
here so how many months left of of
Runway do you have would you say I
probably have till like maybe till the
end of the year uh I would say probably
like maybe five or whatever that is I
can't do the mental math right now but
yeah okay and how like what is your
background if you were to have to go get
a job tomorrow yeah what what do you do
um so I've I've started a couple few
companies I've been I've been Mo

[31:01]
companies I've been I've been Mo
primarily in digital Health I've been
building uh products in the digital
Health space um you know had one company
I started bootstrapped it did a few
million in Revenue had a team but after
that company I exited that company and
worked I'm I'm technically a product
manager um so I work you know I build
digital products
effectively okay how is your job market
today you have you been looking youtiful
yeah yeah it's it's it's it's a bad I
mean product managers are just uh being
you know dumped and laid off by the by
the you know thousands at the moment
it's a it's a really it's a bleak market
right now okay pretty High Cost of
Living where you are yeah I live in the
LA area so yes high cost yeah what is
your Mr on your your cooking project
today oh it's it's at it's at zero right
now it's it's almost at zero yeah so you
say zero yeah I I did a little research

[32:01]
say zero yeah I I did a little research
I'll admit you've got a a a free
newsletter and then you have like a $20
month product is that right that's right
yeah so have you not sold any of the $20
month products then um I haven't been
marketing them I so I I when I first
started I was doing cohort classes and I
was like you know sharing that on
LinkedIn and you know getting people to
join and I was charging like 150 um I
originally started 30 and then I bumped
it to 75 and I was discounting it and
the the total price was 150 I wasn't
getting much many people after like 75
bucks to like to join to pay um but yeah
I've decided to go to more like
recurring Revenue uh model lower price
um doing less of like the Intensive
course and just kind of doing like a
once a month cook along and uh you know
some meal plans and also just have a a
community to like help support these
guys okay is there a press precedent for
a competitor doing what you're doing and

[33:01]
a competitor doing what you're doing and
doing well like or are you kind of
inventing this
model um yeah there are people doing
this in the fitness space um quite a bit
especially like um there's a guy that's
doing stuff in the kind of like uh over
40 50 year old like fitness men male
fitness space and doing quite well
there's like various people doing doing
this in this space like this okay but
what not for dad's cooking
specifically oh yeah not for there there
are there there's like a couple of guys
on like I have a Facebook group but they
don't really have it's not like a very
like active there's like a also like a
Reddit group called dat at Chefs as well
um that people
uh yeah so there's some but it's a free
free free stuff going on do you have
much experience doing um like paid ads
for digital products no no I don't I'm
I'm learning about it but I have I have
no clue uh very much about that okay now

[34:01]
no clue uh very much about that okay now
tell me about the your interest to buy a
business you said you were looking at
like a backfill business what why do you
have that interest and what types of
businesses catch your eye when you're
shopping on bis by sell like we all do
yeah so the one I was looking at is
called backf flow prevention Services I
like this business because it's um it's
mandatory in like 30 states to for
commercial businesses to get this like
tests so it's a really like cheap quick
fast test that's done by for for like
making sure water doesn't go back into
the main the main line um uh I like that
business um but you know I'm just that's
it excites me because it's like they
have to businesses have to do this on a
regular basis um commercial businesses
have to do this uh it's not high I mean
it's it's high margin when it's not like
a lot of I mean the tests are like C you
get certified like it's like a hundred
bucks 20 bucks for the for that um so

[35:00]
bucks 20 bucks for the for that um so
I'm looking at business I'm I'm trying
to like I I'm just tired of tech so I'm
tired of like that that Tech world and
I'm trying to you know I grew up in
grocery stores and cafes and my family
had those they had a distribution
business and you know things like that
so I all all in food um and so like I've
just been I like the TCT tactile sort of
like just using my hands and I just kind
of like the Simplicity of those
businesses um they're messy messy
because of employees and obviously it's
a very different type of management than
like managing as a product manager with
like designers and engineers and things
like that so there's a little bit of a
difference there but um yeah like I'm
attracted to that I'm attracted to you
know uh kind of like taking back a
little bit of control of my my career um
and also just trying to find something
with like cash flow uh that is Cash
flowing and profitable and things like
that so it's yeah how much money like
free cash do you have to invest invest
in a
business so I was I was definitely going

[36:02]
business so I was I was definitely going
to be considering uh my own cash uh some
portion debt with like SBA loan or some
sort of loan as well as uh seller
financing that would be my kind of it
would be a combination so um Free Cash
Plus maybe like a 100 Grand I would say
around 100 Grand so you could use that
or some of that to put down uh in
addition to seller financing Andor an
SBA
correct yeah okay so here's my gut like
from everything you've told me um you're
laid off a few months ago your job
market is really tough right now you
have experien managing people is that
right yeah yeah definitely you you feel
comfortable with that like you people
like you I love
it I love working with people no I'm not
a jerk no no definitely not very
collaborative uh yeah nice I try to be
I'm fair fair and firm yeah okay I feel
like the time the phase of life that

[37:01]
like the time the phase of life that
you're in today is not the phase of life
to chase Your Passion right the the the
dad's that cook thing it sounds fun but
it just doesn't feel like you have that
luxury right now and you're doing it
because you you you want to be doing
something and you should be doing
something and good on you for doing
something right you're not just sitting
there watching Netflix all day you're
building and I commend you for that but
I don't see a path for this side hustle
being enough to cover your monthly
burden right in likeable future yeah
like I would love it if you were to tell
me man I know this guy this guy and this
guy that are doing this and this is
their model and they're making 70 grand
a month 110 Grand a month 10 grand a
month anything where it could be like
okay let's take some of that market
share or okay let's go capture these
dads that they're not even looking at
like these guys are they're only doing
Instagram organic and they're crushing
it but no one's doing it on Tik Tok okay
let's talk about that right but I it

[38:00]
let's talk about that right but I it
just scares me if you're inventing a
model um and it scares me that you don't
already have an audience that you could
push this to that $19 a month scares me
like I've done a newsletter before that
scares me because it is just a slow
linear grind to get that to be five 10
grand a month even so I feel like you
should just kind of keep doing that as
your outlet but not expecting to rely on
that as being a form of tangible income
for you and not and not continuing to
work in that direction I think if the
job market is crap as I believe you say
it is I think you should look seriously
at buying a business um specifically
something in a niche that you have
experience with I wrote a newsletter
about this about a month ago I have like
a five or six step scoring system of if
you should buy or build a business and
one of the scores is is if you have a
lot of experience then you should be

[39:01]
lot of experience then you should be
more likely to buy that business um
because in my opinion the risks are much
higher when you buy a business because
you have something to lose right and so
if you are a product manager going to
buy a restaurant right and you're
obviously not trying to do that that
would be very risky whereas if you're
from the restaurant industry for 20
years that would be less risky um and so
I would just shop start shopping on bis
byell
uh despite what people say about it oh
there's no good deals left on bis Buell
they've all been picked through I don't
agree with that right there's there's
good deals on bis byell and on Zillow
and on kxy there's good deals everywhere
um there's a lot of Tire kickers and
dreamers and guys that just kind of play
business on bis byell and so if you want
to get a a broker or an owner to answer
your call or email you've got to break
through the noise and get really
creative um because they're sick of
dealing with all the tire sckers and I
feel like you're
serious I am I would tell them that you

[40:02]
serious I am I would tell them that you
have cash um you prefer seller financing
but you're also willing to do SBA and I
would find something that can cover your
monthly burn on day one with a lot of
upside right upside in my opinion being
they're not charging enough or they
don't even have a website or they have a
website but they're not marketing at all
or they're complacent like in my opinion
when it comes to buying a boomer owned
business that's the biggest and easiest
to find upside or things like that um
going in getting SBA qualified finding a
really good SBA
lender um being willing to put in some
cash hopefully the seller can can hold a
note and find any Like Home
Service any kind of boring ugly business
that is netting at least six figures a
year I would like put all of your energy
in focus into that and I think you'd

[41:00]
in focus into that and I think you'd
find something good I mean you're in a
city with 20 million people right
there's got to be something there's
there's a few things here do you so what
what I'm kind of like at
a what which kind of like your worry as
well is like I don't have experience you
know like you you you've written a lot
about like tree uh you know tree
trimming and things like all those kind
of Home Service I've never done any of
that stuff before so it's not like I
like I I was thinking of backf have any
experience in plumbing you know or
backflow I I'd have to go get like a
test or go go get certified in that too
but like I'm open to things like that I
just I'm you know like is there do
you like I do have most of my experience
has been Healthcare so it's like I know
Healthcare very well and I have
credibility in in the especially in the
healthcare space I've been looking at
like medical billing companies coding
companies things like that um so I
wonder like if that's a should I be
looking in that area or like should I or
really just doesn't matter industry
agnostic it doesn't I should be looking

[42:01]
agnostic it doesn't I should be looking
at there's do you follow my business
partner
Nick I'm not no I don't unfortunately
sorry so he bought he lived in La he
bought a medical billing company in
Boise uh for a couple million sold it
two years later for five or six million
wow and didn't really do a ton um and
just he didn't even operate it he had an
operator that he gave minority Equity to
and they just made some good efficient
changes the owner was great she stayed
on um it was just a great outcome I
actually invested in that business but
oh wow I like that idea medical billing
I learned a little bit about that
industry when I helped him sell it and I
I learned there's uh an opportunity I
don't know how you feel about this but
it is a business strategy There's an
opportunity in medical billing today to
buy a medical billing company and to
Outsource the labor um or to use AI yeah
to cut
cost over yeah that's that's a that's a

[43:01]
cost over yeah that's that's a that's a
huge huge thing people using like India
Philippines um you know using folks like
that to to do that and AI is is doing
fantastic too um and I know a bunch of
the AI companies to like that are doing
that so very I mean maybe I should just
go down that I mean is there a great way
like to find those because I've had a
lot of trouble finding those businesses
like I would start calling
them like try to hire a VA to find the
owner's info a skip Tracer and text call
email them find the ones that seem to
have been around for a while seem to be
undercharging seem to have outdated
websites and that's the nice thing about
looking for a business to buy that is
very Niche and specific is that you can
hone in on like 10 of them right
especially if they're not listed and you
can be pretty sure that one or two of
those 10 are at least going to be
willing to sell and then you got a grand
right and then you got to get to the
closing table so maybe try 20 or 30 but

[44:01]
closing table so maybe try 20 or 30 but
still look on bis by cell there's stuff
on there and I wouldn't be completely
afraid of Home Services I would be
afraid of more High skill or more
high-risk Industries manufacturing
restaurants but Home Services you could
find a hundred different Home Service
type businesses that are not very high
skill where you could become experienced
in a weekend of YouTube videos right
yeah yeah and that might make you
nervous but you could learn a lot right
on
binging I I've I've learned quite a bit
doing YouTube so that's uh yeah it's my
uh it's my uh my University now so um
okay and what was skip Tracer again what
was that that's just what they call
someone who can find the contact info
really well or they have tools at their
disposal and on upwork there's thousands
of people that call themselves skip
tracers which really just means they
have login info to tools that okay make
that available to them I didn't know
that okay so I can have them go find uh

[45:02]
that okay so I can have them go find uh
and and should I be localized to
California or like I guess your
colleague was in LA as well and found
some place in Boise so that's um if if
you're willing to move I'm a huge
proponent of looking for the best deal
anywhere and just moving there um I'm a
big proponent on like if you're Beggars
can't be choosers right and if you find
an amazing deal on the other side of the
country but moved there for it oh he
moved I I didn't realize that okay so oh
that was the that was a key detail all
right so he moved to Boise that's and
they were not they were lifers they were
SoCal lifers so it was a big deal for
them to move but they do not regret it
whatsoever well yeah I can imagine with
that kind of outcome that's that's huge
um okay so and then you asked about
advertising and things like that for the
the the dad cooking thing like is that
something I should should also be doing
is I'm kind of like just kind of filling
the cut like you know feeding the soul a

[46:01]
the cut like you know feeding the soul a
bit I don't think so um I don't think so
honestly because that's a whole nut to
crack and you're going to have to put a
bunch of money into it just to break
even on ads like the play there is to
have some sort of a $49 course that you
sell that you can just break even on
with ads and then use those leads to
sell something more High ticket to them
that's kind of the whole Russell Brunson
Playbook there but that's
I I wouldn't split your time between the
two I would just you know keep your
newsletter going stay in the know um
keep that fire lit but not really lean
into trying to grow it because this is
looking for a business to buy is at
least at least one full-time job got it
okay this is this is super helpful um
yeah if and if your colleague knows any
anyone in the anyone selling in the
medical billing space that' be love love
to hear I'll have him reach out to you
he'd be happy to help yeah that'd be
fantastic appreciate that absolutely
David well thanks for coming on thanks

[47:00]
David well thanks for coming on thanks
Chris have a good day you too see you
bye bye
bye Patrick hey Chris how are you good
how are you
man
yes having a having a good Friday so far
good good so all uh all I know about you
is sales AI
you
there yeah we had a little bit of
buffering there um I didn't catch your
your first part sorry I said all I know
about you is sales
AI yeah uh so I'm a software engineer by
background and uh have been tinkering
over the past six months or so on an AI
product basically we have a a way for um
people to for us to build and train AI
models to do the sales process for uh

[48:02]
models to do the sales process for uh
for businesses and originally we were
going after really white collar category
um and there was going to be a lot of
Integrations and a lot of other things
and that that were really complex that
needed to be done uh before we would
really get product Market fit um uh in
the meantime I had the opportunity to
show this product to someone that's more
of in a blue crawler product business
and uh you know one $3 million year year
um sales category and it was as if I had
shown a caveman fire for the first time
you got really excited about the product
um feels like there's a lot of room to
run so obviously started started me
thinking about what other categories
what other areas um could I could I get
into and one of the things that I'm
running into is like there are many many
businesses in that space you know
whether it's a product or service
business you know sub $3 million kind of
maybe family run type business uh where

[49:00]
maybe family run type business uh where
we can we can help do some of their
inbound sales uh
qualification uh but I'm suffering with
honestly too many options and not really
knowing where to start a and then B like
how do I contact these people because
they're not LinkedIn or Twitter people
by and large they're they're out in the
field doing doing their their business
well actually these in my experience
these are the easiest guys to uh to
contact and I'll tell you how but but I
first want to hear about the guy you
talked to with the when you say $3
million is that the revenue of his
business or is that the potential size
of a customer he would be to you yes so
that's the re Topline revenue of his
business he's a he's a dealer for in a
product category what what industry like
tell me everything you can about this
guy yeah it's he's in the uh portable
shed storage industry uh has a lot of
inbound for for for his customers for
you know uh product feature you know
will it fit will it be a good fit for my
property those kind of things um and

[50:02]
property those kind of things um and
yeah uh so he gets a lot of inbound some
of that's really low quality or not not
super qualified and but at the same time
he may get two or three a week that that
are ready to move to to make a purchase
you know that day or or that week uh so
filtering through those is a is a
challenge for him okay so by by nature
of that business he just has a ton of
questions and probably 80% % of them are
the same right like exactly yeah do you
need to level this like how do you bring
it in how do you get access what right
stuff like that and so he's thinking if
I can just upload my FAQs basically this
AI software can just chat with my
customers and save me ton of time
exactly and uh we help them do that so
we we import all that data and and uh
build a model that's really customized
for their their business um and they
don't have to do anything other than
start to to send customers that way and
connect their socials uh start

[51:00]
connect their socials uh start
Distributing those phone numbers Etc
what would he be willing to pay for
something like
this you know the the next best option
for him would be hiring an employee to
do it um you know presumably either
inhouse or or some type of va so um you
know that would lend me to believe that
there's a fairly high dollar amount you
know thousand dollar or so a month uh to
be able to do that um you know being
that we're we're software obviously
we've got uh pretty good margin so we
could offer a really competitive rate
relative to what it would cost uh to
hire a person to do this even if they
were
offshore would this software live on the
website is it it's just a chat bot
basically yeah so it's uh it's Omni
channel right so it it's it's on the
website it it can answer um you know
text messages and phone calls as well as
um as well as Facebook messages those
kind of things okay here so chatbots are

[52:03]
kind of things okay here so chatbots are
crowded right and I'm sure you know that
right but I I think what you have going
for you here is the owners of these
bluecollar businesses have never heard
the word chatbot in their life right so
it might as well not be crowded if they
don't know that it's crowded or that
chat Bots are common place they were
Common Place long before AI right I
remember there was a there was a whole
chat chatbot craze with Facebook
Messenger like in the 20 18 2019 eras
but what if you took this product and
made it sms-based like with twilio I
think it is already it is already okay
yes is that like the first case use for
it or is that one of the uses for it
that's one of the uses so you can uh you
can call it you can text it you can chat
with it through Facebook Market or
Facebook uh messenger Etc uh as well as
chat with it through the website so
basically any channel that you're
pushing traffic to uh or or getting

[53:00]
pushing traffic to uh or or getting
leads from um with the notable exception
of like if you have a storefront um that
you walk
into how would you prefer to charge for
this like what what's Your Gut if you
were to charge have to charge for it
today what would you put up on the
website yeah I think I would probably
charge in that $6 $700 a month uh you
know recurring monthly recurring uh
category and do you think people would
pay
that based upon the feedback of one uh
you know he seemed really interested in
doing that and in fact is is traveling
it right now um you know to see if it's
if it's good fit for his business um you
know as we go out of people that
I've that that are in my circle maybe
there's a little less uh dollar amount
to be had
but yeah it's funny because the same
demographic the these these business
owners these Boomer business owners

[54:00]
owners these Boomer business owners
they're the first to say like keep jobs
in America don't Outsource jobs but the
second you pitch to them hey I could
replace your employee with a $500 a
month chatbot they're in they're so in
right yeah one of the things he
communicated with me was like uh getting
people of quality was really hard right
he's he's kind of Middle America and uh
getting people that were really driven
and motivated to to do a good job was
was difficult for him you know even at a
even at a high rate um so having having
the ability to just automate it is is
awesome for him yeah okay so have you
sold like is this live do you have a
website ready to go is it fully built
out or you still the uh pully built out
we we're still working on some
additional features and stuff but you
know it's it's definitely something that
could be uh turned on live today okay uh
is this gentleman willing to start
paying for it
because there's a difference between
this is amazing where has this been on
my life vers take my money yeah um you

[55:04]
my life vers take my money yeah um you
know we we had a conversation about what
price point we feel like that's
comfortable and he he replied positively
to that um you know he didn't pop out
his credit card
but okay I if I were you I would start
with this guy charge him whatever
doesn't even matter um and then craft
your landing page around his industry
mhm the shed industry literally and then
I would scrape a list of all of the shed
businesses in America or in a state or
whatever and start texting them um just
different approaches hey
like honestly you could start by texting
them a normal question that a customer
would ask right just to get their
attention like hey like are you open or
are you open over the weekend or do you
have this model in stock and then just
start a conversation of what you can do
for them and I would get on the phone

[56:01]
for them and I would get on the phone
with this guy and say hey I'm going to
give you half off um but I I really want
to pick your brain and know like all of
the pain points in your business so you
can start using those pain points as
part of your sales pitch to these other
business owners because this
is when your total addressable Market is
so big you really have to start so Niche
like don't name this you know shed
business shot.com name it something
generic so it can be anything but Point
all your branding towards the shed
industry and just for a month just for a
month just see how it goes and are you
able to acquire I like to use the 1%
rule personally so if you have 10,000
shed businesses and you all of them
let's say you have 10,000 shed
businesses and all of them see your
outbound right they see it it's an email
or it's a voicemail or it's a text
and you can convert 100 of them then to

[57:00]
and you can convert 100 of them then to
me that's a scalable business and that
sounds like oh easy well it's not easy
sometimes it's a you know a tenth of a
percent and I would not try to scale
that business but if you can convert 1%
of them then with additional tweaking
you can probably convert two to three to
four even 5% of them which is a great
business and then take that learning
scale it as much as you can and then if
it's not a big enough business for your
liking yet then add it another industry
and just change the branding on the
website because if you're getting your
first customer to give you all this data
that's your llm and now you it's that's
less friction for customers two through
200 it's going to be much easier to
onboard them right whereas it's GNA
you're going to handhold all these
different Industries and it's not going
to be efficient for you so I would start
with just hey serendipitous this is this
is what I'm doing now I have a chatbot
for sh companies because of one
conversation I had with a guy and you're

[58:00]
conversation I had with a guy and you're
assuming that sample size of one can
scale and you might learn on the first
day after you talked to 10 other shed
guys that this guy was a an outlier but
probably not okay yeah great feedback
thank you yeah absolutely well I wish
you the best of luck thanks Chris
yep all right well I think that's it for
today on the the live call-ins we had a
couple other but they weren't able to
make it at this time so I have a few
pre-submitted questions that I'm going
to answer there was one person they
didn't leave any contact information
whatsoever so but they didn't want to be
anonymous so that was just an oversight
I've since changed the type form so that
can't happen again but they asked I'm
gon to read their question
exactly how to buy a home in a very
small community under 40 homes where
there are no acceptable homes uh public
publically for sale now so first of all
I'm going to focus on one word in here

[59:00]
I'm going to focus on one word in here
acceptable acceptable for you I imagine
um it sounds like this is tough okay it
sounds like a pretty exclusive Community
under 40
homes um the average homeowner stays in
their home for three years if it's a
community like this that's you know
exclusive and highly sought after let's
call it five years that means
statistically speaking under 40 homes
let's say there's 35 homes divided by
five is seven um that means every two
months there should be one home for sale
so according to statistics you can wait
and you know check out a home every two
months or if you're not wanting to wait
which I imagine you're not the best way
to do it is just to knock all 40 homes
um as someone who's knocked over 20,000
homes I'll tell you that knocking 40
homes will take you one evening and and
a home is a very important decision and
it's one that most people don't take

[1:00:00]
it's one that most people don't take
lightly and so if you really want to
live there I would spend an evening call
it a Tuesday or a Thursday night between
6 and 900 pm and just knock all the
homes and say hey my name is anonymous
and I really really really want to live
here bring some sort of a flyer or a
business card or something and try to
associate try to get them to associate
you with something memorable like I'm
the guy that randomly knocked on your
door that you want to tie the memory of
you to something so maybe you wear a
weird shirt or something I'm the guy in
the flannel or whatever I'm the guy that
wore a coat in the middle of the summer
um it'll just be easier and then if you
can get their phone Andor email and
check in with them every six months or
so uh i' I'd love to suggest some cool
you know high-tech option but this this
is a personal decision it's a big
decision for them it's a big decision
for you and I would just knock all the
doors
so uh next question we

[1:01:02]
have uh best service to form a legal
entity for a new business in the past
I've used Legal Zoom but there has to be
a better way specifically I need an
escorp in the state of California so I
did not do any research I don't know of
any websites that does this I'm sure
there are many I hate Legal Zoom I'll
just tell you everyone in the world I I
don't like Legal Zoom I don't like the
way they do business I don't like their
their emails their followup there
there's all kinds of shady onboarding
practices to trick you into buying this
or that so don't use Legal Zoom if I
were him I would go to upwork and post a
job for a paralal or someone to file an
escort it's going to be a lot cheaper
than finding a lawyer to do it
um next one is all right this is a
really good one so we just discovered
that our patented Tua Stone Quarry may
be ground into

[1:02:00]
be ground into
Pelon I don't even I've never seen that
word in my life and of used to the
cement industry initial testing will
will run 3 to 10 grand we just put
everything into a sawmill how best to
approach this potential opportunity all
right so if I'm understanding this
question correctly you own a stone
quarry for patented stua patented Tua
Stone um
and you you think it could be used for
cement and you're assuming that could be
as if not more profitable than what
you're currently using it for and it's
going to cost three to 10 grand to know
for sure to me this seems like an
asymmetric bet 3 to 10 grand I imagine
there are tons of people in your orbit
that would be willing to pay that for a
percentage of The Upside this reminds me
of the guy that threw away a hard drive
in the UK that had $130 Million worth of
bitcoin on it and he wanted to go dig up
the landfill and he could not afford to
do that it was going to cost like one to

[1:03:00]
do that it was going to cost like one to
five million bucks so he raised the
money successfully to dig up the
landfill has he found it yet I don't
think so I imagine I would have heard
about it but it's it's an asymmetric bet
you get you find 10 guys that will each
put in 500 Grand that you know that
that's a small percentage of their net
worth and they're going to get 40 50 60%
of the $130 million Bitcoin outcome or
they'll get nothing it's it's a Gamble
and there are a lot of gamblers out
there so this is three to 10 grand
honestly I would probably make that bet
email me and uh if everything looks good
I'd probably take that bet if I get a a
percentage of the revenue or profits so
just find an investor if you don't have
the money um last question is a vending
machine Biz
oversaturated I don't think any business
is oversaturated any business in the
world that's my hot take for the day and
I'm not just trying to sound
controversial I feel
like people only look at one side of the

[1:04:03]
like people only look at one side of the
equation when they look for saturation
in a market for
example virtual assistant agencies
they're everywhere I've talked about it
before on a previous episode every time
I get on Twitter I'm launching a VA
agency and it's different it's Latin
America this one's different it's only
the Philippines oh this one's different
it's only Pakistan everyone's launching
them it's saturated it's oversaturated
how do you know how does anyone know if
it's saturated do you know how big the
market is do you know how much demand
there is you it just seems saturated
because in your little bubble everyone's
launching it now if you're launching it
in that bubble and only selling to that
bubble then there's a better chance that
it's saturated but even so there could
be more demand in that bubble than there
is Supply so is anything oversaturated
you can't answer that definitively
unless you know how big the supply and

[1:05:00]
unless you know how big the supply and
the demand sides are of that market in
that Niche and so if you go figure that
out somehow if you're able to figure out
the size of the market if you're able to
say in
[Music]
um Roswell New Mexico there's 10
plumbers and in every city every other
city in Roswell New Mexico that matches
their
demographics exact exactly with the
population there's five plumbers then I
think you could say with reasonable
certainty that it's oversaturated okay
well that contradicts what I said no it
doesn't because if there are twice as
many plumbers in Roswell New Mexico than
there should be based on other
demographics of other cities in New
Mexico then it almost certainly means
that those guys are not fully maximizing
the potential of their business they're
not fully marketing as well as they
should have or guess what they're not
out of business
they're still in business right so I'm
assuming they're all 10 of them are

[1:06:00]
assuming they're all 10 of them are
still able to feed their families which
means for some weird reason there could
be something going on in Roswell that
makes the demand for plumbing much
higher than average right and so I I
just I take issue when people say it's
oversaturated it's oversaturated because
of their anecdotal sample size seeing
something in in their immediate orbit
that seems to be oversaturated with
maybe all 10 of those plumbers are
garbage they all have terrible customer
service maybe they're all overpriced and
you could come in there with a fair
price or with great customer service and
be number 11 and do better than the
other 10 so is the vending machine
business oversaturated absolutely not
and I don't need to know anything about
the vending machine Biz to answer that
definitively because there's room for
everyone it's capitalism and if you do a
better job then that means the other guy
will have less business or go out of
business which means that you will be
successful so instead of worrying about

[1:07:01]
successful so instead of worrying about
if something is oversaturated ask
yourself do I want to go into this
business do I love this business is
there an asymmetric bet in this business
do I have an unfair advantage in this
business do I have a way of finding new
vending machines uh or finding places to
place new vending machines that other
people don't that's the question you
should be asking yourself because
there's
opportunity
everywhere so don't worry about the
other guys just worry about what your
preferences are and where you have an
unfair
Advantage um I think that's it we're at
an hour and six minutes thank you for
