there's a lot of money billions of dollars pouring
into agent rappers well Vegas always wins why
don't I just become Vegas that sounds like the
perfect side hustle actually i agree 15 grand all
day for thousands of years recorded history every
king has had their adviserss an expert on farming
expert on war an expert on commerce we now have
that at our fingertips whereas in the past it was
the billionaires who could afford to have somebody
on their staff if you want the deep research just
use Perplexities for $20 a month and you basically
get the same thing if not better banana ketchup
it is 90% of the ketchup market in the Philippines
[Music] what all right I got a little framework AI
hack for our listeners today you've got Chad GPT
their $200 a month pro plan and then you've got
Perplexity their pro plan is $20 a month but they
have a deep research function that is in mine and
Kamal's opinion shout out to Kamal for pointing
this out to me better just because of the UI the
way they organize it it's better oh okay so the
experience is better not necessarily the output
both have you messed around with Grock's deep
research just a little bit i would be curious

[01:04]
to hear your guys' opinion on that too okay but
like we've talked a lot about operator and deep
research most people myself included are hesitant
to pay $200 a month especially when free options
out there exist like Grock so if you want the deep
research just use Perplexities for $20 a month and
you basically get the same thing if not better
because I'm not using operator like now that
deep research came out I haven't used in about
two or three weeks so a little life hack let me
ask you why why aren't you using operator because
deep research does it for me and it's faster it's
the same thing for me it's like I was going to use
operator to go and scrape all these sites but now
I can just tell deep research go to these sites
pull this information put it into this table and
it just executes it so it's kind of weird to me
like well why would I ever use operator at this
point especially with the given the functionality
currently i'm assuming that operator is going to
get a lot better and a lot faster and then we'll
go back to using it but I'm having a lot of luck
i have like a a GPT just called deep dives and
that's where I do a lot of my deep research

[02:03]
prompts and I still do deep research prompts in
other GPTs but I do it mostly in deep dives so
it'll spit out 10,000 words and then I just say
I just say "Hey take the most interesting things
based on my preferences and give me bullet points
of everything above." And it's like so much easier
to read can we talk about this right now we both
have custom GPTs in fact I texted you this morning
about like one of your custom GPTs tell me about
that custom GPT that you built there's nothing
custom it's just one of my GPTs that I only use
for deep research like I didn't upload any PDFs or
anything to it there's no overriding prompt oh you
just created like a separate folder basically okay
do you want to talk about GPTs i think that would
be interesting to at least like I'm not having a
lot of success with it like building a GPT based
on all of my tweets or all like where you have a
like you upload a bunch of stuff and then you
have like instructions and then you just start
talking to it i haven't had a lot of success with
it really given it a good enough shot i have for

[03:01]
like very specific tasks so what we're talking
about right now is in chat GPT you can build a
custom GPT it's not like you're not training it
on your own data set but you are training it more
than is allowed in the current context window on
chat GPT so what you can do is you'll say "Hey
like I'll give you one of my custom GPTs i have my
weekly newsletter GPT and I've trained it and I've
said "Hey I'm going to upload three transcripts
from my podcasts from those podcasts this is what
I want you to pull out i want you to summarize
each business model with this these specific
criteria and here's an example of two that I've
done and then for business idea of the week I want
you to give me three suggestions based on that
conversation and then I want you to right so so
I'm telling it and then I'm giving it examples
and then it's saved and I never have to enter
the custom prompt again it's it's essentially
like helping me save a prompt and so I do use

[04:00]
it for that for like very very specific use cases
just to like give me an idea and get me going but
to your point no i I don't find it to be like
perfect every single time you know what I've had
better luck with is whenever Chad GPT spits out
something perfect right it's just like my voice
my style whatever I I always tell it remember this
hey remember this this is this was really good
remember this and it will show you like a little
a little like a widget will appear and it's like
bloop remembered and it will carry that memory
across other chats or other GPTs i had somebody
post this week Hector was sent he posted he's like
"Hey I feel like I need to get into AI like how
does a guy even get started in this space?" And
so I responded and said "Here are my three like
suggestions." Number one just pick one chat TBT
Perplexity Gemini I don't care what it is just
pick one upgrade to the pro plan on whatever
which one it is so it's 20 bucks a month cool
and then stop going to Google for anything that's
not geographic based so if I'm not looking for a

[05:03]
restaurant or a sports team or hours of operation
of a business if I'm like what was the biggest
uh country in the world in 1952 don't go to Google
anymore go to the AI i'm going to say chat GPT for
the AI cool and then third anything that you
would have used an expert or an assistant or
bounced ideas off of start using Chat GPT like
I really like uploading contracts or I really
like uploading financial statements i really like
uploading just things that would have longer than
a paragraph that I'm going to have to actually
read through i upload it and then it gives me
bullet points and I can start just interacting
with it and asking it questions so if you're
thinking about like how do I even get started do
that get get a prop plan for any of the any of
the models stop using it for anything other than
geographic questions and start anything longer
than a paragraph that you need to synthesize
putting that information into it i think it's
a good framework to basically separate in your
mind the geographical or the more recent news

[06:01]
because OpenAI does not want to go scrape the
internet again right that costs them money and
so you just know that Open AI is biased and if
you're like "What's the best Filipino restaurant
in Dallas Texas?" it's going to have to go look
right then and it's already done that you know
maybe a month ago maybe a year ago it would
rather not and so you're going to get a bi a
more biased or a less quality answer than going
to Google for stuff like that but for almost
everything else I go to GPT totally agree so one
cool framework that I found for deep research is
if you're trying to think of trending things or
business ideas one of the best places I get new
business ideas is just when I travel anywhere
right maybe it's an hour Norway just out of
my circle and so I've been using deep research
for that and so I asked the prompt I want you to
find me like unique foods in other countries that
are starting to take on here in the United States
um and then it spits out a bunch and I can take
one of those or more and go deep on that one and

[07:04]
see huh could there be an opportunity there and I
found something interesting called banana ketchup
have you ever heard of that Nick i've heard of
banana hammocks but I've never heard of banana
ketchup all right banana ketchup it is 90% of
the ketchup market in the Philippines what yeah
it's ketchup made out of bananas it's healthier
okay they eat it with their spaghetti with their
ketchup's tomatoes not in the Philippines okay
okay the banana ketchup market in the US is 225
million and growing at like 7% a year 225 million
a year tiny tell me the growth percentage again
wait wait tell me tell me the growth percentage
7% that's not that that's not that fast growth
it's like if you look at the Google Trends data it
is booming like search volume for banana ketchup

[08:02]
specifically in the United States is booming right
now okay hold on so we're talking about frameworks
say that again so you you're traveling you're
using food what food is popular you find you found
banana ketchup and then you went to Google Trends
so you didn't just go to like Google well yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah then I'm like okay interesting
i go to Google Trends type in banana ketchup look
at the last 5 years okay so you're not going
to Google period and being like what is the
gross domestic product okay you're going to Google
trends to because that's actually real-time data
i'm just looking for redundancy on what Chad GPT
told me and if I find it outside of Chad GPT then
I go back to deep research and I say "Huh banana
ketchup that's interesting." And when you say
redundancy you just mean you're you're trying
to find evidence that what chatbt said is true
another data point yeah okay yeah and then this
was my exact prompt i said "Deep dive on banana
ketchup in the Philippines and launching something
similar in the US is there an opportunity there?"

[09:01]
And then it's like do you want feasibility study
general market analysis comparison other content
yeah yep and then I say it gave me four bullet
points and I said yes to the top three no to
the fourth and it gave me so much info and then
I'm like okay Google just give me bullet points
of this okay fill me in what were the bullet
points you could charge $4 to $6 a bottle it
says according to like Google Google's keyword
tool uh there's much more demand than supply
it kind of looks at it like Sriracha was 10 20
years ago right because 20 years ago you're like
"Okay what kind of market is there for like
pickled pepper sauce called Sriracha?" Well
it's pretty huge peter Piper picked a pack of
pickled peppers exactly right yeah i just think
it's interesting like people are going away
from red dye right red dye is being banned in
the US it's a healthier alternative to ketchup
ketchup is the biggest condiment in the United
States by far something interesting there can
I give this is kind of an example of how I use
deep research all right so I downloaded all of my
tweets because you can download that from Twitter

[10:06]
it it takes a while it takes like 24 hours for
them to actually produce it for you and I got
this massive file what do you want to know out
of your tweets right you want to know which ones
perform the best you want to know which ones
had the most engagement right and so whereas a
couple of months ago I would have probably just
uploaded the sheet and been like "Tell me which
tweets were the best." I don't do that anymore
this is the prompt I gave it you ready okay yeah
i have a spreadsheet with all of my Twitter posts
from the last year and a half there are about 520
lines of data each line has a link to the post
let me interrupt you i really like that you said
how many lines of data there are because a lot
of times it will just pull from a sample size
and you don't even know until you really start
probing so it's like this is what to expect right
do you know why I started doing that actually
I'm assuming because it was only pulling from a
sample size but No actually I didn't know it was
pulling from a sample size i started doing that
because of our conversation of you building that
tool with Steve uh with Oh mine was only pulling

[11:00]
from a Yeah yeah yeah cuz you were you were like
why the freak isn't this data correct and then you
found out it's only pulling a sample size of 10
so I was like I don't want you pulling a sample
size i want you pull pulling all the So that's
why I I include all of all of the lines are you
able to look at each post and categorize it for
me i would like you to I would like you to give
a brief oneline 30 characters or less description
that's cool that's cool categorize the post with
at least one of these tags podcast thread howto
guide quick share troll because I have a lot of
troll tweets framework tool deep dive personal and
story give me a quality score on the post based on
a mix of the number of views bookmarks and likes
relative to my followers at the time and then
I hit enter okay so but the reason I wanted to
read it out is because it was like there probably
people listening who are like "Wow that was a lot
more detailed than I would have asked." Chat TV
but we've talked about this before if you want to
get the right answer you've got to ask a longer

[12:01]
question and even after asking that I there were
other follow-up questions that I had to clarify
but I think is I've like shifted my mind is like
"Oh this is a research assistant i've got to be
very specific with them they're going to give me
good data back but I've actually got to prompt it
in the way that I would prompt a human to go and
look at this data." Yeah cuz you and I do that all
the freaking time we've employing people like "Hey
go get this done." And they're like "Okay." Like
they're eager to please they're like "Okay." Then
they're like "Fick what I what do I actually do?"
or or worse they go do it and they come back to
us and they're like "Here's 10 hours of work."
And you're like "That is not at all what Yeah
that's not at all what I wanted." And it was our
fault for not being clear on what we wanted the
more you treat it like a like a human the better
it performed which is a little freaky yeah it is
very freaky very freak i was thinking about this
last night on the drive home ai is going to get
really good right we have really good and really
bad employees though and and they're very smart
what if we have AI developed and it's not the

[13:02]
tool that we think it's going to be it's like oh
it's going to help me we give it a prompt and it's
like nah I don't like what you asked me actually
here's what you should be looking at no no you
should actually just be looking at the number of
tweets by month and the aggregate volume of views
that's what you should be it's like well I didn't
ask you that i want I want to know exactly what
my tweets like i'm curious some employees do that
too that's what I'm getting at right it's like I'm
curious if at some point you you know we've got
to figure out how to run it back in anyways that
was a quick squirrel and then when you combine
AI with hardware like a robot and it does the
same thing it's like huh instead of cooking you
stir fry I'm going to kill you no that Okay let
me ask you something about agents i feel like
agents are it's almost like crypto even today
or five years ago where it's like everyone's like
crypto this crypto that and it's like web three
hold on hold on yeah web 3 back up who's actually
using this like who is actually buying their their
coffee with crypto well no one but like oh there's
potential and we just need to put our tax records

[14:04]
on the blockchain yada yada yada and it's like the
business of crypto is buying and selling crypto
and like today it's still pretty true i feel
like agents is very agents are very similar i
there are literally over five over five companies
that have raised seven to eight figures just to be
an outsourced sales agent you know outsource
your sales to an agent okay there's a lot of
money billions of dollars pouring into companies
building agent rappers and like we're all talking
about it we're agent this and I was talking to
Kamal a month ago and it's like hey anytime I
have something to do if you can't do it then see
if the VA can do it if the VA can't do it see if
an agent can do it that's the new framework so
we don't have to hire a bunch of people okay cool
who is actually using agents to do tasks for them
autonomously without intervention on a daily basis
and like what are those no no like I'm you're like
actually trying i'm trying like there's Gum Loop
there's Lindy there's all kinds of tools that like
make integrating things and automating things like

[15:04]
the Zap Your AI there's a bunch of tools that
do that but like Lindy we spent hours trying to
get Lindy to work with my freaking inbox and it's
just not there and I want it to be there are you
using agents i tried like I'm trying to use agents
problem with agents is like I still feel like it's
it's manual right like operator is the perfect
example you you have to sit there with your
tab open and watch it move slower than a human to
actually complete a task or a function now I don't
think all APIs I don't think all integrations are
the same as the way the operator works but that's
like a good analogy where it still feels like
RPA so video is cool but you know what's better
long form audio via podcast and my newsletter
tkopod.com go there to subscribe for free to my
newsletter it's one email a week very tactical and
then go to my audio podcast three episodes a week
stuff like this you're going to love it all free
no sleazy sales pitch tkopod.com robotic process

[16:03]
automation right so like robot RPA for people who
don't know i didn't I didn't know what it was but
it was very very specific set of instructions of
what to do okay at 10:00 a.m go to this website
click this link click download this report uh
export it to this file but it was it was very
very very specific and so you could do really cool
things you could like run a report every single
day and then populate a dashboard but it wasn't an
agent it was just doing what you told it to do and
so I feel like we're saying the word agent but
it's still this like robotic process automation
system it's going to be agents when we can say
"Hey find me the best tweet yesterday in SMB." Mhm
that performed the best right and then it goes out
and using context and critical reasoning it's like
"Okay well this one didn't get the most views but
had the most bookmarks and had the most shares."
And oh this one was actually retweeted by Mark
Cuban and you know what I mean like best tweet

[17:04]
how do you define that like either you're going to
have to do the robotic process automation and very
clearly defined pull the best tweet or you have
an agent that you can say pull the best tweet and
it goes and executes that task on its own i have
not found the agents yet i've found the robotic
process automations which sucks i want them to be
here we're still so early i think I told you this
a week ago like my mind's kind of shifted from oh
AI is going to replace everybody in six months to
it's going to disrupt and displace a lot of things
but the adoption curve is still going to be a long
one like it's not dude it's It's the last mile
like the last mile for any new innovation is
so long like self-driving cars that last mile
like it's so hard to get just get that last bit
finished yeah well and think about it like this we
have been working for years on achieving AGI the
smartest humans in the world at some point we're
going to get to AGI and at some point there's

[18:02]
going to be parody between a human and a computer
but at that point when there's parody it's only
that we have like more smart humans to work on
problems right we don't have smarter humans yet to
work on problems we just have more smart humans to
work on problems so we will get there like there
will be an inflection point where we're able to
actually develop smarter technology because we've
brought computers along and they've reached AGI
but like we're just not even we don't even have
the resources yet to really get to that point
anyways What you got for me i got an idea for you
we had a guy We had a guy tag us on the Twitter
sphere dragon Slayer 69420 said "No I'm just
kidding this is Zack Ashburn." Zach tagged us it
was a video of him saying "Look at this freaking
thing right here did you watch it?" Mhm okay yep
so I'll explain it and then we can talk about it
i thought it was really cool i don't remember
exactly what it is but his wife somehow is in
the fashion industry i don't know if they have
an e-commerce store or if she just works in the
fashion industry but he was talking about how in
the fashion industry they have to make decisions a

[19:03]
year in advance they're guessing basically like
"Okay what does fall 2026 fashion look like?"
Because if we want to deliver fashion in fall 2026
we've got to buy products we've got to manufacture
it we've got to get it shipped like there's
a whole lag in between when it's produced and
when it's actually popular and in order to prepare
for that these people will literally read industry
reports of like hey this is what we think is going
to be the most popular thing a year and a half
from now here's the color scale here are you know
the different fabric types all of those things
and his idea was why would you not be using
chatbt operator or an operator deep research
to effectively create these forwardlooking reports
and sell them at a much cheaper price point than
what companies are currently doing i thought that
was really interesting so it wasn't just fashion i
I went and asked operator i was like "Hey tell
me if there are any other industries that do
this." And it gave me some good ones so So he said
fashion here are some of the other ones that it it

[20:04]
gave me food and beverage right hey what food and
beverage is going to be popular a year from now
because again there's a lag time between what's
popular and when you actually produce it so you
could you could build reports for people to say
"This is where preferences are are trending oh did
you know that there's uh never touchplastic.com
that's booming right now so actually a year from
now we think it's going to be three times as
big and so you should have XYZ products on your
shelves." Okay technology so you could literally
go and say "Hey here are the top 20 Google trends
right now." I went on Google Trends and these
are the top 20 things this is what it means for
your industry did you know more and more people
are searching inhome caregiver well that means
the industry is going to grow at you know a rate
of 10x percent and this is the product that you
could sell through that vertical right automotive
this was this was an interesting one just looking
forward and and predicting long-term shifts not
only in technology of new cars coming out but the
current cars that are being produced today what
problems are they going to have down the road

[21:02]
right like oh we're going to have a big problem
with LCD screens needing to be replaced in about
five years because all those cars that we sold are
you know are going to have problems i like this
idea of like because I think I think AI is really
good at this taking information and extrapolating
data points that help you understand not only
what happened but how to look for patterns in
the future and I think that that this would
be like a perfect use case so thank you Zach
i I'm gonna stop talking what do you think i
think it's great it's a no-brainer it's like
how long have researchers been around right like
forever i mean pick an industry healthcare science
math engineering whatever there's just so many
variables out there to really dive deep on and
to to connect data points on from here to there so
with with deep research being you know a thousand
PhD level researchers in your pocket we're going
to be uncovering incredible use cases for deep
research for the next decade like where does
it end i was talking to somebody the other day

[22:02]
and for thousands of years recorded history every
king has had their court right their adviserss hey
I got this guy he's an expert on whatever farming
he's an this guy's an expert on war this guy's an
expert on commerce this guy's an expert on trade
whatever we now have that at our fingertips like
I now can have an expert on all of those things
at my fingertips whereas in the past it was the
billionaires who could afford to have somebody
on their staff who was like "Hey let me get Brian
he's the AI expert get him in here i want to ask
him a question." It's like I got a guy for that
yes sir i I And Brian graduated with a PhD in like
computer science from Stanford University you know
what I mean it's like yeah so he only knows stuff
about computer science and there's only one of
Brian right and it's like great I have like the
best expert in this field who works directly for
me and so that billionaire is able to make much
better decisions because he actually has the right
inputs well now we have that at our fingertips
yeah and Brian is so biased because his favorite
professor specialized in Java and so he loves
Java and like you know what I'm saying whereas

[23:01]
like deep research doesn't give a crap it's just
going to give us a bunch of data back to agents
like we're all talking about agents but like
we need to be talking about deep research like
that's an agent you just have to prompt it once
it is an agent because it's doing agentic things
it's going out and it's scraping and it's putting
it into a data set for you if you ask for a data
set it's giving you the links you still have to
go and digest it yourself to understand it let
me tell you Nick you sound really smart when you
say the word agentic okay you need to know that
can you say that again so I can play it for my
wife that's unnecessary just hit repeat let me
bring in an idea that's not AI related and see if
you like it okay I love it i would hate to talk
about someone else's business idea and not name
them all right i'm not going to call this person
some guy all right i'm gonna call him his actual
username at Justin_XYZ on Twitter oh interesting
you give them attribution that's really weird h I
didn't think you were supposed to do that i don't

[24:00]
think you're supposed to do that i haven't thought
of that i thought I'd do something nice today you
know maybe pay it forward so Justin from Taiwan
that's his Twitter name he tagged me on a tweet
and have you ever heard of Activate Games no I've
heard of Activision Blizzard activate Games is a
retail space blowing up i think it's a franchise
blowing up across the country they're in about
4,000 square feet you're going to find them next
to a Chipotle or a Shake Shack and they're for
families kids and adults millennials all ages you
go in you pay 35 45 bucks and you're in this room
that has all these rooms that break off you go
in this main room with all these touchcreens and
a scoreboard and then you go play these games like
basketball games or t like tiles on the floor that
light up or you know kind of like carnival games
but it's all gamified it's you're you're connected
to everyone else there you have a certain amount
of time to do it and you just there's like 15 No
you know what there's like 15 different rooms
each room has like five to 15 different games

[25:01]
so there's hundreds of different games in this
one space for 35 bucks it's fun as crap it's an
legitimate workout like you break a sweat and
think like escape room or or like a trampoline
park but better than both of them this is it's
just blowing up it's like a modern Chuck-E-Cheese
yeah that's a good but like for all ages right
it's got a ton of different games you could go
play a ton of different games but these are these
are like a lot more physical like it's a place
for you to bring your kids or for you to go on
a double date with your wife and and two other
adults and no kids like it's it's for literally
for all ages okay okay so this guy on Twitter
found the source of these floor tiles they're like
these light up tiles they cost like I don't know
uh $15,000 you can set up a whole room with the
hardware software everything and you can charge
people to play instead of hundreds of different
games in a big expensive retail space you can
set them up in your house and charge people 10 to
20 bucks to play 10 different games all based on

[26:03]
these floor tiles really what do you think yeah
like you just set up an iPad little touchcreen
which game do you want and then it plays and
you've got lights and you've got the tiles and
you dance and you jump from one to the other and
there's the timer and like this could be a side
hustle dude like my mind goes to a mobile side
hustle sure oh there's a corporate event oh hey
we're having uh the company picnic this year it's
at Gerber Park oh that's cool hey let's get the
uh the game company mobile games oh yeah great
idea and then you come and you have your tile and
it's like "Oh the kids want to play a game cool
what game do you want to play and they just you
know they take turns playing it doesn't have to be
in a physical location that you're renting out you
can just start on a mobile basis i would bet it
takes like 30 to 60 minutes to set up oh really
like Yeah but e even so like that's like $20 worth
of labor you can set it up at a park or an outdoor
shopping area totally yeah i I think of like
schools when they're having their like back to
school fairs and they're raising money carnivals
especially in the summer when you're having a

[27:02]
bunch of you know cities are having lots of things
this would be like the perfect thing you just set
up this guy claims I I can't I can't vouch for
this but he says for under $15,000 you can set
up a room that pays for itself in a month charge
$25 a person six to eight people per session five
to six sessions per day that's $1,000 a day our
clients are already doing it now granted he's
selling these things it's in his best interest to
say that but it's interesting cuz like I wanted
to take my daughter to activate games we we showed
up and they're like "Oh there's Yeah yeah you can
play there's a 4-hour wait." And I crunched the
numbers and like cuz you can see on their website
how many slots how many people per slot at 100%
occupancy they're doing like 7 million a year did
you know where this would crush in a college town
that doesn't allow liquor like I don't know Provo
Utah oh you mean in the only college town on the
planet to the public i'm just thinking like like
if you set it up in the dorms or if you set it
up in like shared student housing especially I'm

[28:04]
thinking BYU right it's like Helilimman Halls
helilim Halls they knock those down i think
they're now I don't know anyways but yeah it's
just like for young couples to go and have a date
that would be a a freaking really cool place to
go have a date anyways it could be in the dorms
it could be at the university itself it could
be something mobile that sounds like the perfect
side hustle actually i agree 15 grand all day all
right I have one so I had this guy on my podcast
his name is Ethan in fact I'm going to find his
last name real quick cohen yes Ethan Cohen i had
planned to talk to him because he's franchising
his business model i plan to talk to him about
franchising he told me the craziest freaking story
it was just bonkers of how he got into doing what
he's doing here's the short of the long he goes
to college he has saved up $15,000 and proceeds
to lose it in a four-week period of time because
he gets into betting and gambling and the more he

[29:01]
loses the more he doubles down he's going to make
his money back whatever has to go and confess to
his dad his dad's like "You're never doing this
again man here sign this contract." So he makes
his dad makes him write out this contract goes
back to college he's doing fine gets an internship
six months later he's got six grand nba playoffs
roll around he's got the itchy trig trigger finger
gamles again loses it all he's lost over $20,000
at this point then he's like "Crap I got to tell
my dad." So he tells his dad and the lesson he
takes from this is not "I should stop gambling."
The lesson he takes from this is "Well Vegas
always wins why don't I just become Vegas?" So he
starts a sports book he becomes Vegas his friends
all start placing bets that's pretty smart through
him that's pretty smart in one month he's like "I
made 22 grand the first month that I had this this
betting book." He's like "But people weren't
paying me and I had to be like threatening to
them." He makes 22 grand but he got he's owed like
10 grand from these other people and they're not
paying him and he's like I had to contact a guy he
goes on the dark web he emails this guy his social

[30:01]
security number and is like "Hey look man i have
your social security number either pay us what you
owe us or I might be doing something with this."
Ethan did that yeah ethan had Ethan had a guy
who he did that for and e so Ethan's like "I just
didn't like it i didn't like feeling like that."
Uh so I ended up getting rid of the sports book
selling it he then gets into vending machines
and starts selling Zen through vending machines
it's insane dude freaking amazing he committed
Zenfidelity dude he was screaming Zenfidelities
that's how bad it was we're so stupid you're
either Zen or you're Zen you're either Zen or
you're out he was all Zen dude like once he
found that business he was all zen anyways starts
selling Zen in these vending machines places it
in his dorm he's making like $3,000 a month a kid
in his dorm or not his dorm his frat house breaks
it he's in Europe he gets a message it's like
"Dude your vending machine's broken." He's like
"Oh crap." 2 minutes later also dude that video is
trending video's freaking trending three million

[31:07]
the video of them breaking Oh I didn't know the
venue of it yeah so they take a video videos of of
him breaking the vending machine is now freaking
trending on Bar Stool Sports he starts getting all
these DMs people they're like "Hey how did you get
a a Zen vending machine?" He's like "Oh well all
I did was buy an old vending machine." And then I
swapped out I took I got rid of the the the coin
and the and the paper money reader and we just
inserted a credit card reader they're like "Oh
cool could you do that for us?" He gets a hundred
orders he's ordered them he's placing them they're
in the process of fulfillment he's placed 30 of
them he gets a loan for $250,000 from friends and
family he's looking at this he's like "Dude I'm
going to make freaking $80,000 a month in profit."
This is March of 2020 Chris what happens March
of 2020 everything shuts down dude everything
shuts down so then he's got these machines that
he can't place anyways he's got to like retool
everything it's free it was nuts it was a crazy
story to hear the interesting thing that I took

[32:04]
from that was he got started by buying these
old vending machines for like three grand and
then working with this Israeli company that's
apparently the number one company for the the
uh credit card payments on vending machines to
then retrofit them with the electronic payments
and then all of a sudden he's like I was just
buying the shell essentially to make sure that
it was safe but then I had vending machines for
way cheaper so I just really liked the idea that
he had which was going and buying old shells of
vending machines and retrofitting them with new
technology and then placing them within colleges
using the colleges as a distribution model I think
is a really interesting idea i mean we tried to
do this with co-founders where we we're looking
for for people who to start business with us
using the college system as a distribution
channel he's using it for vending but I wonder
if there's any other cool ideas anyways I just
vomited a lot what do you think dude I just
I love how his brain works because it reminds

[33:00]
me of the Midwip meme distribution curve where
it's like all the guys in the middle are like
"All right time for some research and development
we're going to figure out how to make a vending
machine that can dispense the Zin canisters
all right let's get a 3D rendering of a Zen
C." And like he's just like "We're going to buy
a vending machine and put Zen in it." It's like
"No you can't do that because no you can just
do that." And it's funny because the story that
he told he was like I thought I was me patenting
these machines and he's like and then eventually
it was just like no I'm just buying machines and
retrofitting them sitting in them or like what's
the what's the book or the movie about the guys
the MIT crew that goes and like beats the house
blackjack oh yeah yeah 21 something like that so
that's like one end of the spectrum and they're
like "All right we're going to beat Vegas by
using data and machine learning." And and he's
like "I'm just I'm just going to be Vegas like I
don't need to be Vegas to the world i need to be
Vegas to my dorm room and I I'll do just fine."
It's the same mindset it's so crazy he He's like

[34:02]
totally cleancut like from Beverly Hills i'm
guessing from a Jewish family great kid and I'm
like "Hold on a second you became a a a gambling
a degenerate gambler then you became a bookie
then you started selling vice products like drugs
you became a drug dealer like what how how did
this evolution happen so nuts he's checking all
the boxes i think I'm having him on the podcast
at some point so Well he'll probably release
it before me it's usually what happens bias
for action awkward that just got awkward no you'll
you'll you'll like his story dude it was I like it
yeah it was awesome i'm stoked you should be all
right hey keep it sleazy all right what' you think
