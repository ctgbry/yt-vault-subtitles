look at this freaking guy right here
this guy makes over 500 Grand a year
installing or repairing thatched roofs
but how can you profit from that first
let's talk about what this actually is a
thatched roof is made out of straw or
Reed and they can last 30 to 40 years
which is even longer than a normal
asphalt shingle roof here in the US
hundreds of years ago a thatched roof
was a sign of poverty but today exact
opposite is true these can cost $5 to
$15,000 just to repair over $50,000 just
to install but people are loving it this
guy's videos get tens of millions of
views and he merch is monetized on
YouTube and this is begging to be copied
here in the states why because we want
unique housing experiences and this guy
says that in the UK there's a waiting
list of up to a year to get your
thatched roof installed or repaired
what's old is New Again history repeats
itself I promise you these roofs are
going to make a comeback and you can
monetize with a Marketplace a Blog a
lead genen service programmatic SEO I
write all about it right here
