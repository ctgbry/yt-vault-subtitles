I own eight RV parks and campgrounds and
I want to let you in on a little
industry secret glamping is exploding
right now and it's a major asymmetric
bet what do I mean by that higher than
average return for lower than average
investment this fancy glamping tent
behind me is called a Jupe they cost
$30,000 but people rent them out for
$100 to $400 per night for a tent this
inflatable thing going on behind me
costs a tiny fraction of that and you
can rent for about 80% of that amount
the 8020 rule is everywhere 80% as much
profit for 80% less investment you don't
need to buy expensive land outside of
national parks you can rent land as well
you can rent land on a one-year option
where you test out this concept for a
year and if it doesn't go well then you
pull the plug if it does go well you
have the option to buy the land at a
predetermined price once that first year
is up buy a glamping tent for 3,000
instead of 30,000 rent it for 80 a night
instead of 100 a night make your money
back in 2 to 3 months and you're in the
game
