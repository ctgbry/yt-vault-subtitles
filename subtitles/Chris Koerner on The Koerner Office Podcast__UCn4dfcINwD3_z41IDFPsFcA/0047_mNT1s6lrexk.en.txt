if you've ever wanted to learn about the
pet cremation business today is your
lucky day this is our refrigerated van
that we use for cremations we call it
our popsicle pickup and this is my dog
waffles he's in here for some
perspective we drive this van to our
Veterinary customers and we provide them
with large freezers for them to store
their deceased pets we pick up these
pets on a weekly basis in unmarked bags
we put those bags in this section of our
refrigerated van and we drive them with
love and care to our cremation facility
where they are cremated either
individually or in a group depending on
what the owner preferred post cremation
we're able to offer paw print memorials
or earns and the cost to cremate depends
on the breed size weight and muscle
density of the dog fun fact in case you
didn't know hope you learned something
