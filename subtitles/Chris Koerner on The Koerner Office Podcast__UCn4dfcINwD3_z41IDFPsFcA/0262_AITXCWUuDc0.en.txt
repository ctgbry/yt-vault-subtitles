someone jump on this $10 million
business idea remember these Brookstone
stores in the mall as a kid why don't we
have these today for viral product ideas
that we see on social media do you see
all these dumb products going on behind
me these things got hundreds of millions
of views but they're not in stores are
you telling me that inperson impulse
buying is dead it will never die here's
how you launch this business go to a
hight trffic mall like the Galleria of
Dallas or Houston rent a kiosk on a
month-to-month basis buy a handful of
these viral products from China as demos
flag people down as they walk by see how
many you can sell and if you sell them
well then open a full store inside that
same Mall reduce your risk with a kiosk
and then go all in once you prove the
model I promise you this could be aund
store business just like Brookstone
except better with 80 plus% net margins
