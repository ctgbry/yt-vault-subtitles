hot take the best business ideas sound
embarrassingly stupid and simple on the
surface so get this my friend has a
business that makes him about 250 Grand
a year and all he does is pay 150 bucks
a month for software that tells him all
of the permits that were pulled in any
given City for construction projects if
you need a pool you need a fence permit
if you need a new house you need a
sprinkler permit and he gets all the
leads he wants and then he calls up
foundation repair companies roofing
companies deck building companies and
sells these leads for $50 to $200 a
piece and he can sell the same lead to
multiple companies at the same time all
for a flat monthly fee from a website
that most people have never even heard
of yes sometimes it is that simple
