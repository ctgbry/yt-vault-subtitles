[00:00]
what is your churn life you get a
residential customer one of those deals
where like they just fall in love with
it like I don't know how I ever lived
without this and they almost exclusively
fill up with you or is it kind of like
people try it they use you sometimes
there was no one who's taking care of
both no one's taking care of small
businesses no one taking care of
personal vehicles before I did any of
that we run some Facebook ads what are
your revenues like right now one family
will spend about $5,000 with you over a
year how many refills do you do per
month for an average family
well why don't we start by you just
telling me who you are and what you do
yeah Corey McDavid I am the founder of
juice fuel we are a mobile fuel delivery
service okay and how long you been in
business uh almost two years now and
what gave you the idea to start that so
it started with you know my wife we had
just had her her second child and and
she hated going to the gas station she
drove a diesel SUV you know there's less

[01:01]
drove a diesel SUV you know there's less
diesel pumps so a lot of times you're
waiting on the diesel pump to open up
and you know crying kids you know hot
South Carolina she just hated the whole
experience but also at the time I was
terminal manager for the bulk liquids
terminal here in Charleston that brings
in all the fuel to the greater
Charleston area so my day job was
literally like monitoring the you know
who the suppliers were who their
customers were which which gas customers
could actually move the needle in the
area and that just got me looking into
you know seeing how how we could move
more barrels across our rack you know
that was that was my my main job but and
doing that research I saw that there was
really no one that was supplying fuel to
the little guys like if you're removing
a ton of fuel there's plenty of
suppliers that'll bring you bring you
gas you got a big tank on your yard

[02:00]
gas you got a big tank on your yard
because you run a big construction
company or something there are guys that
will supply that but there was no one
who's taking care of boats no one's
taking care of small businesses no one
taking care of personal vehicles and so
when my wife was having this problem I
was like I'm the guy to fix this
solution and make it better for everyone
yeah you're like of all people I'm the
one most qualified to fix this problem
yeah yeah I do it no one can now was
there ever a moment where you kind of
were thinking about this idea and you
saw a truck driving around doing mobile
fuel delivery and you're like oh this is
a thing yes so when I started thinking
about the idea you know of course you
dive into research and and you find find
companies doing it across the country
and and it seemed to be like it was a
growing Trend but it was just like just
becoming popular and I know people have
tried it in the past and never worked
out for one reason or another but it
seemed to be gaining in popularity I
mean certainly coming out of Co like you

[03:00]
mean certainly coming out of Co like you
know delivery services and convenience
and anything that could like keep you
safer and limiting interaction with you
know things that like a gas pump that
everyone in the public has to interact
with was becoming uh popular and so
we're kind of able to jump in on that
that Trend but you know Mobility
Services and and delivery has been a
growing trend for you know decades now
and so why not gas like why gas not a
part of that it's something that we need
you know every day so did you know of
anyone doing it in
Charleston no one was doing it the way
that I envisioned which is is kind of
what we're doing now
you I did I remember one time so I was
also in the South Carolina guard at the
time and I remember you making one of my
trips up to Columbia South Carolina to
do my my flying I passed this truck and
I won't I won't say the name of this

[04:00]
I won't I won't say the name of this
company but they're a small fuel
delivery company I was like boom
someone's thinking like I am but it
wasn't like oh they beat me to it I
can't do this idea now you know like
there's there's plenty there's plenty
for for us to all eat you know like I
can't service every customer and
Charleston neither can another company
so plenty plenty of room to growth and
plenty of room to competition how long
after you saw that truck were you in
business I don't really remember the
um because it wasn't there was some
there was some reasons why like from
from idea to na you know from nain
sketch to like actual launch was
probably like a two-year process but
that wasn't because I was like planning
the whole time you know I had a career
change and you know just put it on the
back burner because you know life you
know trying to drisk you know how I'm
gonna pay for the mortgage and also you
know start up this business so that that

[05:00]
know start up this business so that that
was really why I took the time and but
yeah we launched and we delivered our
first gallons December of 22 I always
say beginning of 23 was our like first
first month in business and so we're
coming up on two years now okay when you
first started did you quit your job did
you do this on the side what did that
look like no I did I do it on the side
and you know fortunately I I work remote
and and I'm able to manage both I have a
lot of support from you know my family
and to Able help but yeah literally the
whole first year was you me and my spare
time making deliveries and just kind of
fine-tuning the equipment the operation
our app you know the financials all of
that and so then after that first Year
my brother graduated from Clemson and I
convinced him to come on fulltime so now
I got a full-time guy doing that and so
it's allowing me to continue my my day

[06:01]
it's allowing me to continue my my day
job and then focus on growing the
business on the side without having to
be in the truck making those deliveries
okay so you you still have your job then
still have my job yep okay did you say
you have an app yeah yeah what did that
look like like how much did it cost to
develop that and what all does it do we
started through a we'll call it an
incubator that kind of helped me get
going and part of their part of their
offering was they would help me build
the MVP version of the app and so once I
got that delivered to me I remember it
was very limited from you know what I
had explained the scope to look like
this was not it like I couldn't even
actually take orders and process payment
in it but they're like no you just need
to get it out there and I no I can't
even take payment on this thing it
doesn't
work right but you know and messing
around in the back end I was able to I
don't know if the developer left an

[07:01]
don't know if the developer left an
Easter egg for me or you know it was
just there by accident but I reached out
to him and I was like hey what do you
want to come work on this with me like
just us and and he was all about it and
so he's still working with us today and
but the app allows us to you know take
orders make requests so schedule send
out push notifications so how it works
is the customer signs up they can insert
their fueled their vehicle types they
can make a request a driver will claim
that request they get notified that the
request has been received and then the
driver will you know notify them when
they're on the way and then when they're
complete and then they can see their
invoice you know how much they were
charged and and all that so okay so I
imagine your app is pretty simple like
they're you're querying a database of
makes and models years colors maybe like
plate number or whatnot or no
yep anything that can help us you know

[08:02]
yep anything that can help us you know
get make sure that we're delivering to
the right place you we don't we don't do
just Vehicles so you know think
generators or boats or you know
excavators or something so we have like
a special notes section where they can
just put all that info in there gate
codes for access to certain places and
then they can pay from the app and
schedule
it yep okay yep schedule and payments
all done through this okay so when you
first started what did it like buying
your first asset look like did you buy
truck did you buy tank how much did that
cost did you retrofit a truck how how
much all in did it cost and what did
that process look like well the first
thing I bought was the the app you know
I had that first and then I was able to
kind of show people the idea and like
let them play with this like functioning
version of it and so they they could
start to see the utility of it and I was
able to take that and do like my first
call family friends round and and we
were able to raise 100 Grand and that

[09:01]
were able to raise 100 Grand and that
allowed me to buy my first which is the
equipment that drops into the the truck
bed so that gave me two tanks you know
pump metering system hose all that
everything we needed to actually deliver
the fuel then I bought a truck I would
say all in you know it was a used truck
paid like 40 grand for it and the skid
cost me you know another 20 you know
that app that part of the process we
were probably 10 maybe 15 grand into it
so we were able to get going for less
than 100 Grand and start actually you
know making money how many gallons is
your skid our current configuration we
can hold 400 gallons per skid that come
in 119 gallon compartments separate
tanks four okay so 400 is that like 400
on a truck then like in a truck
bed yeah wow so that's like 2500 lb the
gas yeah 2600 yeah fully loaded okay all

[10:04]
gas yeah 2600 yeah fully loaded okay all
right so you develop the app first you
get people playing around on it trying
to break it it works you get the truck
you get this kid you're in business you
never quit your job how do you get your
first customers I guess back up a little
bit we had run some before I did any of
that we run some Facebook ads just to
see if there was any sort of appetite
this in our area and we put up a landing
page and was actually getting people
like clicking on the ad and then
submitting their information to try to
sign up for this business that didn't
exist yet and so love it actually I I
used that clickthrough rate that we were
able to establish over a few weeks of
testing I mean modeled out the next
three years of what I thought our
business yeah and how has that gone very
accurate or no it's way off but
yeah it it it gave me enough you know I
felt like it was viable and so I was

[11:02]
felt like it was viable and so I was
willing to make the investment and then
I did all the things we we talked about
but so getting getting my first
customers was yes start start running
Those ads again except for you know we
could actually deliver and then mostly
word of mouth I remember like our first
stranger customer oh my God like we
don't know who this person is yeah yeah
that was really exciting how much time
had elapsed between when you got the
leads from the Facebook ads you were
actually able to deliver on them so gas
is a it's a weird one and this is a like
I don't I not really unique but the
challenge that we definitely have to
deal with is like people hear about us
like oh that's a really great idea I
would love that oh but I don't need gas
right now so they don't sign up who
doesn't need gas right now like you
don't need it now you'll need it in two
days like what right and and so then
when they do need it they're like oh I
need it now like I don't have time to

[12:00]
need it now like I don't have time to
like figure out this app and make a
request and wait several hours you and
so that was you a unique challenge took
some education to like let trying to get
get people to change their habits of
like don't wait till you're on E like
get in there make the request and then
you know your gas station experience is
literally you get home and press a
couple buttons and it's done all right
if you are watching this clip right now
you are watching this on YouTube and if
you are a fan of podcast please check
out my podcast while you're at it
because sometimes I have podcasts that
aren't on YouTube and sometimes I have
YouTube that aren't on podcast so check
out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there so how much time was that then
because I'm thinking like if I opt into
some service like this from a Facebook
ad and any more than like a week passes
like it's out of sight out of mind it's
going to be really hard to convert me at
at that point initial sign up to

[13:02]
at that point initial sign up to
delivery was within days I mean even
when you were just running the test to
the landing page yeah our we we didn't
have any sort of like funnel to like
nurture these ads it was like sign up
sign up and then you can make a request
right from there and so it was pretty
instant and I remember like initial
launch you know we we were able to get
like our first dozen or so customers and
then it was like okay now what you know
how do we how do we keep growing and it
was it was just me spare time so like
you know how do we manage the
expectation of the customer you know
when I still had to work a job and so we
were really careful about not growing
too quickly but also you know keeping
every customer happy because what we're
really building is you know reoccurring
repeatable Revenue like gas is a
commodity and it's low margin business
so so you've really got to start

[14:00]
so so you've really got to start
stacking those customers and building
that revenue and so that's the most
important thing was like getting our
customers on board getting their trust
getting them in the habit of making the
requests and then all of a sudden their
all their fuel spend is now with us and
now we can start getting new customers
you know each we found in our first year
like an average vehicle is like $2,500 a
year so if you're a family to Vehicles
they daily drivers it's like five five
grand a year so if our margin you you
know is you 15 20% on a subscriber like
that you know you could do the math on
how many customers you need and also
made us realize like you know the the
residential side was was how we started
but that wasn't that wasn't going to be
viable long term like we had to start
finding some higher higher margin
options and some bigger ticket items you

[15:00]
options and some bigger ticket items you
know and that's when we started getting
into The Fleets and then ultimately into
boats okay all right so let's talk about
your your pricing and your margins and
all that because 24 bucks a month two
vehicles five bucks a month to add
additional Vehicles fuel price based off
of lowest price within three miles how
do do you mark the gas up do you buy it
wholesale what are your margins like on
both the monthly flat fee and the gas
well I don't know how much I want to get
into the specifics of the gas prices I
mean we certainly sell the gas for more
than what we get it for I know that even
a gas station doesn't make much money on
gas right and and they buy at pretty big
volumes so what does just what does that
look like for you the average margin on
just regular gas is is like 15 to 20
cents we try to get that up to 30 cents
so 30 cents per gallon is the
go it's tough to do on um regular gas
because like I said it's it's the

[16:00]
because like I said it's it's the
replacement opportunities are so easy
there there gas stations all over the
place and the only differentiator
between you know the gas station next
door and the gas station a little bit
further down is the price you know and
so you're constantly um competing with
that price and so my idea was you know
keeping keeping the overhead extremely
low and and being able to you know make
a little bit more margin because of that
okay so one family will spend about
$5,000 with you over a year that's what
you said okay MH how many refills do you
do per month for an average family
typical is like once a week maybe once
every 10 days so three to four three to
four refills them up I will say some
customers you know we didn't put enough
guard rails up so like they take
advantage some customaries would yeah
there one vehicle will fill up at work
one vehicle will fill at at home

[17:00]
one vehicle will fill at at home
so we'll get we'll get requests for the
same subscriber at two different
locations on the same day and I'm just
like come on yeah so it since it says
the fuel price is based on the closest
gas station basically are you you're not
filling up at a gas station are you and
reselling it or are you using like your
your employer to fill up we're buying
wholesale okay okay so you're just using
that price to base what you charge them
because that's kind of like the market
price for their neighborhood or whatever
that's right and okay and we're kind of
getting away from that we haven't fully
like relaunched our our pricing updates
but you know in order to match the
lowest in your area like you're using
software like gas buddy or you know way
or somewhere that publishes gas and
they're reliant on you know third party
inputs that are either out of date fat
fingered and then are you talking about
cash price or credit price it's it's too
unreliable and so
we're just gonna start doing a fixed

[18:02]
we're just gonna start doing a fixed
price yeah smart you're you're I know
there's like one or two Nationwide
Brands is is that how they do it because
I've learned in companies I've started
where I see like a big player doing
doing it one way and it's like oh what
are they doing oh they're so dumb like
no one likes that I'm gonna do it this
way like I'm gonna I'm gonna be so
Innovative I'm gonna reinvent this
market and then I I get six months down
the road I'm like this is terrible
that's why they do it that way I should
have just copied them exactly I've
learned that so many times have you had
learnings like that yeah it's it's you
know I feel like the pricing on fuel is
is kind of it's always like the secret
sauce like you can't figure out why
someone is pricing it this way like is
it a loss leader for a gas station so
that you come in and get a chicken
sandwich instead you know and and so I
see other fuel delivery companies they
don't
necessarily advertise their per gallon
price in every Market is is you know

[19:02]
price in every Market is is you know
very different you know Charleston
doesn't have a pipeline that comes to
Charleston so everything comes in by
ship so if you go further west and
you're receiving barrels off the pipe
it's your pricing is going to be
different depending on the season we've
really just run with that what you just
read as our pricing and still our
current pricing and it hasn't changed
for the first two years because the
price of gas is almost dominous at this
point like we are really building trust
and a brand and getting that customer
base
up so what you mentioned boats is that
kind of where this is heading or are you
trying to lean more into the fleet
delivery
stuff we're we're trying to do it all
you know those are like our three
business lines right now it's you know
I've got a team of four and we're
handling all three of those
simultaneously at at some point it will
be you know Marine uh Fleet and then

[20:02]
be you know Marine uh Fleet and then
residential will have to be separate the
the Marine side is certainly like where
I feel like that's our bread and butter
like no one no one is offering the
service that we're offering being able
to bring out the the volume that we can
and deliver it out to a dock without
your boat having to leave that do
there's there there's no one in town
that can do that yeah okay what's next
for the business how do you see this
scaling more trucks in Charleston
different cities with more trucks more
boats more fleets yeah so we definitely
want to dominate locally but we we also
plan on expanding you I never never
meant juice to be just a local brand you
know we intend to grow this as big and
as kind of starting that as wide as we
can um now what does that look like
exactly you know we're still still

[21:00]
exactly you know we're still still
trying to figure that out we've we've
gone viral several times on our social
media we're very transparent about you
know how we started this business what
we do dayt day we just share what we're
doing and people love it people want to
we have people copying us we have people
who want to do juice in their city and
so you know franchising is probably the
route that we'll go at some point
because like I mentioned earlier fuel
was like very like hyper local the
competitiveness of the price of fuel and
so you've got to like be in the
community and know the community and
know who could benefit from your
services and and be able to build the
trust that you know hey when you're
bringing the fuel you're doing what
you're saying you're doing you know when
they go out to start their vehicle it's
going to start the next day because you
delivered the right fuel um and so the
only way you can do that I think is by
having someone um from the area who is

[22:01]
having someone um from the area who is
you willing to put in that work in a
local market I see it as a like perfect
play for an owner operator yeah you know
think of like a truck driver who he he
might be able to make you know 80 to 100
Grand over the road but he's gone all
the time driving here he
can still be a truck driver but also own
his own business potentially a lot more
upside so I feel like you know that is
like the perfect it's a perfect job for
like you know an owner operator to be
able to scale his own business locally
and I I think that's where we'll go but
certainly regionally um we're going to
expand within our our footprint as far
as we can reach before I feel don't feel
comfortable managing it all under you
know original juice fuel umbrella and
then the natural progression is
vertically integrated into the wholesale
supply side which you that that was my
background that makes the most sense
once we're moving enough volume to

[23:01]
once we're moving enough volume to
justify you know being the wholesaler
ourselves now we can supply all of our
own retail uh locations what is your
churn like if you get a residential
customer are they is it one of those
deals where like they just fall in love
with it like I don't know how I ever
lived without this and they almost
exclusively fill up with you or is it
kind of like people try it they use you
sometimes what's more normal the more
normal is
we have almost no churn people sign up
they try it they love it even the ones
that don't use it very frequently like I
mean you read our pricing we're not it's
very reasonable yeah yeah and so it's
almost worth it for someone to use to
have it as an emergency service you know
if it's raining one day and I don't want
to get gas you yeah or you know someone
to just have that piece of mind that you
know fill up my daughter's car instead
of you know having to give her a credit

[24:00]
of you know having to give her a credit
card you know to go to to and from
school or whatever yeah so we we do have
some of those customers that don't use
it very frequently but rarely do we have
someone sign up and just say you know
this is too much of of a hassle for me
to make a request you know the Tom slots
are never available that I need that
that really hasn't been the case okay
see this is interesting because I I
would use this but I I wouldn't in a
sense because I drive a Tesla
and I aside from that I love gas
stations like I walk into a gas station
every time like a kid in the candy store
it's like I'm going to get a Red Bull
I'm going to get some chips like I eat
like garbage when I walk into a gas
station so I would miss that are you
planning to offer like charging services
at some point or how have you thought
about that we certainly mentioned that
like we're in the um diligence phase of
you raising Capital right now for our
expansion and so that very question has
been asked and we're building a
logistics Network so it's easy enough to
put a a generator on the back of a truck

[25:01]
put a a generator on the back of a truck
and offer that service that's just not
where our focus is just like you know I
think a uh Marketplace for mobile
services will eventually where we're
heading to you know if you're in our app
every week every two weeks making a fuel
request and every time you sign in it
says what what service are you looking
for fuel Tire oil you know and you're
hitting fuel 95% of the time but that
time you need oil chains why are you not
going to go back to that that app and
and select oil chain so I think that is
another way that you know we're we're
looking at going but right now gas is is
where we're focused and and we want to
be laser focused on that and do the best
we can there yeah okay man well this is
an awesome story I appreciate you
sharing it anything else that you would
advise people to do like what if someone
in Sacramento wants to start this what
what would you tell them to do that you
wish you have done differently when you
started I would start delivering the

[26:01]
started I would start delivering the
boats immediately interesting if I could
do it over again that's what I would do
just because at least in in our Market
it's a huge demand that's that's that's
unmet and so the the cell is a lot
easier you know to convert someone when
getting gas in your boat on the water is
a really expensive and B really
inconvenient and you're in Charleston so
I mean right perfect market for that
that's where I would have started but I
always say to I mean honestly this is
for any anyone interested in starting a
business is like you just you just got
to do it you just gotta dive in and and
go out and you'll figure it out along
the way working all out on day one or
before you start you just gota dive in
you just got to
start yep okay well Corey thank you
