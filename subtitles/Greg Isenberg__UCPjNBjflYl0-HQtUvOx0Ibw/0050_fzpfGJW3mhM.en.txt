[00:00]
and look every almost everyone
anyone who understands the scale of the
universe and thinks about how
probability works
almost all comes to the same conclusion
of course we're not alone right it's
like if you picked up one great note we
have one example which is what happened
on earth if you picked up one grain of
sand from a beach and you looked in the
microscope and you saw it was crawling
with little critters
you wouldn't conclude well maybe this is
the only one that has that you'd say of
course i'm sure they're on all kinds of
you know i didn't just pick up the one
that has it right
[Music]
dude great to uh great to meet you and
thank you so much for taking the time
yeah i'm happy to uh
meet at one of my twitter friends i know
exactly well it feels like everyone at
this point is a twitter friend that i'm
now meeting in real life like over the
last two three years some of my best
friends in the world now are just like
people that were anonymously
on twitter it's like a genuinely good
way to um
to meet people like they're like like
twitter sucks in 100 ways but like the

[01:02]
twitter sucks in 100 ways but like the
it's like really like fantastically
great for like three or four really
important things um
yeah i found that it like yeah to your
point it's it's both ends of the
spectrum right it's i guess it's like
anything else in life there's like the
one percent you tweeted it actually just
recently about like advice filters um
and trust filters and i feel that same
way it's like you need to know and
figure out how to find the one percent
that is super interesting that you're
really going to engage with and learn a
lot from um amidst all of the noise that
is out there
yeah you i think like it
depending on who you follow it can be
um a great way to learn a great way to
like get a quick feel for you know to
keep your finger on the pulse of what's
going on it's a great way to do that in
a way that like if you were just
checking
random news sites versus
you know
because twitter doesn't just teach
doesn't just show you what the news is
it shows you what the perception of the
news is and it shows you what the
arguments about the news and the
different

[02:00]
different
you know viewpoints and the different
you can and if you follow
the right
you know
array of people it actually gives you a
feel for what's going on in every bubble
you know
yeah i had a really interesting
conversation on this exact topic with a
new york times journalist who i won't
name but who's very famous well-known
literally earlier this week and he was
saying that they just had a memo go
around internally at the new york times
that basically encouraged them to stop
using twitter so much and to stop
reading so much because they have an
internal perception that it is like five
percent of what's actually happening but
commanding 95 of their mind share of
what is happening and so they're worried
that it's like skewing their
journalistic integrity or their the
journalism so i'm curious just like
generally how other people think about
that i haven't floated it with anyone
else since having that conversation
today i am so excited to talk about

room again that's f-u-n-d-r-i-s-e
dot com slash room to get started today
my instinct is that that's
it's hard because on one hand like
what's going on on twitter is
part of what's going on in reality like
and it has a big effect on things so
you know you don't want to totally have
your head in the sand and just pretend
it doesn't exist but i do think that
we you know we're like we're really um
social beings like i uh this is a random
story here uh i
i always used to like love traveling
alone right it was one of my favorite
things
and

[06:00]
and
you know the first time i you know i
went i was kind of like oh i'm go to
like a restaurant alone i'm in a foreign
country this is still like embarrassing
i'm like
i started to like reframe and i was like
this is not
hey none of these people
know who i am and they'll never see them
again
um
but b it's like why would i be
embarrassed anyway it's like who cares
if anyone thinks and and i got into this
mode where i suddenly was just like so
comfortable being alone traveling
whatever but then i found myself on like
a little tour
uh it was like in the amazon uh and it
was this is one of my solo trips and it
was a little tour and they were like
and i often made friends you know i was
very social when i went so i often did
meet people and i like you know i liked
making friends from other countries and
i went to them this tour and there was
this uh there was like six of us and i
guess like
the other the four of them like two
couples or whatever had like gotten to
know each other
um and then the fifth one was like
another european and they kind of
befriended that person and i was like an
american i don't know why they didn't
like americans or they didn't they
didn't like me but i felt very like out
grouped in in a way it was like it was
like a two-day thing

[07:00]
like a two-day thing
and i found myself like caring so much
about being
outgrouped by five randos who i
literally was never gonna see again and
like
it was just it was just a reminder that
like there's a mechanism in our brain
that can be flipped on and make us
insane like to for me to care about
being outgrouped by this group of
complete strangers was like it was
because i appreciate it even at the time
i was like this is super irrational but
i was really kind of upset about it
three days after it was over i was like
why did i care but anyway so back to
twitter i think that what twitter does
is
it has a lot of dynamics on it a lot of
kind of in-group out group bullying like
you know um uh you know slandering and
and it has like you know uh
you know people have their crew they
have you know that agree with them and
people like me you know we we tweet we
retweet this stuff whatever it is and i
think it like
switches on kind of a kind of a crazy
part of our brains and i could see
journalists kind of getting wrapped up
in it and suddenly kind of
feeling that like middle school kind of
social pressure and and i don't think

[08:01]
social pressure and and i don't think
that's that's probably i don't think
that's good for many people and i think
journalists especially so it was a
roundabout way of kind of explaining why
i think it might be bad well i love that
story because i've often talked about
how i think
a lot of society's problems or your
individual problems would be solved if
you went out on a date by yourself once
a month and just like sat at a bar by
yourself with your own thoughts i think
we've lost as a society our ability to
be uh in solitude and experience
solitude because we're constantly you
know we're on our phones i've got my
phone you're getting pinged there's just
stimuli all around you and so we've lost
the ability to just be alone and i think
that when you do that when you re-engage
that sense a lot of positives come from
it to your point
it's interesting some of the like biases
and psychological impacts of it like the
spotlight effect which you kind of
referred to um we constantly think that
other people are looking at us the
reality is everyone's just thinking
about themselves everyone's selfish and
just thinking about themselves no one
cares how you look sitting alone at the
bar nobody's thinking about you um but
it's such a funny and even if someone is

[09:01]
it's such a funny and even if someone is
like
it you have to if you just
like it
the the thought that it matters is a
very crazy part of your brain that cares
that it's like oh you know like
you know when i'm in a good zone that
kind of is comfortable and in a mature
zone i can i can be pretty sure that
other people i know even like people i
know well are talking [ __ ] about me
and i don't and it rolls off my back and
i say you know i talk [ __ ] about people
like it happens it's okay of course
that's when i'm in a really good zone
you know and when you're in a bad zone
like you just like you care so much
about social things yeah it's a uh it's
such a funny like the ability to pull
yourself away from your your own
internal uh feelings like that is very
rare i feel like i
personally i i won't comment on my own
uh experience with this but i've heard
that when people are under the influence
of psychedelic uh drugs or medicines
that you have some people have the
ability to step away from what they're
feeling and so you're like wow there's
all this crazy stuff going on but then

[10:00]
all this crazy stuff going on but then
you can pull back from it and experience
it as like what is happening in my brain
this is an interesting experience and
process which is part of why scientists
think there's a huge um you know
potential use of for treatments of
depression and other psychological
disorders as well you can like unpack
and deconstruct your own um your own
perspectives and emotions
well yeah it's like i feel like uh if
usually you're kind of
um the way i kind of like it's if you're
in
um
a sphere of like
you know experiences and feelings and um
thoughts
yeah it's like psychedelics allows you
to kind of like step outside and look at
the sphere and like maybe look at it
from other angles and like walk around
it look under it and like and that is um
uh incredible like it's an incredible um
uh tool
it relates to
um exactly how i wanted to it's funny we
had a roundabout way of leading to the
exact thing that i wanted to frame up

[11:01]
exact thing that i wanted to frame up
this discussion with and i always think
about like what is the right way to
um sort of frame up like as a framework
or mental model the kind of line of of
discussion and and chat and you know i
thought i would kind of go meta here in
uh using one of your own pieces one of
my favorite pieces from wait but y um
which was your neural ink piece
and you had a line in there that i just
thought was
fantastic and i think it's a great way
of framing up the discussion and what
you said was i learned that you can only
fully wrap your head around certain
companies
abstract companies to really anything by
zooming both way way in and way way out
in on the technical challenges facing
the engineers out on the existential
challenges facing our species in on a
snapshot of the world right now out on
the big story of how we got to this
moment and what our far future could
look like so
maybe just to kick off what did you mean
by that when you when you wrote that um
and i want to just kind of use that
thread of zooming way in and zooming way

[12:00]
thread of zooming way in and zooming way
out to examine a few different a few
different topics today
yeah i think um i just in general are
talking about zooming i to me it's like
a very uh it's a it's an axis kind of
you know that we can be on it's a
spectrum of
um
how can i think backed up or you know
sometimes i think about it as you're
backing up but i think maybe sometimes
even
a better
metaphor is
like
uh you're so
um
when you're zoomed in it's like you're
on a beach
and you can like look down you know you
really know
you're on a beach and you're looking
around you see so like the coast goes
around you know wraps around over there
and over there and you see some you know
water goes out and you just you don't
see anything else um
and so
first of all you can zoom in which is
you could take a microscope and start
examining
the
grains of sand and um you know just
really getting down there and and
understanding how did this happen how
did each grain of sand get you know get
like this and um you know how

[13:02]
like this and um you know how
how do these trees grow and you know
what are these little tiny organisms
doing
but
to me you know what what's so that
that's one that's one thing that i think
can help you really understand a beach
better but
um
often we're you know we're looking at
something and we don't know is this are
we on an island
is this part of a continent
is this is this a little strip stretch
of a ton of beach or is this the only
little area of beach
uh is that am i looking at a lake a big
lake or is this the ocean
um
and so what what we can do is like
if you i think about like a news story
if a news story that day is just like
looking at a strip of beach
sometimes you don't know like is that
news is this new story actually
important like how like in 10 years will
russia ukraine be like one of the
biggest things of the decade or will it
be like this kind of like oh yeah
remember that russia ukraine thing that
was on for like four months like it's
hard to know right like
um there's all these you know stories
that it's so i think of it as a
helicopter you go up and now you can see

[14:01]
helicopter you go up and now you can see
more you can start to like so if you if
you look back at them last month
um and i know i'm like yeah bringing
news stories and now it's a little bit
convoluted but basically if you look at
the last month of
news stories you can start to see like
oh okay this matters that's like when
you can like zoom up and you can see the
whole
um kind of region here but you still
can't really see is this how big is this
place is it continent is a huge island i
don't know you go up farther and farther
until you're actually now you can see
actually okay now you can you can see
the whole continent and the outline of
it and where you were on it and you go
up even further you can see the whole
earth and you can kind of fully see to
me it's like
um if you you know if you zoomed out uh
on a lot of things you can see the huge
huge story and and so often i think
we're like caught in the middle
um
we're caught in the middle like time
wise as i said with like news stories
like it's hard to it's it's hard for us
to see the big big picture here what's
the real
overarching story that's going on in
2022 right now and and and you know we

[15:03]
2022 right now and and and you know we
time gives us that that helicopter
hindsight
um
uh but also it's not just time it's also
just you know in an industry if there's
a company well what's the big story of
this company what's really going on in
this industry what are the major forces
in play
so i think um um
we need to do a lot more zooming out uh
the best we can obviously again
hindsight helps and um
certain statistics can help to get a
feel for uh i i think that uh whenever i
want to understand something that's my
instinct he's like what's the big big
story going on like what's all of this a
part of again is this is this part of an
island is this part of a giant continent
is this it's you know how relevant is
each thing but then also zooming in um i
find that so often like
we just again we're caught in the middle
where we like read the news story
um or we um we we understand you know we
try to study how a company works
or you know the basic deal with the
company uh but it's when you you know

[16:03]
company uh but it's when you you know
if you go in and you actually talk to
the engineers and start to understand
the problems they're facing you watch
what they're doing on a wednesday at 2
p.m and you sit in on some of the
meetings
it's amazing how much clearer everything
gets suddenly when you look back to what
you thought like a week ago before all
this and you're like wow i i really had
this like depiction that was just wrong
it was not accurate
um
it's so interesting because
my perception is that we often spend
i think most humans spend the vast
majority of their time in the middle not
zoomed in not zoomed down it's because
it's most comfortable right that's like
the the point of peak abstraction where
uh to use your thought experiment um the
pencil just looks like a pencil and you
don't worry about it and you're like
yeah write with it you know this is my
thing it's my pencil and zooming in is
really uncomfortable because you go in
and you realize all of the different
components and like your thought
experiment of no one in the world knows
how to build a pencil because it has
lead and or what you know all of the

[17:00]
lead and or what you know all of the
different components of it not there's
not a single human who can build that
pencil and know how to put it the entire
thing together but then when you zoom
out it's also really uncomfortable you
zoom out and you're like what is the
meaning of all of this and what how does
the pencil how has that changed society
over the last thousand years you know in
all of the writing and so most people
because it's the most comfortable end up
just sitting in the middle and you kind
of play that like peak abstraction
throughout your entire life
the middle is important too it's just
that it's only one of the areas and yeah
it's actually probably the best place to
live but to understand you kind of need
to go to both extremes yeah and it's
probably the point where it's like you
go to both extremes and then you can
coast in the middle and be happy and
like feel fulfilled in there
and i do think uh the secret of if you
if it's some of the most
you know people who seem super prescient
like they can just
you know read the future amazing at
investing in stocks or they're
incredible entrepreneurs they just can
see opportunities or whatever it is um

[18:01]
see opportunities or whatever it is um
i think even you know stand-up comedians
you know which is a good standard
comedian is they really see
the the the bigger
social forces going on and they can
point them out in a way that everyone
says oh my god that's so true you know
i think that one thing that people have
in common is that they often are really
good at the zoom in and zoom out like
elon musk classic example like
no one's a better zoom outer i mean he
he he just seems to like
see the overarching
farthest back stories of like
uh you know humanity is you know the um
uh like trying to keep the light of
human consciousness
uh uh uh and and he sees
um you know the the the major
existential threats uh he just thinks
that's where his head is he's always
thinking about that but then also you
know he knows exactly the four elements
that make up the paint on the rocket you
know and and you know and he can tell
you how much the rocket weighs
uh more if you use this paint versus
that paint and you know every single

[19:00]
that paint and you know every single
component of the tesla you know he can
tell you about so
but when you have that level of both out
and in kind of clarity
it just
um
you're just like seeing without any fog
you know we have so much so if you think
about it as you know we see it in the
middle kind of even there you know the
middle often we can get deceived if you
don't see the top and bottom you know we
can often be deceived by news stories
you know or by by you know headlines and
you know kind of dogmatic story lines
like you know political narratives can
kind of fool us
but when you when you really see the big
big picture and then you also kind of
understand what's going on i feel like
it's at the small level i think it's
just you're much harder to trick and you
can you can work magic uh in investing
and entrepreneurship and the arts and
other things like that
so i i want to spend like a couple of
minutes doing a zoom in zoom out on you
um i feel like everybody uh knows you as
you know the most popular blogger in the
world whether or not uh that's like an
official title you might not be in the

[20:01]
official title you might not be in the
guinness book of world records for that
i don't know if people still make those
or if they're uh they commanded like a
massive outsized share of my childhood i
kind of took a view it was like it was
like one of the
it was like the peak you know that was
the pinnacle of human achievement was
being in the guinness book of world
records in my mind it was like one of
the main it was like one of the three or
four main things
it was like right it was like
it really i tweeted out something uh
maybe like i don't know a few weeks ago
like what was one thing that you thought
was really important when you were a kid
that actually turned out to be totally
useless and like the most common
responses were guinness book of world
records um and then the other ones which
i thought which i find hilarious are
like quicksand uh piranhas like the
bermuda triangle i really wondered why
no one was looking into the bermuda
triangle i was like man planes are
falling out of the sky in this thing and
no one's nightmare to it nightmarish
yeah i mean quicksand is a very good one
like i think part part of it has to do
with the princess bride um

[21:00]
with the princess bride um
but i think it's just in general it was
it was in cartoons and it was like it
was like very kind of a scary
part of life yeah it was quick i mean i
thought i was like really going to
encounter that stuff as an adult i
really thought that was going to be a
part of my life so
back to the broader point on you um
like you know you were born now you're
here
you know kind of what what happened in
between how did you um you know form
your maps of reality like what were the
what were the kind of um key parts of
your life that you feel like have
impacted where you are today
um
yeah i uh
i think i've always just kind of been an
analytical person like i just it's just
my instinct
to
um
when something is going on or i feel a
certain way or something happens to just
like
try to categorize it you know and
um
and and like
make sense of it in a way and and and

[22:00]
make sense of it in a way and and and
and so i also then like people who do
that i end up connecting well with them
and when i find someone who also happens
to do that we become really good friends
um because we just
do a lot of
that um and so were there downsides to
that were there ever downsides from a
relationship standpoint or growing up
where you kind of felt different as a
result of that analytical nature
um
i mean there's downsides in that it just
can like
you're thinking you're just thinking all
the time right it's hard you can take
you out of being present
um i think it can cause you anxiety
i think you can overanalyze stuff
i think if
something unfortunate happens like
instead of just being like yeah that was
a bummer you might like really
you you might like internalize exactly
how big a mistake it was in a way that
like
you know been better to kind of just not
be thinking so hard about it um i always
thought you were a pitcher right yeah

[23:02]
thought you were a pitcher right yeah
yes
baseball fidget toy that i carry around
yeah
like i i would have uh been an awful uh
match for that because
i would have been like
you know um
you know i don't know because you know
i'm just saying i'm like a relief
pitcher and i come in and and i and i
you know i have two outs and there's
like a man on second and i just like in
my head i would start thinking
whether this third guy gets out or gets
a hit is the difference between my
entire like like week being like a good
having been like a good
you know weekend like and like
you know and then of course it's like
the playoffs i would i would have a
moment when i'm like i would just not be
able to get it out of my head that like
this
what i do now will like affect the rest
of my life you can extrapolate by the
way like i bet there is a very clear
correlation if you looked at pictures
the one common thread that i always
found among great pitchers and i think
it applies to all athletes i actually
think it applies to entrepreneurs is
this like almost irrational arrogance uh

[24:02]
this like almost irrational arrogance uh
around your own abilities and like with
pitchers you had to be so uh irrational
that you could go out and give up a
grand you know the worst outing of your
life and come out of the game and be
like those guys suck man that was you
know lucky whatever like i'm way better
than that's [ __ ] uh you had to have
that like completely irrational it made
no sense if you actually evaluated every
single outing you would have gone nuts
and to your point you'd never be able to
do it at scale
yeah yeah you have to have some kind of
um
kind of like emotional shield
that's just like when when bad things
happen just like bounces off so you stay
strong you know and um
and so i think i think you know
analytical people like analytical i'm
not even sure is the word just i don't
know whatever it is but like
it's a little bit of a zoom out thing
like i guess if i were pitching i'd be
zooming out and being like i see the
whole career and be like oh [ __ ] like
this might be my one time in the
playoffs like if or you know like if i
like uh

[25:00]
like uh
you know whatever it is like i would the
zoom out is not helpful in that moment
you know it's like you want to totally
it's kind of like a weird partially uh
permeable shield too like to your point
on the shield i think that's a great
reference but you sort of need something
to break through so that you can
actually adapt and get better too you
want like most of it to deflect off and
shoot off back into space and the like
little inkling of insight that might
make you better the next time out to
actually permeate and kind of hit you i
think that goes for a lot more than
sports too like
i think if you think about um your
beliefs your ideas and who you are as a
person your personality like the way you
are
i think it's good to be a little bit on
the arrogant side a little bit like
enough where you're like proud of who
you are
you're
confident in what you know and and
uh your values and your beliefs and you
go with them you're not always you know
rethinking them or questioning them or
self-doubt you know you're you're maybe
even have a little less than rational
self-doubt like you know you're you're

[26:00]
self-doubt like you know you're you're
kind of just like this is who i am i'm
proud of it and that is what i believe
and i think that that's a good thing
to a point
um and i think that it's like that's a
and it's like you said you have to you
have to mix that with being able to
sometimes say something's not working
for me here or maybe i can grow up a
little bit in this way or maybe i'm
wrong about this like and if you can't
do that now it's like a rubber shield
that's so thick because maybe you're so
maybe you're so scared of what it would
feel like to not have that because
usually once it gets when arrogance gets
to a certain point i think it's not a
result of confidence it's a result of
some kind of fear when it gets to
and now it's a rubbish shield
all new information bounces off of all
negative feedback bounces off of and you
know you know you know you can tell when
someone's like this when they get
negative feedback they get really angry
and they end up even more sure of
themselves and they hate that person i
mean that's someone who has a i think an
arrogance a problem with feedback um
but i i think that
um being totally rational about like
maybe i well maybe i should question
this because that's i don't i think i
think it's that's actually can can be a

[27:00]
think it's that's actually can can be a
paralyzing place and you can quickly
drift when you think of this as like a
spectrum of arrogance all the way down
to like insecurity you can drift below
that totally rational line to a place
where now you're you're doubting
yourself even when it doesn't make sense
to you right and so um but like for
example like this is the kind of thing
i've always done for we're having this
conversation and now in my head i've
formed a an axis a spectrum that goes
from arrogant with a dotted line in the
middle totally rational down to totally
insecure and then i think the right
thing is like a quarter of the or third
of the way from the dotted line to the
but that's just like that's just how i
think i've always done that right um or
like i remember in college i met these
a couple of my best friends
you know we really connected over our
just like we were really really
interested in the topic of like
how to find love like how to find the
right person to marry or whatever um
what what makes a good relationship
first is a bad what should deal breakers
be
so so much so many of the things i write
like i've written now a couple posts
about that kind of thing and so many of
those emerge from these conversations um
that i've had

[28:00]
that i've had
and like i remember we were like
you know i kind of come up with a theory
um
you know just talking i was like okay i
think what matters is um
you know three there's three things that
you have to be good and then everything
else can be bad and it's fine like the
three things have to be you have to have
like a general
attraction you can't just see them as
like your buddy you have to you have to
have like a crush
or you know you know physical
attraction of some kind of physical
attraction is you know especially at the
beginning but like if it starts off with
a lot of that i think that carries you
it's always feels a little more special
than just a friend so there has to be
something there
um
there has to be
like a best friendship type thing where
like you don't want to feel like when
you're out to dinner with your person
and then also your friends and you're
having so much fun with your friends and
you then they leave and you're heading
home with your person you're like
damn it's just just us again like you
don't want to feel that way you want to
feel excited oh it's just us now we can
like really get into it you know um
like you you don't want to feel like
bummed out that like your friends aren't
there all the time because you're just

[29:00]
there all the time because you're just
kind of bored with your person and i i
actually used something called the
traffic test there which is
if you know there's certain friends of
mine uh friends family members who when
i'm i like talking to them so much i
have so much fun just being with them
and just talking to them that when we're
like in a car somewhere and i'm driving
them home right or vice versa i'm
actually like it's pumped up when we hit
traffic i'm like yes traffic
yes we have more time as opposed to like
you know normally traffic sucks i think
that your person should pass the traffic
test you know you should it should be
one of those people uh where it's just
super fun okay and then the third area
so there's like attraction like best
friendship the third area is just like a
deep trust that you just like you just
know that they're you feel a very good
person you feel like they're just like
they're they're they're like you know
deep down they're that you totally trust
them they're not gonna like hurt you
badly you're not like kind of always
like scared that you're gonna get you
know or you know you can just kind of be
yourself and know that it's okay um
so it sounds like that's a lot but
actually there's a lot of other things

[30:00]
actually there's a lot of other things
you know there's stuff you like to do in
common there's like mutual friends
there's like same philosophies on values
on these other things you know religion
you know there's a lot of other things
that i think are there that i think that
you know if the uh if those big three
things are there that's right so anyway
that's the kind of thing that i've done
in real life it reminds me of like john
nash uh you know uh hypothesizing around
the nash equilibrium and like game
theory around the women at the bar yeah
it's in beautiful mind it's like that
scene you know from the scene it's a
very vulnerable scene it reminds me of
that uh you know it's like uh breaking
down this situation in a mathematical
way and in such an analytical way it's
very um it's very interesting how did um
how did wait but y actually come about
were you writing before it like i don't
know the origin story of how it actually
came to be and like the stick figures
and all of your amazing drawings and
like how did you actually launch into
that endeavor
yeah i um i was writing um i basically i
i
uh i always wanted to do something

[31:00]
uh i always wanted to do something
creative professionally um and the thing
i was trying to do was music but it's
like the worst match for a
procrastinator because
you know
you can't just you know you you know and
perfectionist you know you always i
would be paralyzed by wanting to write
like the best movie score for this thing
possible and then you just like end up
behind deadline and like or i just don't
go out in the first place and do the
networking i need to it was a lot of
like things where i i was not i did not
have the work habits to like
that i needed to be like really getting
that career rolling and so i was
procrastinating on that by doing a
couple other things starting a test prep
company which is just like my side job
and then i ended up hiring friends who
were all out there and they also needed
job and tutoring
and then i started blogging just for fun
which i didn't take seriously it was
like
just a fun procrastination activity on i
made like a blogger um
and you know just super simple and um
and i found it was part of it was it was
this it was this
i didn't know i tricked myself where i

[32:00]
i didn't know i tricked myself where i
was doing
a creative pursuit that i
wasn't being perfectionist about because
i didn't pride myself on being good at
it and i didn't wasn't trying to do
anything big with it
and so that's often how you end up in a
really kind of loose
carefree creative zone having fun
and so i ended up writing what i think
was a pretty good blog it was it was it
not i didn't put anywhere near the time
that i put in now
it was just kind of stuff about my day
or my theories on this or a bunch you
know 20 things i don't understand you
know um and i would just you know
i just had fun with it right and um
and
uh and then so meanwhile
on the test prep side of things i uh my
uh my best friend since we were five
moved to
la which is where i was and we partnered
up and we were doing that together and
uh you know now now i'm like 30 and i'm
basically telling him i'm going crazy
doing these like creative pursuits on
the side i was writing a musical on the
side i was doing blogging on the side
while doing this test prep company i

[33:00]
while doing this test prep company i
didn't feel like i was giving my all to
the business and i wasn't giving my all
to anything and it was this kind of
classic me situation to end up in like
super miserable um not really you know
and and i was like i need to go full
time with one of these creative pursuits
and we decided to do something that you
know
uh could be also maybe like something
that could be um a a a business venture
possibly um
you know it's like because it was a way
to like keep working together because i
liked working with him but he would
manage the um
the kind of the business we were doing
and i would go and start a new thing
that was the kind of idea it was like a
way to have my cake and eat it too
without having to like fully quit
everything but also get to do something
i really wanted but something that maybe
was a fun thing for him to be part of if
it grew as opposed to like a musical
which is just like it's such a long time
process it's like so hard to get that to
actually make money and so anyway
because it was deciding between those i
was like i do a lot of blogging and i'd
do this this musical so i decided to go
with blogging that's kind of this long
story
but the like the bigger picture was like
i finally at 31 did what i should have

[34:01]
i finally at 31 did what i should have
done a long time ago which is just go
full in with one of my creative pursuits
it's so interesting um because there's a
generalized
version of this story which i've
experienced as well which is just this
idea that you almost like most people
that go and build something really
unique or um something impressive
successful etc they had the like
janky version of it that happened before
and then that led to and sort of allowed
and enabled the really beautiful
polished version of it and like i i used
to write this um like once a month
newsletter that i would send out to
probably at like a max distribution of
like 500 people and it was like what i
read that month basically and it was
sort of just me like reviewing a few
books and it was pretty crappy like the
writing probably wasn't good but it was
loose to your point and it was kind of
um again like a janky version of the
audience building and the thing that i
ended up doing at scale um was the seed
had been planted and i was working on it
and i think about that when i hear you
tell the story of wait but why like
you'd been working writing you know you

[35:01]
you'd been working writing you know you
kind of opened yourself up creatively
put yourself in the arena a bit and you
had to do that small thing in order for
the big thing to actually happen there's
actually even another level which is
when i started this first blog i
realized that what i was actually doing
is i was doing something i'd done
forever which is i'd come back from a
trip or a crazy weird day and i would
just type an email to like 12 friends
and and i would do it you know i'd be
like okay you know like you know
throughout the day like the following
things happen like tick this take this
take this right i just do that i'll
write these long kind of you know emails
to friends and i realized when i started
blogging it's like oh i'm just actually
doing the thing that i used to just do
on as an email i'm doing this now as a
blog and then then i took it and did it
as a full-time job you know so
there's even like more layers like and i
think that is
a lot of times something you're doing
very casually actually you know is
um
you you actually sometimes find
something that man i'm good at this and
i really like it and it doesn't feel
like it it could go anywhere because it

[36:00]
like it it could go anywhere because it
seems like it's such a casual thing but
sometimes you can make that connection
and say i think this like thing that i
do with my friends actually is pretty
special maybe i can do something with
that like
sometimes that's what you know that
sometimes it's there yeah if you're
anything like me your portfolio is a mix
of the usual suspects stocks bonds and
mutual funds
maybe you've even dabbled in some
alternative assets like crypto but those
investments can be incredibly
unpredictable you know what typically
isn't unpredictable apartment buildings
rental homes industrial facilities
places we go every day to work eat and
live

you've you know built relationships
built a reputation around your writing

[39:01]
built a reputation around your writing
and your creative work that is
astounding and you know and far-reaching
your posts which you're a bit of a
unicorn within the um you know blogging
and newsletter writing sphere because
you don't really have a set cadence for
these posts you're not like you know one
of these hey i'm going to write one a
week or one a month your posts are sort
of few and far between but when you
release them they
go completely nuts and people you know
dive in they're these longer posts
really exploring a topic from what i
love about them is it feels like you
come at a topic from basically any every
any and every angle that might exist at
it and really envelop the topic one of
the things
that sort of
kind of vaulted you to another level of
prominence along the way was your
relationship with
elon musk and you mentioned him earlier
and
some of your insights on him and so i
feel like
a need to to unpack that a little bit
can you just tell the quick story of how
you originally got connected with him in
the first place to write the pieces you
did on spacex tesla neurolink etc

[40:02]
did on spacex tesla neurolink etc
yeah
um
it really started when so at the you
know as i said
this was a partnership with my friend
andrew finn and so we're
every week i was
you know coming up with what's the next
topic you know what's the next
um it's the beginning it was more
regular and it was like you know you
know it you know i i was able to kind of
go longer and less regular once it was
already an audience i shouldn't be there
um and it was always like you know
what's like you know so many topics
potential topics what's the choice and
he said to me one day andrew was like um
he's like you might want to write about
ai there's you know the um
nick i think he's like you know there's
a bunch of people are reading this book
by nick bostrom um
super intelligent so i was like all
right so i picked it up read it was like
had you know jaw on the floor
um and then i
um read you know another book
uh
and then i read

[41:01]
and then i read
uh i forget what the second book was
called it's in the post at the bottom um
i read a third book i read ray
kurzweil's
um singularity is near
i read you know a bunch of long articles
i read a handful of papers i watched a
bunch of people on youtube and i just
started to like absorb this crazy topic
and wrote a big long post about
sometimes you happen to you know
sometimes you write something at the
right time and sometimes you don't right
it's part of the skill is trying to like
figure out when it's a good time for a
topic you know a good time is when it's
it's it's fuzzy but people don't quite
understand it yet is a good time for a
topic like that you don't want to do it
when everyone's like read a bunch of
stuff and they already have a sense of
it and it's become like now there's
camps political camps about it it's
controversial you want it at the
beginning when everyone's like what is
this new thing you know um
everyone's wide-eyed still about it and
trying to understand but if you do it
too early
then also it doesn't hit either you know
it's it's it's
there's a goldilocks there's a
goldilocks moment for things to hit
yes so i feel like i got lucky uh here
with you know um i ai was it was the

[42:00]
with you know um i ai was it was the
right time and the post you know really
went pretty viral um
and then one day you know we used chart
beat to see how many people are on the
site um
and one day you know there's you know
get the notification from chart beat
like you know high activity or something
and you go and there was like a trillion
people on this on the site it was like
it was like a you know it was like a few
days or a week after this thing was
published
and
you see on the side like tweets they
don't do that anymore unfortunately but
i showed you like tweets that are
sending people to your site elon musk
uh
went to the see what the tweet was and
he was like you know funny you know
interesting post you know good primer on
on ai and i was like damn it was like
super exciting obviously yeah um you
know i was i was a fan i already thought
he was like a super awesome dude um
and
so i had part two coming out in a couple
weeks
and now i'm writing part two thinking
you know elon musk might read this right
and so
you know it was uh it's kind of
stressful and also in my head i was like

[43:01]
stressful and also in my head i was like
he's not gonna like he already dedicated
you know 15 minutes of his like
ridiculously precious time to my idiot
blog i'm not don't don't expect more you
know my hopes were done but i published
it turns out i don't know how he got
back to it but he ended up reading that
and he ended up tweeting about it again
and i was like wow uh so i was like okay
this dude like likes this blog that's
pretty awesome so then um
then i got an email from his uh you know
like a staff member of his who basically
was like you know do you want to
you know elon likes your stuff we'd like
to talk to you about like maybe doing
some writing
about you know his stuff
yeah you know and again i expect that to
be
him on the phone for a second or maybe
not even at all like it's he but it's
actually someone else and he's on the
phone for a second then he gets off and
i talk to like you know
a person who's working for him about
what
turns out he calls me one on one and
it's just uh just us on the phone for
like an hour
um
talking about spacex and solarcity tesla

[44:01]
talking about spacex and solarcity tesla
and like
um
ai and other things and like
super interesting conversation
um
and
did you feel over your depth in that
conversation
you know i think
the the way this started was very
helpful if this has been something where
it's like a
i i had a good friend that knew him and
like asked if he would talk to me for a
minute i would have been like you know
so but he
this he came to me after like clearly
liking my stuff so i think that gave me
some like confidence like and i'm very
much myself on the blog i'm like i don't
have to pretend to be someone else
you're clearly like
he's coming he specifically like is
interested in me writing because he he
likes like the way i am thinking about
this stuff so you ticked up north on
your own spectrum that we talked about
yeah yeah i i think i mean look i'm not
saying this now i think probably if you
asked me at the time i would have been
like yeah this is horrifying like this
um i probably was like you know just a
mess like you know rambling but
um he also like

[45:01]
um he also like
you know to his credit is pretty easy to
talk to like you know he he like uh you
just ask him a question and he kind of
just goes on like he would in an
interview or anywhere else he just kind
of starts talking about it and um
very very upfront you know you know
there's there's
just really he's really interested in
the things he's working on so if you ask
him about it he'll just go and it
becomes very easy
so um we had a great combo and and the
idea was like we were trying to figure
out he had no specific idea was like
should you write some stuff on
the tesla website because there was a
blog there um written by actually uh
hamish mckenzie who now is the one of
the founders of sub stack
and it was like oh should you do some
stuff on that blog and i was like i
didn't want to do that because i was
trying to build my own site and i don't
want to
spend a lot of time writing something
that was going to bring traffic to the
tesla website um
um and so
i
you know i wasn't sure if you know he
was going to be like well that's the
only way i'm going to do it he again
very laid back i was like i was like i

[46:01]
very laid back i was like i was like i
think it should be on weight but why
uh
and then i can really like i can have
all the features i want i can put
footnotes i can make it long i can have
images and uh and he was like okay
and i was like cool uh and so then we
were like what's and then so i kind of
came up with the plan though he didn't
really have like any like
instructions for me it was like
i liked what you did on ai i liked that
he felt it was like entertaining and
accurate those are the two things you
know that's what he he cares about
accurate and he also like prefers
something to be you know a tone that
peop you know that might broke people in
so
i basically was like well why don't i do
a post on tesla and on spacex and
you know
see you know what else whatever else
and so that that turned into a four-part
series first one was just a big picture
about him the second one was a long post
about tesla and third one was even
longer post about spacex and the whole
story there
and the fourth one was about like why is
this guy so successful like what's going
on and to me it was like the way he
reasons and that was the answer there um
and i've more since written about other

[47:01]
and i've more since written about other
companies of his like neuralink but
um but but what was really interesting
is because he just doesn't do things in
normal way you know he doesn't you know
you think someone like him would have
this pr team that's doing his tweets
there's no pr team right this is him you
know he's a guy he's acting like a guy
he opens up his twitter and he tweets
something funny he just doesn't do
things the normal way for someone like
that right in so many ways
how does he think i mean you spent time
with him he's obviously in the news and
you know his prominence since you first
interacted with him is probably a
hundred asked a million because he was
already yeah i think he had a million
twitter followers when we yeah so
if you just take twitter it's a hundred
x that if you look at any other metric
you know his influence in the world is
yeah um completely astounding you know
with all the different companies with
starlink now with everything that he's
doing
how do you think he
uh what is your perception of how he
thinks about new opportunities and like
i'm asking this question in the context
of all this stuff that he's talking
about with twitter now and with all the
different stuff that he's doing in the
world of atoms you know that's out there
like how do you think um

[48:01]
like how do you think um
like what is his mental model or his
framework for evaluating what to take on
and new opportunities what's your
perception of that
um
i think he
always starts from
the big goal
and works backwards from there so the
big goal for him he's very clear-headed
about it and he's been saying in the
same wording
the same goal since if you look back to
interviews from his you know or you know
things he wrote or said in 2001 2002
um
which is
uh
to increase the probability of a good
future for humanity uh and an even
bigger picture maybe to he wants the
light of human consciousness to go on
for a long time and he wants it to be a
good future he wants it so increase the
probability of a good and long future
for humanity not not for each individual
person you know he's not he's not
working on life extension for people as
much you know he's concerned about the
species and again i think if you really
zoom out and you take a big step back

[49:00]
zoom out and you take a big step back
and you picture the whole milky way
galaxy in front of you and you know that
there's this little like dot of of
higher consciousness there maybe there's
a lot of places where that exists but
maybe not we don't know but we know is
that it's one place
and it and and you know he thinks about
the fermi paradox a lot why don't we see
other aliens he's worried that maybe
we're very rare and maybe you know it's
very precarious to keep a civilization
like ours going so he wants to keep that
dot that little flame alive really badly
um
and so at that point
now you start thinking okay so you work
backwards from there so
if that's what you want
to raise the probability of a good
future
what are the threats
to
a a good future what are the threats to
a long future right so what are the
major biggest
you know existential things going on
um and
then from there
what are
okay so now you've identified some
threats like he thinks you know advanced
ai is a threat he thinks that

[50:00]
ai is a threat he thinks that
um you know not moving to a sustainable
energy world is a threat to a good
future
um he thinks being stuck on one planet
alone you know all our eggs in one's
basket is a threat to a good future um
he's you know so there there's some
major things like this
um
and so it's almost like inverting
like he kind of inverts like if the goal
is the big future he's inverted that and
said like what would lead to a bad
future yeah and now go solve those
problems that could potentially lead to
that bad future yeah you know which
which of these
has potential solutions like where can
human effort
um
have an effect a positive effect on some
of these things and raise the
probability of a good future um
so the erosion of free speech is a
threat to a good future
he you know i see twitter very much i
see twitter very much as part of the
same story here he sees um and this is
you know this he sees uh
what's
just in general the polarization of

[51:00]
just in general the polarization of
society and and the threats of
authoritarianism from many angles um as
a threat to a good future um and and um
and again it's not just that it's a
threat but he thinks he sees ways that
human effort can make it better he's he
he he sees ways that
if we change things in this way it could
be better with you know sustainable
energy future he you know uh if if if
everyone went electric for vehicles like
that would have be a big help and it
seems doable like electric vehicles are
good enough where people will want to
switch over if they could you know so it
has to be practical has to make sense
but he'll talk about even if he thinks
something has a 10 chance of succeeding
but it's really important it's worth
trying well this is like his uh charlie
munger lunch right like charlie munger
spent the whole lunch i don't know if
this is actually a true story but it's
definitely been told several times of
like charlie munger at a lunch with with
elon musk tells the entire table all the
reasons why tesla will fail and elon
responded by basically agreeing with all
of the reasons and saying i agree all of

[52:00]
of the reasons and saying i agree all of
those are real reasons why it is likely
to fail but it is still worth trying
yeah i mean
you know it's like you miss 100 of the
shots you don't take kind of thing like
if this really matters well the one way
to guarantee the failure is to not try
it at all
but you know he's not crazy if he
thought if he thinks it's a point one
percent chance of succeeding he's not
gonna put his time into that but ten
percent it's also
it's an ev right like it's an expected
value bet and he's a highly analytical
person as as you are as well right and
so you're calculating even if it's a ten
percent chance but if the
outcome in that scenario is
astronomically better than in the event
of not trying it or in the event of
failure you should probably take that
bet and you would do it over and over
again and the overall ev of society will
be hugely positive from doing that yeah
yeah yeah exactly like
whatever he could be working on that's
more of a 90 chance of success he does
he doesn't see that eevee as as as
matching up
so i have to
route back to something that you
mentioned in passing there on the fermi

[53:00]
mentioned in passing there on the fermi
paradox because i absolutely love this
one uh you've written a long post on it
which i thought was which i thought was
fantastic um for anyone that doesn't
know this is like the where is everybody
uh question of you know like if life in
the universe exists as we you know as
people surmise shouldn't we have
encountered it by now um you know if
there's like millions of stars and
there's likely to be planets that look
like earth um
where is the life that would have
progressed to the point of interstellar
travel why haven't we met them yet um so
i'm curious just for your perspective on
this like what is your current thinking
on this paradox is there life in the
universe why haven't we encountered it
yet
yeah i mean it's like it's it's the
world's most interesting question right
i think there's nothing if you take a
again zoom out like there's nothing more
interesting than
than this um and and the reason it's so
tantalizing
i mean first of all it seems like it's
something i
suspect
that we're gonna get an answer to in the
next like 50 years like i think we're at

[54:00]
next like 50 years like i think we're at
the end of our i think this is the this
one in the last
not last it's one of like the the it's
it's it's the it's one of the big
questions that's probably going to be
solved in our lifetimes in my opinion i
just think that and it can only be
solved in one direction because the
absence of evidence is not evident
correct i think i think
yes although although the better your
tools get the more that the
argument that maybe we're alone starts
to go up if you don't find anything so
but yes that's not a clear answer
obviously um
and uh and our tools is just like you
know if you think about it it's not like
oh well it's been millennia and we
haven't answered it so well we've only
been actually searching for like a few
decades in in a real way and our tools
are getting exponentially better so
it's just um
you know it's unbelievable what they can
do now like
just by looking at the wavelengths of
light emerging from
uh a star system they can actually
understand what gases are on a planet
like they can understand the atmospheric
makeup it's like insane to me totally
interesting just like imagine how
knowing how to do that and so they can

[55:00]
knowing how to do that and so they can
be like yeah there's you know and they
and there's a certain kind of
fingerprint that we you know maybe life
exists in lots of different kind of
atmospheric fingerprints but we know one
we know one where it really worked here
and so we if we see another fingerprint
that looks a lot like this with a
certain amount of oxygen and carbon
dioxide and nitrogen or whatever uh i
think that you know that's a
that can be a signal so
so anyway and obviously the big things
you're looking for is like some weird
you know thing where a star is you know
one of my favorite i'll get to the
answer in a second but just i just
there's a lot to think about here one of
my favorite scary theories is like um
there's this boots void it's called uh
which is like this insanely large space
out in the universe with no galaxies or
like very few like a much smaller it's
almost entirely
blank it's just like a sphere of black
uh when when that's not normal like in
any other sphere that size there's like
you know thousands of galaxies
and so it could be a lot of things it
could be that that's a big black hole

[56:00]
could be that that's a big black hole
you know like or or there's a group of
black holes that like merge there's a
lot of different ways of good things it
could be
referred to as the great nothing yes
colloquially or referred to i'm i'm kind
of scared after that it's it's upsetting
it's an upsetting concept like i'm just
like i don't want to be in the middle of
that where like what's crazy is that
light that go that leaves one side of
the boots for it doesn't hit the other
side for like a billion years so it's
like
so you can be you can be so so so and
the thing is there are planets
there are some stars and planets like
scattered in there what's crazy is that
if there are you know planets around
there and there's life on there they'll
look out and they will be sure that
there's no such thing as like a galaxy
or there's no such thing as like other
galaxies they're just gonna see you know
they're only gonna see
anyway
so one of the territories one of the
potential theories is that actually what
you're seeing here because you know one
of the one of the ideas about what
advanced life more advanced than us
might do is you know we think about it
in terms of energy so there's this thing
called the kardashev scale

[57:00]
called the kardashev scale
level ones a level one species can now
harness all the energy of their home
planet so we're not there it's
logarithmic we're like a point seven out
of one but that's not seventy percent
we're like two percent but
logarithmically it's like seven point
seven so we're a little below that like
you know we're there's obviously all
kinds of energy from the inside of the
earth and from you know rivers and from
wind that we're not harnessing right now
um
then level two is you can harness the
energy of your whole star
so that can be a dyson sphere around the
star you know this idea of like a sphere
that captures because you think oh you
can't sometimes i think intuitively you
can't put a sphere on a star it'll go
out i'm like no no it's not fire that
needs oxygen it's it's fusion there's
nothing to do because i'm like you can't
like but say you know you could cover up
the sun and it would be burning just as
bright and just as as as you know
doesn't there's nothing it needs from
the outside of it so you can put a
sphere around it and all the thing goes
into the surface of the sphere and it
gets channeled into different you know
tubes they go out to the you know
whatever
it's like
that that would be

[58:00]
that that would be
so vastly more energy than we have right
now that we could ever need but but a
super advanced civilization they might
have thousands of space habitats and
they might be on hundreds of planets and
they might be doing way higher level
kind of uh stuff that you know energy
requirements anyway level three is when
you harness the whole energy of your
whole galaxy which again sounds insane
when there's you know over 100 billion
maybe
uh maybe you know
half a bill half a trillion stars
but if somewhere if someone mastered the
dyson sphere thing
you know once you get it you get like
it's like it's like building um
a building was really impossible for
like early humans like a big tall
building but once we did it we just
replicated in other buildings or
everywhere right so you can see once
they get it now so they just start to go
out and they start to uh even if it
takes them a few million years because
you know and and you know to go build
these dyson spheres and
anyway the one of the theories about the
boots void is that there's an
extraordinarily advanced civilization
that has been you don't see the light
because it's all been covered up by
their things and they're living this

[59:01]
their things and they're living this
vast thing that you just can't see it
and that's that's the evidence of their
expansion
anyway
long answer to get back to you asked is
just a big picture for the fermi paradox
um
and look every almost everyone
anyone who understands the scale of the
universe and thinks about how
probability works
almost all comes to the same conclusion
of course we're not alone right it's
like if you picked up one great note we
have one example which is what happened
on earth if you picked up one grain of
sand from a beach and you looked in the
microscope and you saw it was crawling
with little critters
you wouldn't conclude well maybe this is
the only one that has that you'd say of
course i'm sure they're on all kinds you
know i didn't just pick up the one that
has it right so we
we have one example here
um or one solar system and we see that
civilization happen
to think that well maybe this is the
only place it happened makes no sense
right
of course with the scale of course this
must be coming that said there are some
very compelling

[1:00:01]
very compelling
papers and arguments out there that
that say we don't have any good reason
to be confident
that
what happened here wasn't
outrageously rare
like
that's on a scale so it could be so rare
that it pops up in a galaxy once every
couple million years so we're here now
and then maybe there's another one over
there and then maybe you know these two
die out and a million years passes and
the other one pops up so it could be
like that and again if you if you
picture those as like little lights
flashing on if you zoomed out you still
see if you see all the galaxies you
still see all these lights everywhere
and all the galaxies you know so that
but but if that would be rare enough
that there would be nothing else in our
whole galaxy right now right that would
be mean we are unbelievable freak
incident if it happens like once in a
galaxy every once in a while
you can go further and say that you know
maybe this is the only time this has
ever happened in the milky way but it's
happened in other galaxies here and
there you can go even further and say
actually this is the only time it's
happened in the observable universe um

[1:01:01]
happened in the observable universe um
again it's it's it goes
counter-intuitive but we have no sense
of how rare it was how freak of an
incident it was obviously it's some kind
of freak incident that life began
because it took so long before it
happened right so a lot of collisions of
molecules before it happened clearly
it's a hard thing to have happen
uh
we also know i want to propose yeah i
want to propose something that's a bit i
don't know whether anyone has ever
thought of um this kind of angle to it
so have you ever heard of cope's rule
no
so cope's rule is this idea that like
organisms basically scale in size
linearly over time um kind of up to a
point right like then basically like
becoming too big you know
if if you followed that humans would be
you know the size of the sky would be
giants etc and so like there's this idea
that as you get too big you know it's
bad right like there's like an actual
you kind of asymptote from a size
standpoint you can't actually get much
bigger it's bad for you for various
reasons and you see it play out like you
know companies get too big and then

[1:02:00]
know companies get too big and then
struggle or like investors like once you
get big a lot of large numbers it
becomes difficult to perform et cetera
so i wonder whether
there is an intelligence asymptote
of societies where at scale you actually
will not see interstellar travel ever
become a thing because societies find a
way to die off uh from an intelligence
standpoint when they basically like get
too smart for their own good so like in
the same way that size becomes a
disadvantage when it gets like too too
big does intelligence actually become a
disadvantage and are we seeing the
beginning of that with the fracturing of
society and the way that we're seeing
today
yeah i mean so
you're talking about is is
is human level intelligence a possible
great filter candidate great filter is a
robin hansen term that
is you know is there some
point
along the evolutionary path that it that
that almost every single attempt
hits a wall there

[1:03:01]
hits a wall there
um and and and there's a few options
here it's not just what you said it's
like the great filter might be behind us
it may be maybe going from
simple cell to complex cell with a
nucleus because that took a i don't know
it took a billion years it took a huge
amount of time i think it took a billion
years of simple sales i mean that's
but maybe actually the average is it
would have taken a thousand uh you know
a trillion years and it happened really
really early here it was a freak
incident so maybe it's behind us and all
the other attempts they don't get past
that we happen to that would be great
news
it also could be ahead of us
um meaning you know we look
this is you know nick bostrom talks
about how
uh
what if you could make a nuclear weapon
by microwaving sand right set up a
nuclear bomb by putting sand in the
microwave just something like something
that anyone could do
you have to imagine we would be set back
to the stone age at this point right
because
one out of every 100 000 people is a
maniac who would love to extinct humans
and love to go down in the you know look

[1:04:01]
and love to go down in the you know look
at school shooters i mean i don't think
that they're choosing
to only kill 15 people i think they
could kill a thousand they pro a lot of
them would right and they're obviously
trying to go down with the biggest bang
possible
so
it doesn't matter if 99.999
of people are good and reasonable
if it becomes easy to blow up the planet
the planet it's going to be blown up
right so
uh this the scary thing is to think
about well as our technology gets better
and better and better um
and you look at stuff like social media
maybe this happens on a lot of planet
maybe every planet that you know all
these civilizations they end up with
their social media phase and when they
get there very quickly you know madness
starts to prevail over reason which is
what's happening on social media this
most people are reasonable but the
forces of madness
are on the rise and and squashing the
forces of reason right now and maybe
this isn't you know maybe this is just
very predictable and happens all the
time and at some point you get too
interconnected and the weapons get too
easy to make and

[1:05:01]
easy to make and
all the reason in the world doesn't
matter because suddenly everyone's back
in the state of nature just shine trying
to protect themselves and
and maybe it doesn't extinct them maybe
it sets them back you know to the stone
age or whatever and then they can you
know so you know it doesn't have to
extinct us to so yeah i mean it that's a
very possible thing but here's here okay
here's an argument against it
if life you know because there's also
lots of theories that say even if even
if this is pretty rare there's so many
stars out there so many sun-like stars
with earth-like planets around them
habitable planets
that a lot of other people say well what
we would expect is that there's not just
other civilizations like ours there's
milli tens of millions of them in the
milky way alone
milk is just one of hundreds you know
two trillion galaxies
um
and so
even if this were the case what you were
saying there'd be a freak incident
there'd be outliers there'd be some
species that developed this
all-encompassing religion that was so
you know that did such a good job of
policing people's behavior that they

[1:06:01]
policing people's behavior that they
that they made it past they got to the
point where they could now all upload
their consciousness and you couldn't
kill off people any more easily and they
were on many many planets and they had
developed you know intelligence that
allowed them to snuff out any threats i
don't know
so or maybe not but it seems like
you know
man it really it's a great filter that
filters everyone if it's working
right
it's a pretty amazing i mean it's just
amazing to go to the like reaches of
thinking on this the boots uh the boots
boy
because there's so much space in between
stars but
all of the stars around us we're all in
like a tiny like a super like urban
neighborhood you know a galaxy is like
super condensed but yet when you
actually get in here you're like oh my
god there's so much space between
galaxies is even more space and the
boots void is like it's next level it's
like it's upset
it is amazing to just think about like

[1:07:00]
it is amazing to just think about like
humans do have a fascination with the
very very big
um and like the zooming out you know
cosmos like neil degrasse tyson and
cosmos and and how he kind of brought a
um you know an abstraction of the
complexity of the very big to the masses
um you know and before him obviously the
original cosmos um with carl sagan and
um that there's always been this amazing
fascination with the unknown of space
and the scale of it and it like you know
you watch the first episode of cosmos
and i defy you to not like get pushed
back into your pillow or wherever you're
watching it and feel like holy [ __ ] what
is the meaning of all this why am i here
um but the big has this allure that i
find personally the like very small
doesn't necessarily have in zooming in i
mean it's just the bigness is just so
because like the smallness we know it's
there right we know at some point you
can just get it's like you know it's
like yes
if you zoom in enough on anything you're
going to see really small particles
right but the bigness like we didn't i
don't think you know humans knew about

[1:08:00]
don't think you know humans knew about
how big things were for a long time um
which which of course is another way of
saying they didn't know how small they
were right it makes us really small
like tiny um but not to mention that
there are things about the bigness one
of the things i find fascinating
historically is like galileo was
ostracized cast off um you know a
complete pariah for um you know theories
that he had about the universe and about
the bigness uh a few hundred years later
he was obviously proven completely
correct and was no longer you know
considered a pariah historically but
there are going to be things that today
uh we are hilariously wrong about that
we are like ostracizing people um saying
you're an idiot you know pushing them
off like they're on the fringes of
science that 100 years from now that
person will be like the genius that you
know predicted x y or z whatever it was
yeah yeah it's uh
they're uh i mean there's i forget who
said it but you know
if you go back to any point in history

[1:09:03]
if you go back to any point in history
uh to any society there's gonna be a
bunch of things
that you
will that you should not say out loud a
bunch of truths that you better not say
out loud
right
and
it's easy to look back at the people in
the past and the societies in the past
and see what they were and say oh my god
you know if you said this
very obvious normal thing today out loud
back in 1620 england or in you know the
roman empire
um
you're you're done you know you're
you're at best ostracized you know
um
and
uh
yeah and
it's hard to unders it's hard to see you
know again we have that we have the
helicopter view of those those societies
now so we can see
um uh but we are ridiculous like you
said we are for sure without question i
mean i think 20 years ago it would have
been like wow we're probably ridiculous
in some ways today it's almost like it's
it's painfully clear to see like just
looking at social media um

[1:10:01]
looking at social media um
looking at like like the way like we're
being manipulated by in information
warfare and
um you know the fact that there's like
still
like lots and lots of like brutal
dictatorships
um and like our livestock farming
there's so many areas where i'm like
you can see like it's annoying to know
the things that we're gonna be laughed
at in the future but like i'm sure
people in the 1700s
and you know if you look at like abigail
adams letters to john adams people were
aware how bad slavery was you know there
were a lot of abigail adams is writing
these letters basically being like
this is like the worst thing ever they
knew right so i think a lot of the time
like there are a lot of people who know
how bad things are but there's there's
some forces that are keeping it up
upheld uh so yeah i think about this
kind of thing all the time it's like
yeah the ridiculousness of the human
state the the one thing i will leave you
with and i know we're running up against
end of time um is one of your one of
your tweets i think it was last year

[1:11:01]
your tweets i think it was last year
which is
sort of to this day one of my favorite
tweets and and general thoughts which is
this idea that like if you went back in
time
to a few days before you were um
conceived or born
um you would be very careful about the
actions you took because you would know
that there was the potential that any
action you took back then might lead to
you not being born back to the feedback
to the future if you went back
to before your parents met you'd be like
don't touch
anything hide in the closet don't say
anything right because
you know yeah
and so
it's a good reminder if that's the case
that in the present to think just as
carefully about the things you were
doing because your actions have very
real impacts um on the future and yeah
where everything goes from here right
you don't have to like worry about like
oh no like i just interrupted that
conversation now those few people might
not like have gotten married you have to
worry because it doesn't matter because
any of the future paths might be equally
as bad or good when you're in the
present but
it's a reminder that you know any i do

[1:12:00]
it's a reminder that you know any i do
think that like
we take any person
who lives from like a baby to like old
age and then they die whether they're
totally you know ordinary person living
an ordinary life the ripple effects that
that person causes
and the the the secondary kind of
consequences i think you have a totally
different world
uh
if if they if they lived or if they
didn't live most cases you know and yeah
and certainly today you know um so yeah
i think it's it's it's empowering to be
like yes what we do matters yeah yeah
it's empowering um and the last one is
on the fermi paradox uh
you said
it has two possibilities both of them
make me want to hug you either the
universe is teeming with aliens which
means we're a single family in a cosmic
society great or
there's no one else in which case we're
stranded together on a tiny island in
the vast darkness but gladly not the
boots boyd
yes and that's true that's part of why
the fairy paradox is so cool because
like

[1:13:00]
like
either way it's mind-blowing right
there's no non there's no
non-mind-blowing outcome here and either
way it it is a reminder that like
fighting with each other above dumb [ __ ]
like human tribalism is so stupid
it's it's only when your like head is so
like zoomed in that you can't like
just remind yourself what the hell is
really going on here
that's how i feel a good a good reason
to not fight on twitter with strangers
oh man well thank you so much tim by the
way i love you i love your twitter i uh
i appreciate it it was uh you know it's
been an absolute blast talking with you
i feel like i owe you money um for how
much i learned from this conversation
and i also feel like i'm gonna be kind
of mad at you when i think about the
boots void later tonight so i appreciate
it so much
look forward to to getting together uh
when you're out in new york and uh
thanks so much for joining me thanks so
