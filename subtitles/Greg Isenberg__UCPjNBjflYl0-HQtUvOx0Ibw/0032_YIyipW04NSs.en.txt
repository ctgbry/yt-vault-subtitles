[00:00]
[Music]
what up how's it going man
ah it's early for us uh
i feel like we normally do these in the
evening and i i drink alongside them but
it's like the rare morning recording
that we're doing right now yeah so
but i know you're like super caffeinated
so i feel like you're ready to you're
ready to go
well i'm not as caffeinated as i
otherwise would be you know for context
but this is like you know morning after
the super bowl so i'm like you know a
little hungover um got into it a little
bit last night
and it's it's early i'm this is actually
my first cold brew of the day which is
pretty rare and i'm only like a third of
the way into it so i actually i feel
like i need to need to get some energy
going here what do you got for me today
to give me a little energy i mean
i'm still thinking super bowl
um
favorite super bowl ad obviously the qr
code the bouncing around qr code
give me your take on that so for people
that don't have context or didn't watch

[01:00]
that don't have context or didn't watch
the super bowl
there was an ad basically it was a black
screen and there was a qr code which
some people know what they are some
people don't but basically this qr code
was just like ping-ponging around the
screen in different colors um it was a
fit it was a coinbase ad and if you
popped up in your phone and scanned the
qr code it took you to coinbase um and
it crashed the site like within two
minutes the site was down from all the
traffic from you know 100 million people
watching the super bowl and presumably a
bunch of them logged into it at once and
it took down the site so what was your
take on i mean so i'll give you my macro
take and my micro take so my macro take
on the bouncing around qr code is it's
an ode to
like you remember in school when they
used to like bring in a tv
and we'd wait for like a video and it
was that basically this like bouncing
around image and it never hits the
corners and i think there's like an
office episode actually that like talks
that there's like a clip of it maybe we
can put in the show notes where
like the whole office um is like

[02:01]
like the whole office um is like
watching
uh
the screen and they're just kind of
waiting for it anyway so the whole point
is
um
it's an it's a
a nod to nostalgia and i think like the
macro thing is that nostalgia is one of
the most powerful sales techniques of
all time
and we saw that everywhere that was the
theme of the super bowl in my opinion
like the winner was nostalgia so for
example like the halftime show like
was nostalgia
you know to the max
um so that's the macro and then the
micro which is
uh this particular ad
um
[Music]
you know i just think it's a brilliant
way to get you know if they're gonna
spend seven million dollars on an ad and
they're trying to get like a hundred
thousand sign ups like yeah it makes
sense to put a qr code and then it's
like yeah it does make sense to like
combine direct response plus nostalgia
so the stats on it are pretty staggering

[03:00]
so the stats on it are pretty staggering
by the way i completely agree with you
nostalgia
the actual stats on the ad which i
looked up this morning are crazy because
they spent 14 million dollars for the
60-second spot during the super bowl it
was literally 60 seconds of this thing
ping-ponging around
and uh it crashed the site within a
couple minutes because of all the people
going to it the app went from being
186th in the world
to
second in the world overnight from
running this ad during the super bowl
and so
14 million dollars and the return was
that that massive jump plus all the
earned media of people just talking
about it constantly we're sitting here
talking about it all the news articles
this morning i actually tweeted out
something saying if i were gonna go drop
a bold super bowl ad
i would probably pre-program my site to
be down like two minutes after the thing
dropped because i personally think that
the earned media of saying oh we crashed
the site with our super bowl dad that we
ran is more valuable than the site being
up and people being able to like do

[04:00]
up and people being able to like do
something on the site when they go to it
because i think it extends the half-life
of that overall kind of ad impression
for much longer than it otherwise would
have been yeah i thought that was i i
agree with you i also think that like
you mentioned like the app store charts
like one you know one thing about app
store charts is once you hit the top of
the charts
like other people basically will be like
oh what's you know we'll just be
discovering the charts and be like oh
what's coinbase and so there's a certain
amount of staying power that happens
when you hit up in you know and and you
do what's called a
you know that's called like a burst
marketing campaign where you you go up
and there's a certain amount of staying
power so overall like
coinbase i mean my guess is they crushed
it on those ads in terms of numbers
um it makes it makes me think like
you know
for late checkout and our clients like
should we be like taking out more tv ads
like and throwing up qr codes um are tv
ads undervalued

[05:00]

it's sort of interesting i mean with
with um how expensive digital
advertising has gotten do you go back
like to the point of nostalgia do you go
back to doing the old way i mean we've
seen it in consumer i spent a lot of my
time in consumer in my old job and the
re-emergence of things like direct mail
and catalogs within consumer was
fascinating because it was like what's
old is new right um you had all these
people all of a sudden realizing it was
so expensive to acquire customers online
and spend money on google and facebook
and all of those things and so they went
to sending direct mailers and like these
beautiful catalogs that were really
immersive and interesting
and that became the new way to acquire
customers it was the same thing with
small footprint retail like three four
years ago all these stores realized that
it was more expensive to acquire
customers online than to put up a small

[08:00]
customers online than to put up a small
you know store in soho and have that be
like a billboard plus a place for them
to create an immersive experience um but
this feels like the next emergence of
that it was also very clear that crypto
was kind of one of the themes of super
bowl ads this year you just have all
these crypto companies that have raised
so [ __ ] much money and needed to find
creative ways to deploy it and it was
kind of a cool coming out party for a
lot of like web 3 crypto the nouns thing
that you've talked about in the past
that ad where they made an appearance in
the budweiser ad um it was pretty cool
it was cool to see definitely definitely
cool to see um i definitely had like
moments where as a crypto person i was
watching that and my you know my heart
warmed a bunch of times um i think going
back to like
tv ads as a medium in 2022 i think like
why super bowl ads work
um
is because people tune in to the to this
to super bowl ads like i bet you
more you know more people
prefer the halftime show and super bowl

[09:00]
prefer the halftime show and super bowl
ads than the actual super bowl itself
the dif and the difference between like
regular tv ads is it's interruption
you're just like you're there you're
like okay you know clorox you're like in
my face like get out of there so i think
that
what works is
you know
traditional tv advertisements or
traditional advertising in in channels
where people are
tuning in not
tuning out so that's that was a small
takeaway i had
yeah i think that's a really interesting
point it's also an interesting point on
the halftime show because i don't know
if you've ever seen the mechanics of how
that works but basically the nfl
contributes like a million dollars
towards the halftime show and any other
amount that the artists um want in order
to create an amazing experience at
halftime show is self-funded by the
artist so like last year the weekend i
think invested seven million of his own
capital into making an amazing
experience a halftime show this year dr
dre put in six million dollars and so
they spent seven total in addition to
the one um and the the rationale behind

[10:01]
the one um and the the rationale behind
it is pretty interesting because it's
basically a 15-minute ad for that artist
to go and hook people on what their the
content that they are creating and so
relative to like spending coinbase spent
14 million dollars for a 60-second spot
dr dre spent seven million dollars for a
15-minute spot of all these artists
might not be quite as relevant for uh dr
dre snoop dogg eminem maybe they're not
touring as much but for the weekend last
year the amount of um roi that he got on
that seven million dollars is probably
astounding in terms of you know tour
ticket sales merch
uh spotify streams all of his songs
ended up on the top charts in the days
that followed that's worth a lot of
money um so it's pretty fascinating when
you think about the mechanics of these
halftime shows as well it makes me think
like is there an opportunity to do
half-time shows but for other events so
obviously super bowl has 100 million
people watching or more
um but there's tons of events that have
a million people watching 100 000 people

[11:00]
a million people watching 100 000 people
watching 10 million people watching
where you can create a business that
basically creates these tours and you
can combine these artists you combine
the brands and then you sell it to the
nfl the nhl
college whatever thoughts
yeah it's kind of interesting i mean i
the the challenge is would you still
capture as much attention as you do
during the super bowl that's your point
the value here is the fact that there's
i don't know 100 million people watch
this how many of them are tuned in
specifically for commercials and for the
halftime show and so you know you have
this massive captive audience when
you're delivering that content
could you start to shift the narrative
around these other events and create a
place where the halftime show is
actually drawing people into the other
event maybe and you could i mean
effectively get a discounted rate um
from the fact that you're actually
contributing value to the main event via
the halftime show so it's it's sort of
an interesting here's what i like about
halftime shows so
and by the way this is a stream of
consciousness so

[12:01]
consciousness so
let me know if this makes doesn't make
sense
so
halftime shows are for everyone games or
for some
people so
if you could create
interesting you know halftime shows
and create
cultural statements and and bring
culture to events that are beyond just
like hardcore sports
um
i just think that there's in a a it
makes the game like richer and more con
and more interesting to folks
and b i think it it gives
artists a channel to
um to access audiences and to you know
be on their tour dates or beyond like
shows that they're gonna do
it also brings communities together i i
don't think it's crazy what you said it
brings communities together because i
mean you think of the case the super
bowl the amount of super bowl parties
people that come together cool moments
that that creates and that's because
it's an immersive and welcoming

[13:00]
it's an immersive and welcoming
environment where it's not just you know
men watching the super bowl it's um
everybody my wife loves to watch the
super bowl because of the commercialism
because the halftime show and she likes
the football and gets engaged in it and
it's a fun experience for us together
so i don't think it's crazy at all i
think uh
like post pandemic
that these super bowl type events are
going to get a lot bigger and
the ecosystem events
around a lot of these events are going
to get a lot bigger
so
yeah yeah it's a cool it's cool to think
about what how you could build a
business around creating
i mean you kind of alluded to it earlier
create um
halftime shows or similar events short
like 10 to 15 minute events that are
really immersive that can be
um inserted into either physical or
digital events uh because these these
gatherings are going to be uh more and
more prolific and at more and more scale
within the digital world right you can
just get so many people versus in a
physical place um and so how do you

[14:02]
physical place um and so how do you
insert how can you like aggregate and
insert interesting content into that um
in a profitable way
i think it's interesting
cool yeah i mean i i think uh
that was my light bulb moment last night
nostalgia and
halftime shows something there
yeah
so i was thinking more and more it kind
of got me thinking more and more about
these ideas that i've talked about
around creators and owned audiences you
know we were talking about the the kind
of owned audience effect of people
tuning in for the super bowl and um how
it's a good way to capture a bunch of
people at once and it's effectively
priced in right they priced the super
bowl ads and so you're not really
getting a deal on it per se but if you
do something really splashy like what
coinbase did coinbase did you can really
win
and you know there's this whole concept
um now that creators are kind of the
future of
of brands and advertising i was talking
with um alex one of the founders at

[15:01]
with um alex one of the founders at
morning brew recently and he was talking
and he's been tweeting and doing videos
about how he thinks that creators are
really the future and and um you know
the fact that they have an owned
audience and the fact that they have a
really fervent and passionate audience
and a community built around them that
that is the future of consumer
consumer brands distribution etc
and it got me down the rabbit hole on mr
beast
who i'm sure you're familiar with but
like one of the most prolific youtube
creators i think we've talked about him
in the past in the context of that squid
games reenactment video that he did um
which i think now has like 200 million
views or something like that something
completely insane um but mr beast
recently launched this chocolate company
and that was like a light bulb moment
for me personally as i was thinking
about it because look this is a 23 year
old
young man
he has
90 approaching 100 million subscribers
on youtube um i think 15 billion plus
video views to date

[16:00]
video views to date
40 million in revenue or something like
that in 2021 um that squid games
reenactment video did more um
generated more revenue than the original
which is completely insane to me um and
i think he grew by like five million
subs from that one video which is
remarkable as well so mr beast has gone
and launched this chocolate company
called feastables
and they've done it in a very uh
interesting way where the whole launch
was tailored around this like willy
wonka chocolate factory type deal where
you had like tickets like golden tickets
in there and so there's a chance to win
his actual chocolate factory there's
like a million dollars um in prizes you
can be in a mr beast video if you get
one of the lucky tickets um and it's
such a fascinating case study of like
the future of where these consumer
launches and brands are going because he
has a massive owned audience i mean
imagine the number of people that are
going and buying this because they're
seeing him holding it in their videos
they're seeing him interact with it talk

[17:00]
they're seeing him interact with it talk
about it etc it's a good product you
know they're like doing the whole like
very few base ingredients
i'm sure it's kind of best in class in
terms of a formulation standpoint and
they brought in a really legit team to
help run it because they know that
immediately this has scale to it it's
not like a consumer brand that you need
to get off the ground and slowly build a
base he has this enormous embedded
community and audience around it um so
i've just been thinking more and more
about this and like what are the
opportunities to
um
to build at scale around this concept
like it's great on an individual level
that a mr beast can go do this um but
what are the business opportunities that
exist around this general trend that is
developing have you uh
have you heard of knight media
no okay pull it up um
yeah
so
i know about these guys because we work
with them on some projects um

[18:00]
and basically is it night as in like a
middle medieval
or like night like it's it's night time
it's the website is night.
okay i got it yeah so
basically they manage talent including
mr beast
they oh this is a dope website by the
way um they're
a venture studio so they basically
partner with operators so
like you sahil bloom might partner with
like a top
you know youtube creator that they
manage to create a product
and they do investing
this is really cool
so this is what i'm getting at like
there has to be
an opportunity to create a like holding
company of sorts where
this is more of like an agency as far as
i can tell where like they're
representing these people and they will
kind of bring them to bear and then
there's ownership i thought it would be

[19:00]
there's ownership i thought it would be
interesting if you got like 10 creators
together and
basically gave them joint ownership like
you came together twitter tick tock
youtube etc and you kind of take joint
ownership of this holding company and
the holding company then has an
investment fund which i imagine you
could go raise a billion dollars for
because people would definitely give you
capital given the collective influence
the fund would have um and then you
would have everyone's individual brands
underneath it probably some sort of just
like revenue share where like 10 of the
profits they make go back into the
holding company pool um and then you
have
any individual brands you're launching
off of it and you launch them and then
they you kind of hire a team and you can
spin them out like it becomes this like
creator iac of the future um that i
think is like a really really cool
content and you know you call it too
right you call it um
halftime ventures there you go
there you go
there's probably something really cool
to do with it um you're normally the guy

[20:00]
to do with it um you're normally the guy
that brings up tokenomics and web3 but
i'm just thinking about like over time
because you would set an ownership base
presumably at the beginning but over
time as different people grow in
different amounts and are contributing
different value to it it would be pretty
interesting if you had a way to kind of
um have the creators that are growing
the fastest and that are contributing
the most value to the holding company
actually kind of profit from that in
some way
and similarly the people that are
following them that want to kind of
participate within that value creation
might have a mechanism by some form of
token yeah i think the really cool thing
about creators in general is and we
talked about ecosystems before is you
have the creator and then you have their
communities and ecosystems around that
so if you could create
um
you know a new a new version of iac or
holding company where
these creators are incubating products
but you know they're seeing upside which
is really cool um their communities are
seeing upside which is really cool and
you can use web3 to do really fun things
like for example
you know maybe you can't uh

[21:02]
you know maybe you can't uh
you know maybe you get if if you stake
let's say your tokens you get certain
benefits you get extra tokens like you
know maybe there's ways to reward um
you know communities and creators that
are more uh
i guess just
are in it for the long haul so i i do
like that yeah that piece of it it's a
good point
yeah i just feel like um
one of the trends that i see happening
right now is that creators
are individually um going and building
um kind of equity in things right and
you kind of have like a bunch of
creators that are raising small funds
we've seen that obviously a bunch of our
friends um i'm a part of that movement
like there's a bunch of people doing
this and i tend to think that
like one plus one equals three if you
bring these people together if you had
the collective sway of a bunch of the
biggest youtubers a bunch of the biggest
twitter a bunch of the biggest tick tock

[22:00]
twitter a bunch of the biggest tick tock
um a bunch of the biggest instagram etc
and you kind of brought it into a single
fund that would guarantee be able to go
and raise and collect more value
from lps and the fee base of that and
the potential future carry of it than
just these individual small funds that
people are able to raise um so i think
it'd be pretty interesting to actually
see something like this come together
i've seen like
another friend marshall sandman who runs
uh animal capital which is like the sway
house guys um josh richards and those
guys is that his name josh josh richards
right um and uh that's pretty
interesting because they're bringing
this collective kind of sway but can you
go do that on a mass scale where you
bring a bunch of people together and you
have a holding company structure where
you can spin things out i think it's
pretty interesting and there's probably
a bunch of adjacent infrastructure
businesses that would need to be built
in order to enable people to so how
would you do it how would you do it so
let's just say someone is listening to
this and wants to go and create this
um
easier for sahel bloom to do it with you

[23:00]
easier for sahel bloom to do it with you
know half a million twitter followers by
the time we
hopefully
uh by the time we put this out
um you know what what sort of advice can
you give to people who
who might not have a an audience but who
want to create something like this
yeah i mean i guess
the actual putting together of the
structure
um i think would need to be led by the
individuals that were going to be a big
part of it like they would need to all
be on board for it but the individual
pieces of like business and
infrastructure around it i think could
really be anybody um
like when you think about pitch first
off pitching them on it i think there's
an interesting thing to just be pitched
i i would be glad to be a part of that
because i think it's a pretty
interesting concept that i've played
around with different people
but i do tend to think that like the
infrastructure uh layer of somebody
going and launching a new brand like a
feastables um is there a kind of um
is there is there infrastructure and

[24:01]
is there is there infrastructure and
tools that exist that allow creators to
very quickly spin up product drops or
new consumer brands um
things like that where you're kind of
playing the adjacent trend i think are
are probably the more reasonable way for
anyone to get involved in that type of
movement um
but i don't know i need to think about
it more we should muse on it more
because i actually do think there's
something interesting here and something
that we're probably uniquely well suited
to go and play like
here's how
if anyone's listening here's how i would
think about it to me it's very similar
to how
you start a conference
and you want to get guest speakers
so
the thing or you're starting a podcast
and you want to get you know
great guest speakers
um
you know you try to just like
get bigger and bigger names and use
those names to leverage other names
[Music]
and then once you have you know
let's say mr beast as a part of this or

[25:00]
let's say mr beast as a part of this or
mr beast coming to your event then it's
really easy to get anyone else
so i think
the way to do this is
you have to make a compelling
like make a video or something like
record a video make something really
cool like grab an iphone but make it
like unique and interesting and just
like dm as many people as possible and
then wait until you get that one person
to say yes and then use that one person
to say yes to like leverage and then be
like i've got this person you should
come on board
yeah it's a hustle game it's a hustle
game in the early days um
i feel like that's a good transition too
to bring in
our guest for today who is a amazing
creator in his own right but also has
kind of taken the creator um
the creator path and now effectively
transitioned into building really scale
businesses and equity around it um so i
want to bring in i want to bring in our
guest and we can uh we can dive into it
with him and go a little bit deeper here
cool let's do it

[26:00]
cool let's do it
um so
i want to kick off by just wait we're
recording now we're recording

maybe we can just start um
i want to dive in and get
your story and background because i
think it's so interesting how you have
progressed from where you start you know
you grew up in israel
um i want to kind of hear the background
like yeah i've looked up and spent a
bunch of time understanding you know
your path and it's such an interesting
one to where you are today and the
business building um that you've kind of
created around the creator economy as
well but maybe we can just start at the
beginning i'd love to just hear your
kind of journey nus yeah yeah first of
all guys uh greg sale thank you so much
for having me here uh really appreciate
it um
yes my name is nasir like yes sire no
sire yes sire no sire it's complicated
uh i was born raised in israel uh i'm

[28:01]
uh i was born raised in israel uh i'm
palestinian israeli so it's double
whammy
moved to the united states for college
got into harvard not a double whammy uh
graduated worked as a software engineer
at venmo
before it was cool now venmo is really
cool back then it was cool too um
and then decided to become a creator and
so i started making videos put them on
the internet and then to my surprise
like people started to watch i made a
thousand videos in a thousand days never
missed a day not even once i adopted
facebook as my platform as opposed to
youtube maybe that's why half your
audience doesn't know me uh
and uh and it blew up from there and now
nas daily has you know 47 million
followers in 13 different languages
around the world
and after i finished that journey of
making content i started a tech company
going back to my software engineering
roots
so we're building basically a master

[29:00]
so we're building basically a master
class for creators
and
we have been building it for two years
we're venture funded series a and we
will be serious b very soon i hope
and that's me i'm talking to you from
dubai
so i need this i need to back you up a
little bit on this whole thing because
there's so many interesting um
points in that story so
you got into harvard you ended up at
harvard i think i read that you were
originally going to do an aerospace
engineering degree ended up doing
economics and computer science which i
think is probably more practical
practical maybe you'd be working for
spacex or something now
working in the space economy but
you end up at venmo
how did you decide to quit your job and
go off on this journey because you were
on like probably what was a very
lucrative and great track and as uh as
someone with um uh with immigrant
parents uh and india you know an indian
mother um jewish father
i uh i was always someone who felt like

[30:00]
i uh i was always someone who felt like
the safe track was the one i was
supposed to be taking and i imagine your
parents
had maybe similar perspectives
yeah i know that's a great question i
mean that decision happened six years
ago i think the riskiest part of that
decision is not the money it's actually
the visa because when you quit your job
as an international you lose your h-1b
and you need somebody else to sponsor it
and you need to win the lottery again
and i was just like i don't know it was
just a stupid decision in retrospect
actually made me smart but i was like i
don't i don't need america i don't i
don't need the visa and i don't need the
120k per year because i had 60k savings
already so 60k is is all it takes really
to feel a sense of
i'm never going to be homeless you know
um yeah are there companies just to
pause you on the visa point because
you're sparking an idea are there
companies that um help people with this
like a company that
um you can nominally work for and
acquire a visa via that when you're

[31:01]
acquire a visa via that when you're
doing a non-traditional path yeah that
sounds like illegal yeah
nominally work for equals illegal
um do you think so i i don't know like
like a company that will um
kind of
basically take people that are going to
go
on a non-traditional but potentially
lucrative path and bear the risk of
the payment on you know on whatever it
costs to get them the visa but then gets
a percent of the upside around it it's
sort of like they're investing in your
future which could be potentially much
more valuable and they're the ones that
are going to incur the costs around the
visa process well you are very
entrepreneurial man i i get i gotta
admire that but i i think the us
government asks you why you want the
visa i'll uh i'll raise you you know
i'll add to that idea so
linkedin but it's for jobs that
you know u.s companies will sponsor your
visa j1 which is your internship visa

[32:01]
visa j1 which is your internship visa
which is really easy to give
tn which is your canadian us you know
it's just all br broken down and
categorized around different categories
as a canadian myself
and moved who moved to the us
like
i dealt with so much pain around just
like
visas and stuff like that and so many
friends have totally and it doesn't need
to be this way i mean and and we're in a
job shortage right like we need to hire
people
yeah
and highly technical and skilled workers
too i mean it's um
it's an insane problem i mean i have um
close close family who grew up in in
bangladesh
and are still bangladeshi citizens i
believe and um it's impossible one of
them worked for him oh one of them
worked for amazon and then was wanted to
go start a startup but literally
couldn't leave amazon because of that
challenge of like oh well then i'm gonna
have to move back to bangladesh because
i won't have a visa yeah wow crazy from
amazon to bangladesh anyway

[33:00]
amazon to bangladesh anyway
back to you guys
super interesting anyway i'm sorry i i
gotta add so
you know you said something
uh when you're kind of explaining a bit
about yourself which i i really dialed
into which is
you basically were like hey i started
making a bunch of videos and then to my
surprise
people started watching and i made it a
thousand videos every single day so
number one like how surprised
were you actually like
um
and how long did it take for you
like how did you do it basically like
what advice could you give to people
listening who want to create something
uh who want to you know create videos
create tweets create whatever
um what sort of frameworks could you
give to people to help them get hundreds
of millions of people watching yeah
well greg the problem with this podcast
is that people cannot see my face
right when they see
when they see my face they realize wow
this is not a hollywood face
you know there's a lot of this is why

[34:01]
you know there's a lot of this is why
don't sell yourself short come on man
you know what i
thank you for being nice but that's
[ __ ] because before starting nas
daily i i went on tinder and i swiped
right basically on every single girl for
the next 500 girls
and then i just got like
two swipes back
people don't want a hollywood face
anymore they want a tick-tock face
that's what they want okay well i i
guess preference changed in the last six
years well
unfortunately i've been in a
relationship for five years so i don't
need to swipe anymore but
when i swiped i got no responses so
that's when i knew statistically
speaking i don't have the face to go
viral
that's number one number two
is i scream in my videos
i don't know if you've seen the videos
but i [ __ ] scream
and
a lot of people think that's annoying uh
number three
you know i'm from israel which is a very
controversial country and all this stuff

[35:02]
controversial country and all this stuff
so
yeah a lot of reasons that's why i was
surprised people resonated to my
storytelling
my recommendation for people watching is
probably
uh
you know
i what is my recommendation actually
you know the truth of the matter is you
know how there is like companies that
find product markets fit i think there
is such a thing called personality
market fit
there are just some personalities that
literally cannot go viral that literally
cannot be relatable and there are some
personalities that are just make one
video and you'll be immediately in love
people in love with you like charlie
demilia for example
so my recommendation is first understand
if you have personality market fit and
for that you need to look at very early
signals in your day-to-day life

[36:00]
signals in your day-to-day life
to see
if you could rally the crowd around you
so i'll give you one of the earliest
signals i knew that i could have i could
have
i potentially could have a career here
um
despite my tinder failure
which was i looked at my facebook my
personal facebook and i uploaded a
status update and it got 60 60 likes
6-0 and i looked at my roommate and he
uploaded one status update and he got
six likes
now i was wondering why is my status
update 10 times more engaging than my
roommate who is actually 10 times more
attractive than me
and also the signals i started to
understand like oh my god like my
personal facebook is consistently
popping
you know if i if i throw a rooftop party
people show up
if i throw another summit six years
later people consider showing up and i
was like huh
there's something there i wonder if i
could find 60 million people as opposed

[37:00]
could find 60 million people as opposed
to 60. and now we found 47 million and
we have 13 million more people to go
so that is fascinating to me the way
that you laid that out because i i think
it clicks with me in a lot of ways in my
own experience as a
creator
with
the twitter stuff i've done because in
prior lives i had done i had experienced
something similar with facebook on a
personal level or with linkedin um on
micro scales and then with instagram i
had a i had a brief uh appearance as
like a travel instagram photographer
deleted my instagram in 2017 because i
didn't think it was healthy um but i had
those same moments and just never really
thought about it the way that you laid
out that you have these kind of signals
the other thing that you're not giving
yourself credit for is you created 1 000
videos over a thousand days yes and one
thing that we consistently come back to
on this show whether it's with um the
founder of reddit alexis ohanian or
whether it's with scott belsky the head
of product at adobe these amazing

[38:00]
of product at adobe these amazing
entrepreneurs founders creators that
we've had on is the consistency the
relentless consistency of effort is a
common thread among all of them all of
them actually say that they're not
particularly special
which i call [ __ ] on by the way like
everyone says that i think it's this
great thing of humility awesome i like i
respect the hell out of it yeah i think
it's [ __ ] i think all of you are
very special but
one thing that you all have in common
for sure
is this uncommon
relentless consistency around the
efforts once you've found something that
works you know how to just go deep deep
deep deep down that route
yeah that is very true i think you would
call it in a different world like
obsession
because it took me 270 videos to
actually you know make it big with nice
daily to get to uh you know to 4x
um in one day so so my overnight success
took 270 days every single day every
single weekend working and making that

[39:01]
single weekend working and making that
one minute video um
so i would say it's like you know like
deep down inside
like i knew this was
this is supposed to work from day one
but it took 270 days for it to actually
work um
how did you deal with the emotional
side of
creation and of the process like it's
it's very similar to entrepreneurs great
to this in his own entrepreneurial
journey the highs and lows the swings
are enormous and there's a high
incidence of depression i think among
entrepreneurs and among creators for
this reason because you have this daily
scorecard of your performance and when
you're posting something on facebook
every day and you thought it was amazing
and two people like it or in your case
you know 200 versus 2000 you're the only
person that really thought about that by
the way but it really does impact your
mood so how did you deal with that
emotional side of the of the process and
journey yeah the truth of the matter is
i i don't i don't deal with it it

[40:00]
i i don't i don't deal with it it
stresses the crap out of me and and
you're so right is very similar to
entrepreneurship like yesterday i
thought my company is going to be 10
billion today i think it's going to be a
failure you know like literally within
24 hours there's a 10 billion dollar
difference
every day when i was making those videos
if one video tanks
i say okay i lost my facebook page it's
gone it's dead forever and i had that
feeling 500 days out of a thousand
i'm not here to give any advice because
i suffer from this every day i do think
about getting a shrink i do think about
getting into like a mental hospital or
something um because it is you know it's
when you take content and
entrepreneurship at the same time you
know the highlight the highs and lows
are doubled
so
yeah here's another solution to it you
got to suck it up here's an idea
mental health hospitals for creators

[41:01]
mental health hospitals for creators
dude i completely agree i'm
i'm all in on that i i think it's i
think it's brilliant like
even just like a tailor-made um daily
video or something that you can click on
um when you're facing those very common
problems that creators all face like
hedonic treadmill you know
getting a thousand likes on a twitter
thread in the past for me was like holy
[ __ ] i just got a thousand likes on this
now a thousand likes i feel like holy
[ __ ] that's a dud why did i spend the
time to write that i'm useless i'm a
piece of [ __ ] yeah it's like dealing
with those daily things that's something
everyone deals with and you're again
you're it's such a personal journey and
you're the only one that thinks about it
so i i agree greg i think you could
build a
very simple uh mental health curriculum
with like little modules where you could
just click on that video of like
something to give you perspective on x y
or z plus
kind of peer-to-peer matching or like a
community yeah where you could talk with
other creators in real time about how

[42:01]
other creators in real time about how
you're dealing with that like our
whatsapp group
does is um is one of the most amazing
things because it's a it's a whatsapp
group that was put together by our
friend um sriram over at a16z and it has
just a bunch of amazing creators in it
across youtube twitter tiktok you know
instagram etc and people actually share
things they're struggling with on a
daily basis and then other people come
in and give them perspective on it or
you want to think about it
i asked one time how to deal with
negativity and everyone gave their
perspectives and it really helped me so
and that's how we connected
that that's how we connect exactly
that's how we connect it um and so
thinking about how you productize that
greg to your point i think okay i got
the idea you know the company i sorry i
gotta sorry i got the name i got the
name we're gonna register the name after
this as soon as so when this is live and
if anyone wants to work on this because
i think it would actually make the lives
of
creators a lot more healthy
and happy
and in turn hopefully make other people

[43:00]
and in turn hopefully make other people
happier and healthier so the name is
um
creatorsgeneralhospital.com
okay that's amazing i love that
we could bring in like i bet we could
bring in 10 or 15 creators as like part
owners of this by the way and you'd have
buy-in from people that could talk about
it with their audiences because creators
tend to have a lot of aspiring creators
in their audiences so the distribution
of it would actually be really easy
because you could just talk about it you
would know you had you know five percent
ownership or something of this company
we just need to find someone really good
to build it and run it yeah but i think
you you you cannot put hospital as a
trademark in the in the in the company
name i think uh it must it must be
reserved somewhere but actually a
similar company that's doing it is from
israel it's called better help no well i
like look i think that that is um i
think the thing that's really
interesting about this idea is that um
it's like this general framework that i
talk about often um of like the uh i

[44:00]
talk about often um of like the uh i
think it's like generally christensen's
model of disruptive innovation where you
you have a space that is massive in
mental health and you have
companies that are trying to serve the
entire spectrum of mental health that's
very hard because what happens is you
end up over-serving some customers under
serving others you're not providing the
perfect service to some people and so
what you'd focus on with this for
creators in particular is provide the
exact set of mental health services that
creators need and you'd go to creators
and figure out exactly like what are the
10 or 15 you know swings in emotion that
tend to happen whether it's too high or
too low
you know negativity on the platforms
whatever it is and you'd create simple
modules and simple products that would
allow you to feel better in those
moments
and then you'd pair it with community
because i think that that's a super
interesting thing that you and i nods
have seen is really powerful when you
when you have a community you can talk
to or rely on um and you'd figure out
basically how to provide that very
specific set of services and i don't

[45:01]
specific set of services and i don't
think it would be that hard to set up
actually as a company um and you could
be the creator mental health platform
very quickly and if you launched with
creators and partnership
as part owners of the company you could
probably get to scale pretty quickly as
well
there you go that's a 100 million dollar
idea
greg what do you think
um i love it i think what i like about
it too is it's it's
relatively simple to
to get going like it's just about
scoping
what are those nuanced
services that you need how do you ensure
that the mental health professionals
are high quality and can do the job and
it's just like a landing page really a
brand a great brand and a landing page
um yeah yeah and i think you go talk to
a hundred creators like go talk to 25
tick talkers 25 youtubers 25 twitter or
whatever and ask them what the you know
swings of emotion are give us like three

[46:01]
swings of emotion are give us like three
things that impact your daily mental
health as a creator um and then you go
you know partner with mental health
providers and and mental health doctors
who can um actually create the services
that would improve their lives and those
in those regards and then you you pair
it with communities so that people can
pop in and ask their questions or talk
to someone that's unbiased or even
anonymized um to help with those things
on a daily basis because i do think
there's going to be more and more people
it's a great macro trend there's more
and more people that are going to be
creators that are thinking these things
um
and people are going to feel this more
and more because we're in this world now
that is going to be increasingly digital
and so that connection um and the more
time you spend there the more negativity
you're going to face the more of this
like kind of highs and lows swings
you're going to face there's a pretty
interesting business to be built around
this yeah and i think uh there's a
social good angle too right you could do
like for every hour of mental health
help that the creator buys maybe you

[47:00]
help that the creator buys maybe you
give an hour to to
to someone who needs it who can't afford
it
that's interesting too
like a tom's shoes buy one get one thing
buy one give one rather
are you guys in the are you guys in the
like uh
uh like brainstorming phase in your
lives where you're looking for the next
company to build
i think we're always in that phase i um
i mean part of this show um is
ideating in real time basically giving
people
we called it where it happens which is a
play on the room where it happens and
basically give people a lens into
the kind of insight to idea to execution
journey that entrepreneurs founders
executors operators go through and so
democratizing access to the rooms where
these interesting conversations happen
and where ideas are created and and
formed um so part of it is literally

[48:01]
formed um so part of it is literally
this type of thing where we're on and
we're talking and we're like oh holy
[ __ ] that's an interesting idea let's go
down the rabbit hole a bit on it and
then we have a community set up in
discord
where we'll try to go deeper on those
things and where people are actually
trying to go start some of these ideas
that have come out of the world that's
smart how many companies have like
fun out of this so far
well we're only
what is this episode 10 greg
we're not very many episodes in we
launched the show um a few months ago so
there's actually i mean there's three
separate channels now built around
specific ideas that have come out of the
show and you have like people going and
doing research on different things that
are coming out of there the ultimate
vision is that we can create a fund
around the show that actually invests
behind these ideas um and you can kind
of seed them out where it's almost like
the show becomes a holding company of
sorts
that's great
yeah it's pretty interesting
um so tell us
before we run out of time i want to hear
more about nas academy

[49:00]
more about nas academy
as a company and so you did your creator
journey you had scaled massively you
know on facebook you then launched your
youtube and i think 2019 you've scaled
enormously on youtube as well i love
your video going to north korea by the
way it was [ __ ] awesome um
fascinating i watched it with my wife is
so so good um
i'm curious then how you kind of thought
about
jumping into building a business and um
maybe kind of you know slowing down some
of your creator output and focusing on
building equity and building a real
business that frankly enables a lot of
other creators to go and create what
they want to
so look here's the way i think about it
for any creators that are listening to
this
you have a shelf life that either the
market dictates or your mental health
dictates which is basically like say
five six years
you know even the algorithm on facebook
and youtube does not like you forever
right at some point the algorithm's best
interest is to recommend other creators
on the platform to keep it fresh

[50:01]
on the platform to keep it fresh
so you can never be the biggest creator
on facebook forever so your shelf life
is five six years um my when i was
reaching my shelf life which was roughly
year three for i was like [ __ ]
quick i gotta build a company so that i
need to build it for the next three
years so by the time i'm out of my shelf
life as a creator i have a billion
dollar company
you know so basically i'm using my
creator lifespan as a leverage to become
an entrepreneur
the last thing you want is to be caught
in a cycle two or too late then you'll
just be a husband as a creator and
you'll be a failed company as a company
so
um this is why i made the jump i've also
always dreamed of having an organization
that works when you're asleep the
problem with creation is that you're
when you're asleep there is no creation
but when you have a thousand people
working
you can still be productive 24 7.
um
and last but not least i think every

[51:00]
and last but not least i think every
creator is a business you're an
individual as a business you're a
business of one that's what a creator is
nothing else
so going from a business of one to a
business of 1 000 shouldn't be that
impossible uh so that's why we're taking
on that challenge as well
so these are the reasons why i decided
to start a company now the question is
why did i decide to start this specific
company
master class for creators
well
there's a need
nobody's teaching in the world greg i
don't think you're teaching sahil i
don't think you're teaching other than
those tweets
and you have knowledge
what the hell is you know what's what's
going on like your knowledge is really
highly privileged
it's only your friends in that whatsapp
group that can access that knowledge so
we really are on a mission to convince
as many creators as possible to
productize their knowledge and share it
with their audience and that's kind of
the idea behind nasa academy so both uh
sahel and i have done
a few of these cohort based courses

[52:00]
a few of these cohort based courses
and oh you did [ __ ] i assumed you're not
dj and
i just checked nazicon academy is it is
it cohort based or is it like recorded
and could you talk a little bit more
about
you know the best way for creators like
us to educate people
yeah so it's actually cohort based
recorded so that's the beauty of it it's
like hybrid so the problem with just
cohort base is that you need to be
teaching all the time every single
cohort you need to do the work
it doesn't scale with nasa academy it's
like it's recorded but the recordings
are only available at a certain time
this unlock at a certain time
finish at a certain time so every 100
students are put in one group
and they learn together there's a coach
assigned to them to make sure they all
meet each other and communicate with
each other and then they watch your
video files when they unlock every day
that's kind of the idea behind it so
it's a scalable way for creators to

[53:00]
it's a scalable way for creators to
teach in cohorts
so how would you like i'm familiar with
um like i think greg and i both did our
courses with maven um yeah which is sort
of the biggest platform now around like
the live cohort based courses
um
how does it work you know one of the
things maven i think has done really
really well is they actually teach
teachers how to be effective teachers
like you know the future digital
professors they do a course to teach
them how much training are you doing
around um like with the creators so that
the quality of the content and the
course that they're going and creating
the videos et cetera is exceptional
so i invested in maven and maven
invested in us so we're sister companies
basically um you know we love them i
love the gun and west they're incredible
people um and they've done something
amazing i think maven is specializing in
the live
we are specializing in the uh
pre-recorded uh but it's all cohort
based uh we actually do a lot of hand
holdings we have a curriculum team we
have a video editing team so we go to
your house sahil and basically we shoot

[54:01]
your house sahil and basically we shoot
you for two days we help you edit the
classes for very very very very cheap
and then we we put them out on the
internet on the marketplace setting of
nas academy so nas academy is not just
software to help you teach but it's also
giving you distribution think of it like
amazon and maven is like shopify
right
we're trying to build the destination
kind of like udemy and master class
while maven is building let's say the
infrastructure teachable and and in
shopify
so do you have does nas academy have
like an all-access pass in the way
master class does or is it self-serve
kind of individual courses
yeah so the problem with the self with a
with a class pass is that eventually
uh you lose control as a creator of your
class you have no incentive to teach in
nasa academy
because if you're bringing in one extra
user we we make all the money you know
forever
so that's why we're actually keeping it

[55:01]
so that's why we're actually keeping it
by purchase only we're enabling
subscription for you so you can
subscribe to sahil 20 a month to learn
from him
so it becomes like it's like a mix
between patreon and masterclass
basically
this is interesting
um super super interesting and then how
does that tie in for you as a business
to these summits that you're on
so we are you know nas means people in
arabic it just happens to be in my
nickname but nas means people in arabic
and uh we just want to build the people
company so nasa academy people's academy
now summit people's summit nas daily
people stories of people every day
um nas hotel you know nas fund
everything we just want to build nas
um
everything ties to everything you know
it's like a flywheel effect in the nas
summit we're bringing creators casey
neistat by the way is going to be the
keynote that's going to be very exciting
um you know we're trying to bring
creators together in physical settings

[56:00]
creators together in physical settings
just to make the tide rise for all boats
and we'll benefit a little bit but
you'll benefit the most and this also is
the same way we run us academy you make
most of the revenue we take a small cut
i love it i also i just love how it
overlays community into all of this
because i imagine
you know when you bring this many great
creators together they're all going to
be building they're going to start
collaborating on different things
they'll do videos together they'll be
working together you know there's just a
lot of interesting things that will then
trace chase their lineage back to the
summit that was happening in dubai or
whichever summit had had occurred
digitally or physically
exactly
we we just want to make interesting
people meet other interesting people
that's it nice uh
so yeah i was just gonna say um
just because we're running out of time
in a few minutes but
you know do you have any
five-year predictions
around where

[57:01]
around where
uh where creators are gonna go
like what does the future of creators
look like in five years according to nas
oh man that's a great question
well i want to say something
controversial what can i say
like if i say it will increase well
whoop they do sherlock holmes also
cancer
you know like
so of course it'll increase
i think the idea that you need to be a
video creator to be a creator is going
to be like not like it it will disappear
i think video creator is going to be
minority potentially like you could be
an nfc creator uh a 3d artist creator uh
so i think the definition of creator
will increase
from just vlogger to
nfd artist or even an engineer could
become a creator uh two i think they
will make a crap ton of money

[58:02]
will make a crap ton of money
uh i think you're gonna definitely see a
creator
well you see a creator a billionaire
i think you will
they're 100
yeah there will be a creator billionaire
i don't think it's going to be mr beast
by the way
um
i think what is that
i think they'll come from india
i think a lot of people
in india are like killing it but the
mainstream media in the united states
does not listen does not watch like
unacademy for example is a four billion
dollar company started by a youtuber
buy you by jews is the biggest
educational company in the world worth
15 billion dollars
who was started by
a teacher who started on youtube
so i i don't you know let's get out of
the u.s bubble a little bit
it's already happening so we're
definitely going to see a
youtuber who becomes a billionaire
in the next five years
the first youtuber creator billionaire

[59:01]
the first youtuber creator billionaire
will come from india you heard it here
first oh you should tweet that bro that
means i love that that's a great
i have a lot a lot of my audience is in
india because of my own heritage as well
but um that's a great prediction i think
it's an interesting one and i think your
prediction on
the kind of
dynamic
nature of what creators will look like
is a fascinating prediction as well greg
and i have talked about that in various
forms on the show
pseudonymous creators you know creators
that never show their face in any way um
in this digital world and as we
increasingly move towards living in and
caring more about our digital worlds and
our physical realities
um i think it's more and more going to
become the case i completely agree with
you
yeah that's exciting but the problem is
you're we're not we're not uh building
for that world you're not building for
that world we're we're still uh
videographer actually are you a video
creator would you say you're a video we
post videos around this show like this
video will be posted um and we do half

[1:00:01]
video will be posted um and we do half
the episodes live in person and so that
we can post videos but i wouldn't
consider myself a video creator yet just
because of the scale of my reach there
is so low relative to on twitter
um eventually i hope to be um i don't
know
i don't know if i'm
what's that how's your tinder game that
dictates if you have uh you know my
tinder game is zero i've been married
for five years so you're gonna try to
get me in trouble here i've got a baby
on the way
my tinder game is non-existent if my
wife is listening non-existent
that's great
[Laughter]
um
no this was awesome man i
i'm super appreciative of your time i
know it's late on your end as well i
hope i can make it over to one of these
events um and if not we need to just do
more together i feel like there's a ton
of energy alignment around all of these
things and um the future is very very
bright for what you're building so i'm
i'm excited to to watch your journey
