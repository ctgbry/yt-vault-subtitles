people are listening to this on audio
get on YouTube because
you're wearing sunglasses I think you're
the first person on the show to wearing
sunglasses
I feel today I felt like bringing the
heat uh
and I felt that I had these glasses and
I was like I feel like the glasses give
me a little bit of a mood for my day
um
and so I was like you know what I'm
gonna bring the [ __ ] heat today I'm
gonna wear the glasses I'm wearing them
everywhere and tonight I'm going to talk
at USC and I'm gonna wear them there too

[01:02]
at USC and I'm gonna wear them there too
all right well
as much as I brought you on here for
your fashionista Vibes which are a plus
the number one reason I brought you on
is you are
a wealth of knowledge a Fountain of
Knowledge when it comes to creators
there's a shift between thought leaders
being on a pedestal talking down to you
to now thought leaders talking directly
to you at eye level get closer to
yourself put blinders on listen to your
own intuition and follow that not to go
and find the person that I think that I
am but to get close to the person that I
know that I've always been by letting go
of the parts of me that I know that I'm
not
how to build audiences how to build
businesses on top of it I want to talk
to you about it
thank you I appreciate that and yeah I'm
excited to talk about that
maybe we can start with
what are you seeing on Tick Tock to
start with like what are some accounts
that are are blowing up like what are

[02:00]
that are are blowing up like what are
Trends on Tick Tock a lot of people here
want to create an account wanna go viral
uh algorithm changing all the time what
are you seeing out in the transit
trenches
um
I think uh
the first thing that I always go to is
is storytelling because I I I I don't
like to encourage people to do Trends
because I think that Trends are fleeting
that's not Trends are not a sustainable
model for people to use in perpetuity
and so I always lean on tell your
stories like tell your tell your own
life story tell the challenges that
you've been through or particularly
because I think the people that are
listening to this are entrepreneurial or
business minded tell your company story
talk about the things that you're going
through or the way that you got to where
you are or the ideas that got you to
even starting the product
um
it's it's just so hard to it's so hard

[03:02]
it's it's just so hard to it's so hard
for to find longevity when you're just
following the trend of the day and
that's what Tick Tock and that's how
Tick Tock became popular was literally
what's popping today trends of the day
and it's just hard it's just really hard
to consistently follow that
um so I highly recommend people to lean
into something that's way more
sustainable and actually cuts through
the noise which is Original Stories
so would you recommend people just like
how would you what are Frameworks or
ways to think about how to pull stories
out of people because we all have
stories great question great question I
even I even like
wrote out what I would deem the actual
formula for a video I went back and
looked at about 150 videos that had
worked for either for me in the past or
had worked for other people that I liked
that it seems like
the linear progression of a story which
is which very well correlates to the

[04:01]
is which very well correlates to the
narrative Arc of an actual story and
child like that children read
some sort of intro which I call a hook
that captivates captivates the audience
then there's some sort of setting
then there's a conflict
and then the conflict gets resolved
and then there's a call to action
so like literally if you take those five
things I'll I'll say it in kind of tick
tock or I even would say short form
because majority of the content now is
works on every any platform but a hook a
setting a conflict a resolution and a
call to action those are the five things
that I think uh I try to incorporate in
my videos and I think the call to action
is dependent on what the video is there
doesn't need to be a hard sell it could
just be like I hope this helps it could
be no wishing you a great day it could
be something that easy but I I people
people consume with their emotions
and when you create stories it's able to

[05:00]
and when you create stories it's able to
get people involved emotionally
um and that's what you want that's what
you gets people to actually care about
what you're doing
so that's the formula that I try to
follow in a lot of my videos
so what you're saying is
it's almost like ignore the trends for
now just focus on writing really good
stories start by writing and then how do
you think of you know once I've written
several stories how do you think about
filming
Etc the way that I the the actual like
in the weeds uh process that I think
everybody should try and do to make it
the easiest on themselves is first write
out what you're going to say
then go and record it on your like voice
notes
so go into a an audio only draft then
once you have that audio draft go and
look at the words that you're saying in
the video and think about is there any

[06:00]
the video and think about is there any
archival footage any camera roll footage
any things that I have that are on
Google any articles that I was in any
footage that correlates to the words
that I'm saying in this story
and then go and place it over it
um
and then outside of that so once you
have that that'll get you to probably
you probably have like you know 40 of
the video will be archival footage
things from the past
and then you look at the other words
that are like that's a lot of filler
content like I was sitting there you
don't have a you might not have a video
of you sitting on your camera roll so
you go and film those filler ones and
then that at the end of you filling the
filming those filler ones now you have a
compiled video that is completed with
the audio only file b-roll filler
content and then I go a step further and
add text over top of it that's not
necessary you could honestly do the auto
text that's on Tick Tock and Instagram
and all those that just works just fine
but that's the formula

[07:00]
but that's the formula
and how do you think about
a brand account versus a personal
account
meaning
if I'm a brand
like yeah you know what's the expression
people follow people not Brands so how
do you think about
um to me it's the same yeah I think you
I think you Brands need to act more like
human beings
for them to build followings
um they need to they need we need to
they need to relate to
to people
because that's who's consuming it
um we don't go on social media and have
a so in and have a a brand only social
media platform and a person only social
media platform you're in the same
playing field as every other person in
the world and every other company in the
world
you have to be able to cut through that
noise
um just showing your product here's the
way that here's the way that I think
people think about it versus brands when
people make content

[08:00]
people make content
they're not selling as much because they
don't have a product to sell they're
just like putting their [ __ ] out there
they're putting their content out there
hoping that somebody likes it ideally
somebody does companies have a product
that they've worked hard on so they
approach content uh in a way of we have
the best product in the market we gotta
sell this people need to know about it
let's push it out there and force it on
onto people's uh for you Pages or
timelines
then as consumers when you see that
you're you immediately want to swipe
past it because you're like what is this
like this is I'm here to watch things
that actually provide me value not to
get sold to if I want to get sold to I'd
go walk in the mall or go on Amazon my
Amazon app or let you know things like
that so
immediately it's an easy way for people
to just want to click to the next
that's why the companies that think
about who they're making the content for
and actually provide that end user value
or the ones that are able to build
audiences so I think you need to be

[09:01]
audiences so I think you need to be
thinking more like a person does
what's a non-obvious example of a brand
doing really well on short form
Bose
really Bose yeah Bose on Tick Tock does
a unique
so it's easy for me to use something
like Duolingo it's easy to use big ones
like that I think somebody that does a
really good job a company that does a
really good job by creating original
content that's contextual to the
platform that is entertaining to watch
and fits in the culture this Bose they
make these original videos that are
humorous that look almost like
infomercials but they're not
infomercials and they're like playing on
the fact that they're bringing
infomercials to tick tock and but
they're very gen z-ish and they just do
a really good job of creating and
understanding the context and
understanding the platform so that's a
good example for you guys to look up go
scroll down a little if it's not popping
right now and look at some of the videos
that have and it's like

[10:01]
that have and it's like
it's not trying they're not trying to be
the coolest people in the world they're
like they're they're understanding the
humor of gen Z the lingo the culture how
Tick Tock works and they're getting
people to stop and pay attention
that's right yeah and they've got
they've got a lot of views like I'm
looking at their pinned
uh pin videos like 1.1 million 2 million
2.7 so something's working and that's a
big big company now let me go smaller
company for a lot of people that are
listening I think the best for me for a
lot of for a lot of smaller companies
that are listening to this I think the
best company in the world right now at
doing content is midday squares I don't
think there's anybody that comes even
close to them
um in terms of Storytelling in an
organic way and knowing the end consumer
and understanding the context of the
platforms
um they invest heavily into their
content they know that it's something
that's going to drive the business and I
I don't see any other brands taking it

[11:02]
I don't see any other brands taking it
as serious as them
and that's why they're disrupting that
industry that's why they're making a
dent
um is because people see their content
and go oh [ __ ] when is this and then
they back it up with having a good
product and I think that those two
things together are a recipe for some
real damage and that's what people
should be looking at
so Nick's aldarelli who's uh the CEO has
been on the show before I grew up with
those guys so uh oh cool are you
Canadian all right yeah I am nice that's
awesome yeah so
they've basically gone from zero to
almost 20 million a year in revenue on
their chocolate bar which is highly
competitive category right so they
started that and it's like how do you
compete against Hershey's
um and some of these Brands like you
have to
stand out and
they've thought about what's really
interesting about midday squares I think
is

[12:00]
is
when you buy a midday square like at the
back of the package like you see the
founders faces then it feels like it
feels like
you're you know
you're kind of I guess they're what I'm
trying to say is they're a creator-born
brand from the start it's in their DNA
yeah but the interest but the the caveat
to that is they weren't creators
they turned themselves into creators
because they understood what would
happen if they did and how that could be
such a um such ammunition to what they
were trying to accomplish and it's paid
off really nicely and I think that a big
thing that I think I think that that is
the play I think for majority of people
especially with what we're seeing today
the creator-led brands that are popping
with feastables and things that I'm a
Chamberlain's coffee and all that that
are like that that come into the market
and immediately disrupt it's because
they already have an audience because
people like them as human beings and as
creators so I think that companies that

[13:00]
creators so I think that companies that
are starting today or even companies
that aren't starting companies that are
out of place right now where they're
trying to disrupt the easiest way for
you to disrupt is to actually get people
to genuinely care about what you're
doing then I go what's the easiest way
to do that how do you get somebody to
care about it's not going to be going
and
standing around at a mall it's gonna be
going where everybody's consuming that
is our phones that is social media that
are the FL that is the platforms that
we're on in spending majority of our
days on our majority of our time on and
learning how to execute there so I think
the companies that really understand
content will be the ones that disrupt
the most granted you have to have a
product that backs it up but for the
most part I think that the biggest play
to even get your foot in the door is
through content
I'll tell you the story of the company
before midday square is that went
nowhere which cool obviously isn't
talked about so I actually had an idea
for a Candle Company focused on men I

[14:00]
for a Candle Company focused on men I
chatted about it with
um this guy Casey Carls who's Jake
carls's uh brother Leslie and Jay Carl's
started midday squares with Nick
and basically I bought a third of the
company and Jake was the CEO of the
company and and the other two-thirds
were owned by the Carl's we spent a
bunch of money on this like really funny
video that was supposed to be the launch
of it right it was around the time this
is like 20 I don't know 16 or 17.
um it was around the time where it was
like kickstarters were really big and
the idea was if you could have like a
really funny video It's Gonna spread
across the internet so we spent all this
time building this this video all this
energy posted it got no sales
and through that I think Jake learned
that it's not about spending
you know creating one video a year
basically it's about creating one video
an hour

[15:01]
an hour
and building a brand for yourself
close that company
then they did midday squares and I think
it's interesting yeah that's the story
of that it's it totally makes sense to
me because it's very in line with the
brands that we work with or that we get
on conversations with that are like how
do we go viral
and for me virality is such a fleeting
thing for people
because one going viral a single time
for something that you don't actually
care about is actually detrimental to
your business into your algorithm as a
platform because now all of your new
content is going to be shown to that
audience that isn't the actual audience
that you're trying to go after so that's
one thing but second is the real
relationships that you're trying to
build with your community aren't built
in one video they aren't built from the
single video that the person saw they're

[16:01]
single video that the person saw they're
built from the videos that they see
after that one video the smaller ones
that don't pop off that you think didn't
do anything because they got four five
six seven thousand views but they
trickled into the people that now
actually care about you and those are
the community that you're trying to
really build with
and that's the way that I look at it and
that's why I was posting three times a
day for a while on Tick Tock because the
videos that would not pop would be the
ones that people would message me and be
like yo I really filled this one this
one actually impacted me and those are
the people that will show up to meet up
or will buy the product
virality is something that I think
confuses a lot of people
um and so that totally makes sense to me
yeah I mean my first question was
basically to you on this interview was
how to go viral and I kind of half
expected you to be like
you shouldn't want yeah you shouldn't
want to go viral like virality is a bad
word in our world
yeah you know you want to go viral
when

[17:00]
when
as a byproduct you have
yeah exactly virality as a byproduct
virality as a byproduct of putting out
the content you genuinely want to put
out is a home run
virality as a means of just saying you
went viral
is I don't know what's an analogy for
something that's terrible that can ruin
your business
I mean it's bad PR
yeah it's just not it's just it's just
not where I think people should be
thinking I I look at it like this here's
the way I look at all content
it's a relationship
when you go and you meet people when you
move to a new city and you're trying to
make friends you don't hang out with
somebody one time and be like we're the
best of friends you're gonna be in my
wedding I love you I'll show up anywhere
it takes time you have to put in
repetitions
you have to communicate you have to have
like-minded interests you have to care
for that person you have to like you
have to build that's the same thing as
an audience we get on conversations with
people they're like look we have a month

[18:00]
people they're like look we have a month
and a half where our team is investing
we're ready to go if this doesn't work
in a month and a half though our CFO or
our team is we're pulling this we're not
doing Tick Tock anymore not doing
Instagram anymore we need content to
work ASAP I'm I look at it I'm like this
you need to build for you need to build
for years you need to be building for a
long period of time
you're trying to build relationships
well it's the same it's it's very
similar to like how SEO works you know
SEO isn't something that you know you
change a few meta tags on your website
and all of a sudden you're gonna get a
hundred thousand people to your website
tomorrow
you invest in SEO because I mean you
literally use the word invest because
when you know you're constantly climbing
up the rankings for these keywords that
work and that you want and then at a
certain point you're just you know 12
months from now sitting on a beach and
people are just showing up to your
website regardless and that's the same
thing with social in general which is

[19:02]
thing with social in general which is
people have this expectation that you
know I don't get a hundred thousand
Twitter followers and I'll get a hundred
thousand Instagram followers this you
know this video doesn't get a million
views or a hundred thousand views or
even a thousand views I should just like
quit
and like the way I see it is it's very
much like r d marketing r d
you should look at it as like I have a
mark you know with r d you set a budget
18 months 24 months let's go figure out
an invention or let's go experiment
that's the exact same way people should
look at being a Creator and creating
content is it's r d you figure out
like what content works why it works
while you're building the product
um and then hopefully you don't go viral
on day one hopefully you go viral on
month 14. love it completely agree
am I hired at your company yeah
welcome what what does your company do
um so we're we're all things content but

[20:00]
um so we're we're all things content but
the things that we specialize in is
short form organic so we'll either
consult on your current scene that you
already have and we'll teach you guys
how to improve your videos write stories
create the content in-house uh for
select few we don't do this for
everybody for a select few will actually
edit the content ourselves like we'll
take your story we'll make it ourselves
um and hand it back to you and then the
second kind of area that we work on is
we go into companies and build their
content arm for them so it's really hard
to find creators that want to come and
work for companies what do people do
when they try and find people that they
want to hire they go on LinkedIn they go
on indeed they search content creator
I'm a content creator I know a thousand
content creators not one of them would
go and put their job profile on LinkedIn
or or on upwork and be looking for jobs
there so it's just not the they don't
you don't find creators in that same
typical way that you would find other
employees you find them through the
platforms and so what I've done is
started making videos talking about is

[21:00]
started making videos talking about is
there anybody on here that would want to
work for a company that would actually
want to go in and run their account and
not like one video a month or two videos
a month like an influencer like
literally you're with their team every
day making content or every couple days
making contact
lo and behold I got 1500 people
overnight that wanted to do that now
that's turned into seven thousand so we
have like a database of these creators
that want to go and work with companies
so we'll go into we will go into
businesses and actually employ these
people like we'll we'll introduce them
to the team the team will hire to the
company the company will hire them
um as contractors or as employees and
then we'll work with them to like get
set up and like make sure that they're
good and then that person will go and
run the account make content for the
business
um manage it Community manage
um and now we're and we'll continue to
just kind of build on that so we'll now
we're kind of starting to do where we'll
find a creative director that will help
with ideas for that company too
sometimes we'll do a little social media
manager we'll help with just the posting
but they're not actually filming as much

[22:00]
but they're not actually filming as much
so all things content
um within companies
and
like what's an example of a company that
you work with and like what have you
done with them uh super coffee
so I mean companies that we found
creators for we found big and small
we've found we've done that kind of like
internal recruiting for big companies
like Nissan Sketchers Best Western
uh but also smaller companies not
smaller necessarily or smaller but not
the smallest poppy super coffee belly
Welly
um a lot of cpg ones like that
um almond cow
um so all different sizes I would say
our biggest criteria is cpg Le or New
York based Health a little bit better
for you or impact driven
um is like the criteria that I think we
specialize in but we go across the board
super coffee we did both edited content

[23:00]
super coffee we did both edited content
for them help them build out their
storylines if you ever see any of their
videos where their Founders are talking
about how they built the business how it
happened in their college dorm
we like storyboard that come up with the
storyline The Arc of it film it edit it
hand it back to them
um and then we find them we found them a
Creator too who does more man on the
street stuff so he'll go and interview
people
um
talk to people at schools talk to people
around the city that they're located in
so yeah do you ever
okay so I run in I run multiple agencies
and
as someone who runs agencies
every agency owner asks themselves
should I be Building Product
constantly right so in your case
um
could should you be creating a cpg brand
like if you are able to build a lot of
attention on social it's like all the
only missing piece that you have is

[24:02]
only missing piece that you have is
what is the product and the operational
arm to it right like the actual like
manufacturing fulfillment like at the
midday Square guys how hard it like how
hard it is to do that they built a a
factory factory
um yeah but you know does that interest
you at all like yeah I will do that to a
studio yeah I will do that
um
the thing the the long-term plan for me
will be to build my audience as a
Creator to the point where I feel like
it has the leverage to launch a product
through it and the product that I will
launch through it will be purely based
off of the community and their needs and
the things that they feel like need to
be innovated so if my audience continues
to be creators or people in the creative
world that are business-minded that are
trying to get into content and they're
like we hate our tripods or we hate our
you know ring lights
um and I have an audience that's a big
enough size and I feel like that the

[25:00]
enough size and I feel like that the
market needs to be disrupted I will go
into research and development and build
a product to fit that need and then
that's what I'll launched through my
audience I don't have the I don't feel
compelled to do that yet because one I
think you need to have a bigger audience
than I have and I'm not saying that I
have a small one but I just think you
need multiple hundreds of thousands on
multiple platforms to really have that
be the be an um immediate distribution
to make a dent so I see this I'm seeing
there's a lot of creators that I know
personally and just the way that they're
launching products and doing it well I
think you need I think you need a
sizable number so I'm building towards
that and then when I get there uh I'll
launch products through it and the
agency arm that we have right now of all
content and stuff will
not transition into working for that
brand but it will really help it will be
the thing that kind of like Powers a
quick Interruption from me if you're
listening to this on Apple podcast or
Spotify you're getting any value you

[26:02]

thank you enjoy the rest of the show
what are some
non-obvious creators
like personal creators not bows like
people that are the future Mr Beast or
Emma chamberlains of the world that
you're like
well you know let me keep a tab on that
Creator because like they're gonna be
doing big things the future Mr Beast I
think is the future of Mr Beast I think
is really hard because Mr Beast is more
of an anomaly that people think

[27:01]
of an anomaly that people think
um explain so many yes so many creators
and so many business
folk think that there will be more Mr
Beast and that the next kid coming up is
gonna be the next Mr Beast Mr Beast is
is is literally an anomaly the amount of
work that he puts in what he's built
what he's been able to achieve and the
timing that he's been able to do it
um have all created a perfect storm for
him I think that there will be the next
sizable person like Mr Beast won't be in
the style of him at all it'll be
completely different because he's
created a whole wave of this fast cut
um attention span kind of error that I
think now there's so many smaller
creators that ever trying to replicate
it that I think it will almost
burn it out and I think the next style
will be something completely different
um that somebody will build through so

[28:02]
um that somebody will build through so
there I don't think there will be
another Mr Beast of his size plus the
business that he has behind it with the
team that he has is a bunch of savages
they're incredible at what they do
um and so I I just think that he's an
anomaly so people that I think that you
are that individuals should look at I
really think that female lifestyle
influencers and creators will build
enormous businesses because
women support each other more than men
do women buy into other women's content
way more than men buy into other men's
contact in women lifestyle creators show
a lot more than business people do so
inherently the relationship that they
have With Their audience is deeper
if you pair a lifestyle Creator in the
in a female Niche with a business minded
individual that wants to come in and
help them really build I think we will

[29:00]
help them really build I think we will
see a lot of companies come through that
that will do damage and I'll give you an
example of one that's doing that right
now it's Bloom nutrition Bloom
supplements with Mari Llewellyn I think
her last name is Mari has built a big
audience then built a supplement company
around greens that helped her throughout
her journey of Health and Wellness
um now they are in Walmart disrupting
the whole category in Walmart Nationwide
and it's all done through her own
personal
accounts and through them building a
community around her and her life
um so I think that she does a great job
and again it's it's pairing that creator
with smart business people her husband
and their team are smart people my
fiance is another good example she's
done a great job of building she
launched her own Fitness platform
they're bawling they're doing really
really well I have I am not part of that
at all so I can't take any credit but

[30:00]
at all so I can't take any credit but
she just documents she shows her life
people care about that and women support
women and I I think that there will be a
lot more people like that realm that'll
be more realistic I have a quick story
about that actually so right before I
uh clicked record on this my girlfriend
asked me hey who are you interviewing
for the Pod and then I said your name
and then and then she goes
oh I've seen that guy because I am a
subscriber to
um
I'm subscribed to the to your wife's
platform
that's awesome tell her thank you
um yeah it's been I mean I'm proud I'm
really proud of her it's been really
cool to see her build
um she does a fantastic job of
cultivating community in that same in
that same realm of just like putting in
repetitions and it not being an
overnight thing like she's been doing
this for probably six years now seven
years now and she was creating content
like she wasn't selling anything for a

[31:01]
like she wasn't selling anything for a
long time for sure yeah she was fir she
first was she was creating content on
Instagram then on YouTube and then she
was on a platform called
um
uh fit plan so she was a trainer on fit
plan and then she realized wait a minute
I would like to actually start my own
things and she started her own thing and
now it's doing well and now they're
branching into different
um Realms of actual tangible goods
rather than just a an app
um but they're doing a good job and they
and that's an example of like a another
female that I think has built community
and then leverage that to build products
through so I I think that we'll see a
lot more people in that world
rather than the anomalies of somebody
like a Mr Beast
but when you say like lifestyle female
lifestyle like what does that really
mean right like you have to
don't you have to Niche down a little
bit
lifestyle is a niche health and
lifestyle is a niche people follow

[32:01]
lifestyle is a niche people follow
people follow people literally just to
see what their morning routine looks
like and what they do during their day
and what they're eating and what the the
stuff that is mundane to you and I is
interesting in to some people somewhere
so like when I say to get more
particular when I say lifestyle
what I mean directly is probably a
little more Health and Wellness skewing
Health and Wellness
creators individuals bloggers YouTubers
whatever
um and the reason why I think that they
do a good job is because typically most
health and wellness creators have
struggled with something in their life
that has led them to this journey of
health and wellness and they share that
and so the audience buys into that and
then the audience goes on the journey
with them
which is the same formula that I think
businesses should follow
literally talk about most people start
with a pain Point most people start with

[33:00]
with a pain Point most people start with
building their company because some
should happen to them or a friend of
theirs or their kid they saw something
they start with a pain point they
realize something needs to change and
they go and they take action and then
they get to that point where they're
making change on that that's the kind of
things that I think people should really
be talking about and documenting the
same way these health and wellness
creators do because that's what gets
people to actually buy into the mission
and want to support it
um so that's what I'm trying that's what
I try to do in my content is just like
show people what I'm doing and talk
about it and
actually listen to them and if there's
anything that they would want to see
more of I try and provide more of that
yeah I think
I want to emphasize one point you said
which is
really start with the mission right like
if you you start with the mission you be
consistent about content
you find your own voice in terms of the
type of content that you know you create
you use this uh
uh Arc narrative that you talked about
earlier

[34:00]
earlier
and then you just show up every day you
know I I like to say like
you know obviously you know Gary
vaynerchuk his jab jab hook model I'm
kind of like I believe in the jab jab
jab jab jab jab jab bottle you know you
just keep jabbing and giving value
um and give value give value give value
all around this mission
um
and lifestyle and if you keep doing that
over time you're gonna understand a lot
of these pain points then you'll be able
to build stuff for those pain points
fully agree
um
yeah but I I think it's continuing to
just give and then ask
and then ask which I think is actually
Gary's which is actually I think the end
of his thing is rather than give give
take I think it's ask
um
yeah
in terms of uh

[35:00]
in terms of uh
just going back to Mr Beast I had a
friend of mine sent me something really
interesting I'm curious your perspective
on
he said that he had analyzed the top 1
000 best performing Mr Beast tick tocks
across the platform every month and
found that
15 months ago the average length of
these videos was 28 seconds it is now 40
seconds a 43 increase feels like a it
feels a lot like 2017 YouTube when the
YouTube algorithm started pushing videos
with higher
uh avd average video duration what do
you think about that
I don't know longer content or yes for
sure yes for sure yes but longer meaning
what like I do I think that people just
want to sit for 35 40 minutes no do I
think people are when I think people
really are craving right now is
content that doesn't
make them have a huge spike in their

[36:02]
make them have a huge spike in their
dopamine and be like an addicting every
three seconds they're seeing something
new that's popping up so I that's why I
think that they're that's why I think
that the videos are
going a little bit longer now because
people are keeping in more pauses and
more ums and less like the formula for
the past while has been cut out
everything that isn't fast-paced bad end
noise add in uh text so that your eyes
are going and following it all over and
you're never able to click away
um I think that us as consumers will
crave more
I don't even want to say still less but
just more slower paced content
um and so that would be my take on that
I don't think that Jimmy and their team
is making content longer just for the
sake of making it longer I think it's
probably the videos that they're doing
now are probably needing and requiring
that length for them to make a cut
um rather than it being a shorter one

[37:00]
um rather than it being a shorter one
with just the videos that they're doing
now
um
yeah let's keep going
um
if you're a Creator and you want to get
started on or if you if you want to do
if you want to do short form like what's
your creator stack because there is in
terms of like what tools do you use
yeah when you're working with brands
um besides the obvious Tick Tock
Instagram whatever yeah that but that's
just the distribution to on the actual
back end uh the ideas start in my notes
and then when I and I'm just writing
things that pop in my head all day
then they go from my notes to notion
which is where we have everything that's
actually stored and housed so then they
actually get formulated a little bit
deeper in notion with the team and then
once they're in notion
um which is where the script will come
from all usually either film that script

[38:00]
from all usually either film that script
looking into the camera or I will voice
over or voice note
um that script in My Voice Memos app on
my phone
um
that gets uploaded to the cloud uh this
is iCloud drive so me and my this is
actually something I haven't shared with
anybody this is actually like this is
some [ __ ] that I think people need to
think more of
um rather than using a Google drive or
Dropbox or anything like that me and my
video team have a shared iCloud so on
your actual iPhone when you're filming
you can save rather than uploading it
anywhere you can save to files which you
could have a collaborative folder in so
when I film a video I save it to there
that goes immediately onto my editor's
computer so as soon as I'm done I text
him that it's in that folder you can
even send a link
um and then he gets to work on it so I
go I have voice notes
um if I'm actually editing the video
myself I'm doing it in cap cut so I have

[39:02]
myself I'm doing it in cap cut so I have
cap cut on my phone I have cap cut on my
computer that's the platform that I edit
most of my content in my editor is using
Final Cut or Adobe Premiere I'm not a
computer guy I do literally 100 of my
edits are from my phone so anything
you've ever seen that from me hasn't
been done on a phone
um so I'll edit on cap cut and then the
way that I do and then if I'm writing
anything out like for LinkedIn it's
using later that's the tech platform
that I'm using for that it's scheduling
um and then and then I distribute so
that's usually what I do I film
everything on my camera I don't film on
Tick Tock I don't film my cap cut for
the most part it's all filmed on my
camera
brought into these platforms edited
voice over compiled together and then
uploaded what you're watching right now
is the day in the life of a Creator who
runs his own company in Los Angeles and
loves doing it the goal of all that you
see me doing is to help people like
yourself realize that you can build a
business around the things that you're
interested in by making contact and so

[40:00]
interested in by making contact and so
that's what we do I have a great little
team we use notion and I've got to give
myself the best chance of success like
using this tripod which you guys need to
check out and then I jump on meetings I
wouldn't want it any other way I love
connecting with people and I'm super
grateful for it midday break about
content I created a workflow to upload
things to an editor so I'm not doing it
all but I will bore you with that and
then back to meetings for a couple hours
did I mention that I don't eat anything
until about 3 pm I intermittent fast I
love it I just do coffee and build out
three the answer Summer's boss is on
LinkedIn answer a few more emails and
then when the Sun goes down I try to
turn my lights down as well and how long
does it usually take from beginning to
end to create a video really depends on
the video like if you look at a lot of
my tick tocks a lot of my tick tocks is
literally just talking to the camera
those take the amount of time for me to
say the words and then Auto caption them
so those some of them legitimately take
me 15 to 17 minutes total with
captioning right hosting but you but you
most know like most of them know most of
the ones on Tick Tock because it's just
a very off the cuff
not needing to be

[41:01]
not needing to be
kind of formed as much uh platform those
are literally just thought comes to me I
say it done so those ones can take you
know let's say 30 minutes on average
the ones that you're singing now that
are very story and more produced where
there's multiple clips over top of it
visuals text all of that right now I
would say the average is about two hours
for one of those videos
that's from me to do the voice over then
to find the be the thing that takes the
most time is finding the visuals I could
do the voiceover pretty quickly that
takes me about 15-20 minutes but going
and finding visuals will be the
challenge that most people will come
across so we've built actually we built
out a whole library now of b-roll so all
footage of me doing everyday activities
to put over top of these clips so that I
don't have to go and refilm them every
day and I can pull from them
um and reuse them in little mundane
moments of our of our content
um but that usually was what takes the

[42:00]
um but that usually was what takes the
longest time and then I would say that
the rest of it comes a little bit
quicker probably about two and a half
hours two hours is the length that it's
taking for one of those
did you ever use any insights tools like
I use vid IQ I'm an investor in vid IQ
but it I still use it it's it's I like
vid IQ yeah
I don't you can tell me if you don't
like it by the way yeah you know no no I
do like it we use we worked with it IQ
that was another brand we found a
creator for
okay
um so I I like vid IQ
um I'm a fan for anything that shows you
deeper insights I don't I don't value
metrics
um like like real deep metrics as
heavily as I value my own intuition so I
look at the content and see rather than
looking at the number and being like oh
they dropped off at 30 seconds I need to
change that I look at it and I'm like do
I feel like genuinely my audience is is
feeling this video as a whole do I feel
like the intro or this so I don't look

[43:02]
like the intro or this so I don't look
at analytics as deeply and and look at
it as truth I get I look at it as like
it gives me a little bit more info later
that platform that I was just telling
you about gives you analytics on the
back end of it so we'll look at that for
LinkedIn we'll look it up for some
Instagram stuff I'll look at my
Instagram insights I'll look at
linkedins giving you better analytics
now natively on the platform so I'll
look at those
um Tick Tock same thing but I've I I can
feel it in my body honestly I feel it
when I know if things are hitting
um based off of comments and the way
that I feel when I'm putting out the
video I can feel when it's like oh we're
gonna we're in a rhythm
um and on the flip side of that I can
feel when it's not and I'm like we're
putting out content right now but it's
not really working
um so yeah I base it off of that more
I'm the same way I feel like
I probably like if you were to ask me
exactly like what's the breakdown of
this podcast and you know in terms of
like demographics you know I I probably

[44:00]
like demographics you know I I probably
wouldn't be able to tell you but when
people are like tweeting at me and I
love this episode and you know then I
really
like I feel like I've done a good job
um
the numbers for me don't equate to us
loving a video like
on my team if we have a video that has a
million views and it really really
popped off I'm not looking at that and
being like we need to do every video
like this because again in that same
thing like I want it to affect the core
people that I want to be in my community
not necessarily just reach millions and
millions of people so what I look for
more is like how did we feel with this
video when we put it up and do the
people that are replying to us that
we're hearing from that were getting
feedback from do are they the people
that we care about getting that feedback
from and if I get feedback from my
actual core demo then I'm like oh [ __ ]

[45:02]
actual core demo then I'm like oh [ __ ]
this was impactful if I'm getting
feedback from somebody that's like yo I
saw your video and it's like you're not
the person that I necessarily am looking
at as being somebody that's a consumer
I'm like cool that's awesome that it
reached you but that doesn't change
that's not like changing the way that
we're going into execution I want to end
uh I want to end on on this your your
four favorite creators who are they and
why in terms of creators I really think
a good example that people need to look
at is Tim giusiano
temperaturesiano is a dude that does uh
everyday kind of Casey neistat style
Vlogs on tick tock
um and has built a big Community through
that and is just a hell of a dude
um and I really like him
the majority of them are like family
creators the next one I would say is uh
Daniel ciong with his family
s-e-o-n-g life l-i-f-e it's young life

[46:02]
s-e-o-n-g life l-i-f-e it's young life
it's literally him his wife and their
kids in Irvine California a document
just showing things that they do in
their life and giving out tips about how
they parent and what they do for their
days and stuff like that
um I gravitate more towards feel good
content like those than like heavy
hitter
uh Mr B style content that's like really
entertaining and engaging in like fast
paced I gravitate more towards the
content that I watched and it makes me
feel like the way I want to feel in my
day
uh or makes me feel like a better person
um
so those two people I really like
um
let's think of let me try and think of a
YouTube creator that I really like
um
YouTube I really like Colin and Samir I
think that they're great at what they do
um it's it I I pull a lot of my own
inspiration from their uh kind of

[47:03]
inspiration from their uh kind of
educational informational style of
making information tangible and
digestible and cool
um and they're both really good dudes
too
um so I like them a lot I think that
they do a really good job
in terms of like mass mass viral
somebody that I think will build big as
well will be Ryan Trahan
um who's another dude that's signed to
the same management team as Mr Beast and
I think he's got chops I think he's got
a real personality that people should
look into but dude honestly majority of
the content creators that I really like
and that I kick it with are smaller
than I've and I have like real Niche
Community it's Matt Choi a runner in
Austin that has this huge running
Community now
um just by showing himself hating
running and getting into running and I'm
in that same process I hate running
right now he's making me want to get
into more
um but just I look for authenticity I
look for people that's relatable that's

[48:01]
look for people that's relatable that's
going back to like that's a mission
relatable Mission Check Yes exactly
um so yeah I I follow those kind of
people that like just make me feel good
that make me in a world in a world of
content that wants you to just be
addicted to your phone I follow people
that I I spend the most time
intentionally following people that I
feel like add value to my day
um and so yeah those are some of the
people that I like
someone should build like a a product
hunt for this like for feel good
uh up and coming
creators uh who are doing cool things
and building businesses on top of
uh on top of them that you can get
involved fully agree
I wanna there might be a couple other
ones too but
okay give me a couple more while I have
while we have you

[49:00]
while we have you
let me see really quick because I might
have there might be two more that I
really like
um
you know whose content I've actually
been consuming a lot of in terms of
podcasts and and again dude I people
that I just think add value to my life
uh Rob Dyrdek from Robin big from DC
from MTV back in the day if you go
listen to his podcast about how he's
living his life with his with his
um his family and his business and
balancing all of that and I listen to it
I'm like you [ __ ] give me you're
giving me you're just adding more to my
day you're making me feel good
um and I think garyvee did a lot of that
for me like when I was playing pro
hockey he was one of the only dudes that
I listened to I would just have one in
the background
and it's just like it gives you it it
makes anything that makes me feel like
I'm a better human being after consuming
it makes me feel like okay like I'm I I
like this person now and I really think
people as a should go and consume midday
squares because in terms of creating

[50:00]
squares because in terms of creating
authentic engaging
um inspiring content I think that they
they are actually very legitimate
creators their whole team
um so they even as a fan I consume their
content and I'm just like this is
compelling
yeah I just bought some at Whole Foods
the other day so they're at Whole Foods
uh here in North America
and it's just it's worth it to try a lot
of these products just because you'll
understand a little more
what this whole world means and how you
can get involved so even if you're not a
chocolate fan uh grab some midday
squares just uh
like that's what I agree like I I'm just
like I have a budget for like just
testing testing
I love testing yeah it's why I liked
it's why I liked um
I almost just called it Coachella uh
Expo West so much right it's why I like
Expo West so much because it really is
like uh it's just a testing ground for

[51:00]
like uh it's just a testing ground for
all of the who's who in cpg new things
things that are popping things that are
currently relevant
um and so it's I have a field day going
and just checking those out and I think
people can literally go to Whole Foods
and just pull 50 products that they
enjoy go home and it's like a a
Halloween
sampling of candy I'm just trying new
things
um and that's something that we do often
I've never been to Expo West what was
the coolest thing that you saw there
this year
um the coolest thing for me was seeing
friends that I know that I've gone from
literally an idea in their garage to
actually having a booth there and it
being like fully done and looking nice
and people coming up to them and
supporting that was the coolest thing
that I got to experience in terms of
people that I think were really
Innovative there that had nice booths
that I think were cool booths cool ideas
uh I think good olds are goodles the uh

[52:00]
uh I think good olds are goodles the uh
the like better for you
gluten-free I think it's gluten-free
macaroni and cheese that I I think is
gal gadots uh company or as a part of it
they had a really good setup they did a
good job
um trough or like trough a lot
um which is the hot sauce company
they Crush levels right yeah with
Truffle in it poppy which is which I
have to give credit to because their
Booth was probably the most
um appealing it was literally like just
like a full retail shop in the middle of
Expo so they did a really good job with
it
um and I just I just look at things that
catch my eye that are like why are
people congregating here or why is that
why does this look so much different
than the others
um so yeah those are some of the ones
that I loved so like you mentioned three
or four products there like what what
was it about them these products that

[53:01]
was it about them these products that
caught your eye besides like a nicely
designed booth
well I think things that stand out so
the way that I the way that I judge is
like I see a wall of company is 50
booths and I see what ones catch my eyes
so sometimes that's bright colors and
unique branding sometimes that's the
opposite because everything's bright
colors and unique branding and there's
one that's like black and liquid death
looking like so I look at what stands
out branding wise first then the second
thing after that that I needed to do is
test the product I need to actually like
try the product and see if it's
something that's good that I would enjoy
if I enjoy the product now I'm like okay
cool this is something that's legit
how's the team who are the people that
are involved with this who's the people
that's driving this forward what's the
founder like who are the other people on
their team and then for me particularly
I'm like are they prioritizing content
what kind of content are they making if
they're doing that then I feel even
better about it and then the last thing

[54:00]
better about it and then the last thing
for me would be like where are they sold
and how much are they sold for like is
it attainable is it uh is the price
point Fair are they so are they already
in big stores are they trying to get
into big stores are they crushing it
direct to Consumer are they Nationwide
already like where are they those are
kind of the four things that I look at
um if you pass those four things for me
I
would bet on you
I love it
JT where could uh people find you on the
internet
uh everything's just JT Barnett JT
Barnett please send me a message I
appreciate all of you guys really for
listening to this it's actually been a
real this is a really fun vlogcast this
is uh some different some different
surprise
you seem surprised I'm not not surprised
just you appreciate you appreciate
um individuals that have unique takes
um because a lot of podcasts that I do

[55:00]
um because a lot of podcasts that I do
are just very kind of like follow the
question and here's the answer if all
the question here's the answer and very
kind of just brief history and then what
are you doing today so I appreciate when
people have their own
kind of uh takes or looks or Viewpoint
and they share it and then it's more
conversational
um so this one was really fun
well you know I'm just trying to follow
my curiosity and get as much tactical
information from you as possible
and I love that
I just think that that's going to be at
you know beneficial for people listening
it's also beneficial for me frankly you
know now I know
you know you just gave me your whole
Creator stack
you know I'm gonna go research a lot of
these products see how I can use them
thinking about arcs and narratives and
and writing stories I really like that
um and that's why that that's why I
think that your podcast has legs is

[56:00]
think that your podcast has legs is
because you're like you said following
your own interests which then anybody
that is at a similar point to you in
their life now has somebody to follow
that is going to be leading them into
the right places whereas if you're just
literally doing it just to get the who's
who won and just ask them about their
past and then be like cool later then it
doesn't it it there's just not a there's
not like a real relationship that's
built within the conversation and
there's less takeaways from it
um and so you like prying me or or like
doubling down on a question or even
giving your own thoughts makes me want
to go deeper into it which now your
audience has like a better chance to
grasp that information
um so both yeah if you learn if you
learn something on this pod please
