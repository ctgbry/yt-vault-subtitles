[00:00]
one key thing that we see we see there
that it's easy to build stuff but it's
not easy to grow 99% of the makers can
build stuff but only few can actually
grow and sell and bring in customers
most people actually fail right at the
start they just don't get any traction
at all like not even one sign up and
here you can solve that problem and I
think people are willing to pay for that
so that's where I think the best ideas
are right now so this is the idea like
find keyword with high traffic search
for it if it doesn't have any directory
on the first page of Google go and build
[Music]
it John Rush startup ideas podcast he's
finally on he's a fellow idea junkie
this guy is is pushing out I mean what
you have 20 businesses now 24 yeah yeah

[01:00]
you have 20 businesses now 24 yeah yeah
yeah you've got John has 20 businesses
that he's running $2 million ARR 10
million users that are B2B to see
100,000 plus users on B2B come on this
guy is one of us welcome welcome my my
friend good to have you yeah thanks for
having me
G all right so what is on your mind
right now what sort of ideas and Trends
um would you be willing to share with
with our
audience I see two Trends now so one
trend is that uh there are more and more
solar preneurs so there are a lot of
people building a startup on the side
like people who work at a corporate job
and they build it on a weekend and
evening and then there are people moving
over to uh cost effective countries uh
saving UPS some money and spending a
year or two building out from there like
uh it's called building p public or in

[02:00]
uh it's called building p public or in
the hackers on Twitter and this movement
was very small like it was very few
people like three two years ago but I
think it's doubling every year like I
don't have the count but my feeling that
it's at least doubling and will keep
growing uh just because we see that uh
the access to building
startups is really best ever like you
don't have to fund raise anymore you
don't have to find a co-founder you
don't have to find a team you can can
just do everything on your own either
you just codee it if you're a coder or
you use no code if you're not a coder so
that's kind of the trend I see and then
at the same time I see how this trend
can be uh utilized or how how we can
supply this trend and uh like my my
personal role is pretty much to build
the tools for for this crowd so that
they are kind of more powerful with
fewer resources and uh I think uh one
key thing that we see we see there that

[03:01]
key thing that we see we see there that
it's easy to build
stuff but it's not easy to grow like
that's kind of like 99% of the makers
can build stuff but only few can
actually grow and sell and bring in
customers so that's where I think the
best ideas are right now like the low
hanging fruits is building something
around the uh the growth and the
marketing and c and Tools around
that yeah and people will pay for growth
is the other thing that people don't
talk about which is yeah you know if
you're able to generate customers uh for
a startup people are willing to
basically share in the revenu you know
it's a revenue split basically you know
so I think that what sort of prompt
could you give to people in terms of you
know how do you come up with an
idea for you know in the
space I think the best way to come up
with the idea is to start with how would
you sell it so basically uh don't build

[04:03]
you sell it so basically uh don't build
stuff but just see what people are
actually looking for and for example
like I give precise examples from from
my own Journey like I saw a lot of
people asking about SE for example like
people were asking how to get backlinks
how to grow how to you know grow the
demand rating Etc so when you see those
requests usually you see people
answering how to do it with like seven
steps and some makers kind of like like
that just you know they read the steps
and they implement but since most makers
now are actually busy like they have
even full-time job or or their side
project say they want to save time and
then if you rub that little kind of list
of actions into a tool I call that
micras uh and it just does one thing uh
but it doesn't clear it's clear what to
expect and it's easy to recommend so
like my my game plan is this like I want

[05:00]
like my my game plan is this like I want
people to recommend my tool under those
posts like if somebody asks like how to
do X and then somebody comes there and
says I did that using this tool and if
tool just only does one thing then it's
easy for the user to remember this tool
and to recommend that tool comparing to
the tools doing like a lot of things
like that then is hard to remember
exactly where it does you were telling
me about a a startup idea you had around
weight lists can you can you talk more
about that yeah I think like it's really
hard to start like I remember uh in old
times it was kind of easy to start I
thought it's like everybody has an idea
I thought like all founders have tons of
ideas and they just kind of need funding
or people to implement those but now uh
I see more and more people uh with the
willingness to build something but they

[06:00]
willingness to build something but they
don't know what to build and usually
they're just looking around for random
stuff and they just kind of build that
stuff and usually that fails because
like you promote this you know build
community first and then the audience
then from audience you go to um to the
to their needs and then to the product
right and I had this idea that if
someone actually does this job of coming
up with ideas uh validating the ideas
uh with the users and then collecting uh
a weit list maybe collecting prepayments
and then you have the whole thing like
there's an idea there is there there
like 100 people who want it maybe five
paid for it then you have you know all
the risks not all the risk but a lot of
the risk is gone now and then if there
is someone who can build stuff they
could actually buy this little you know
uh like rough draft it's like start
draft you can you can call it right you

[07:02]
draft you can you can call it right you
can you buy the startup draft and you
can build it and you go from one from
there which is hey everyone if you're
anything like me you've got a ton of
design work that you need webites
landing pages emails social assets you
name it but you don't just want
beautiful landing pages or beautiful
websites you want the stuff that's going
to convert you want this stuff that's
going to actually drive value that's
where design scientist.com comes in it's
an agency that for one monthly price
will do all your design work all your
copy work all your engineering and do
stuff that actually scales your Revenue
you don't need a designer you need a
design scientist let's go design
scientist.com I liked it so much I
invested in the
business like I was surprised to see
that most people actually fail right at

[08:02]
that most people actually fail right at
the start they just don't get any
traction at all like not even one sign
up and here you can solve that problem
and I think people are willing to pay
for that I think people are willing to
pay like my my economics there was that
uh basically people would pay up to
$1,000 for that and and if that works
and there is some Word of Mouth people
can pay like two or three or 5K for that
just to save this you know first period
uh they could Skip and it's it's pretty
low cost to do this so uh one could just
make a machine that does all the steps
so the first step is coming up with idea
and if that's kind of your whole value
proposition coming up with ideas then
it's easier to put that on scale and to
come up with a lot of ideas just by
doing things like research on keywords
research on hot topics on Reddit on
Twitter and Etc so there are a lot of

[09:00]
Twitter and Etc so there are a lot of
tools for that and so you do one part of
the job you come with ideas and then the
second stage is that you validate the
ideas using technical methods so uh you
check their traffic on organic you you
check uh the potential you check the
free domains on do com Etc so you do
this simple things and that can be
automated you can actually make a little
tool for yourself uh that automates this
and then the uh stage number three is
that
uh you have to now validate with real
people and to do that you create a
weight list and you promote the weight
list using uh either ads or you pay
influencers I actually like to pay
influencers more than the ads because uh
it's just cheaper like from my
experience it was like you can pay $300
and have 100K views on the post uh now
on Twitter so and you do that and then
eventually like if if your pipeline is
100 ideas coming at the beginning and

[10:01]
100 ideas coming at the beginning and
then uh like 30 ideas go to the next
stage after this now technical
validation and then out of those thir
ideas maybe 10 ideas go to the next
stage uh after being validated by people
like they join the weight list and then
those 10 people you explain them the
value and eventually ask them to pay 70%
discount like a prepayment or something
like that and then let's say three ideas
survive so you have you know three out
of 100 uh and then you have these three
ideas you can sell basically now with
the little audience with the prepayments
with the ID itself with with the landing
page let's say you say you sell it for
3,000 or $2,000 and that's like
$6,000 and to do all this if there is a
system for that and you built little
tool for that to do all this you would
spend maybe $1,000 right or
or $2,000 so the margins are pretty good

[11:02]
or $2,000 so the margins are pretty good
and the margins get better and better as
more ideas and things you do in the
system and everything can be automated
like literally everything you can buy
domains VI apis you can you know make
ads the same way landing pages can be
generated using some builders that have
apis as well so this can be turned into
into a tool and then basically just turn
this tool on and it keeps doing the job
and even the ideas it can find the ideas
uh based on the same algorithm you did
by hands but now you can automate that
as well using Ai and using scraping and
now the system can do 1,000 ideas a
month right and then you have 30 winning
ideas and you sell
them yeah it's so this is a really smart
idea
because no one's doing it you know yeah
no one is doing it and there you know of
course there's marketplaces for startups
like aire.com and flipa but also there's

[12:00]
like aire.com and flipa but also there's
no Marketplace for what you're
describing which is basically what
you're describing is is let us do all
the work for validating a startup idea
let us let us get you your first 100,000
customers and then
once uh the uncertainty is taken away a
lot of the uncertainty we are going to
hand that for hand that over to you but
you are going to pay us a premium for
for that and it's kind of it's a win-win
situation because uh the person who's
inheriting that uh that new product is
they didn't have to go through all that
hassle of going through the ideas
finding those customers as you said you
know Finding customers isn't easy and
now all of a sudden they can buy
something for cheap because if they
would have went on one of you know one
of the startup marketplaces or buy a
startup you know that's EST
that's going to be already too expensive

[13:01]
that's going to be already too expensive
so this is like a cheaper version of
that yeah if you go to the startup
Marketplace and they check the prices
there so uh you would have no users and
no revenue and no validation products
for the same price just because they can
build something there but it's not the
part that's important like uh you can
build stuff like building stuff is easy
right like it's the easiest part of the
startup and if if there are users
prepayments and certain validation then
it's at least 10K right and that's way
too expensive so you glossed over
something that I think is really
important that I want to unpack a little
bit so you
said you prefer
influencers right now over ads and
you're you're seeing rates like $300 for
$100,000 views could you walk us through
how you think about like how do you
acquire these or how do you do these

[14:01]
acquire these or how do you do these
deals with these influencers how do you
reach out to them what is your process
to do this yeah so there are a lot of
influencers now a lot more than there
were a year ago I think uh AI has helped
and the new Twitter algorithm has H so
uh there are a lot of people doing that
for living and uh I kind
of I was looking at that segment uh two
years ago as well and I was checking the
prices and it was at least 1K and they
would guarantee maybe 30,000 views uh
and then I kept asking the same people
price again every few months uh and now
it's way lower just because there are
more people kind of doing the same thing
there's competition and they dropped the
prices so now it's uh it's $300 some is
$100 so I have uh some deals for $100
just because I buy often so if somebody
sells for $300 and you buy five times

[15:00]
sells for $300 and you buy five times
they they drop the price right and in my
case I have a lot of products and I buy
very
often I just reach out on uh Twitter and
Linkedin just direct messages sometimes
they reach out to me it's more often
that they reach out to me then I reach
out to them uh they offer their service
so it's pretty simple to find but
usually they start with really high
price so you would get like you know 700
or 800 at the start uh and you should
just bargain that down to few hundred
and and that usually works even if they
say no so that's how it works for me
they say no but then they come back four
weeks after because they have this one
week slot that's not taken and 200 is
better than nothing so they say you can
take it right and if you have enough of
influencers uh in your pipeline in your
list then uh there's always a wick open
for one of them or a few of them and
you buy and then eventually when you

[16:01]
you buy and then eventually when you
bought five or 10 times you agree on
fixed price that's pretty low and what I
do now I'm doing new things so I'm
experimenting and it's pretty
interesting so I pay influencers fixed
amount every
month and it is similar to partnership
like like the football stars to with
with Nike Etc but on a micro on Nano
scale right so and I pay them fixed
money every month and they know it will
be coming in
uh whatever happens and I commit for 12
months consolation so I I I won't conso
uh unless I give the notice so a lot of
people like it and I have certain amount
of stuff I can do on their account like
it can be a post it can be part of the
listicle it can be a reply Etc and now
uh the price goes very low for me
there's some risk so they might just you
know lose their engagement and reach and

[17:00]
know lose their engagement and reach and
then I still pay them but uh it never
really happens like I haven't seen
influencer like completely going out of
the business like some some changes in
the algorithm and they get back so and I
actually plan to launch a tool around
that basically to make that kind of the
whole not a Marketplace but a little
like people say on Twitter I'm
Reinventing the
AdSense but yeah AdSense for micro
startups
cool yeah I like that I think
also like it sounds like you're doing a
very manual process in terms of
responding to influencers reaching out
to influencers there's probably a lot of
ways that you
can automate a lot of it and especially
with
AI you know you can just feed a list of
here's my Niche and here's like the 100
influencers and like hit them up every
week
with or every two weeks C you know with

[18:02]
with or every two weeks C you know with
an email saying hey like you know are
you willing
to you know your price is X will willing
to pay you half
X yeah here's one more idea there's one
more idea I needan every idea vers
another idea is is the issue is is my
constant issues I'm constantly
having when I come up with an idea I'm
like oh that's a good idea or that's a
bad idea but you know oh what if we
Chang this and oh that could do this you
know so there's that's the idea maze
that's why they call it the
Maze and yeah I'm definitely always in
it but yeah I love that I think a lot of
people go towards ads as
a they're just it's just the the easiest
way you know it's so simple to set up an
ad campaign but I I do think that the
micro influencers particularly when
you're like reaching out to them
is there's a lot of alpha there um not

[19:03]
is there's a lot of alpha there um not
sure how long that Alpha is going to
last that Arbitrage is going to last
because as more and more
marketplaces come up the the prices I'd
imagine end up
becoming it you know more visible it's
kind of like how real estate was so in
real you know today in real estate you
know you have the MLS so you have
basically a database of all the
different at least in North America um I
don't know how it works in Turkey but um
in North America you have this system
and it's basically you can set up like
alerts and you can see everything that's
in the system but back in the day when
things weren't online you know you might
have seen a building for sale and they
listed it at 200,000 and it was really
worth
600,000 but because they didn't have
access to the data it was wildly
underpriced it was a misprice asset and

[20:02]
underpriced it was a misprice asset and
I think you're starting to see the same
thing with that kind of concept like
we're in that era with influencers right
now not everything is available actually
we're in that area specifically with
micro
influencers in in in influencers mega
influencers I feel like there's very
little mispriced attention but when it
comes to smaller creators and smaller
accounts there is a ton of opport Unity
to uh get something that's worth $1,000
for $200 yeah I mean I was just having
this dilemma today like I'm using social
media a lot and I'm getting I'm getting
good at it and my my reach is growing
but at the same time uh it's hurting my
my other part like I can't build as much
as I as I built know years ago and I see
that happening with a lot of the other
people like I I posted that on Twitter
and I had a lot of DMS from people

[21:01]
and I had a lot of DMS from people
saying like you know I have the same
thing and I think we G to have very huge
epidemic of uh people you know turning
full-time influencers because it's
actually really hard to keep building
and influencing or you creating content
at the same time and if that's happening
then the number of people who are uh on
the market you know will be growing and
it will be a lot of people there so I
actually think that even when we put
this into a Marketplace like with real
estate in the case of real estate the
number of houses isn't growing much is
growing very slow but here I think it's
nearly exponential growth of influencers
so I think it will be more similar to
Spotify where actually the cost of Music
dropped almost to zero you can listen
and everything for like you know fixed

[22:00]
and everything for like you know fixed
price I think it'll be similar thing
here right but again since we're
competing and if I have an access to
influencers and you have access to
influencer and we both advertise our
products then you know uh we'll have the
same access but at least at the
beginning like people who utilize
influencers they will gain a lot of
momentum compared to those who don't
yeah yeah I think that's right I think
the supply of
you know creators and influencers is
going up and up and especially with you
know faceless YouTube
channels uh and faceless accounts in
general meme Pages if if the ability to
create content becomes a lot easier than
more content exist meaning more
competition for
eyeballs um which means that the
Monopoly that creators have become
smaller and smaller that's why I think
right now is such a beautiful time to be

[23:02]
right now is such a beautiful time to be
creating yeah products and and I don't
know like I said you know I don't know
how long this lasts but it's beautiful
because as you said it number one it's
cheaper now than it's cheaper than ever
to create it's uh there's misprice
influencer and Creator opportunities and
there's number three there's the ability
to use AI to enhance support and
systematize and automate a lot of
content so you have these three things
and it's it's just a it's a beautiful
it's a beautiful time to be building I
want to uh I want to segue to your and
and talk about ideas around directories
because when I think of directories to
me you're like the directory King and I
just want you to talk about like why why
are you building directories and and do
you have any specific ideas that you can
give away around directories I had
passion for directories for many years I

[24:00]
passion for directories for many years I
would say and uh two years ago I had a
team and we were discussing
directories and I wanted to go full into
that stuff and and my team said like
look this is uh in obsolete stuff like
nobody does directors it was cool in
2017 but not anymore H and I was like no
I don't think so but I wasn't sure to
actually you know follow my own idea so
I I didn't start and then I start later
like just just last year uh I I think
directories are under appre
underappreciated why because when the
quantity
grows the
quality the percentage wise drops so the
more things you can choose from the
harder are is to choose and it means
that people really want to go to places
where where the selection has been done
for them either selection or

[25:02]
for them either selection or
categorization or other type of uh
enrichment of information so that they
can pick the right tool or anything the
right item right and the amount of like
the quantity on all the scales is
growing like the there are like hundreds
of CRM tools there are hundreds of any
kind of tools and tomorrow it'll be
thousands and then it will be 10
thousand like it will just keep growing
right like like the old ones aren't
being deleted they they stay too and the
new ones are adding up on top and that's
same with regular stuff as well like
there there more coffee shops there are
more people selling stuff around so
everything is growing and it's harder
and harder to choose and I think uh the
directories are here to solve that
problem so people trust other people who
have reason to trust them and I think
think the directories made by people who

[26:01]
think the directories made by people who
show that they have certain experience
in this field and you can trust their
choice you can trust their judgment on
this list uh people will even pay for
that and we see that like they like I'm
not charging for my directories like
people can use them but I see a lot of
people now starting to charge for good
directories and people actually pay to
have access to that data all right
because they just want to save time on
know selecting out of 10,000 items and
to have just 100 the best being sent to
them every week like you know even
things like uh for example there is this
guy uh Pat his name is Pat and he does
starter story you probably know him and
I think you had podcast with him and
like even that is directory in my head
because it's a directory of stories
about startups and people pay him
because he does the job of picking the
best Founders and putting their stores
in right yes so I think like when I say

[27:00]
in right yes so I think like when I say
directory people always have this image
of of a list of boring items there like
why would it be there like list of house
or or list of names but it can be list
of anything and people are willing to
pay for that and people are willing to
be in that list uh so you can both
monetize you know the the one side and
the other side and I think we are just
starting with that I think we are like
uh just entering the directory age as
they call it uh
because uh the AI made it even easier to
create everything the information
products and everything and obviously
the quality dropped a bit so now people
are even more interested and the other
thing that I'm thinking about uh that
most don't think about is that uh
AI will have to figure out how to find
the best items to recommend to people
right
and uh what are they using now they are

[28:01]
and uh what are they using now they are
using uh Reddit they're using other kind
of uh places and For Me Reddit is a
directory partly is a directory as well
like for AI it looks like a directory
it's a place where people with
reputation you know uh order things they
can vote for them and then there is a
list ordered by votes and that's a
directory too so I think the directories
will eventually be really important for
AI and the best directories will be
chosen by AI to be used for the search
results and and and if that happens to
your directory that means that uh you
have huge power and uh people are
willing to pay to be there as well right
yeah so so so you know people are bought
in I mean I don't know how you listen to
that and and aren't bought in I think
like the idea
around people there's so much
uncertainty and so much content that

[29:01]
uncertainty and so much content that
people just want a trusted
Source make sense to I think a lot of
people and you know we talk about
directories like oh yeah it's been
around for the last few years and it's
but like the reality is D you know since
the internet existed directories have
been a thing you know organizing
information the first day it's not the
first day and you have like you have
publicly traded you know
companies uh Angie which was formerly
called Angie's List I mean does you know
billion billion three in Revenue you
know so big businesses that basically
are just databases of
curated trusted people and people are
willing to pay for it so that's what I
that's what I like about directories too
I mean it's proven it's trusted and you
said the the magic words which is you
know it started to get uncool and some
started to get un cool what does that
mean if you're listening to this it

[30:00]
mean if you're listening to this it
means if it's uncool there's
Arbitrage there's opportunity to come in
and find something that's mispriced and
and do something so yes now we're bought
in what directory ideas do you have for
for us there are two types of directory
ideas I have in mind and I have in my
pipeline so one is local directories so
basically there are a lot of directories
in English I would say m of them are in
English and uh there are very few on
local languages so like it's really hard
to find directory of uh you know S tools
made by French people in France right
for example so I think moving forward
the quantity will be so large that
directories will have to find more
filters because like now people don't
want to go to a place where they have
everything they rather want to go to
place that has fewer items than too many

[31:03]
place that has fewer items than too many
so I so one way to do this is find the
directory that's working really well in
us uh and just find a country where
there is no directory like that and it's
easy to find you Just Google like the
best thing about directories is that the
whole research is in Google you just
search for something and if you don't
see good result on the top you go for it
right and uh so that's how you test it
you find good directories in bigger
countries and you search in the other
language like let's say in French uh and
if it doesn't exist on top of the Google
results uh you build it right and and
then of course you have to solve the the
the reputation problem Etc uh but
usually uh it is uh solvable over time
like if you work on directory you start
learning the topic you start learning
the tools you start to making podcasts
with founders of all these tools for

[32:00]
with founders of all these tools for
example like there are a lot of easy
ways to actually you know uh gain
reputation within segment so is the idea
there I'm going to go find
validated English directories and then
I'm just going to apply what you know my
let's say French I'm going to
apply my language French to it and then
and then localize it to for example
France France and Canada and senagal and
French speaking countries is that the
idea yeah yeah yeah exactly because
there are a lot of people uh who don't
speak English in those countries
actually most people don't and people
say like don't those who don't speak
English they are not in Tech it's not
true you knowt a lot of people speak
only French or prefer French and they
build within there and they have large
Market too and eventually at some point
they go International when things go
bigger right yeah I mean you're talking

[33:00]
bigger right yeah I mean you're talking
to a guy I mean I'm literally sitting in
a place where 94% of the
people here where I'm where I'm sitting
speak French as their first language so
you know you know there
are there
are you know the American
POV is always like focus on America it's
such a big market and and it's true in a
lot of ways like it is such a big market
and it and it's it's a it's an amazing
Market but that doesn't mean that
they're with with what's happening
around the E the the East to create
directories and and creating new tools
and like we talked about audiences and
stuff like that why not just take
something that's working and apply it to
a a local market I think makes a lot of
sense and again this is not something
that we're in Reinventing do you
remember rocket internet yeah yeah

[34:00]
remember rocket internet yeah yeah
exactly
rocket yeah right those those guys in
Germany that basically would look at
popular Silicon Valley startups that
raised a ton of money and be like okay
great
eBay is popping off in the US let's go
create the eBay for uh you know North
Africa yeah and they it it was a
brilliant idea I think they're down fall
a little bit was that they went public
and but like the idea of like rocket
internet not you know cash flowing makes
a lot of sense I think like that's a
huge idea so this is a really John I
hope you know you're you're given a
really good idea over here I mean the
the best part about the re is that that
most people don't appreciate is that uh
it's very little teag so it's it's it's
easy the building part is really easy
like in the rocket internet they had to
put a lot of money into that and here

[35:00]
put a lot of money into that and here
it's like if there's one thing you could
do where you don't need money but you
need your own time that's a directory
right uh because it needs time to make
the quality of the content good and
promote it but it doesn't need time for
building it which is like it just needs
a little bit of time comparing to
SS absolutely so you so you were saying
before I got really exced exed about
that idea that you had a second idea
around directories what was that yeah
the so the second idea about directories
is that it's not particular directory
it's just the method that I apply myself
very often uh and it just works I mean
it works so well that I feel it can't be
true that it just works almost every
time uh is but when you search for
keyword on Google ad plan
it's a free tool like it's ads. Keyword

[36:02]
it's a free tool like it's ads. Keyword
Planner something like that and you
search for keywords around random topics
and then you find a keyword that has
high traffic and then you search for
that keyword on Google and only block
posts are shown on the top that's the
idea like you just build a directory
around that and Google really likes
directories and eventually you will get
to the top two so it is it's kind of
soulless so you don't pick the idea that
you like but you can actually pick the
ideas you like and test them for traffic
but overall when I do that I don't use
any of my own judgment because then I
tend to pick the idea that's not so good
it has a little traffic but I think it's
good and my my intuition never works and
that's the thing like I think with
director ideas intuition always fail
fails because when you test it turns out
the opposite so in in my directories all
directories I had high hopes for they

[37:02]
directories I had high hopes for they
failed and those I didn't have hopes for
succeeded and I think the reason is that
if I have high hopes a lot of people
also have high hopes for the same
directory because it's kind of I'm I'm
an average of the society and whatever I
think most likely a lot of other people
think right so we can all build the same
thing so this is the idea just use
technical method like find keyword with
high traffic search for it if it doesn't
have any directory on the first page of
Google go and build it and you can do
that for 10 ideas like it's cheap it's
fast you do for 10 IDs and then you drop
seven and you push harder on
three how do you come up with the
keywords like how do you know what are
the keywords that are highly trafficked
yeah so it is uh it's boring I asked CH
B so what would be an example prompt
that you know that you would use with
chat GPT uh I I give you the real one uh

[38:03]
chat GPT uh I I give you the real one uh
so I want to have directory so usually I
launch directories to help my other SAS
tools to bring traffic so and then I had
this uh couple of Dev tools like you
have Dev hunt and and flat UI and and I
want to drive traffic there so I I want
to build a
directory uh for developers so I just
asked J I said I have this this and this
and I want this audience give me 20
ideas and gave me 20 ideas and then uh I
just tested all 20 and one was
great right so it's a it feels like like
a steel like you know it feels a bit
boring like sometimes too
easy and but it works it works I I think
a lot of the times uh Founders think
that it's uh uh things have to be hard I

[39:00]
that it's uh uh things have to be hard I
think things don't have to be hard but
you have to do the right things but
doing the right things is hard right so
that's kind of the thing well I think
what it is is great
entrepreneurs bet heavily when the odds
are stacked in their
favor so what you're doing the process
that you're
mentioning
is is pretty methodical like there's a
lot of steps associated with it so it's
less creative in that sense it's less
I'm taking a blank canvas and I'm
drawing something beautiful and putting
it out into the world uh and it's more
more like a science experiment but what
it does is when you use things like
Google Keyword Planner is it reduces
your risk and allows you
to build something when the odds are
stacked in your face you know that with
a certain

[40:00]
a certain
percent of probability that this is
going to hit some level of success and
of course it's going to be a numbers
game so just like you know betting it's
just you have to I I don't think and and
correct me if I'm wrong I don't think
that you're going to hit J chbt with a
high Search terms uh directory stuff and
then you pick the first one and it
happens to you know work I think this is
something that you have to apply a
portfolio approach try try multiple of
them but I think the key is you're
reducing risk uh along the way um
John we're going to end it here because
there's just two there there's too much
there's too much good in this um I want
people to check out John at his ex
account he just posts every single day
what he's learning in real time building
his 20 businesses is it's John Rush X

[41:00]
his 20 businesses is it's John Rush X
and he's also got a A list of all his
many projects John rush.
me uh check it out and it's inspiring
because I think the the model that
you're applying is is really the future
of building startup so thank you for
sharing it with us yeah thanks for
having me here of course later thanks
everyone
