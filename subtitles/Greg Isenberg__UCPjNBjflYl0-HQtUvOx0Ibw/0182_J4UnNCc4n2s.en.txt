[00:00]
yeah I mean four or five years ago maybe
a little bit longer now gosh was
probably is longer now there was a
Coachella where Tupac was on stage as a
hologram yeah rapping along sides
alongside Snoop Dogg and and some other
folks um and that was a huge unlock SL
wow moment for a lot of people they're
like they brought someone back from the
dead for a
performance it's kind of crazy right A
lot has happened since then and now we
have you know AI voice models that can
be trained on like five words and create
like pretty accurate you know voice
voices that are that are basically you
could take just the five words that I
say and then train on my voice and and
spit out full paragraphs of of of copy
that sound exactly like me and it even
gets better if you just train for a few
minutes of with data right so there is
very much a world where if I'm in my
studio here I can put up a green screen
for my guest

[01:00]
for my guest
I can um you know create my guest and i'
I've seen it even working now where you
can actually take and you can lip sync
uh or so you can lip I guess it is lip
sync you're syncing their lips to what
they're saying um they do this for
different languages so right now I could
be speaking Spanish to you or Japanese
and my lips would look like I'm speaking
Japanese if you just run it through this
post-processing um uh production that's
out there uh what I would do is I would
say okay let's just take a great flosser
like Allan Wat
um if you go to Alan watts. org his
website you can download 500 hours of
his talks right like that an MP3 format
again with the training you could go and
take all that data and say okay I'm
taking that entire Corpus I want to
understand who alen wats is his
philosophies feed in some of his books
as well and all of a sudden you have a
pretty interesting you know compelling
AI model that will speak and act and
talk and think like Alan Watts now I can
sit down and in real time have a

[02:01]
sit down and in real time have a
conversation and interview people that
have passed away I could do this with
Einstein you could do this with a whole
slew of different people and actually
you know have fullon conversations and
yes the AI is kind of filling in some of
the gaps and trying to come up with his
best Assumption of how they would answer
certain things but if you have enough
data I'd imagine you get pretty close I
think it would be a fun experiment I
don't know there's this is not a
business this is just more like a
thought experiment like what if we went
and tried this to see what would happen
I mean you could do this with all
different types of leaders both good and
bad that have passed away um you know
you can imagine some pretty extreme
examples of previous leaders that were
pretty evil that you could bring in you
know their data and thinking and it just
um yeah it would just be fascinating to
see how this unfolds and I have to
imagine it's coming
soon what about taking it to the next
level with speaking to

[03:01]
level with speaking to
people in our lives that have passed
away oh 100%
yeah yeah that that would be the problem
there is like just do you have enough
data like I have my my dad's passed away
you know uh 13 years ago now something
like that and I think about what I have
of him and I have a few recordings of
him saying a few things bunch of emails
but they were you know just little two
three sentence things here and there so
I don't know that I have the data
required for that but we certainly will
like my kids will be able to do that
with me for sure that's for sure yeah
that's for sure and I was thinking about
this the other day because my dad my dad
was like cleaning out a closet and he
had found a bunch of
DVDs um like old family videos and he
sent me he sent me a bunch and I hadn't
seen these people

[04:00]
seen these people
like you know as you know my late my
late grandfather my other late
grandfather I haven't seen them videos
moving pictures of them in such a long
time um and there's just something about
watching someone in video that like you
really it hits different than a photo
yeah I just it's funny you say that I
just got done sending my entire box of
old
videos uh mostly VHS honestly and
getting them converted by company and
they sent him to me and I hadn't seen my
grandma in you know since she was alive
like like almost 30 years ago or
something I was a little kid you know I
saw her last and just to see her there
was in talking was such a trip such a
trip and I mean the MVP of this like
even if you don't have enough video
footage of your grandmother but you knew
a few things that she used to say and
you have maybe some of her voice like
just like good morning Kevin like hope

[05:00]
just like good morning Kevin like hope
you have a great day um yeah yeah it's
it's really it's funny that we were just
talking about Alan Watson I saw somebody
hacked a Raspberry Pi to be their voice
assistant and they used alen watt's
training data and it was like totally
alen watt saying good morning like you
know enjoy your day today you have three
meetings or whatever and I was like what
the hell like it's so such a trip such a
trip and I I just think that I know I
personally would pay tons of money for
something like that um yeah so I think
there's a huge business around that it's
sing time baby
