[00:00]
getting started with something simple is
the best way to get more ideas to build
a tiny audience to get feedback to learn
there's just so many things that just
roll after that having a course a book I
think it's the easiest way to get
started and so yeah the that's the
entire point is to start with something
simple um there's this sense as a
business owner that if you charge a
subscription then you will get monthly
recuring Revenue so you get $10 in
January you're going to get $10 in
December and you know it's going to keep
going like this but what I do is I tend
to remove any subscription and I really
ask myself do I need that subscriptions
a friend of mine is telling me if you
have a recuring payment you should
provide recurring value you need to
build that idea cuz that idea is so
smart I'll build that with
you I need man I'm I need a notepad
right
here that's a successful startup ideas
podcast when you have to pull out your
notepad you're like okay let me just
take a note on that
[Music]

[01:05]
[Music]
all right I am so excited to have you
mark on the show on the startup ideas
podcast you know on my Mount Rushmore of
Indie hackers I've got you know Peter
levels I've got Danny postma and I
definitely have Mark Lou so um I finally
got you to come on agree to come on the
Pod you're here and uh
welcome man thank you so much big fan of
the P i' I've watched a lot of episodes
and I'm I'm happy to be finally in here
you're you're here man you're here and
and you came prepared too which I love
so you've got a list of a bunch of ideas
um and I take your ideas very seriously
because you've been able to you've been
able to build a pretty big audience on
YouTube You've you know you've you
you've made you know and revenue

[02:00]
you've made you know and revenue
millions of dollars uh at this point um
so which one of these ideas do you want
to start with because they're all pretty
interesting um just before we get
started I'm I got lots of ideas lots of
them are terrible but I try all of them
and eventually some of them ended up
working so whatever I prepared some of
them might not be the best but uh it
crossed my mind and uh I think it's
worth exploring yeah and it's funny
because sometimes like the bad ideas end
up being the good
ideas man it's c that that is absolutely
crazy that reminds you that even with
years of experience you'll still not
really know what you're doing yeah
exactly and sometimes you just got to
like you just got to put it out there
and make it ugly and just see what
happens and it it strikes a chord and
you're like wow I actually can't believe
how bad of an idea this is but it it's
actually interesting to people

[03:00]
actually interesting to people
yeah yeah and and sometimes the opposite
happens when you think you have an
amazing idea you spend two month
building it and then nothing happens I
guess the open zound I think
um um I think one one good part to get
started is there is this like gold rush
for
SAS product but I in because we hear
like amazing stories of like a kid who
use no code and and make a million
dollar using a size product but I think
there are tons of products before that
that are much simpler to start with and
um and I think one of them is teaching
what you actually know you probably have
a background whether you've been
studying something you been I don't know
it could be a sport background could be
employee backgrounds having a course a
book I think it's the easiest way to get
started so yeah you're right everyone
knows something but how do you know just

[04:01]
knows something but how do you know just
because you know something doesn't mean
the thing that you know is what someone
wants to buy necessarily so for
example it might be way easier to sell
someone how to build a SAS than it is to
sell online than it is to sell someone
um how to make you know on you know how
to make Ceramics or Pottery or cups U
maybe there's a big market for that but
I just know that the Val the customer
value
for um how to build SAS maybe is bigger
than maybe maybe the ceramic so the
question to you is how do you how do you
think about the customer here and how
much they're willing to pay or does it
matter I think that's my case I I like
the creation process and I wouldn't
think too much about the customer I
would still create it and I I would
think about something that changed my
life and building a sass is one of them

[05:01]
life and building a sass is one of them
but sometimes there are little things
that are I'm talking about very simple
things but like how to sleep better like
for instance I see the impact on my
sleep on my day if I have a good night
eight hours of sleep I wake up I'm
pumped my entire day is like a blessing
but now if you're talking about getting
the perfect night of of sleep on repeat
it's much harder than just being lucky
once you need to go to bed at the same
time all the time you need a specific
temperature you need earplugs you need
all these of things and it becomes
complicated and this is this is
something that you could sell to anyone
everybody needs a good night of sleep
and I remember in 2021 that's one of the
thing that changed my life that could
literally something you could build in
like you could make a PDF in a day and
you can sell that to starts shh don't
tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup
ideas that could make you millions and
I'm giving them away for free these

[06:01]
I'm giving them away for free these
aren't just random guesses they're
validated Concepts from entrepreneurs
whove built hundred million plus
businesses I've compiled them into one
simple
database compiled from hundreds of
conversations I've had on my podcast but
the main thing is most of these ideas
don't need a single investor some cost
nothing to start I'm pretty much handing
you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your
startup
shortcut just click below to get
access your next cash flowing business
is waiting for you so that's really
interesting so when you when you were
saying you know everyone knows something
basically package it up and you should
you can sell it I was thinking more of
like a hobby or something like that but
what you're saying is actually no you
might just know something about life
meaning you might know uh just some life

[07:04]
meaning you might know uh just some life
hack basically um like how to sleep
better and if you write out like as a
prompt what are the you know what are
the 10 life hacks that you've learned in
your life uh maybe it's how to get to
the gym consistently and then what
you're saying is okay write write down
all the life
hacks write a PDF you can you can even
use tools like gamma. apppp uh which is
uh kind of a really it's like a a tool
to really make uh lead magnets quite
easily that I've been using have you
seen it no I haven't I was Googling it
yeah yeah I've been obsessed with it
recently um it it if you go to their
website it
doesn't it doesn't say like we make lead
magnets
um but I use it for lead

[08:01]
um but I use it for lead
pet um and I use it for for just making
beautiful websites out
of
content yeah yeah because design that
design matters a lot here and where even
if just ideas is very simple having a
good learning page like the one you you
talk about like this is one of um one of
your favorite I think it was a
newsletter or tweet of yours that says
the tweets size or tweet bite landing
page I think man that's such a great way
to get started without overthinking you
can have a call to action buy a little
course here or there and if you do the
work to launching a little bit
everywhere you know then you learn a lot
about what's happening and what's not
happening you learn about creating
headlines you learn about putting your
ideas out there and stop overthinking I
think that's the first step when you're
starting in this journey even if it
seems simple that's the point that's the
point of like you're just getting

[09:00]
point of like you're just getting
started then you can you know yeah I
think the counterargument that someone
makes when they hear something like this
is they go okay great how to sleep
better like I'm GNA go make maybe I can
make $50,000 a year um with this but I
think what you're saying is and correct
me if I'm wrong but I think what you're
saying is that could just be the
starting Place meaning once you put out
this PDF around how to sleep you you
might have an idea for a sleep
supplement or uh I don't know like an
eye mask business right there we go yeah
that's the point that's the starting
that's the ignition of the
business I think there there's a there's
the like um sometimes you get this idea
and you think that's going to change
everything and this you know this is
like you Full Throttle all into it but I
think it's it's a journey and a ni IDE
is just a part of the journey and there

[10:01]
is just a part of the journey and there
there will be so many ideas in that
longer journey and getting started with
something simple is the best way to get
more ideas to build a tiny audience to
get feedback to learn um there's just so
many things that just roll after that
and so yeah that's that's the that's the
entire point is to start with something
simple if you were let's just say you
were creating a digital product around
how to sleep better what are your next
steps like okay you have the idea and
then you know how do you name it how do
you you know what how do you generate
traffic to it like how do you think
about growing a digital product like
that okay so for talking about something
very simple like creating an ebook to
sleep better I would definitely use a
medium to share what I'm working
on so if it's if I'm comfortable on the
camera I'll definitely go on YouTube or
TI Tok Instagram if I am better with

[11:01]
TI Tok Instagram if I am better with
writing because I'm a little bit
introvert then I would go on Twitter and
I would learn how to share my ideas
learn how to share what I'm currently
working on so I can create content out
of my daily life and that would create
it wouldn't make a buzz at the beginning
but I would create an initial traction
you would get five to like I don't know
10 people who just look at what you're
doing and they will be here when you're
launching that's would be the first step
yeah I I want to say one quick thing on
this
so dude
I and I I applaud you for doing this but
I was I was for a while I was recording
the direct to camera videos where I'd be
like here's the 10 ways to do XYZ and I
and I you know would do these videos and
I hated it I hated it man like I I
really really it felt really unnatural
to
me and

[12:01]
um whereas like on Twitter and writing
and even doing these long form podcasts
it feels very natural to me but like
writing a script and staring into the
camera made me feel very like weird and
sometimes feeling
weird is like it's not really feeling
weird actually uncomfortable sometimes
feeling uncomfortable is the necessary
evil you need to go through in order to
like do something great but at a certain
point I was just unhappy and I hated
doing it so I think the question for
people if they're if they're going to
like document their path you have to ask
yourself which
format is good for
you yeah man that I can relate so much
to that and if you go back to my Twitter
accounts in the very beginning of the
journey like 2021 2022 you would see
tweets of me but now would cringe
because I'm I'm trying to tell people
what to do I think the mistake we do and
I think it's kind of natural because you

[13:01]
I think it's kind of natural because you
open YouTube and you see videos with
million views of I don't know Alex
hormos who is telling you five mistakes
you're making as you know an
entrepreneur like there's this like
teacher mindset and you're like I'm
gonna copy that I'm gonna imitate I'm
gonna teach them what I know but at the
beginning you don't know anything so you
want to start by using I and not you so
I did that I learned that and then maybe
later in the journey when you start you
have a biger following you've learned a
lot then maybe you can start teach Ing
and telling like you should be doing
this or or stuff like that I think it's
a good finding the right medium so
Twitter like YouTube Instagram whatever
this is and finding the formats on how
you tell your ideas I think this is this
is very important here took
me yeah and I think about format a lot
too so what what you mean by format
is like saying I did that today and not
you should do that right and and and how
do you like so a lot of people are going

[14:00]
do you like so a lot of people are going
to agree with you they be yeah a format
but how do
you how do you develop your own format
you know there's a lot of there's a lot
of content around developing your own
voice but developing your own voice is
very different than developing a format
that is going to work
and and get shared by people how do you
think about that man if those are good
question because I can really retrace
the beginning of the journey I'm like
hey I was actually thinking about that
um I think it comes
to finding consuming content and picking
the little things you like from each
creators for instance I like the mindset
of P levels to say I did that and having
like lots of little projects and I
copied that and I put it in my head and
I like now it's part of me um maybe some
of your audience know Justin well she a
really good writer on Twitter I like the
way he writes like it's very clear
concise super simple to understand I was
like okay love that I took the way right

[15:00]
like okay love that I took the way right
and I put it in my head I'm like now
that's part of my identity and I mix
those con
creators in my head and it becomes my
identity so my identity is not really my
identity actually it's like a mix of
lots of things I found everywhere plus
what I've discovered along the way but
at the beginning this is literally
nothing and if you go back to my Twitter
you really see that things have changed
a lot from the very beginning yeah so
it's interesting we were talking about m
Rushmore before it's almost like you
should create that your own Creator
Mount Rushmore for your formats meaning
pick three or four people who you really
look up to and then write down what is
the one or two things that you take away
from their content that you want to
implement into
yours and then from that go and
experiment with different you know
different
formats exactly that

[16:00]
formats exactly that
cool all right and then okay so then you
you start creating content
and how do you you know how do you sell
the PDF how do you think about pricing
it um or
ebook oh man pricing could be a could be
an entire YouTube video of one hour for
for that I think you want to start with
a pay wall you don't want you want to
avoid launching free things unless
you're passionate about unless you have
a really good idea and you think it
could work otherwise you want to have a
pay wall because that teaches you a lot
of things um you don't want to price too
cheap because obviously when it's cheap
people will undervalue the product and
as you're getting
started if you sell 10 PDF and each PDF
is like $1 then at the end of the month
you're not even paying the
bills so you want to have the motivation
and and for that you need to price a
little higher than than expected you
look at competitors prices for that if
you don't know how to price um it's just

[17:02]
you don't know how to price um it's just
really a bunch a bunch of a but yeah I
would I would go for one time payment
for sure at the very beginning
especially if you're selling a course I
would say one thing you can do is get
all the data around like competition
like seeing where you sit in competition
I think is really helpful so write about
you know make a list of all the the data
points around what people are selling it
for take that data go into uh uh go into
you know
Claude let's say and do a prompt be like
hey I need you to help me price this
you're my like pricing partner pretend
pretend like you're you know the head
the best pricing expert on the planet
and that you know I always say like
pretend you work at like Walmart or
you're the head of pricing at Walmart
and the best in the world and you get
paid a million dollars a year to do this
and here's the data I want to price this
product what do you think I should be
priced at and why
and and that if you're like a solo Indie

[18:02]
and and that if you're like a solo Indie
hacker type person just having going
back and forth with AI will help refine
what your first price should be yeah
it's crazy good though yeah so and then
the other thing to note about pricing
and by the way comment on YouTube if you
want us to do or you know want to do a
or you're interested in a pricing
episode um I don't know if people are
down down for that but um
I think uh you can always change your
price too right yes I've been playing a
lot a lot with that I started with very
cheap and cheap subscriptions with a
long time free long free trial and then
I ended up removing the free trial
pricing higher and REM sometimes
removing removing the
subscription um I think it really
depends on the product I think there is
a rush towards subscriptions because um
there's this sense as a business owner
that if you charge a subscription then
you will get monthly recing Revenue so

[19:00]
you will get monthly recing Revenue so
you get 10 month on January you're going
to get $10 in January you're going to
get $10 in December and you know it's
going to keep going like this but I
think as a customer it's kind of a pain
to have subscriptions because you have
Netflix Spotify Etc and so in the
customer's mind when you see a
subscription you're already thinking
what happens if I have to cancel and I
forget and when you create objections in
the mind of the customer at the moment
purchase that is usually impacting your
conversion rate
and what I do is I tend to remove any
subscription and I really ask myself do
I need that subscriptions a friend of
mine is telling me if you have a
recurring payment you should provide
recurring value which usually falls in
the category of software for businesses
like if you're using I don't know like a
a scheduling tool because you have calls
every week that it makes sense to have a
recurring
subscription if you look at there's a
lot of product that can actually remove
the entire subscript ion model and have

[20:01]
the entire subscript ion model and have
onetime payment or a system like a
credit system that works really well too
that's doesn't you know push the
customer to like make a big
commitments and it's easier to sell who
do you think does pricing well what are
examples of people who do pricing well
before we move on to the next startup
idea I just have to ask
selfishly examples from Indie hikers or
any company could be anything any
company I'm interested in it because I'm
just interested in companies that do
pricing well because I think there's
this shift happening right now to your
point which is like people are getting
sick of monthly
subscriptions and so I'm just interested
on who's innovating or who's doing
interesting things in pricing quick ad
break let me tell you about a business I
invested in it's called boring
marketing.com so a few years ago I met
this group of people that were some of
the best SEO experts in the world they
were behind getting some of the biggest
companies found on Google and the secret
SEC sauce is they've got a set of

[21:00]
SEC sauce is they've got a set of
technology and AI that could help you
outrank your competition so for my own
businesses I wanted that I didn't want
to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I
didn't want to depend on ads to drive
customers to my businesses I wanted to
rank high in Google that's why I like
SEO and that's why I use boring
marketing.com and that's why I invested
in it they're so confident in their
approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint
with 100% money back guarantee who does
that nowadays so check it out highly
recommend boring marketing.com
I nobody really likes paying so there's
nothing that comes in mind I think I
remember seeing the Met subscription the
Met usage where I was like oh that's
cool but not a comp I don't have any
company in mind one company that comes
in mind when it comes to pricing it's
it's a smart move on their side but as a
customer I don't like it is stripe with
the fees if you actually look at your

[22:00]
the fees if you actually look at your
monthly fee that's a lot of money I
think that's where I spend the most
money in my business like probably
$5,000 a month they got three% for the
cards plus an extra 1% if the card is
not from Europe plus an extra 1% if
you're charging another currency and
then and plus 0.4% if you want to make
an invoice in the end you pay like five
to six% so it's smart for the business
and as a customer I'm not a big fan of
it yeah I think
that's that's like the payer per usage
model which is the more you use it the
more like in theory you're happy because
oh you're making all this money then
you're happy to give them a cut and if
you're not making a lot of money then
you don't give them a cut but the
reality is it would be great if it was a
sliding scale meaning instead of you
maybe it's 2.9% let's say 3% I don't
know what stripe fees are but let's just
say for the sake of this conversation
that's
3% up until 100,000 of sales and then

[23:03]
3% up until 100,000 of sales and then
for you know 100,000 to a million it's
2% and then a million and more is
1% man yeah that's you just remind me of
a pricing I saw that was really smart
but it was years ago they were charging
higher it's it was a subscription they
were charging higher on the first month
or they were charging you on the first
month for a basine that's they they show
on their site and then it decreases
after like two to three month and so as
a customer you don't want to cancel
because otherwise you lose what you
already gained by being a customer for
the past three months I canot remember
the company but I thought it was a
really Smart Pricing that is really
smart that is really smart like no one's
doing that yeah yeah that makes me want
to ship something and just try just to
see that's amazing okay um moving on to
your next Idea Idea number two what what
do you what do you

[24:00]
do you what do you
got all right if we step um all right
maybe we can move from that whatever
course you you're trying to sell there's
something I love and it's maybe speaking
to only Gamers out there but I'm a big
fan of all the forecraft I've played
games for so many years and I try to
gamify things that have a purpose in
real life so for instance you could
gamify your sleep you could score points
you can compete with friends
you can lose money if you don't get good
sleep or if you don't track your habits
or something like that I think there's a
lot to do in the gamification system
because everybody wants better sleep
everybody wants to eat better everybody
wants to work out and I think there is a
game
gamification things that could help
people achieve their goals and that
could be a software by itself so you
would have to so I bu I buy the thesis
which is gamification helps people do

[25:01]
which is gamification helps people do
things and create streaks and results so
but how would you like which vertical is
most interesting you know would you I
think sleep is really interesting um but
by the way sleep like I'll show you
right now like I use eight sleep the
mattress and it's like a smart mattress
and the first thing I do when I wake up
in the
morning is I check my sleep Fitness
score
there you go and so I slept well last
night
99% um and then you can see like your
REM sleep and your deep sleep so you can
see that I like you know it's game it's
gamified like this is gamified yeah yeah
you're not wearing any ring or anything
is it the mattress tell you that just
the mattress tells me that I don't know
how it does it I don't ask questions
exactly yeah yeah I think in this case

[26:02]
exactly yeah yeah I think in this case
it's I think it's a mattress company
that sells the app on top of that so
that eventually on a call on a podcast
you would end up talking about the
mattress because it's interesting
normally you don't talk about a
mattress I think that makes a lot of
sense but that would require you to
already have a business if you're sing a
course about how to sleep better you
know you could bring a lebard of all the
people who purchased and make them
compete um for sleep there is sleep an
app that was released I think a year ago
or something which makes 100 million a
year and basically the better you sleep
the more your Pokemons will grow and
evolv um and they Pokemon sleep is
making 100 million dollars a year did I
hear that correctly yeah I don't know
what is the license fee they pay for the
the Pokemon license but he's pretty
insane okay wow I'm just reading this
now this is this is absolutely
Bonkers um they

[27:01]
Bonkers um they
have they made $100 million on 9.8
million
downloads
so that's pretty crazy
like that's to $10 per download yeah
it's
crazy yeah it's pretty
crazy I think the Nostalgia of Pokemon
combined with a real life goal that's
that's the a big something big okay so
here's the unlock here's the idea the
idea is this the the idea is there's a
we all know the things that people want
to do sleep better sleep better eat
better all the
things um you can you can ask Claude you
can ask whoever you can ask your mom
these things don't change human beings
don't
change we all know that gamification
leaderboard status badges streaks is a
product design tool that helps people
achieve their goal it sounds like what

[28:02]
achieve their goal it sounds like what
what is the unlock that Pokemon sleep
has done well they've
licensed the intellectual property of
Pokemon and they've added that
to this whole concept of gamification
Etc so the question
is the way I'm thinking about this and
I'm like really excited about this as
you you can see
is um what is an opportunity to license
a a brand and just BR basically what is
poke the idea is this it's Pokemon sleep
for
a yeah you li you license the IP and by
the way people someone's going to be
listening to this and and say like
well uh yeah easy for them who like they
probably paid so much money for Pokemon
and and and you'd be
surprised like how cheap some of these
licenses are
to uh to get to get um maybe not Pokemon

[29:03]
to uh to get to get um maybe not Pokemon
but like to get amazing licenses for
nostalgic intellectual property you'd be
surprised how cheap they are I don't
want to uh I don't want to say who it is
cuz it's it's someone everyone knows but
there's someone who I know who got the
LIC like went to um basically uh a what
do they call it a franch uh not a
franchise it's like a intellectual
property conference licensing conference
in Las Vegas and
and he got like a Star Wars for for like
a some apparel he basically bought the
Star Wars license for some like apparel
line and he thought it was going to cost
he's like you know Star Wars is huge
right and he's like oh my God it's going
to cost like millions of dollars a year
and it ended up costing
uh
$50,000 for the first two

[30:02]
$50,000 for the first two
years and some percentage of sale I
think it was like two or three
percentage but now all of a sudden you
can do Facebook ads with Star Wars on it
so huge yeah that's crazy I mean yeah
man I would love to grow my Jedi as soon
as I ship is start of my lightsabers
becomes I don't know double or something
just so many and we're talking about
General stuff like sleep or workouts but
you can go deep into Niche like
developers who commit for this is some
this is an app I have in mind for for a
long time I probably build it it in
years from now it's like um every time
you make a commit as a developer it's
pushed to GitHub and there is like these
super addictive GitHub things where you
have like a a greed of all your commits
across the last 365 days every
developers wherever your software
engineer using typescript or your pet
levels using PHP and doesn't care about
anything everybody knows about that and

[31:01]
anything everybody knows about that and
everybody loves his greed and man I I
kind I want to bring that in and and
make a massive leaderboard of comits or
whatever geds something that makes
people wants to push some code
online this is one of the millions of
Niche where you can gamify gamify habits
goals yeah dude you need to build that
idea cuz that idea is so smart
think
about um like during the web 3 craze
there was an app called
sweatcoin I don't know if you saw this
but it was basically like based on the
amount of steps that you took they would
give you this
coin um so it gamified
walking think about credit card points
like the more you use your credit card
the more I think uh credit card points
meets
GitHub uh commits idea is a massive idea

[32:00]
GitHub uh commits idea is a massive idea
if you could be the place that people
like the more I commit the more points I
get and yes there's a leaderboard but it
also allows me to redeem for something I
think that's the idea that you should do
there you go man that is that is myart
way there's a financial incentive yeah
okay I'll build that with
you I need man I'm I need a nut pad
right
here that's what the go that's that's a
successful startup ideas podcast and you
have to pull out your notepad you're
like okay let me just take a note on
that and do the track record you have
because um if that end up working two
years from now it's like this idea was
born on the startup ideas podcast
exactly we documented it I'm I'm really
taking note of that one I'll I'll CC you
I'll DM you if I ended up building it
cool one La we have time for one last
idea can I can I pick one okay because

[33:00]
idea can I can I pick one okay because
there's there's one I'm curious about
that I've thought about for many years I
almost don't want to bring it up but
we'll bring it up because I said it
already legal for entrepreneurs what do
you mean by that oh okay I thought it
was your idea no I want I want I i' I've
been I've been exploring this in the
space for for a few years now but I
haven't built anything in the space so
I'm curious what you mean by legal for
entrepreneurs
oh man I dropped it here because this is
the number one question I receive on
every YouTube videos I make where did
you set up your company how does it work
how did you set up your strap account
with that company the same question
every single time and uh the thing is I
I think there is an opportunity for an
info product for sure so people
understand a little bit better about
what what is going on how does it how
does the thing work because it's mostly
it starts with that
and eventually for a service where you

[34:00]
and eventually for a service where you
have you marketplace where you you match
people in their needs and the legal
entity that they need I am I am I am
terrible at legal stuff like this is
something that it pulls my hair so I
spend as least time as I can on it but I
think there's a real need because people
ask all the time I think so too uh I use
stripe uh stripe Atlas to like set up my
companies
um to you know it's just
integrated uh with stripe obviously it
makes it pretty easy but I wish there
was someone I could talk to at stripe
Atlas too you know sometimes I'm like I
don't know if I should start an LLC
versus es Corp and you know what I mean
it feels feels like there's an
opportunity to make it a little more
educational and and have like a more
premium version I guess like the idea I
have here is more of a premium version
of stripe
Atlas oh okay I think yeah in your case

[35:02]
Atlas oh okay I think yeah in your case
it's probably like an Advan version
maybe for to optimize your textes or
something like
this yeah I mean it's okay so the
example I'll use
is uh I you know we set up an LLC for
one of our businesses in in the states
and it started making a bunch of money
and we didn't realize that we should
have converted it to an
escort and which is another type of
Corporation so um and that cost us
hundreds of thousands if not millions of
dollars of
taxes and we would have set it up
probably as a as an escort from the
beginning um but we didn't know because
we were just on stripe Atlas um so I
wonder so if you think about like legal
there's as as a spectrum right on one
end of the spectrum you have
um calling your like calling my

[36:02]
um calling your like calling my
Manhattan lawyer paying my Manhattan
lawyer $1,100 an hour to set up a
company which is something we've done
before you know which sucks like take
it's painful literally so
painful that you know just it's hurts my
soul that that's one end of spectrum and
the other end of the spectrum you have
selfs serve stripe Atlas type products
that for like a couple hundred bucks get
you all set up it feels like there's in
the middle all right I think yeah maybe
because in new your I think you're
you're from Canada right I'm originally
from Canada
yes I think there's
um the what I see is from people who are
usually not from the US because for for
you guys there is this like this easy
option of stripe at last and you're
American I mean you're you're you're
from Canada
so I'm a I'm a green card holder so I
live in the US now mostly
but I'm I'm still it's it's basically

[37:00]
but I'm I'm still it's it's basically
I'm like an American yeah so you pay
taxes in in the US now yeah I pay taxes
in the US I don't pay taxes to Canada
okay okay so yeah you've you've been
because for for I look I look at my
situation I am a French person who is
married to a Korean woman and living
living FIS like T my tax I pay my taxes
in Bell there was an infinite ocean of
options where would I pay my taxes where
would I pay pay my company where would I
open a company because I don't need to
open a company necessarily in Indonesia
or in France I can open it in Singapore
and so you have like so many options and
sometimes like yeah but you have STP
Atlas in the US where you pay 0% taxes
why not opening there and then you
realize if you do that then you're not
you have you own a company like there
and you live in Indonesia it's maybe
illegal there's this like entire system
where it's like completely [ __ ] up and
I think that's why people are asking
it's more like not trying to optimize
Sexes but to understand the system where
should they set up their company in

[38:00]
should they set up their company in
first place so that it's working because
you could now that you work with a
computer you could work from anywhere in
the world you can leave anywhere in the
world so there's this like an ocean of
options which create as well an otions
of thoughts and that's interesting
that's interesting yeah I didn't even
consider opening a a company outside
outside can or the US to me it was like
that's where I would open a company
because that's all I know um but you're
right there are probably other places
that I should have considered um for a
bunch of
reasons yeah and I think for you it also
Mak makes sense where you are because
you you might have employees Etc so it's
the the more things engage for me the
company is one person it's me and there
is no employee there's no one else
there's eventually a contractor to edit
my videos but that's that's it and so
that guys give me an an an an enormous

[39:01]
that guys give me an an an an enormous
amount of flexibility to where I go but
on the downside where do I go and that
that that was the tricky part where I
was not really sure where to open first
and interesting yeah and people really
ask a lot like it's number one question
so I guess stripe Atlas for Indie
hackers with maybe a little more support
is probably an interesting idea um yeah
when I looked at stripe At Last At the
beginning I was living in
France and I hired someone a lawyer and
he told me if you own a strip Atlas
business in
France like you're going to get flagged
they they won't like it because it's
like zero 0% tax Even Heaven and so
either you would get double tax as if it
was a French company so in that case
that makes zero sense or if one day you
got an audit then your F and I was like
and that's the moment where I started to

[40:00]
and that's the moment where I started to
realize like wait so so what you know
and then there's this entire process of
like okay I can have a company abroad
but then I need to move abroad as well
and
then and then yeah and then that's when
the troubles somehow somehow started
then you have the regulation that
changes in every countries because at
some point everybody was talking about
Dubai that's the place to go and then
they changed the regulation and became
more expensive or like and I was I was
lost I was like okay [ __ ] I'm not going
to optimize anything I'm going to do
something simple I'm going to go there
and boom I like it there's there's
something here someone in the comment
section is going to be like I'm going to
do something so I'm happy you flagged it
and and uh I appreciate it Mark Mercy I
