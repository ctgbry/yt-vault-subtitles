[00:00]
you need to divorce two brains if you're
a product builder in the space one is
like why you're building and what you're
building what you're excited about and
the second is like the generative greed
t-gen greed on like trading and then
making money because I'm like if you let
the two brains come together it's gonna
get very messy for you and your
enthusiasm your motivation is going to
be this like toxic mix of like why are
you building you know
um and so I think obviously for anyone
that's in it for degenerative to DJ and
greed uh they've lost a ton of
enthusiasm as things pull down and then
you gotta like you know like seek
shelter but I think for a lot of people
they're building it for well I would
call the right reasons which are like
The Primitives are changing and it's the
promise of like a better future
foreign
of the where it happens podcast
welcome welcome
today's episode I want to start off by
telling a little story

[01:01]
telling a little story
when I was 21 I was working on a app
called five by and it was this video
discovery app that allowed you to find
the most interesting videos on YouTube
and I was living in Canada at the time
but I had to make a trip to Silicon
Valley I had to see like where all these
big companies uh started and and Grew
From so I went there for a few weeks and
I got introduced to this entrepreneur
who had started and sold a company uh to
Google I was already following him on
Twitter so someone who I knew about
so I was really excited to meet him
and I met him for coffee
I remember it was super rainy out and I
you know I walk in there wet a few
minutes late and I was just so excited
to be there
um I apologize for being late
and I asked him you know what are you up
to what are you up to now
and he told me about how he was starting
a video discovery at how he had raised

[02:02]
a video discovery at how he had raised
millions of dollars and I just I felt my
stomach turn I was like oh my God is
this
is this my ideas he's is he working on
my idea
of course he couldn't be
but I ended up asking him to tell me
more about it and I said hey could you
could you maybe show me what you're
working on
so he pulls up his laptop and he starts
pulling up the mock-ups for this app
and literally pixel for Pixel
it was the same like we had the same
idea
and
I cringe right I was just I was this
early 20s uh you know not as much
experience as him living in Canada he
was this big shot raised millions of
dollars had hired all these Google
engineers
uh and it was tough and at the time
you know I left that coffee shop and I
didn't really have

[03:00]
didn't really have
um like a support network of
entrepreneurs to to to to call and say
like you know to to voice how I'm
feeling
and that's why this episode I wanted to
bring on my good friend Danny Trin uh
later I moved to San Francisco and Danny
became one of those friends who I could
definitely vent with and I think that
it's really important for entrepreneurs
Founders makers to have someone or
ideally multiple people
that they could be real with uh so
during this episode there's tons of gems
from Danny uh about the importance of
having that support network
um and you know I hope you really like
the episode before we bring on Danny
Trin I wanted to make an announcement
the reason why we started the where it
happens podcast was we wanted to give
you
an inside
look into what happens behind closed
doors there's so many conversations of

[04:01]
doors there's so many conversations of
well-known people happening behind
closed doors what if these conversations
we're open to everyone what if it was
like a FaceTime basically
um that you know two well-known
entrepreneurs are having that was public
and one of the things I realized you
know we've done a ton of interviews is
the most interesting conversations
happen with makers they happen with
builders
and they happen in these three
categories Community people
Commerce people and creators
and why well it's because those people
are shaping the world
and we're Shifting the format to only
interview those types of people so if
you're interested in those categories
you are going to be so excited about the
guests we have lined up
uh the other quick announcement is my
co-host sahil Bloom is no longer going
to be co-hosting with me it's just going
to be me
um he's focusing on his book and I'm

[05:01]
um he's focusing on his book and I'm
focusing on this podcast uh as well as
my company late checkout so I'm excited
uh for him and I'm I'm really excited
about where the podcast is going and I
know you're going to enjoy uh this
conversation with Danny Tran and what
we've got cooking for you because it is
incredible thank you well well speaking
of that by the way I remember the last
time I was on it's crazy to think that
it was six months ago so much has
changed this year I feel like at the end
you all were jokingly mentioning
particle and I think I joked I was like
are you all behind particle let me tell
you part of full since that time good
Lord I I feel like I see it everywhere
and um it's just been uh it's been crazy
to see good for them you know yeah so
you want to do you want to describe what
particle is for people who didn't listen
to that episode and why why you might
think it's interesting
yeah I mean it's like it's a paperless
posts uh brought into the new era for
mobile uh or like you know for SMS and

[06:01]
mobile uh or like you know for SMS and
just the way people might do invites and
as obviously things like Facebook events
and other things have died uh there's
been obviously a need for to make it
really easy to organize
um and at least here in New York I've
been seeing particle go out but even
some of those birthday party or or
whatnot or dinner it is sent out a
particle link
um and it's really smart you know it's
on SMS
um it's like sorry it's a website that
you can say text or snap to somebody
um yeah I've just been genuinely
surprised to see that it like has
Consolidated and it's like the thing for
sending out like a really quick
impromptu invite you know
yeah I think what's cool about it is
like when I when I chatted with the
founder she was like yeah it's basically
like I don't know paperless post but for
Gen Z and
when I when I go to websites where it's
like hey is this product for Gen Z or
it's this product for Millennials like
that never works like you can't say it's
for that person you just kind of have to
like when I go to I just went to the

[07:00]
like when I go to I just went to the
particle website
and it's like it's not like it says gen
Z anywhere on this website
yeah just like I mean
I I know nothing about the team behind
it but uh I wish them all a success it's
pretty cool uh especially in a space
it's so crowded or it's full of so many
uh it's me dead folks who've tried it
out uh yeah wait who are the particle
founders
today's episode is brought to you by a
company and product that has literally
changed my life and one that I use every
single day I started taking ag1 in 2011
because I wanted to feel great
it's been a staple of my morning routine
ever since yeah that's 10 years and 99
compliant
I met the CEO when we were training at
the same strength training facility way
back in the day
he had been creating an early version of
the product to battle his own gut health
issues when he realized how challenging
and expensive it was to create an

[08:00]
and expensive it was to create an
optimal routine on your own I started
taking it during those college baseball
years and was completely hooked
over the years it has kept me feeling on
point physically and mentally the best
part it fits into whatever lifestyle or
Diet I'm currently experimenting with
from keto to paleo to vegan and more
it's a tiny micro habit that you can
execute daily that has large long-term
and compounding benefits
the product has over seven thousand five
star reviews and is trusted by a long
list of professional athletes and
leading Health experts I love it they do
and I know you will too
to make it easy athletic greens is going
to give you a free one-year supply of
immune supporting vitamin D and five
free travel packs with your first
purchase all you have to do is visit
athleticgreens.com
wih again that is athleticgreens.com
wih to take ownership over your health
and pick up the ultimate daily

[09:00]
and pick up the ultimate daily
nutritional Insurance you won't regret
it for the last 10 years I've been
building internal tools to help my sales
teams or engineering teams work at
blazing speeds
but the catch with internal tools is
it's really hard to build from scratch
and maintaining them also requires a lot
of engineering work and it's just
frankly super tedious
thankfully there's now a retool retool
is a much faster way to build internal
tools it has a complete library of a
hundred plus fully featured accessible
UI components that you can just drag and
drop into any interface
retools platform lets you build the
custom internal tools your team needs 10
times faster
it's a one platform to build your
interface you can connect any data
source any API and publish employee
facing apps in record time
it's also super flexible you can write

[10:02]
it's also super flexible you can write
custom code nearly anywhere to customize
how your app looks and works
and app environments SSO permissions and
other critical app functionality are all
available completely out of the box
the result
you can build production grade internal
tools without the wasted effort of
Googling component libraries debugging
dependencies or rewriting boilerplate
code
thousands of teams at companies like
Amazon doordash NBC late checkout
collaborate around custom built retooled
apps to operate faster operate better
also teams of up to five can build
retool apps for free so
you shouldn't be surprised why we're big
ritual fans at where it happens to learn
more you just gotta go to retool.com
um I only met one of them
I'm blanking on her name her name is

[11:02]
I'm blanking on her name her name is
let's see hold up
[Music]
um
I think her name is Joy Tau oh no Shreya
that's who I met
um
and yeah she's probably in her mid-20s
really product design or like Focus like
you can see it in the product like it
feels very much like I mean you get it
it's like
when you use the particle product it
like it feels really good when you use
Eventbrite like you want to take a
shower
um yeah well I don't remember the last
movie was Eventbrite but uh yeah I guess
and by the way it looks like you just
used Eventbrite because you know that
hair is looking looking real real real
real clean you know oh yeah exactly yeah
I just got it I just got out of an event
right uh session that's why
uh yeah for the listeners I just I just
took a shower so yeah
well yeah I guess uh what else what are
you seeing these days do you see
anything fun lately the the caught your

[12:02]
anything fun lately the the caught your
eye
um I'm curious like you know I've been
seeing a lot of stuff you know we
chatted a little bit about web3
um
you know obviously a lot has changed in
web 3 over the last six months
um and it was just right before this uh
in between shower and this call I was I
was uh
I was reading Koopa troopas uh
newsletter around music nfts
yeah
um
and I've just been fascinated with like
web3 and music uh thinking about
royalties thinking about like
you know the role of the label
um curious your perspective
um on music nfts and then also just in
web 3 in general like
um yeah what is change are you still
bullish
you know talk to me
yeah I mean it's two things a especially

[13:00]
yeah I mean it's two things a especially
music entities definitely not my bag
um I know a lot of people who were
really kind of excited about it or and I
know there's a lot of energy there I
think obviously a lot remains to be seen
so you know
um I think it's also actually something
randomly it was like it's called like
sounds XYZ or something they released as
like some protocol or something and
anyways very excited for them or like
whatever finding out visit they are
there but I think that's the question is
there they're there so I think you have
all these people like kind of just
telling each other it's going to be
awesome or it's the future
um without you know a ton behind it and
but I but that's not to take away from
um than them trying to change uh the
foundation of it all I think web3 in
general kind of reminds me of web 2
right now and that like I don't think a
lot of people remember web 2 how web 2
at least from where I'm sitting ended
and that you had this like oh the future
the web is social and you had all these
like microblogging competitors you're
like oh web2 is so exciting it is Ajax
we're gonna age it everything's gonna be

[14:01]
we're gonna age it everything's gonna be
alive and it's gonna be awesome but
there was definitely a moment where like
things got really tough and rough like
2008-ish or like things Consolidated a
lot of that stuff is now dead you know
and it's nothing wrong with those
Founders or those people but just you
know even though there was this
generation you know the internet
becoming more modern or things that we
now accept to be table sticks a lot of
stuff was cleared out and I think you
know as we're in Winter we're so firmly
in winter again uh you know there's
there's a natural consolidation
happening of like you know some of the
less sturdy and frankly some of the more
hypey noisy stuff uh is getting washed
away
um and it's yeah it's force and folks to
go back and focus it's like you know
it's Beyond Winter now it's like a
nuclear winter it's like
um I think it's bigger than any of the
just web3 stuff it's like the world we
live in today
um where where it's just really really
rough I mean one thing so I'll segue
really quickly like I'm pretty excited
about October 11th uh Japan's opening

[15:00]
about October 11th uh Japan's opening
its borders for like non-business
um excuse travel and it's like the US
dollar versus the yen is an all-time
crazy High
um and it's like that's a bang got
nothing to do with like crypto that's
just the world we live in like the you
know things are just getting crazy and
hectic like they think that the Euros at
a 20-year historic low against the
dollar and whatever like all I'll say is
um it's kind of a crazy time we live and
so I think web3 yeah suffering or like
that entire generation of companies
right now but so many others are too
um so it's uh it's interesting to watch
because I I will say I think some of the
best most resilient Founders and teams
tend to get started or tend to survive
improve themselves for surviving periods
like this
um and you know this period is far from
even over or frankly even getting
started I think we're still in the free
fall into like in this is the depth of
some Darkness so
um yeah God wishing godspeed to all the

[16:01]
um yeah God wishing godspeed to all the
folks out there trying to darndest to
stay afloat and uh keep building and
stay focused um yeah
could you uh
yeah could you talk like
I want I want to come back to the web
three thing but I want to actually jump
to to web 2 for a second living in San
Francisco during the Heyday our buddy
Addison just sent us a uh who's also you
know in that in that scene just sent us
a text message of like a video of our
buddy Jeff and a few other people just
like being in San Francisco at that era
and you know social era mobile was
coming out it felt like really exciting
um could you talk more about like and
and you were in it too dude like you
were yeah you were at dig which was like
one of the most you know
hottest startups in Social at the time
path when the hottest mobile startups at
the time talk like what was it like in
your in your mind being in SF at that

[17:01]
your in your mind being in SF at that
time
yeah um because like we've got thousands
of listeners who just like
what weren't they what one thing one one
thing I'd say is that okay
definitely 2008 you know financial crash
in its own right you know that's that's
the year I got to SF
um you know everyone now knows SF to be
displaced for people like way overpaid
like the minimum like salary out of
college for a good CS degree is like
something crazy you know like everyone
basically has expense Lifestyles with
like free mini kitchens and laundry and
buses and stuff
um and I think the one thing I'll say is
like when you get to SF 2008 like there
wasn't a ton of money floating around
like it wasn't like every company that
was alive was over funded and you know
there was just cash everywhere it was
kind of like this
um
is this place where you you went there
because you just attracted to hanging
out and seeing what other people were
building you know and it wasn't because
it was super lucrative I'd argue you
know Facebook sorry Googled gone public

[18:00]
know Facebook sorry Googled gone public
but it really was probably until
Facebook idea
2012 or so when things got kind of kind
of crazy you know
um and so I'd say what was great about
that period that's around the same time
you know Addison and what was out there
and that we all you know so many friends
friends that I keep to this day lifelong
friends were made was it was just like
hey uh what do you have to what do you
build in uh my first apartment was in
Hayes Valley because it was the place I
could afford not because Hayes Valley
which is now like the cool the cool kids
little mid-market area like it's not
just like you you would kind of just
surviving and and and trying to build
stuff and like again it wasn't this
crazy like overvalued time it was just a
lot of fun I think frankly there were so
many people that had such bad terrible
apocalyptic experiences with the first
bubble like 2000s
that they would almost like laugh about
this idea web 2 or people doing startups
again
um and like trying to make businesses or
whatnot figure it out and you know a lot
of that was fair because a lot of those
companies didn't make it uh what's funny
is some of them are still still going

[19:00]
is some of them are still still going
strong today
um
yeah and I it was a fun time I think
what was cool about SF in that time
in or you know I don't know if your
question is just about SF or web 2 but I
think what was so cool about the time
was you'd bump shoulders casually with
some of the best Builders ever with like
No Agenda and there was no ego it's just
like hey whoa like oh you're working on
that like oh tell me more uh and you're
like do you want to get a burrito like
you can walk around the mission like get
a Fair leader or something or grab beer
somewhere and and it was uh it was just
a really I don't know it was it was just
so yeah yeah a couple things so
first of all I completely agree like the
start like today like there's tons of
startups that are like flush with cash
back then like even the startups that
were quote unquote flush with cash like
when we we didn't there wasn't that much
money there it was very much like us
versus them like didn't path you know I

[20:00]
versus them like didn't path you know I
don't know if yeah path was tried or
Google tried to buy path at one time and
I remember like I think it was like 100
million dollars or more and I remember
like everyone was kind of like no we
can't do like path users were like no no
way they can't do it like it it felt
very us and them though I mean I guess
it feels like that a little bit uh or
sorry it felt very US versus them back
then it still feels that way a little
bit now but it's not it was way it felt
way more of that back then back then do
you agree
yeah I think back then everything was
just a little faster loose because you
didn't know but you didn't know right
like I think 2010 that that particular
year things changed the iPhone 4 changed
like it was like a seismic shift right
finally the camera was good enough right
and then in the following years as
connections got better and like the
mobile your Cellular Connection got
better there's a seismic shift and so
there was no like right or wrong way to
do things right whereas I'd say like if
you look at consumer now

[21:01]
you look at consumer now
like I I think it's a pain cave for a
Founder to go out without some angle or
strategy on how they're going to get
distribution you know like what
advantage they're gonna have because say
you make something great
it's gonna get copied or snatched up by
somebody so fast you know
um and and so yeah I think especially
around then it was a little bit of the
wild west but you didn't know like you
were undergoing the shift in Mobile a
lot and
I know there's that I'm tired so low-mo
movement which made me cringe at the
time it still makes me cringe to say it
out loud today uh but like explain what
that is yeah for people who don't know
what that is
well they're pillars that now sound
really damn obvious which is like can
you make social location mobile
um experiences or companies and products
and yeah at the time it was an entire
wave right like it began with like the
first bit I think it's you know South by
2009 where you had um Foursquare in
guala you know and it's like it now
seems so medieval and primitive to be
like oh my phone knows where DPS I might

[22:01]
like oh my phone knows where DPS I might
be able to check in to a place where I'm
at right and obviously so many people
have built on that right
um but I yeah it's there was this crazy
Cambrian explosion of people you know
taking different bits and Legos and
assembling different ideas you know off
of these like big new things that were
unlocked right like gowala was the
competitor and it's cool to see Josh
Williams and Co and he's gotten like a
lot of that original koala team back and
they're out trying to do it again
um but you know Google was the exact
same time and was building some very
different things with like these little
collectibles
uh and little like passports you know
that you you could uh you could drop or
leave for others you know and so those
were just the first two like I didn't
you know there were so many other
companies that got going around that
time you know obviously Instagram won it
all at that time
um you know but but there's so many
others right like they're
so again it's it's a
yeah it's
it kind of is a reminder that like at

[23:01]
it kind of is a reminder that like at
any given moment especially like when
you talk about web3 or anything like
next generation of companies yeah a ton
of the things that sound great and
awesome are probably gonna go you know
be be like be you know erased or or or
or or not make it but
um yeah it was it was a fun time
yeah sorry my mind just randomly thought
of Vine for a second and I was like oh I
miss I miss Vine I don't know Vine it's
firmly under the solo it was definitely
a social and mobile
um it's not a location stuff in there
but uh yeah Vine mine is crazy
um yeah yeah I mean I think like
Vine had a magic moment for so many
people when people downloaded it and it
felt just so different like it was six
seconds I think right those six second
videos and
um it was also so you know we're talking
about particle like really well designed
like Vine was also really well designed
um totally right
um yeah I think the other cool thing
about it was

[24:00]
about it was
you I mean it was the precursor to tick
tock of course but like you could post
something
on Instagram get no love but post
something on Vine and like
you know yeah I have a friend you know I
had random like my friend Jerome jarr
who got like millions of followers on
Vine was like this random french guy who
just would have funny videos and then
changed his life you know and I yeah I
think that's the crazy the crazy part to
me is that probably there's there's
hundreds of millions there's a
generation of tick tock
um either users or creators who probably
may not even remember Vine but uh yeah
Vine is definitely in the DNA you know
like the looping video the talent show
like how how funny can you be within
those constraints you know
um even the idea of stitching things
together right like obviously Bond
wasn't the first to do that but they
were the first really to bring that
um you know that mechanic out there and
yeah I miss it now yeah I don't think
they they they die to slow and painful
death

[25:00]
death
um but you know it's just the nature of
our industry right it's like everyone's
kind of building on the shoulders of
other people
um yeah and that's uh what a good app I
guess that's kind of where I want to
shift gears a bit which is
okay I figured it out I want to shift
gears to we we lived in San Francisco in
our 20s during the height of
you know social and mobile and we we
partook in that economy and we had some
really high highs and some really low
lows
um right yeah I can picture them now and
um there's a whole like we were the
young kids then like we were the Gen Z
back then right like we were we were the
up and comers now and we're in our 30s
like we're we've been there and done
that and we're kind of older so
what do you like what can we what do you
take away from your time doing Social
Mobile SF
that you can impart

[26:00]
that you can impart
to the Next Generation in terms of how
do you build products that are gonna
they're you know that people are gonna
love
you you know one thing I'd say
there's a lot to unpacked there but but
it's funny when you said Ben there done
that I I actually something I try to
pride myself in is this notion of The
Beginner's mind
um but just because you know you maybe
maybe learned a particularly painful
lesson or you learned you tried
something that didn't work
um that you can like continue to like
keep that freshness and that enthusiasm
so it can keep exploring you know things
you're interested in
um it's funny how I said I would never
work in consumer social again but look
at where I am now
um and it's like we end up back here
um one one thing I'd say is
with the benefit of hindsight on that
time was the joy of beginning the joy of
starting was a superpower right like
something I tell all kinds of young
people is when they get started
especially designers and creatives our
industry is like you may not be money

[27:01]
industry is like you may not be money
rich but you're definitely time rich and
when you have when you're time wealthy
which means you have like a ton of times
like work nights and weekends and like
work ABF like uh on a schedule that it
would be uncomfortable for a lot of
other people who have other lifestyle
whatever who have like kids or whatever
um there's nothing wrong with having
kids by the way
um it's just that you you can try more
things and you can be a beginner much
more frequently
um and that's something I think is super
important you know like especially as
our industry gets Fuller and Fuller
people just like you and I who had a
certain set of experiences and certain
years out there because all these people
want to tell you like how you should be
doing things or how you should approach
things or let me tell you about that
time we were growing LinkedIn or let me
tell you about that time we were making
Tinder grow on you USC new UCLA's campus
and it's like okay sure maybe it worked
that way then but it may not work that
way now and I I think that that was one
thing in SF that really caught on I I if
so my most painful memories are like and
you're listening to The Experts they're

[28:01]
you're listening to The Experts they're
listening to like the like you know the
people who've been there done that tell
you how you need to be growing or tell
you how you need to be approaching a
problem
um you know it was it was uh it was
often really bad advice
um and so yeah there's one story that
actually resonates really specifically
with me which is we were you know all in
on mobile and like building out apps for
the iPhone and Android
um and literally there was someone who
insisted that because his grandmother
didn't have a smartphone when you like
dedicate Two web Engineers to sending
out an email digest to her uh for her to
like you know
um be able to follow and in hindsight
now the I would tell that person to [ __ ]
off but in the moment you're like oh wow
this is a very experienced smart person
who's telling us about the total
addressable whatever being about that
and the other okay yes let's spend two
of our four web Engineers if that makes
sense right
um and and yeah what I'd say I don't
want to cherry pick on that person
um but I'd say like in general

[29:02]
um but I'd say like in general
SF I'll probably carry these values with
me lifelong that there will always be
some notion of like experts or like the
right people telling you how things need
to be and especially in consumer the way
you would grow is constantly evolving
right it's so Dynamic
um yeah I'm curious for you but your
Tech because I know that you we had we
experience of the highest size and
lowest lows together I'm very curious
for you uh if you flip the question on
you
um you know what comes to mind
well I mean going back to our earlier
conversation about where the Pod is
going like
I want to bring on Builders like I don't
want to bring on VCS
like and I I think that and this is kind
of a hot take I think but
just because you invest in a company
doesn't mean it's your company so a lot
of VCS what they'll say is
oh one of our companies oh I am so they
invested out of their fund which they
invested from LPS so not even their own

[30:01]
invested from LPS so not even their own
money yeah they're going and they invest
and then they're saying oh particle yeah
that's one of our companies
yeah sorry sorry Chad
um yeah but just because you wired the
money
does not you were not in the trenches
and you were not in the trenches you
play a meaningful role in your
connection with the business and it
wouldn't exist in its current state
without you
but but I still but I still think that
you know I'd much rather when I when I'm
training notes around building consumer
products I want to talk to Shreya I
don't want to talk to yeah the VC here
yeah
like I think yeah all perspectives are
valuable that I I can agree with you
that I know there's some sometimes folks
like VCS well like it's almost like a
claiming credit for the success of like
a singular credit
I mean it's like yeah of course you help
him but like if it's yes it's a little
dirty when when they it's almost like
they're taking credit for for the
success of this it was especially funny

[31:01]
success of this it was especially funny
though is like when they take credit
years after or like talk shade what's
worse is not even taking credit when
they talk when they talk shade on the
founder who has been successful after
them or whatever and I think that's the
entire other tangent
um but yeah man like uh Builders tend to
be the most fun to hang out with you
know shared misery and shared Joy you
know uh of of the process and
yeah I don't know I mean that's how
that's how we bonded like we bonded I
don't know if you remember but we it was
right before you you know you had a trip
out we went to what was that beer garden
yeah yeah and I remember exactly where
we were we were we were at the second
level
and you were just telling me about free
which you should tell people what it was
because it was like ahead of its time so
like crazy ahead of its time and it was

[32:00]
like crazy ahead of its time and it was
so right on so many levels and you were
having a hard time frankly like in you
know yeah and
[Music]
you know not because you weren't
executing well just because startups are
difficult and consumer social is
difficult and teams are hard and and it
and we were bonding over that shared
misery I think um but yeah tell folks
what we was the timing
you know because I think it's relevant
well so I'll give some context that
basically a path one of my my last
things that were done was our messenger
and I remember I literally put like the
Targaryen symbol the dragon symbol from
Game of Thrones on the room when we ship
that messenger and mind you this is
before Facebook Messenger got their act
together like Facebook Messenger like
you suppose like a very basic thing at
the time
um and and we wanted to really build
like what would be what would be paths
take you know on a messenger and like
kind of went crazy there and so I'll say
is from building that messenger saw holy
cow the numbers around a messenger are

[33:02]
cow the numbers around a messenger are
just different you know like we also
technically have the same loop as
stories but you now would consider
stories where you could post a photo and
someone like no post a photo once a day
and like come back like five ten times a
day to see who else has seen it because
that's what we call them scene it's
empath
um but the numbers change for Messenger
like the the amount of time someone uses
that if the message are just like crazy
right and so I was like okay I really
want to go build a messenger but I want
to build a messenger
um with a purpose and the purpose is
like it owns that first message in the
conversation and the classic picture
I'll tell everyone is it reminds me of
like this season sorry joke where he
says like if you look on my phone on a
Sunday I was like a psycho because I'm
texting all my friends hey I want to
grab brunch hey want to grab Brown she
want to grab brunch you know
um I think our friend Nikita has a funny
joke which is like every social founder
at one point tries to make an app for
like getting people to hang out together
IRL
um and it's it's so true I think free is
definitely my my uh my my version of
that lesson
um I think free yeah it was it was the

[34:01]
um I think free yeah it was it was the
the other way I would refer to it was
like I grew up on ale and some messenger
and I missed the Green Dot when you'd go
home sign in and see your buddy let's
see who's green and like for the green
people you can chat with them and they
were your friends and I wanted that for
the real world and so I just wanted to
see who was free at any given moment
kind of like the hornagon door or like
the bat signal whatever
we built it I won't bore you with all
the details or build more of the people
your little details but
um solve so many problems I think there
are pieces of its new user experience
and onboarding that still echo in a lot
of apps today
um you know I I made a ton of fun
building it but also yeah a ton of Joy a
ton of misery
um and yeah I think
when at the time I I also remember
distinctly that they were in Southern
Pacific I I think it was one of those
moments where I was a Founder you kind
of like you have you start to get a
muscle for sketching out
9 12 and 18 months in advance even which
at the time as a 22 23 year old I was
not very good at you know

[35:00]
not very good at you know
um and I was like damn I think I think
this isn't I don't know I don't know I
don't know what's happening here
um and and what I'll say is I think a
lot of my conversation with other
Founders today and I see myself and so
many Founders I hang with today like
it's that realization of like damn
I don't know who else I can talk with
like this you know because think about
it with a team you have to give great
you know you're trying to keep the
inspiration like that that energy on
Mondays and get through the week of like
yeah here's the vision and like maybe
your investor updates maybe you don't
know truly how to be that candid like
you know you know or to speak that
bluntly because you also want to like
Inspire confidence and faith in the team
I think it's a very special type of like
trusted relationship it can't be with
investors too but or like other Founders
or operators you you you you you trust
but it's a very specific type of
relationship where you can kind of share
that you know
um and and talk through it and really
sketch out all the options you know for
what they'll all look like
um yeah and I remember that day it was
it was a special day and a special

[36:00]
it was a special day and a special
weekend but we don't have to dive into
that
um you know I uh yeah but um that was
that was a good that was that was a
meaningful that was a really meaningful
time for the last 10 years I've been
building internal tools to help my sales
teams or engineering teams work at
blazing speeds
but the catch with internal tools is
it's really hard to build from scratch
and maintaining them also requires a lot
of engineering work and it's just
frankly super tedious
thankfully there's now a retool retool
is a much faster way to build internal
tools it has a complete library of a
hundred plus fully featured accessible
UI components that you can just drag and
drop into any interface
retools platform lets you build the
custom internal tools your team needs 10
times faster
it's a one platform to build your
interface you can connect any data
source any API and publish employee

[37:01]
source any API and publish employee
facing apps in record time
it's also super flexible you can write
custom code nearly anywhere to customize
how your app looks and works
and app environments SSO permissions and
other critical app functionality are all
available completely out of the box
the result
you can build production grade internal
tools without the wasted effort of
Googling component libraries debugging
dependencies or rewriting boilerplate
code
thousands of teams at companies like
Amazon doordash NBC late checkout
collaborate around custom built retooled
apps to operate faster operate better
also teams of up to five can build
retool apps for free so
you shouldn't be surprised why we're big
ritual fans at where it happens to learn
more you just got to go to retool.com

[38:00]
more you just got to go to retool.com
today's episode is brought to you by a
company and product that has literally
changed my life and one that I use every
single day
I started taking ag1 in 2011 because I
wanted to feel great
it's been a staple of my morning routine
ever since yeah that's 10 years and 99
compliant
I met the CEO when we were training at
the same strength training facility way
back in the day
he had been creating an early version of
the product to battle his own gut health
issues when he realized how challenging
and expensive it was to create an
optimal routine on your own I started
taking it during those college baseball
years and was completely hooked over the

fits into whatever lifestyle or Diet I'm

wih to take ownership over your health
and pick up the ultimate daily
nutritional Insurance you won't regret
it yeah I think
um
you do have to put on a bit of a face
when you're talking to your team or VCS
or advisors like it's it's hard to be a
hundred percent unfiltered but with
other builders it's hard not to be
it's hard to be anything but 100

[40:01]
it's hard to be anything but 100
unfiltered right so it's your time to be
like okay here's what's really going
down I'd really love your opinion on XYZ
and I don't think I don't know if I've
said this on the Pod yet but
um
every year me and a group of uh six or
seven entrepreneurs used to rent a house
in La
um and it was like a mastermind
basically of Founders and we actually
hired a moderator and we hired like a
chef and I know this is sound bougie as
hell but like not you know initially not
not a lot of us had money we just like
poured it into this and
we would sit there and we would all work
on each you know work with each other
unfiltered Mastermind Founders and like
we had like Sean paulry was one of those
Founders
um Julian Smith who you know who's been
on he's a guest friend of the Pod uh you
know he came up with breather there
um I came up with Islands there flow

[41:00]
um I came up with Islands there flow
water Nicholas Reichenbach who create
you know it's in every Whole Foods
Across the Nation he came up with it
there uh it's not publicly traded
company and
I've been thinking a lot about
masterminds and I want people to hit me
up if this is interesting to them
um but like we gotta we gotta we gotta
we gotta we gotta bring it back you know
I think it'd be I think it'd be awesome
to to bring it back
yeah I think it's awesome also because
like especially because so many of us
live on Twitter and and places like that
where it's just like
you just
okay there's a couple things so people
are you know spend a lot of time on
Twitter and you can't really get
feedback really on places like that and
then big events big conferences and
stuff like that
is just like you're not it's so hard to
find your people there so like these
smaller like six to eight ten high
quality trusted people bring them
together do you know do a proper

[42:00]
together do you know do a proper
um I feel like that first of all no I
feel like that's
a huge opportunity for Founders and also
like I feel like it needs to exist and
all like I also think you can build a
business around that
I I tell you I'm just a weird epiphany
of the day not Epiphany but just like
how I think of things I mean it's funny
that we're talking about this is such a
public or a semi-public uh a forum but
it's like the more public a place is
even if it's for discussion you know
conversation the more judgment there is
right and I think judgment like the
level of judgment in an area
is inversely uh correlated to how like
actually meaningful the interactions are
going to be you know like I think that
on Twitter you're like oh it went viral
with the 100 300 000 likes you know you
feel this like dopamine rip of like wow
all these awesome people may have liked
it or a lot of people saw it but like
how meaningful was that versus a room

[43:00]
how meaningful was that versus a room
that's low judgment where someone can
bring up some really deep [ __ ] or like
some whatever's on their chest and like
talk about it and know that like no this
is not like something that's gonna be
people like screenshot and share around
and all that toxic you know whatever
stuff is going to go there but it's a
meaningful place and so yeah I I think
about at least for Builders you thrive
in low judgment zones
um look I've never been to Burning Man
and I think everyone has a there say
it's now actually a high judgment Zone
from the from the the Peta gallery of
like what actually happened to burning
man these days but I think the idea of a
place where people can actually kind of
let their hair down and be themselves
amongst the similar all you know amongst
other people whether they know them well
or not and into and to share ideas and
talk through their [ __ ] sounds kind of
awesome so anyways your masterminds
sound dope I mean I love the I'd love to
join the the one that you the first one
you do when you bring them back you know
yeah I mean
maybe we can even share this like I
think it needs to be sort of like it
also needs to be fun right like so we

[44:01]
also needs to be fun right like so we
would do
you know 50 like structured okay
everyone has a certain amount of time
these are the questions you can ask like
I think the structure is really
important that's why the moderator is
key here the whole thing
and then we would have fun at like night
times like dinners going out I don't
know if we can show this image I I saw
like on a
like you know one time the only time
I've shot a gun was in LA at one of
these events
um oh and uh yeah maybe we can like post
the like in the show notes I'll I'll
find the the picture it was like 12
years ago
by the way non-sponsored uh plug if you
ever want a cool place to shoot guns in
a place that isn't about shooting guns
drivetanks.com
uh I don't even know if it's still
around but it's in the mid it's like two
hours outside of Austin you can
literally Drive tanks and then the belt
it's like it's very safe to take care of
it for you and should you desire to you
know build like a used car like they'll

[45:01]
know build like a used car like they'll
let you aim the cannon and shoot it also
you let you shoot a Howitzer I actually
now remember you can also shoot actual
guns like like decals like miniguns it's
very safe very supervised very like team
off-site e energy but uh it's a great
place to you know like go blow off some
steam you know it's pretty cool yeah I
mean listen I'm uh
I think uh if you're gonna do an
off-site Mastermind type thing like that
like put it around something like that
so you also have these like new
experience like how many times have you
driven a tank like for me like never
right so then like not that I really
want to drive a tank at all or shoot a
gun but like the fact that I'm gonna do
this with this group is like a bonding
experience yeah I I'm sorry I just open
drivetanks.com and look at their Sizzle
reel on their front page and uh it's
it's pretty it's pretty awesome you know
I I kind of
oh man this is a literally amazing first
of all wow so what I'm looking at is I

[46:01]
of all wow so what I'm looking at is I
can't I can't believe this exists it
looks like
dude it's a tank literally going over a
fully like
tank that could be in Iraq or whatever
like going over a car
and like shooting missiles from it
I look I've done this I've done the like
crush a car underneath it I've
definitely done the shot and I actually
like this website's pretty good
um you know like when they talk about
like it was conversion like front page
conversions I'm like it's so simple it's
called drytanks.com the three offerings
or drive a tank shoot a tank shoot big
guns uh you know uh they they got to the
point really quickly so it's um it's
pretty good
okay I'm pulling up the price list I'm
curious how much
this cost
wow okay
so there's a bunch of Tanks they've got
like 12 different types of Tanks
I gotta be real with you all I have no
idea what the different tanks are but
the the cheapest tank to drive is gonna

[47:02]
the the cheapest tank to drive is gonna
cost you
uh 600 bucks
um yeah which is totally doable the most
expensive like baller you came up with a
billion dollar idea today at the end of
The Mastermind is the stug three it's
twenty two hundred dollars
you know some good and then yeah it's uh
I you know I'm not I'm really not here
to plug them I think they have some
packages too but you know hey uh for
what people spend on like bottle service
in the club versus uh a once in a
lifetime memory driving a tank you know
I think they're they're you know
um yeah
cool no I'm happy you made it I'm happy
you talked about that so no I think yeah
I think it's really important to to
drive tanks at your at your at your
Mastermind and I think like
um
yeah just do do things that are that are
going to open you up both on on the
structured piece of it of coming up with
ideas but also on the

[48:00]
ideas but also on the
bonding piece of it too
yeah
um yeah cool
going back
we talked a little bit about you know
sort of web 2 SF
and but before that we talked about web3
and I wanna I wanna understand what what
Danny Trends current state you know lay
of the land of how you're feeling about
web3 and and right now oh gosh I I think
uh my my short answer would be you know
it is it is definitely absurdly winter I
think there's a lot of really cool
people that I'm seeing charging forward
and continuing to build
um and I think it's it's it's kind of
poetic that one of them is is Kevin you
know I think he recently just moved down
to LA and like there's really building
out the proof team for my understanding
there and like really going for it
um
yeah and it's yeah and it's it's um
excuse me last week
yeah I just realized that a bunch of
other great people uh in that same in

[49:00]
other great people uh in that same in
the same crew and family are all there
and kind of pushing and so I'll say like
it's kind of awesome to see you know
um yeah there's that same kind of uh
what's the right word for it um
yeah the the perseverance and also the
conviction to keep going like it's
awesome to see now overall web3 a lot of
other crazy [ __ ] like Del Quan you know
he's got Interpol he's got a code red on
out for him uh that's kind of awesome uh
sorry I don't want to I don't wanna
laugh at other people's Misfortune I
think it's just you know there's all
kinds of Corrections on the good and bad
um and yeah it's it's it's it's it's a
spicy time I mean it's it's absolutely
winter so you know a lot of the Jokers
are gonna leave a lot of the tourists
they're gonna leave
um and it's it's Pro it's definitely for
the best I think this time last year
you're probably at Peak hype Mania
uh just blew up like a dad uh not and
okay I wanted probably some fun not bad
that like it was all bad just that there

[50:00]
that like it was all bad just that there
was just a lot of noise that probably
wasn't healthy absolutely is not healthy
um yeah we're back to Winter uh if you
believe in the space you believe in the
space if you're someone who was talking
[ __ ] about it all for the last 18 months
or years you feel very right you feel
very like uh validated uh I don't think
this will be the last winter I I think
that there will absolutely be a future
here
um and yeah I I'm excited to see how it
all goes down
um but yeah I think if anything it's
it's good that teams can be quiet less
distracted like thinking about if you
had a team in this space over the last
18 months
especially on the run-up you're probably
dealing with a bunch of more than 18
months years you're doing a bunch of
crazy distractions or probably
everyone's trying to hire their other
other people constantly wondering like
am I working on the bright thing am I
missing out on like life-changing
opportunity working on something else or
trading something else or whatever and
now that things are more quiet like
there's going to be a ton more folks who
are just focusing like you know
kind of really pure about things and and

[51:00]
kind of really pure about things and and
doing and you know making
the moves they want to make and I think
we'll see where it all nips out who even
knows how the rest of the world Nets out
you know
um right now like I think we're probably
another six to nine months of a minimum
of like
sliding into finding where the bottom
and darkness is
um
so something like definitely you know I
don't think about every day it's not my
it's not my day job
uh but it's definitely something I'm
keeping keeping tabs on you know
yeah how do you um
like
I know I know you've got a day job but I
do know that you're also like a lot of
web 2 Founders in that era like we
talked about Josh Williams like he's in
web3 now Kevin Rose web 2 you know
prolific web 2 founder yeah he's in web3
yeah I've been doing a lot of web3 stuff
and a lot of our friends in that you
know Donnie denge web3 now
um
what do you like why do you think
were attracted to web3 and why do you
think that we're still excited about it

[52:03]
think that we're still excited about it
um and do you have like
are you less or more excited about it
than let's say a year ago
so there's something that there's some
advice I gave about this stuff to
believe
this time last year to someone that was
just getting into it I was like you need
to divorce two brains if you're a
product builder in this space one is
like why you're building and what you're
building what you're excited about and
the second is like the generative greed
DJ and greed on like trading and then
making money because I'm like if you let
the two brains come together it's gonna
get very messy for you and your
enthusiasm your motivation is going to
be this like toxic mix of like why are
you building you know
um and so I think obviously for anyone
that's in it for degenerative to DJ and
greed uh they've lost a ton of
enthusiasm as things pull down and then
you gotta like you know uh seek shelter
but I think for a lot of people they're
building it for well I would call the
right reasons which are like The
Primitives are changing and it's the

[53:00]
Primitives are changing and it's the
promise of like a better future
um
yeah I think a lot of those people and
everyone I talk to is it's almost like
business as usual like they're
continuing on amidst the challenge right
and this is not the first or last time
that the people in this space have dealt
with crazy challenges or being told are
completely wrong and silly like it's
funny to me I actually remember probably
around that time 2016 when you and I
were hanging out in Southern Pacific
where like I feel like it was chat Bots
Ai and crypto we're like the three like
laughing like you could like the butt
end of every joke right like oh remember
that person worked on chatbots another
person worked on crypto stuff remember
that person who worked on AI and it's
kind of funny now at least in 2022 that
I'm like AI like nothing to joke about
with AI like some of the crazy truly
like crazy [ __ ] is happening before our
eyes like making it into a very like
into the mainstream right crypto like
and no one's laughing about I mean you
may laugh at the collapse like if you're
laughing at that collapse laughing at
the economies collapse which is you know
um but you know that's your prerogative

[54:00]
um but you know that's your prerogative
and maybe yeah Chef bats yeah like if
anyone's working on a chatbot now I'd
still be like what are you doing there
uh folks
um but so what I did is like what are
you doing there
like uh that's probably my PC uh it's my
like PC yeah uh whatever but like but
you know Cycles right and like I think
the thing about people who are generally
excited about these things like their
enthusiasm gets tested and retested and
the ones that tended to last through
multiple Winters and do the best are the
ones that keep persisting right like if
you're a conviction in some of these
spaces is so low that you get you know
you you can drop this quickly you
probably aren't working in the right
space you know
um and if anything I think one thing you
can't deny is that the the conversations
change right like the conversation on
the types of people are interested in
this stuff and the types of things
they're building
is is now like we we've opened we've
gone through a one-way door right
because so many major companies so many
major like universes of Ip are are into

[55:02]
major like universes of Ip are are into
this now it's gonna be really exciting
to see what happens
um I I think that's the one thing
about right now you're like oh are you
so excited about it like well
whether I am or not excited about it I'm
absolutely not going to ignore it you
know like the the thing about it right
now is like it's it's typically the
people that ignore shifts like these are
the ones who are the cautionary tales
it's like the Nokia guy talking [ __ ]
about the iPhone you know or or like uh
ever or like all the like the big
consumer web apps that were like they're
kind of [ __ ] on like the move to
Mobile in general you know
um and yeah it's I think typically the
folks who record default dismissive of
of of interesting new things technically
take years to bore out those are the
ones that like uh you know history
always remembers as the fools and so I
think right now look tough times
like guess what been here before
multiple times you know and so I I think
it's um it's interesting to see you know

[56:00]
it's um it's interesting to see you know
so who knows who knows what the solvers
what are your thoughts uh on web free
loyalty I saw a few weeks ago Starbucks
obviously launched uh a really big push
into loyalty I'm curious
uh what you think I think around that
that that's in the I I hope that a
recording of This podcast hasn't become
like a cautionary tale me sounded like
an idiot a few years from now
um I think
my immediate reaction is like it's cool
to see them build it's cool to see an
experiment that's where you're talking
about like sf2008 it's like when I was a
teenager still I'm a youngster and a
beginner's Mind At Art I'm like it's
awesome to see people experimenting if
it doesn't work out I'm like net net
something they did when in that
experiment will probably be a building
block that someone else grabs and uses
and takes off I think Starbucks is
probably going nowhere maybe this is
like the funny quote for like two years
from now Starbucks implodes
um but like I don't think Starbucks is
going anywhere so cool on them to
experiment with some stuff maybe they'll
change and approach maybe they won't you

[57:00]
change and approach maybe they won't you
know it's kind of like motor before the
iPhone Motorola made The Rocker with
apple which is a 99 song limit on it and
everyone thought like this if this is
the iPhone this is not the future I'm
like okay
I think people will experience with
loyalty stuff just as like music
entities are trying to figure out what
the
pardon like yeah what the [ __ ] that
actually all means you know uh but yeah
I think that's essential to getting
there
um there's a book I really love about
like you know like a good model for
Innovation is like you have artists and
soldiers right and like if they're
defined by their relationship with risk
right it's like soldiers are
fundamentally about low risk because you
don't want to kill everybody and artists
are fundamentally about high risk you're
rewarded to take lots of risks and to
fail a lot fail a lot and typically
soldiers and artists hate each other's
guts because they misunderstand each
other like soldiers look at artists and
like you don't do any work you don't
have any discipline you're just trying a
bunch of stuff that goes nowhere and
artists look at soldiers are like you're
so like like unafraid of trying anything
new and like you're so you're like
you're gonna be like left behind and I

[58:01]
you're gonna be like left behind and I
would say that's the moment where we are
right now like in one of these like like
you know Winters where the artists and
the soldiers look at each other and and
and think the other one is the fool
right like the the there are many
artists like you're talking about
some great friends they're going to
continue to push on and try things
Starbucks what not like I think there's
a ton of other companies trying stuff
and the soldiers who are like trying to
survive you know in economic recession
or Worse are looking at them like you
idiots I can't believe you're continuing
to move on you know and that's my take
of right now is that it's it's artists
and soldiers I use this same model
actually like for people who are working
teams where you have an office still you
know the people who come in super early
and we also leave early until we come in
super late and leave late and I'm like
oh there's those two people judge each
other just at different times of the day
like those early people come in they're
like oh I can't believe so-and-so is not
here yet and then those people that come
in late see those early people leaving
earlier like oh I can't believe you're
calling it you're throwing in the towel

[59:01]
calling it you're throwing in the towel
so early you know and and so you know
fleshing out my answer here I I think
when I look at stuff like Starbucks or I
see people trying out stuff I'm like
okay I think I net buys towards the
artist lens which is I love seeing
people try stuff even if it goes you
know to zero and fails because that's
what gives me energy you know like uh
seeing people like take take a shot now
yeah I do I advise the artist's
lifestyle for soldiers or the soldier
lifestyle for artists no
um and so you know I think especially
when you look at something that's
polarizing as web 3 right now it's like
really easy for folks on both sides to
really entrench in their positions
um and so maybe my last thing on this
long ramble I'd say is like I would ask
someone where they think they are like
deep down on it and if they could
empathize for a second for a little bit
with the other side
um and and that that's my my take on
what three is like it's it's a look in
the mirror for how you feel about these
things in general
um and so someone who's a soldier by day

[1:00:00]
um and so someone who's a soldier by day
works a big company life and like only
like scales things looks like two to
five to ten percent God forbid gains uh
looks at some of these moves as like
really risky or like like rear ending
and I'm like okay
that's that's just it's cool that people
are experimenting like it's like and I
think
you know I'm I'm happy that on on the
start you know from a startup of one to
a startup of Starbucks or a company of
Starbucks like that we're kind of
we're not taking the status quo as like
okay this is the world we live in and
like these are the products that exist
now we're gonna like push the envelope
over here push the envelope over here
try different things and we'll find out
what what is going to resonate with with
folks
um yeah but I think I think um I think
it's cool that first of all I love the
soldier
um artist like kind of way of thinking
about it and I also think it's cool that

[1:01:00]
about it and I also think it's cool that
I happen to be on your camp like I love
I like when I see people
um on Twitter for example like
seeing the launch of a startup and being
like
but actually you know like the but
actually guy
um but actually this is a bad idea
because XYZ and it's like no like we
need to celebrate peep builders
yeah I I mean if anything think about
like I look at like this like if you're
a meme account that loves to like trade
on being like you know making hilarious
jokes but other people and God knows I
love a good Meme and I love I love
there's so many accounts I find very
hilarious but net net I think a lot of
those meme accounts Pander to like the
soldier type who likes to be you know
like yeah duh look at that failure like
oh so clearly bad or like oh got him you
know got em yeah I got him and you know
like oh and I'm like okay go back to
your like whatever life you know like
they chuckle at the meme they heart it
and they move on with their like
whatever the [ __ ] they're doing for the

[1:02:00]
whatever the [ __ ] they're doing for the
rest of the day and it's like okay you
know the it is it's it's what makes this
account successful and like uh it's it's
what gets their engagement up you know
and I can't knock that hustle either
because they're slowly trying to like
get EX like blow up and make a business
I'm sure whatever they're doing like it
can be hilarious
um it's just not you know I I'd like to
think in my pure heart that I I'm not
I'm not there even though I know I'm
probably very guilty of that same type
of uh dunking sometimes but yeah like I
think that that it's uh on the on the
spectrum of like soldiered artists like
the audience of the people like getting
giving all that like feedback of I got
them are just like it said not to be
artists you know like that's and that's
fine it's totally fine
um yeah
cool let's uh that's a mic drop I think
that's a lot for people to to digest and
think about where they sit on the
Spectrum
and um artists versus versus Soldier and

[1:03:00]
and um artists versus versus Soldier and
um D Trin you're you're you're you're
your family you know you're not just a

for your format I mean if you call it

literally like your screen recording and
like you're actually it's like it's
about that so they keep it authentic
it's like you kind of tell maybe you
tell it's almost like remember like Who
Wants To Be A Millionaire you would tell
the fellow friend people roughly to be
available in case their friend was on
the show and they're being called but
like you could show literally you're
FaceTiming some people and they're not
there they hang up or like they say like
they don't answer the call and then
finally someone picks up and you're like
Yahtzee you know
um and like and that's who we got this
