[00:00]
in a world in a world of commoditized
products how do you how do you stand out
and become not a product people want to
spend money on but a person that people
want to spend money on yes exactly and
you buy the product because this person
has given me so much value in my
day-to-day life therefore you're like
tipping the Creator's Journey this is
the beginning like this packaging where
the people are in the packaging is the
beginning of a bigger Trend which is
they're going to take more and more real
estate like the chocolate you see over
here like is still 99% of the packaging
and the people is only 2% in the future
I'm sure it'll be like 50% the people
50% the chocolate yeah might even be the
opposite of what it is now where it
might be 90% the people and 10% of
chocolate which could be
[Music]
interesting all right Justin Welsh Mr
solo perur you don't do a lot of

[01:01]
solo perur you don't do a lot of
podcasts and somehow I convince you to
take some time from your vacation to
come on and jam startup ideas with me
and startup ideas for soloer so thanks
for coming on yeah of course man Greg
it's really good to see you and uh you
know I know you swung through my living
area many months ago and we got a chance
to bite tee together and so uh here I am
ready to uh talk s Bas so you have a few
list a few ideas on your list here maybe
let's start with the first one because
it's something I've been thinking about
too you want to you want to hit it yeah
so um I've been thinking about
especially having grown my following and
been approached by some publishing
houses uh in the last year or so just
like the approach to becoming a
published author and I've talked to a
bunch of my friends who are creators or
entrepreneurs and have followings and
and they have kind of some of them have

[02:01]
and they have kind of some of them have
started the book process others have
finished it some are trying to decide
whether or not to get into that that
process and it feels like um it's really
cumbersome and there's a lot of
unanswered questions it feels like the
negotiation um the advance picking the
agent picking the editor and maybe it's
because I'm removed from it and I have
not been through the process um but it
it feels conversome and it feels um a
bit scary intimidating and like you
might get into something without having
all of your questions answered and so
I'm thinking and I made a note here
around AI but I'm thinking through that
process in general and how do we make
that process easier and since I kind of
jotted down some of these ideas I
actually think people are starting to
approach that that problem already I saw
the guys from base camp have come out
with something called once.com I haven't
done a deep dive onto it yet but it
seems to be a way in which to get your

[03:00]
seems to be a way in which to get your
book out pretty quickly I believe that
James clear and Tim Ferris are working
on something um as well that seems at
least tangentially related to to to that
so my big question around that is just
like how do we streamline the process of
becoming a published author for folks
that don't want to go through the really
difficult process of doing so so I think
you're talking about write book which is
the Jason freed product right yeah yeah
yeah maybe it's right book that's right
once.com was the product before that I'm
confusing the to you're right yeah write
book exactly yeah so write book I just
pulled it up instantly publish your own
books on the web for free no publisher
required so this is basically it looks
like it's how do you make book
publishing as easy as
blogging yeah exactly yeah it's under
the once brand here yeah I I like I I
use hey.com which is a product from the
base camp guys and I love all the
Simplicity that they built into their
products and like if anyone is going to
attack that that model this this doesn't

[04:00]
attack that that model this this doesn't
seem to be tied into becoming a you know
New York Times best-selling author or
getting published under a Big Brand this
seems to be a way to sort of instantly
publish your own book but I actually
think that is just as good an idea as
disrupting the traditional you know
publishing model like this seems to be
faster better easier have less uh
friction for those who want to get
started and like do we see a major
disruption do people in 10 years not
publish with huge publishing houses
anymore is everything done through
something like a WR book and I don't
know there's a part of me that says that
that's possible or likely yeah
so something I've been thinking a lot
about is how do you how do you create an
AI powerered book
Empire and so it's less about Justin
wellsh show Greg Eisenberg wants to
create a book and like yeah maybe we
work with penguin or we do a on.com but
more about how do we how do we create a

[05:01]
more about how do we how do we create a
hundred books in in a year what would
that look like and I've got actually a
stepbystep framework for how I would go
about and and do it you want to hear it
I do yeah I'm very interested and then
and then I'll argue whether I think it's
a good idea or not but go totally I love
it this is perfect and this is this is
why I brought you on is because like we
can chat ideas and you're you're you're
a guy who call me on my stuff so
um I appreciate that about you okay so
if I wanted okay how to build an AI
powered book Empire in 20124 so the
first thing I would do is I'd use Cloe
or gp4 I'm actually I'm using uh Cloe
just like 99 times more than yeah it's
just way better so let's just say use
Cloe to brainstorm 100 plus book
Concepts based on trending topics then
what I'd do is I'd analyze Amazon's best
sellers list with the jungle scout app

[06:02]
sellers list with the jungle scout app
um for Gap identification so are you
familiar with jungle Scout I'm not no
I'm looking up now yeah so uh a lot of
people who are not in e-commerce have
never heard of jungle scope but it's
basically I think it started off as a I
want to say a Chrome
extension um and it allowed uh people to
see competitor insights and keyword
analysis on different products so you
can go on to you know call it a
um I don't know teapot and you could see
that this teapot used to be priced at
$40 and now it's on $30 and they've sold
4,000 of them today so I would use this
with with books because I can basically
just see like okay what's selling what's
not selling what are the
trends um and I don't think many people
are doing that um then what I'd do is
I'd use chat GPT uh or clo to generate
detailed book outlines based on some of

[07:02]
detailed book outlines based on some of
these
trending uh areas are you with me I have
like a million more steps yeah yeah I I
am with you I'm just like quick ad break
let me tell you about a business I
invested in it's called boring
marketing.com so a few years ago I met
this group of people that were some of
the best SEO experts in the world they
were behind getting some of the biggest
companies found on Google and the secret
sauce is they've got a set of technology
and AI that could help you outrank your
competition so for my own businesses I
wanted that I didn't want to have to
rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to
depend on ads to drive customers to my
businesses I wanted to rank high in
Google that's why I like SEO and that's
why I use boring marketing.com and
that's why I invested in it they're so
confident in their approach that they
offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money

[08:00]
offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money
back guarantee who does that nowadays so
check it out highly recommend boring
marketing.com I I as soon as I hear you
kind of going down this like step byep
building a book with AI my mind pulls
back to this quote and I forget who it's
attributed to and it's it's popular so
I'm sure someone will will know who said
it but it's something to the effect of I
think it was on Twitter like I want I
don't want AI to write my books and do
my art and like all that wanted to do
the dishes and like pick up my room so
that I can write books and do art and so
like I just wonder from a long-term
perspective if everyone's writing a
hundred books and by the way I recognize
that not everyone's going to do it
people always ask me what if everyone
was the solo preneur so I get that's
it's a stupid question but like if a lot
of people are doing that does the art of
like writing a really strong and
powerful book with compelling study and
like user experience um does that die do
do you think about that when you outline
this stuff or does like does that just

[09:00]
this stuff or does like does that just
sort of you separate yourself from that
as you're thinking through it I think
the reality is AI is going to devalue
the majority of content period so in a
world where it makes it easier to create
any sort of content book content video
content podcast content tweets posts
whatever it's going to be devalued and
it's going to be harder for artists
let's call them artist people come up
with unique perspectives point of views
to to stand above the noise that said
once they once they do stand above the
noise or they you know they are
recognized as unique I think that
there's massive amounts of staying power
and I think that the top 1% of artists
are going to make 100 times more in the
next 10 years than they will in the
previous because there's going to be
such demand for curated experiences but
that being said I think that there's a
trem there is a gap and an opportunity
right now to do some Arbitrage around

[10:00]
right now to do some Arbitrage around
creating content with AI and automation
now that doesn't mean that just it needs
to be a book by Justin Welsh it could be
a book by Jane Wells you know and sure
and as long as you read the book and
you're like wow there's value here then
I still think that there's a
huge it's I personally am interested in
exploring this space yeah it's an
interesting like just just to be clear
like I think AI is fascinating and I'm
also like um not a person who's like oh
because I like the creative side of
things and because I like you know
unique in personal art uh that I somehow
don't believe that AI will will overtake
those things I do my my big concern
around it and not to like cut you off on
your on your book idea but like my big
concern around it is you say people are
going to become experts or have a very
unique point of view and there's going
to be staying power around that I think
a huge concern that I have is like how

[11:01]
a huge concern that I have is like how
right so someone gets a someone gets one
one inch into a into a journey that
they're really excited about where they
have a really unique and meaningful
perspective and like you're talking
about using jungle Scout to see trends
like there's going to be much more
complicated software at that point in
time someone's going to see that right
away and say this person is getting some
form of traction and like before they
can get traction and get a leg up and
get staying power let's just steal that
let's just take that and so I just
wonder like how does some go really deep
get a ton of traction in an area of
expertise and like stand out in a sea of
people creating hundreds and hundreds of
things based on what that person has
already just started I feel I I feel
worried about that I I think like I
struggle I struggle to Envision a world
like that does that make sense yeah it
totally makes sense and I'm happy you
bring it up because 70% of the people
listening to this are gonna are having
the same voice in their head so it's
good that you're bringing it up okay
let's let's think about the world before

[12:01]
let's let's think about the world before
the internet or at least early internet
like people were probably having a
similar conversation around sure that
you know okay I'm a print designer and
now anyone could create art on Photoshop
or Ms paint and it's so much simpler and
faster now doesn't that like destroy
art um doesn't it make it okay now now
there's going to be a thousand times
more artists because is you know you
don't have to go to the Parson School of
Design and you don't have to like buy
canvases you can just like fire up your
you know Microsoft 3.1 or whatever it's
called it was called and and or Ms Doss
or whatever and just like start playing
around yeah I think like being a Creator
being an artist is going to evolve and
there are going to be tools that are
going to make it ridiculously easy I.E
jungle Scout in 20 in the year 2030
but I still think that if I'm trying to

[13:02]
but I still think that if I'm trying to
like learn let's just say I want to be
I'm really into coffee and you know I
was a barista for five years and I
wanted
to um create content and create a
business around coffee that's not a
coffee shop I could still use jungle
Scout and learn like what's selling
what's not selling and then come up with
my own point of views and create a
business around it and hopefully yeah
you know it is it is a a way more
competitive space today you know in in
this time than it would be in in the
previous but I my point is I think not
using the tools is a risk a very big
risk huge risk I I I totally agree um I
am not anti- AI I don't find it to be a
particular particularly fabulous writer
at this point in time it's certainly
getting better clo is the best I've seen
right like I think chat gbt writes
pretty ter I've tested it out on a bunch

[14:00]
pretty ter I've tested it out on a bunch
of different things but like again we're
only a few years into this thing like
Fast Forward 10 years I think it's going
to be tremendously different I think
about someone like Jack butcher right
who's like like as Internet art and by
the way that's only because this is my
ecosystem so I might be blind to those
who came before him and we creating
something similar so I'm I'm speaking
within the realm of my my what I know on
the internet like when he came out and
started creating art like he got some
traction it became oh I can look at that
and know that it's something by Jack
like I can see his style I know that's a
visualized value piece and as we've kind
of gone over time like you know you've
had maybe five or 10 or 15 or 20 or 25
sort of knockoffs of that you know and
it's kind of getting faster and faster
and faster and I'm I fear for a world
and not to kind of again take this back
full circle to like what I worry about
but I do feel for for a world or fear
for one where a jack butcher gets
traction on one piece and the next day
there are 10,000 pieces just like that
and it's like how do you stand out in
that noise and it's a question worth

[15:02]
that noise and it's a question worth
answering like the the answer is you
have to and I just I just wonder what a
world full of noise looks like the way
you stand out is you are Jack butcher
you will always be one step ahead of the
competition and no one could compete
against Jack butcher in that in that
sense only Jack butcher is Jack butcher
so today today to today but you know
okay if I want to compete with Jack
butcher in an AI world what do I do I
study all his previous work MH
and I I basically I become Jack
butcher's brain but Jack butcher's brain
is essentially Jack butcher up into
today and previously now Jack butcher
could decide to go from black and white
to red and
yellow um tomorrow and that and then
they it does it does become a game
content then becomes a game of right cat
and M
I think that's what that's the trend

[16:01]
I think that's what that's the trend
that is is is beginning yeah I fear for
that Trend like I by the way it doesn't
mean it's not happening like cares what
I who cares what I think emotionally um
but I do like wonder what a world like
that feels like I mean it sucks it's I
hate that world too by the way just to
be clear like I hate it and it's not fun
because people like me and you who like
put stuff out there and we spend so much
time like crafting things and then the
next day
it gets copied or duplicated it it
totally it feels it feels
wrong um but the point I you know that's
the that's the negative side of this the
positive side of this is there there is
a ton of opportunity to to be building
things in a in totally totally what
what's the point of an original thought
if the next day it's duplicated to an
infinite degree exactly so like like but
I do I do agree there's tons of uh I was
just watching a video on someone using
perplexity and clo to do like SEO

[17:01]
perplexity and clo to do like SEO
optimized articles and like he was
prompting perplexity and Cloe and like
couldn't spell and I was like this is
what happens like people can't spell
like they don't even know how to like do
common reading and writing and I'm just
like is that a world like do we need to
know that anymore I guess not but maybe
I'm just like a classical person but
like I was just I was very flabbergasted
by that so I'm G to get back to the book
steps in a second sorry sorry sorry but
before I get back I have to say this
little story clo was down yesterday
and I noticed clo was down I'll be
honest I was trying to like use it for a
software project and I wanted some help
on it and uh I went on to Twitter and I
was like is CLO down and a bunch of
people were saying it's down and I saw a
Tweet someone said a very well-known
entrepreneur I won't tell you who it is
but a very well-known entrepreneur says
I literally thought I was going to have
a productive morning today and I can't
go to work because I don't have Claude
that's kind of kind of scary yeah that's

[18:00]
that's kind of kind of scary yeah that's
what we're moving towards but um it's
it's a muscle it's like riding a bicycle
like once you stop riding on your own or
thinking on your own and you let
something else do it for you it
atrophies totally now that being said
let me tell you how you can use clothes
to
make1 sorry for uh sorry for getting you
off your your your book idea continue so
so then you got your outlines so you've
used chat gbt or clo to make the
outlines used use the uh the outl you
know clo to make the chapter drafts one
of the things I would do is I would I
would write um you know you know prompt
something like pretend I'm the editor
and here's the 10 ways in which I write
and just give them detailed instructions
of how you write and you can train that
I could train that based on Justin Welsh
I could say like here's a 100 posts that
Justin Welsh has done write like Justin
Welsh and then bring out um you know
Justin generally is a very clear thinker
and he Ally never buries the lead uh

[19:01]
and he Ally never buries the lead uh
these are things that you can pull out
and that you can uh put in into
Cloe yeah their projects their projects
functionality is pretty amazing that is
yeah exactly yeah yeah I I I find that
the the projects functionality is light
years ahead of like chat gpts memory and
things like that yeah totally the
project functionality in itself is worth
the $20 a month oh 100% totally
yeah uh then you you can use uh not many
people know this but grammarly
uh they've got like an AI for well a lot
of people know it but I I've been using
it a lot recently for just real-time
editing and proof reading um you can
also use uh Jasper AI for Content
generation and and like if you because
you're going to be reading a bunch of
these a bunch of these articles that
Clo's going to be outputting and you
might be like wow this is actually not
that good so if you need new ideas you
can use something like jasper. a the
Hemingway app have you ever used that
yeah yeah I use it to make sure that my

[20:01]
yeah yeah I use it to make sure that my
writing is at a certain grade level for
my newsletter or my social content um I
know about what my audience likes to
consume at so I use it almost almost
daily can you talk can you talk about uh
how it works and and how you use it yeah
so so basically the one functionality I
use inside it is grade level and I want
to keep my grade level writing between
seventh and eth grade like I've run
multiple like a battery of tests against
both my newsletter and my LinkedIn
content not so much my my like X content
because I don't think it matters it's
much shorter the brevity is what matters
um but I will push that through uh uh
Hemingway and I will basically not just
the grade level I also look for like
sentences that could be more clear clear
Clarity and conciseness because that's
something that I think I've become known
for if I had to like guess uh on social
media is like taking complex ideas and
making them very simple and while I
think I'm generally pretty good at that
there are definitely times when I
overwrite when I make when I choose too
many words when I make things too
complex and so I love Heming way for

[21:02]
complex and so I love Heming way for
that and I often realize that when I
write I use words that to me seem simple
because they've become part of my
lexicon from working in startups for 20
years from being around people who are
certainly more academic than I am um and
so Hemingway helps me kind of bring that
down seventh to eighth grade reading
level I've written in third fourth fifth
sixth seventh 9th all the way up to 12th
and I will look at Impressions I will
look at reply rate on my newsletter I'll
look at engagement and that 7 to eight
for me is just like where where it hits
there you go that's that's really
helpful to know I actually I should do
that I'm and uh but yeah with a book
it's also equally uh important so you
want to put that content into Hemingway
and check uh check the readability and
and areas that you can improve there's a
tool called then the next thing I do
there's a tool called book stat I had
never heard of it uh but heard about it
just and you know through the research

[22:00]
just and you know through the research
of this um and the coolest thing it does
is like our our buddy sahill Bloom is um
launching a book and wouldn't it be cool
to see if you know if I was competing
against Sahel bloom in terms of his book
how many pre-orders a day is he getting
um and the trend around that so um it's
basically subscription data service and
I think you're going to see a lot of
these pop up just a lot of these
subscription data services in a bunch of
different Industries um but it just
gives you real-time stats um that'll
help you uh change the positioning of
your book title
chapters um and and help you around the
marketing of it that's really
interesting I often wondered if there
was a tool like this like um you know
just very candidly as I've watched like
sahill and Ali abdall launch their books
um I mean the consumer or or even their
friends um have very little visibility
into you know there's there's rah rah

[23:00]
into you know there's there's rah rah
around it and like you might assume that
it's selling a thousand copies or 5,000
copies a day but um the reality could be
very very different um and when
someone's not like a New York Times
bestseller my question is always like
how close were they or like what was the
gap between them you know making and
missing the mark and this is a service
that it looks like I could kind of
figure that out which is really
interesting really totally and it's you
you actually go on their website and it
looks like it's a website from $1 1999
totally I'm like what is this this is
crazy um the next thing I would do is uh
you have to templatized
[Music]
you you can use uh I think it's lulu.com
they have a AI powered formatting tool
so it's it's ready for print print um
but you'll also need a cover design so
you know could you use AI uh to create
the cover design design yeah you can use
Dy 3 or mid Journey I'm starting to feel

[24:02]
Dy 3 or mid Journey I'm starting to feel
that a lot of those tools are just like
you can tell it's AI generated I don't
know totally yeah oh totally yeah it's
it's just like I don't know it's it
feels like commoditized to me at this
point um it's supposed to be new and
unique and interesting but like every
visual that I see and by the way I'm not
an AI artist and most people who use it
are not AI artists with the prompts so
they're just getting generic output and
so everyone's generic output looks
exactly the same
um yes you know I'm sure I'm sure if
you're a professional you know digital
artist who understands AI prompting you
can probably make something wonderful
but for 99.9% of us that's that's not us
exactly so you can use um you can use an
agency we have an agency that we built
design scientist.com little little plug
there um and uh you know or just find
someone go to like upwork or or or
Fiverr or or whatever whatever your
budget fits and and uh get a human to

[25:01]
budget fits and and uh get a human to
design it nothing wrong with that the
the book cover matters like the book
cover really really matters it's like
one of those things where in YouTube
land they say doesn't even matter what
your content is all that matters is your
title and
thumbnail uh it's very similar in books
where the title matters a ton and the
and the cover matters a ton yeah a
friend of mine is a 12 time New York
Times bestselling fiction author writing
crime and he's he's in his 80s and he
will tell me all the time like he'll
have a really creative idea for a book
title and he'll run it by me and my wife
we're like we like that and then he'll
bring it back and be like the publisher
is actually going with something much
more simple I'm like oh I don't like
that at all he's like yeah but it
describes what's inside of the book and
I was like right right that makes sense
that makes sense it's the same with
YouTube right it's like yeah totally
it's the same so then I would uh there's
also another uh company I I found
they're called blurb.com
um they also allow you to do layouts so

[26:01]
um they also allow you to do layouts so
the layout of your book which's cool
about blurb.com
is they have these templates so you can
like go and make a children's book and
then they have these like children book
templates or photography like let's say
you want to create a cooking book you
can you can do like a photography one um
so I think that's really cool um and
again in our world no one talks about
this stuff yeah you've strung together
like the most AI Tools in history to do
a really cool process like I'm I'm
actually um really impressed you know I
go about as far as perplexity chat GPT
and Cloud um these are all really
interesting I feel like my this audience
loves like tools so yeah and I feel like
you appreciate the stuff too it's just
like we're all looking for unfair
advantages yeah in some way or another
so another thing thing that is really
useful I think is Spotify I think they

[27:03]
useful I think is Spotify I think they
might have bought this company but they'
they they I don't know if they bought it
or they incubated it's called find
findaway voices.com
and uh I'm pretty sure they actually
allow you to do an AI n narrator
selection for audiobook production wow
that's really cool so you don't a huge
process that's a huge process yeah it's
a huge process and especially if you're
if you're Jane Wells and you sound like
Justin Welsh you don't want you know you
don't want to be going into record you
know renting recording studio and and
recording for for three days straight
sounding sound like you
sound yeah it's it's really interesting
as you're as you're going through this
like um I mentioned something during the
book design part where I said you know
99.9% of us aren't AI artists nor do we
understand how to prompt AI to create
beautiful art and I may have just

[28:01]
beautiful art and I may have just
answered my previous concern or question
where it's like how do you become the
next Jack butcher well it's no longer
about the stroke of the brush or the the
how you move the mouse it's more about
prompting like how do you become a
world-class prompter which in which in
turn the outcome is world class art so I
guess I have to like Focus my brain on
thinking about how how the world changes
that way and what being great at
something looks like and I think it's
going to be a lot around prompting it is
and you know just this morning I was
talking to uh a finance someone on my
finance team and and she was like what
is this charge here this charge here
this charge here and I'm like oh man
have I gotten carried away with AI tools
and just like premium tools like are we
going to
spend on one hand I was like scared but
then but on the other hand I'm like
listen Maybe I'm spending $5,000 a month
on these tools
but uh you know you you wouldn't bad an

[29:01]
but uh you know you you wouldn't bad an
eyelash have paying someone five you
know a salary $5,000 a person $5,000 a
month right like $60,000 a year so I
think that's what's going to happen is
these software tools from a percent of
your costs are just going to increase
versus human beings yeah I was talking
to an entrepreneur the other day who
were main named was seven figure
entrepreneur in the like digital sort of
knowledge space and like um has a team
who basically takes his uh content and
chops it up and creates it you know for
for different social platforms and he's
like I'm kind of frustrated because
their prices are going up and I was like
how are their prices going up like
explain that to me like with all the AI
tools available right now like the
service they provide their prices should
be going down or you should be like you
should be spending one day next week
like designing all of your prompts and
if you really want somebody else to
write your content for you like the
following week you should be able to
press a button and do it yourself like

[30:01]
press a button and do it yourself like
uh I can't imagine like service
companies for copyrighting right now
like having the gall to raise their
prices Maybe I'm Wrong on that but like
I don't know I see that going away fast
yeah yeah I I I agree I got a couple
more tools for you and then and then our
book will be launched our Empire will be
launched nice um draft to digital number
two draft to digital so their tagline we
are self-publishing with support
self-publishing on your own is kind of
daunting I've actually explored this
it's daunting even think about how many
steps we just we just went
through um so draft to
digital um
is services and tools to help you with
the publishing the distribution the
layout and the print on demand paperback
so they just give you a little bit
support
very cool yeah I think this is going to

[31:01]
very cool yeah I think this is going to
be a huge industry just like getting
helping people produce longer form
content whether it's AI created or not
irrelevant like and getting it to the
masses in forms that they're used to I
think is going to be just right for like
tons of players as you're already
showing me right here right I've got
tabs open right yeah and and and you can
you know what I love about some of these
business models like draft to digital is
they don't they don't charge you they
just charge 10% of the retail price so
they they can tack on a little fee so
you would have charged $20 for a book
now you charge $22 $2 goes to
them um so anywhere anywhere where you
can do a pay per performance or paper
usage or paper task model I think is is
going to be interesting to
people like here's a question I have
that maybe you haven't thought about or
maybe you have and you you'll answer it
here in a moment but I've got one two
three four five six seven eight nine

[32:01]
three four five six seven eight nine
different tabs open at the moment as you
kind of go through this creation like
who becomes the who takes all these
Point Solutions and becomes the allinone
for this yeah I think that's that's like
an interesting question is why do I have
to use nine services for for producing
one outcome like why can't I use one
service for that let me just pull hold
on one sec I want to pull up a name of
this new app okay so I I first of all I
completely agree that it it's
overwhelming and what's going to happen
is each vertical is going to
consolidate and you're actually starting
to see this in Mobile too did you see
this app that just came out the other
day called hero assistant it's pretty
interesting um if you think about our
mobile like our our our iPhones let's
say we have to open up our calendar we
have to open up our weather we have to
open up our mail we have to open up
instacart reminders they're all separate
apps and it's getting overwhelming it's
the same issue that it's one of the same

[33:02]
the same issue that it's one of the same
issues that you're describing in AI it's
like there's too many different Services
I mean AI has two problems one is how do
you find out about these Services
besides listening to the startup ideas
podcast and then
two and two is uh H how do you how do
you make it a cohesive simple
experience
and in in Mobile you just have the issue
of like you have the App Store so it's
easier to find the apps but um what hero
is and is really interesting and is
getting a lot of people talking is it
just brings all those apps calendar
weather perplexity instacart reminders
into one
interface really cool I'm like I'm
looking at right now yeah I think that's
what's going to happen in AI but not yet
because we're still in the soul
searching trying to figure out use cases
phase yeah this is I think this is this
happens in every single every single
problem that I have today in my business

[34:01]
problem that I have today in my business
is solved by several different point
solutions that don't communicate with
one another this like the last startup
that I helped build was a medical
startup that essentially did exactly
that took every Point solution a
physician used and put it together in
one allinone solution sold it at a
better price right that's why 200
million in Revenue today um I see that
exact same thing coming to everything
that a Creator does everything that a
writer does everything an entrepreneur
does will be like at first first spread
out amongst nine to 10 different apps
and then put into one and I think that's
like how do you become either one of
those 10 or the
one yeah that is like a really big idea
that you're sharing which is how do you
be the node in all these different
Industries and someone
listening you know it doesn't need you
don't need to pick a a node in like
publishing which might be overwhelming
but you can pick a node that's like in a
sub niche
um and still be that and it's and and

[35:01]
um and still be that and it's and and
those businesses have huge sticking
power and are are great to create can I
give you an example of something that
I've been thinking about recently um
so as a Creator across multiple
platforms like let's think about my
workflow on a regular basis so
everything that I do starts with a tweet
right like I might try and think of
something interesting or useful to say
on on X right um I throw those out there
because a short feedback window so you
know you you get feedback in 10 minutes
you know whether this thing's going to
go well or go poorly once you once you
push it out there um since I'm pushing
stuff out there on a consistent basis I
have a lot of pieces of content that I
can choose to use in different ways
oftentimes what I'll do is screenshot
that add some context it's a LinkedIn
post right do that a couple times a day
figure out which one works the best I
can take that same screenshot same
context move it over to Instagram copy
the Tweet bring it over to threads like
there's just a million ways to sort of
organize this stuff
that in and of itself is one problem

[36:00]
that in and of itself is one problem
that needs to be solved because like
going back and forth between different
notion tabs different publishing tools
becomes very conversant and confusing
then add to the fact that inside of
every Discovery platform I want to bring
my audience to my website have them do a
deeper dive on learning about me and
what it is what problem it is that I
solve um so every piece of content has
to have a relevant piece of deeper long
form content that is related to it so I
can drive someone naturally in the next
call to my website so hey you want to
learn more about this or want to go
deeper on this go check out this article
go go check out this newsletter I have a
repository of newsletters and articles
it's not easy for me to find which one
is most relevant and therefore make it
the call to action so like that's
another problem that should be solved
with one click of a button I use cloud
projects for that but today Cloud
projects doesn't talk to tweet hunter or
tap Leo or any of the publishing tools
that I use then I want to meet smart
interesting people who I can start to
network with on social media I do that
on platform I do that on LinkedIn I do
that on X I do that on Instagram that

[37:01]
that on X I do that on Instagram that
doesn't exist in the publishing tools it
doesn't exist in CLA so like there are
these disparate problems um that I have
to solve through all these different
tools and I'm thinking to myself like
why not one tool why can't I do this
inside of one app and why don't I build
that why wouldn't you build it I would
yeah I mean it's it's something that I'm
very interested in building um I figure
you know if I solve my own problems I'll
probably solve a thousand other people's
problems totally but you're you're not
actively building it today right it's
just an idea
potentially I love it I love it say less
my friend this is a big idea I I you
know I also have the same issue which is
um even though I use less tools than
that um in content I still feel like I'm
going from place to place and I'm
getting basically like content wh
Whiplash that's how I feel same why

[38:02]
Whiplash that's how I feel same why
can't I focus on writing one good idea
like even if I don't want to use AI for
that and I just want to write myself
like because I like to write but once I
write one good idea why can't I hit one
button and just be like go all the
places you're supposed to go and do all
the things you're supposed to do that's
I I just want to be the creative like I
don't want to figure out how to stitch
together all this different stuff just
like let's build that that automation
now right for fun and hit the button and
everything works that's that's the world
that I Envision AI being fun in in less
uh taking over creativity I guess yeah
and there's there's you know this could
be really big like we often forget but
who's a billion doll company even on the
Indie hacker side like I just had TBO
from tweet Hunter on he sold it for $10
million so um there's a lot of demand
for Creator tools
and um if if you can build this

[39:01]
and um if if you can build this
efficiently uh I yeah I think people
would pay for it and and very candidly
this is my opinion by the way like I
can't I don't have data to back this up
but I think I can in a in a weird way
which is like I use Tapo and tweet
Hunter and I like TBO and I think his
team builds really good products um but
in a way in a way many of the products
that are on the market today and it's
not just in the Creator space or
publishing space um are not too
dissimilar from one another uh they are
becoming more and more commoditized and
I think what is most important is if
somebody uses it and so what I'm seeing
is like the companies that are standing
out in the publishing space like a tweet
hunter or a Tapo have the big creators
behind it the big creators use it the
big creators talk about it they sponsor
the big creators newsletters they're in
front of the big creators audiences and
like you might look at that in another
tool and they might at first glance look

[40:01]
tool and they might at first glance look
relatively similar but if you know that
I use it or sahill uses it or you use it
you're just more inclined to use it as
well and so I think for someone like
myself how do I leverage how do I use
that Advantage uh you know as I'm
thinking about both solving my own
problem and building something that
isn't commoditized and then combining it
with um you know a brand and and a
person who who's known for creating
content those are things that are kind
of circulating in my mind at the moment
so what you're kind of saying is it's
similar to like the Mr Beast chocolate
Feasta BS it's like why are you buying a
Feasta BS over hery joab bar it's like
oh no I Mr Beast is my guy I love him I
want I want to show you something real
quick I just off camera right before I
came on I had this thing called a midday
Square have you seen this product I've
not so it's it's cool packaging
functional yeah so if you're not
watching on this YouTube um YouTube by
the way if you're not watching on
YouTube just go to YouTube and subscribe

[41:00]
YouTube just go to YouTube and subscribe
and comment and like do those things but
here it is the midday Square cookie
dough flavor and you when you when you
pull it into the other side what do you
see oh three
faces who are these three people they've
been actually building this
company this is Jake uh this is Jake
Nick and Leslie they're the three
co-founders they've got like plus
thousand followers and they've been
building this business in public the
highs the lows uh Creator Le company and
you buy the product because I mean the
product's great but it it's also because
you want to it's almost like a tip
you're like tipping the Creator's
Journey you're like this person has
given me so much value in my day-to-day
life therefore three bucks for the choco
bar dude totally I I actually think like
I buy from a lot of creators just as a
tip yes like there there are Creator
friends of mine who creat something that

[42:00]
friends of mine who creat something that
I absolutely have zero interest in I'm
consuming and like when it comes out
I'll buy it because like you know if I
read a hundred of your tweets and a
thousand of your posts and I read your
newsletter every week like the least
that I can do it's for small businesses
least I can do is give you a tip so when
your product comes out I will buy it
100% And I think a lot of people operate
that way some people don't but a lot of
people do I think most people operate
that way that's fair even subconsciously
subconsciously some people opposite yeah
some people are completely the opposite
yeah yeah but I I I appreciate you
sharing that because I think that's I
think that's big in the future is like
in a world in a world of commoditized
products how do you how do you stand out
and become not a product people want to
spend money on but a person that people
want to spend money on yes exactly and I
think you're this is the beginning like
this packaging where the people are in
the packaging is the beginning of a
bigger trend which is they're going to
take more and more real estate like the

[43:00]
take more and more real estate like the
chocolate you see over here like is
still 99% of the packaging and the
people is only 2% in the future I'm sure
it'll be like 50% the people 50% the
chocolate yeah might even be the
opposite of what it is now where it
might be 90% of people and 10% of
chocolate which could be yeah you'll be
like why am I eating oops I hope I'm not
eating like a leg right
now cool I like that that's cool I'm
have to look for that product or at
least follow their story I not familiar
with that cool um Justin this has been
great uh didn't think we'd go here but
we this has been fun and got my my
creative juices are flowing how you
feeling feeling good man I didn't expect
to go there either um uh you had way
more um tactical information on on the
book stuff so I I think your audience
can someone will run with that um I
think what I hope that people take away
from this is like a lot of the stuff

[44:00]
from this is like a lot of the stuff
that we talked about in just solving
your own problems I think a big part of
startup ideas at least in the future is
going to be being cognizant enough to
pause when you actually have a problem
like I I go through problems all the
time day after day after day the same
problem and it actually takes me like
weeks and sometimes months to pause and
be like why haven't I solved this like
what's a much because we're so busy and
we're so heads down that that becomes a
problem and I think um a lot of folks if
they can make themselves stop and think
through those things we we'll start to
see ideas flowing in much faster than
they normally do amen if people uh
people want to support Justin Welsh and
find you on the internet where where
could they go they can go to Justin
