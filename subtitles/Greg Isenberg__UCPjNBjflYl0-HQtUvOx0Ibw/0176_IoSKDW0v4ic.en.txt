that all right gu
has entered the stage G what up hey Greg
how's it going man good where where you
calling from uh UK just having an a meal
with my family didn't think you'd call
me straight on so you're were the first
person you're escaping your family right

[09:01]
person you're escaping your family right
now which kid room kids room you
wouldn't be the F you wouldn't be the
first dad to do it so um it's
understood I was sipping a very small
glass of red wine but I hav okay no
worries we believe you I can see some I
can see some blush in in your cheeks you
know let's uh we can keep it really
quick and on point though and then let's
do it what's on your mind so uh yeah big
fan of what you're doing thanks for
having me on um I love the agencies you
build the way you brand them uh the way
you Market them I've got a video
business called gdv
video.co and uh I've been doing it for
10 years it's like a oneperson video
agency all the spoke work done stuff for
like Volvo Autodesk some you know qun
some big brands in the UK and us
um but I'm looking to like productize
differentiate streamline my video
agencies it's not really as much a

[10:00]
agencies it's not really as much a
startup idea it's getting
your take on how I could streamline and
differentiate my video company and maybe
create a similar thing that like you've
got uh with some of your agencies the
problem I've got is like video is it's
like it's high-end video so it's in
person right you know that's the
challenge it's like how do I scale this
up because the area I live in in the
northwest of the UK it's not there's not
much happening here so it's it's
challenging what's uh uh I'm going to go
to your website what is the name of your
website it's a GD so my initials got gdv
video.co uh and at the moment it's
literally just a Squarespace portfolio
of some of the work all right I'm gonna
put you on blast it's okay if I share
your website yeah cool cool so here to
tell your story creators of authentic
branded content Micco documentaries and
Commercial films first of all these are
like three different things so I think
what what what you're going to have to

[11:00]
what what what you're going to have to
do is figure out what is your angle and
what are you going to productize and
then what the price Point's going to be
um it's interesting because what you're
talking about you know you say it almost
as a negative is like you do in person
and like you know I think what you see
in a lot of productized video agencies
is they don't do in
person and so I actually see this as
like your your skill set of like
bringing Crews and like doing literal
like Volvo commercial which by the way
is my dream I I drive a Volvo um like
this is this is what people want coming
up right um so the question to you is
where you know these are all kind of
different actually you have a lot of
like health and wellness you have some
Auto
here what let's start with who do you
who do you think you have an unfair
Advantage with in terms of customer base
um so I've don't know lower down on the
page I've done a lot of outdoor sport

[12:01]
page I've done a lot of outdoor sport
documentaries like original
documentaries um the problem is there's
not a lot of those Brands don't have a
lot of money for marketing or they're
using a lot of user generated content um
my best client on there who was the de
leopard thing I did is a company called
Neeve who are like the Rolls-Royce of uh
audio recording equipment uh and I also
did a music production degree so there's
something around maybe like music
technology uh brands
uh but they're randomly based where I
live uh they're am- ne.com they they're
my best client I've got them on retainer
I do all their social
content um and I'd like to sort of get
another 10 of those clients I guess um
so I guess you could call them like a
premium brand uh technology type
brand um the the thing is I'm just
surrounded here by like boring
businesses which might not be a bad
thing but uh I don't it doesn't lend
itself to my skill set which is like

[13:00]
itself to my skill set which is like
higher endend production
[Music]
um I don't know I guess to be honest I'm
just a bit a bit tired of going out and
doing everything myself as well it's
like I I work with Freelancers so I
don't hire anyone I've got a freelance
team so I can send crews out but then
it's never quite as good as if I do it
myself so it's like how do I you know is
is it more a case of I keep the bespoke
video agency and try and you know teach
other videographers how to grow a onep
person business or um I don't know do I
help Brands more with like strategies as
a product size service then offer
bespoke production on the back
end well I'll tell you where I see the
opportunity
and okay where I see the opportunity is
I don't see anyone owning documentaries
for companies like use the word micro
documentaries I'm not sure if it's micro
documentary on but it's doc you know
micro documentaries or documentaries if

[14:00]
micro documentaries or documentaries if
you can become the micro documentaries
guy and you help companies create
documentaries every brand needs that
because um we're all trying to stand out
and video is how we're going to stand
out and when I hear the word documentary
like what is it it's basically just
documenting a story is that right I
would say so yeah like done a lot of
like branding content like that more
like you know storytelling where like I
did one for a big uh like music um
they're like a ticketing platform in the
local area um so we did a series of docs
on like upcoming bouns uh with big
followings you know to help that so it's
like that branded
Association content and storytelling but
I would say there's a lot of people
trying to do that um who's doing it
who's the number one person doing
that oh I just think every like cool
Studio is doing that like if you look at

[15:00]
Studio is doing that like if you look at
stepped uh
step in in the US and farm league we're
g we're gonna pull them up because I
think it's helpful for people just to
understand stepped like St P what was it
St PT um maybe uh not sure um Step
Studios they're not that they're not
that big if they don't own step.com
all right here we
go cool lot of commercial work as well
this feels like
commercials yeah there'll probably be a
section on like content
um but that's the thing is like no
one I haven't gone to a landing page it
says like we do documentaries for like
we do micro documentaries like own
something smaller a different phrase a
different phrase like own the smaller
phrase I talked about this yesterday
with you know with boring marketing.com

[16:00]
with you know with boring marketing.com
you know a lot of people did SEO but no
one owned boring marketing yeah so I
think you have to figure out what that
is for you micro documentary seems to be
really interesting to me if you can put
people on a product IED service where
it's like for $5,000 a month I'm gonna
give you one documentary um micro
documentary um that's interesting that's
and so who do you you think like sort of
more people who do more like brand it's
more like a brand play would you say or
is it like going behind the scenes of
their of their brand
or yeah I mean it doesn't it's it's
going behind the scenes in Brands it's
telling the story I mean sometimes it
could be like you know let's say us like
a you know we have a remote company um
you know we definitely have
like uh people in certain areas but
let's say we hired you um you know some
of the work could actually be like 50%

[17:00]
of the work could actually be like 50%
could just be like zooms that we're
doing with other people or um and then
50% could be in person um and just you
just stitch together and you craft the
story and you crack the narrative Arc
and then we can use that to put on
social and just be like this is you know
for example with LCA our Innovation
agency it's like this is how uh like
it's a micro documentary and how we
create a brand for another company so
like a case study but it's got the hook
of like micro documentary which is yeah
more intriguing exactly so I want to
hear in the chat is this a sip or a spit
on this idea of micro documentaries
producti service gu is in this
Crossroads we've always been you know
we've been in and a lot of us listening
have been on the in these Crossroads
where we don't know if we should like
what we should do next you know he's
built a good business but he doesn't
know what exactly he should do next of
course by the way G while people are
sipping and spitting
let's you know I think uh of course you

[18:02]
let's you know I think uh of course you
could go and teach people how to create
you know create a membership paid
membership charge for it and teach
people but I think that if I'm you I
still need
to I'm not done yet you know like you've
you've built up so many great case
studies that you can probably use that
to charge a lot for yeah so I I don't
know if I'm there yet so okay what are
we see what are we seeing we're getting
actually a lot of sip so uh ver sip Ryan
as a director sip baby so that's you
know Justin Nukem sip because people
need video John S I think many companies
would like the documentary part for
example how we started that's true Arvin
sip Jason sip uh Ethan SI Victor sip so
you're getting a lot of sips there's
something there we'll leave you with
that get back to your
family hopefully they're still there and
uh micro that's actually a good line
micro doumentary is the new case study I

[19:01]
micro doumentary is the new case study I
love that this is going to be saved
isn't it on YouTube I need to uh exact I
watched yesterday is it's so cool what
you're doing man you know you could be
charging thousands for this it's just so
so sick so I'm big fan of the podcast
and yeah big fun thank you pleasure my
pleasure this is fun all right thanks
for joining us thanks all right that was
cool G from the UK literally escaped his
family poor family but you know he's
going back his his his little glass of
wine is there up next we've got Joey
I'll bring you on stage and then we got
Patrick and Victor I see you but you you
know it's gonna take a few minutes to
get to you all boom and without further
Ado Joey welcome to the
stage no we can't hear
you no worries we'll give you a second

[20:02]
all right Joey we oh no
Joey hello say something can you hear me
now yeah we can hear you now okay
cool cool uh Greg I I saw the the
episode that you did with starter story
uh and I and I think I kind of came
across your content a couple times
previously but it wasn't until I saw it
on starter story and then I started to
check out your YouTube channel oh cool
well welcome to the Channel I'm doing
these I don't know how long I'm going to
do them for these live streams but I'm
just having fun right now and and it and
it seems like others are having fun so
yeah it's a cool idea it's a cool idea
um I'll tell you a little bit about what
I'm working on um and I wanted to get
your thoughts specifically as someone
who has a holding company um I wanted to
get your thoughts on this so right now
currently I'm working on a rule up of
restoration Contracting companies so
restoration contract s these guys are

[21:00]
restoration contract s these guys are
the people that that show up to your
home to fix hold on Joey I got to take
off my sweater like you're talking about
you know rollups you're getting me hot
hot and heavy here okay so shirt is off
where where where are you based right
now right now I am
in the middle of I'm looking over at
like 90 Acres of P Wilderness in the
mountains I'm I'm in I'm in Canada okay
and
it's just my little nature place where I
can go hang out and yeah sure
yeah cool um so right now I'm working on
a uh a rollup of restoration Contracting
businesses so restoration contractors
they are essentially the folks that
would show up to your home to fix up
anything that breaks after a fire water
damage it can be as small as like a a
burst pipe in your home right and and
people really need to fix that as soon

[22:00]
people really need to fix that as soon
as possible before mold sets into their
hes so yes it's a very it's it's the
pain is very real and people need to um
call them as soon as possible and and
the amazing thing is the homeowners
don't really pay out of pocket because
it's usually covered by their insurance
so it it's a it's a fairly um uh need to
have business so I I really like it and
and I've gotten a chance to actually um
sit on the so I I run a venture fund um
and I invested in a company called
alware which essentially is a a service
Titan specifically for restoration
Contracting I've gotten a chance to work
with the founder he and I have gone
through a lot of battles together and we
really like working with each other so
over the last three years we've been
thinking about this idea um and so we
launched our Restoration company or our
restoration rollup idea and we we're
starting to have conversations uh the

[23:01]
starting to have conversations uh the
the the website that you should check
out is called Long View restoration so
Longview restoration.com
okay and this would be we're we're
bringing together essentially about 15
smaller restoration owners and helping
them get to the next level um by buying
up probably up to like 80% of their
business
um helping them retain the 20% and the
the cool thing about rollups as you
probably know is when you have when you
are at let's say like 250 in ibida
you're probably trading at like 3x you
know 3x if you're lucky but um if you
actually get to let's say 10 million or
15 million like you can be trading at 8
to 10x EB D multiple right so theide
idea right now is to bring together

[24:01]
idea right now is to bring together
small restoration guys that frankly you
know right now they're just guys who are
just working on their businesses heads
down they don't necessarily have a
retirement plan all the private Equity
folks are telling them hey you're too
small you're too early for us to even
you know entertain um so to bring these
guys together buy 80% of their business
upfront and then help them retain the
20% give them you know Financial
Security up front and then in about five
years or six years or so we all exit
together and the and that second you
know the 20% that they would have
retained previously they would be able
to sell at the same probably amount as
the first 80% right so that's the
current idea right now uh there's a lot
more detail but I'll just kind of stop
here and see if you have any initial
questions and who's funding this so this
is the thing that I I've been um going

[25:00]
is the thing that I I've been um going
back and forth on so there's two options
uh the first option is um classic just
raise a fund um I think we were going to
need about $25 million in terms of
equity um and it would you know I
probably can scrape together five to 10
million of that through my network
because you know I run a venture fund as
well um the so so that's that's option
one the option two is to do the MVP of
this on my own DME and um you know there
are SBA Loans involved so the idea would
be hey can we find two or three of these
you know if we plan on doing 15 can we
find two or three of these and Alex and
I would just put together our own
personal capital and then use SBA loan
to lever up uh and a combination of
sellers note to make it make it happen
and then roll that into the fund if we
can prove out the MVP of this right so I

[26:03]
can prove out the MVP of this right so I
me what do you think I I don't know
if so what do you think of Splash before
I tell you what I think Splash what know
Splash okay so I'm gonna share my screen
again yeah so similar model uh roll up
for pool service
companies um yeah I came across them
because this guy Jeremy uh Yamaguchi yes
like he was the guy from lawn love which
was a YC company that was uh a Lawn Care
Marketplace okay that's awesome really
awesome and then they built the largest
Marketplace in in lawn care yes um and
then a bunch of like the Cody sanchezes
of the world invested in this business
and they end oh cool yeah yeah so to me
it feels like there's this movement
around like Splash for X um right right
yes and the one thing I'm missing from

[27:03]
yes and the one thing I'm missing from
your you know your pitch or what I would
be doing differently is like how do you
integrate vertical software as a part of
the offering yeah so
building you know one way to and I'm
sure you've already thought about this
but you know one way to increase
multiples you know not just by rolling
up is by adding technology to it um and
actually creating technology and then
selling that to other
um other uh
restoration uh or or small restoration
contractors right so I think that's what
the only thing I'm missing from the
pitch this is a big idea
[Music]
um
and I think if I were you I probably
would do like the first maybe second on
my own yeah just just so you could maybe
really small ones yes just so you could
say that hey like I've done this and you

[28:00]
say that hey like I've done this and you
avoid
the you avoid the pain that you're going
to get when you speak to investors and
they're gonna be like well why don't you
know why don't you do this yeah yeah the
the the um the one thing that I've I've
I've spoken to folks like Splash who've
kind of done it successfully they've
already exited on the other side as as
fund managers um one thing I do worry
about is um like all startups you're
going to end up figuring it out as you
go right so like the back office
integration and especially in in
restoration Contracting there is a lot
of complex there's a reason why service
Titan hasn't gone into this space and
it's because of you have to deal with
insurance yeah Insurance workflows are
an absolute nightmare right so uh I
think there's going to be a lot to
figure out right so everything from
estimation and coding all the different
you know line items for insurance
companies um all the way to um

[29:02]
companies um all the way to um
collecting from the insurance companies
and and to be fair alware the software
company that is also actually a YC
company as well and they've been trying
for the last three years they right now
they're a project management company and
now they're like trying and going
through that process of trying to own
everything on that platform um and it's
a complex problem man it's it's it's
painful and I think like when I
integrate the first two or three there's
going to be a lot of lessons there um
which maybe I don't want to learn on
someone else's dime maybe I should just
learn it on my own dime first before you
know bringing you know taking on
external investors I mean you could do
both right so you can as you know you
can you could just ra start like I want
to raise $10 million or whatever and and
create the deal and raise but in the in
the background you're you're buying
you're not relying on that closing
right and so I think it's it's

[30:01]
right and so I think it's it's
worthwhile to do it I think the only
thing again missing from the pitch is
going to be that vertical Tech piece yes
and I think that's gonna really excite
the right people I mean I'm interested
I'm interested you know if you end up
raing awesome that's good Market
validation yeah I'm interested let me
know how it turns out
and
um yeah maybe there's a way we can
partner in some way where we can you
know we've built some of the biggest s
vertical SAS products through our a
genci so maybe there's a way that we can
somehow partner I'm not sure but um
thank yeah what what are people thinking
is this a sip or spit idea is uh should
Joey do it himself take out his own
dollars or uh or go raise from the Dark
Side sip or spit even though he's a part
of the dark side right I am I am part of
the dark set and I I think I might have
seen a McKenzie logo somewhere in I oh
no you got to dig up my True Bru got him

[31:01]
no you got to dig up my True Bru got him
where you located Joey while while
people are sipping and I I recently
moved from uh the bay to Nashville oh so
sick of California taxes man I just oh
nice well uh one of my business partners
lives in Nashville so oh really you
should definitely uh reach out um you
could you can hit him up on Twitter
Jordan mix jrdn X
mix um he'll be here later during the
stream okay you're getting a bunch of
sips um just go for it though people are
saying Victor is saying just go for it
and I think that's right super sip you
got a super wow super good idea and I
think for folks listening you're sort of
seeing you're seeing this uh this macro
Trend around Splash for X so think about
what is your Fair Advantage is there a
way for you to roll up certain

[32:01]
way for you to roll up certain
businesses buy them for a fair price um
and this is the Warren Buffet model
right um yeah and uh and sort
of bring them together operate at scale
increase operational uh efficiencies but
the one thing that Warren Buffett
wouldn't do is create that vertical
software layer which I think really
increases the um the value
invest in yourself people say sip invest
in yourself good good stuff Joey thanks
for coming on and thanks Greg sharing
with us
awesome who and up next we
have Mr
Patrick feedback freak.com that's right
can you hear me yes sir welcome to the
stage thanks Greg thanks for having me
on yeah I'm big big admirer of you and
uh I guess your method of of uh method

[33:02]
uh I guess your method of of uh method
of Madness yeah method of Madness
building the audience first and letting
sort of the product fall out of that so
I think my my questions are um I guess
that's that's like where to focus my
energy I have all these ideas for tools
to build to support basically writers to
basically get feedback and publish
better stuff more frequently is sort of
the goal um and that's you know through
encouragement and and criticism um and
some of that's done peer-to-peer some of
that's going to be done with a
Marketplace this is all very new by the
way I launched this like two months ago
um coming out of WR a passage I don't
know if you know of course yeah okay
sweet nice so that yeah course and yeah
just coming out of was like okay like
you know all the things that exist in
that cohort are amazing and when it was
ending everyone was just like yeah it'd
be awesome to continue doing these like
the gyms which are just like when you
meet and you you know pitch your idea or
you give feedback to people
one-on-one uh that's just like
peer-to-peer stuff or like the you know
professional editors that give you
feedback so it's pretty much just
surfacing those things that exist in the

[34:01]
surfacing those things that exist in the
cohort that then just abruptly end um
but then of course I've dreamed up all
these other things of like you know
potentially like AI tools that can do
some helpful you know for like
organizing making your writing a little
more punchier or clearer uh uh you know
inline editing type stuff that's
gamified where you know there's no like
kind of Free Loaders or Free Riders so
that people really want to give editing
back to each other um there's a bunch of
stuff you could do but you know as a
follower view it's like I think probably
what I should do first is try to grow an
audience and like really kind of
interview them and understand all right
and I'm a writer so I'm B basing some of
the assumptions around what I need but
uh you know building the audience first
of course would help guide like a more
Crystal Clear Vision of what is actually
needed um and I'm just like maybe I'm
hamstrung around like I'm like God man
can I really grow an audience like I
only had like 50 people sign up for uh
like gyms or whatever and uh just
through R A Passage the last cohort just
ended so it got a little bit of bump

[35:01]
ended so it got a little bit of bump
there but i' had some encour you know
like oneon-one you know encouragement
from people saying like oh was a good
idea like I love I like the idea that
it's not really crystallized very well
but uh at any event yeah curious to just
hear your thoughts and like where I
should focus my energy I
guess so Zach asked a really good
question what does someone giving
feedback get out of
it great question yeah I think for the
peer-to-peer stuff I me there's going to
be Marketplace I'm launching where they
actually get paid so that's a separate
sort of offering but for the
peer-to-peer stuff I
think I guess my pitch them would be
giving feedback helps you become a
better writer and a better thinker um
and it makes you more self-aware as a
writer um and I think a lot of people
realize that they go through right a
passage at least but probably it's not
too obvious to everyone
um maybe potentially if they're trying
to sell like editing Services too or
like some Consulting service know that's
sort of a lead generation for them but
other than that yeah it's not really a

[36:00]
other than that yeah it's not really a
ton of value good
question
and okay so here's how I would do it if
I were you so I first of all I think the
Insight
around you know I'm you know because I'm
a writer myself and I I I sometimes most
of the time 99% of the time I write in a
silo and I'll even have like my wife
just be like hey what do you think of
this like she reads A lot of my stuff
yeah just um
but I would also love the ability
for a Prof you know professional writer
or you know even you know someone who's
writing on the internet publishing out
there to give me feedback and I'd pay
for it uh so I like that Insight but I
think you're you're in for a world of
pain based on what I've seen um because
I think you're going to have issues
incentivizing at scale you're going to
have issues incentivizing in people to
to matchmake

[37:00]
to matchmake
basically um and I wonder if there's a
you know question I wonder if there's a
simpler way to actually do what you're
trying to do like what if there was an
email that you send your piece and you
get a
loom five minute Loom with
feedback you know and maybe you pay for
maybe you have to pay for it each time
and and and maybe you also get like a
Google doc associated with it you know
you put you probably have to because
like maybe there's grammar or you know
it's just easier I mean I write in
Google doc so for me yeah it would be
easier so I wonder if there's just like
email
and a Google doc around what another

[38:01]
and a Google doc around what another
writer would do now why is that easier
than what how you have it set up well
you don't have to rely on like a live
group hangout or a live one-on-one chat
it's it's just you're offis skating away
the marketplace so you're hiding it with
an email yeah
um it also probably is more comfortable
for people to work async so another
trend is just that people are they when
it comes to online stuff they're they're
actually prioritizing a way of
synchronous stuff and they're moving
more people prefer uh async when it
comes to IRL inperson stuff they're they
they prefer like iners events
synchronous so I'm you what I'm doing is
I'm shifting away uh Loom feedback
Google doc Costco type membership right
you need to pay every year probably not
every month because I think also people
are getting tired of this every month
for something like this which is maybe

[39:01]
for something like this which is maybe
not a must have is a nice to have but
like for 200 bucks a year 300 bucks a
year get get the
membership get the
email and I think that there's
something to that I'm also I love the
name feedback freak.com like I love it
like I love the idea of like you're a
feedback freak I just wonder if the hold
Co is called feedback freak and the
first product is called writing feedback
freak.com okay yeah yeah totally uh yeah
actually you hit on like that's ideally
what the Grand Vision is to like be a
feedback Freak app for all creative
Endeavors like I think anyone that's
starting out creatively they don't have
a network they don't have anyone to kind
of bounce ideas off of so it's partly
like they need encouragement they also
need like actual criticism and like as
the world like sort of for better for
worse tells everyone they should be a
Creator as we kind of see online you
know for better for worse um I think
it's just yeah it's going to be more and
more a necessity and if you can try to
perfect him me my Grand Vision is like
you know I'm really influenced by Rick

[40:00]
you know I'm really influenced by Rick
Rubin right now I don't if you've seen
him on podcast and stuff he's that yeah
he's the man and like it's like he
ultimately when you look at what he does
you know he over oversimplifies it
offices like I don't know anything about
music I just really know what my tastes
are and I'm able to communicate that to
artists in a way that that they find
useful and it's like he's ultimately
just a really good feedback partner and
like if you can could you figure out if
you had enough data if you had enough
people what podcasts lift to what do
they read what they what are their
objectives can you like could you Al
Lally match people so that everyone has
their own like Rick Ruben you know what
I mean for any creative Endeavor would
be like awesome but um that's yeah great
great great feedback well so that makes
a to ton of sense like like you said
obos Skating the the marketplace and
having that as a product like 24hour or
48 hour turnaround I love the idea how
would you grow the marketplace you kind
of have the you know chicken and egg
kind of starting problem there I I mean
to me it's it's it's simple like you
start on Twitter you create an audience
called write you know it's too long to

[41:01]
called write you know it's too long to
say writer feedback freak yeah it would
just be
like um at writing feedback and you you
literally just
roast or
rewrite popular like okay popular
people's popular creators
writing and you you write threads on it
I love it and so you start doing that
you build the credibility that way um
and then like to me it's not it's not
going to be hard to find the you know
the writers who want to actually give
feedback like the Looms because you'll
just pay them um but you'll have
bootstrapped via the the memberships so
you'll have you're going to sell these
one year memberships that's going to
fund a lot of
the um the payment for the initial
people and then every time like I don't
know how you have it but maybe it's
every time someone asks for feedback
they have to pay a certain amount or
maybe in a year you get this is actually
probably how you do it so you get a

[42:01]
probably how you do it so you get a
lifetime membership or sorry a yearly
membership and with that you get a
certain amount of credits call it 10
credits each time you on feedback you
have to use you use one credit okay um
and you know that you know
um let's say you sell a credit for $30
maybe it takes someone 5 minutes so you
pay them you pay the writer $15 you take
$15 and the pitch to the writer is like
I'm going to pay you a little bit but I
don't even I don't even need to pay you
because the amount of stuff that you're
going to learn from doing this is going
to make you a 10x better writer right
you know what I mean but you know I'm
just going to pay you
because you know I want to keep you
incentivized right show me the
incentives and I'll show you the outcome
so y um what do people think is this a
sip or a
spit uh
is this what do you think of this idea
and uh give Patrick a little a little

[43:02]
and uh give Patrick a little a little
feedback because he's a he's a feedback
freak I might
say yeah man I got I gotta give you a
shout out too on the the name of you're
like I saw one of your threads was like
if you can would you put it on a T-shirt
and that's how I was like oh yeah I'd
wear a t-shirt it's said feedback freak
so yeah I call that the T-shirt test
yeah coming up with a name you know
would you be would you proud to wear it
as a T-shirt and
uh you know that's oh you got a spit

Victor hi and Victor yes you're gonna

right person I might take five minutes I
might take five minutes you know okay so
get excited send some hearts for Victor
uh he's gonna he's gonna talk about
whatever he wants to talk about while
I'm making french press um actually I'm
going to apologize for my spit but
here's why I did it is because I also
run an app for
writers um
this is crazy I also run an app for

[48:00]
this is crazy I also run an app for
writers um it's called Magic Book of
fire and what and I've dealt with a lot
of writers
um I've dealt with a lot of writers uh
coming in and the hardest thing to do is
to get these people who are deeply
rooted in art to go through a series of
actions uh that get them what they want
like the easier it is the easier it's
like a button click that gives them a
prize then then that is what people
respond to more and I feel like I feel
like if they have to go through
um a a series of steps to get their
feedback then I mean there's my cat
dizzy by the way uh then you know that
uh then you know that you have like some
drop off I'm not uh Greg so I'm not
really great at this uh but why am I

[49:02]
really great at this uh but why am I
here by myself anyway that's you are
great Victor you are great you're up
here with people you're doing great I'm
just boiling some water and and I'm just
hearing you in the background yeah and
it's not easy so you know give it up
keep going people are loving this look
in the comment section people are loving
this um cool oh you can hear me so maybe
I should just tell tell you about what
my idea is while you get your coffee or
anything all right let's do it awesome
great okay so the reason I'm here I'm a
multi I'm a multipreneur uh I I
accidentally got into being a
multipreneur and one of my projects we
just pivoted and it is I think about to
blow up really big and I want advice on
customer acquisition so here's what it
is so I have this website um which is a
video game website called high score
game arcade if you go to highscore game
arcade.com right now you'll see a game

[50:00]
arcade.com right now you'll see a game
that I made for a brand uh for Joey
Kramer from AOL Smith um I made a I made
a game for his coffee brand um where I
did a reimagining of the video game
Tapper which is like this old 1980s game
that Budweiser uh had where you would
serve at a bar and I reimagined it as a
coffee uh a coffee shop game anyway so
then uh at one point we did an
activation at a a live activation in
person where we had a screen that was up
and on the screen was a high score list
and then people at the live activation
could scan a QR code they go into a game
on the web on their phone and then they
play that game and then their names go
up on the high scoreboard and this
really worked really well and then so we
changed this into a product and this is
the product that is uh really about to
blow up what we do is we'll go into a
brick and mortar business where gaming
works like say a sports bar you put up a
leaderboard screen wait Victor we need

[51:01]
leaderboard screen wait Victor we need
the URL people are people are dying for
the URL what's well the URL of the
website is High scoregame arcade.com
game arcade.com High scor game
arcade.com and that's the URL where you
can see the game that I made with uh uh
Joey Kramer from AOL Smith his uh coffee
brand cool I'm just going to share my
screen real quick right rocking and
roasting that's the name of his coffee
amazing oh and then on July 1 uh you get
you win a thousand dollars if you get
the high score in the game very cool um
so so this is the website the website
works it runs on ads it and runs on ads
and Brands nobody has to pay to play the
game but you know like uh this is how
the game works so in in person what'll
happen is at a bar you'll see like a
high score you'll see like a leaderboard
and it'll it'll be like saying play
it'll be a screen that'll say play this
game you know win a $25 bab if you get
the high score today okay they scan and

[52:02]
the high score today okay they scan and
then the game and they play the game and
their name goes up on the leaderboard
and it's highly interactive and we found
that like 40% of people when they're
told about this uh like will interact
with it and then so these brick and
mortar businesses gain all of these
emails okay for they and gain local
emails and then and then we own all the
advertising space on the screens and at
the end of the game so Brands want to be
on the screens and on the game over
screens with a clickable ad okay and
then so and so when we approach when we
approach places it costs them nothing
the brand pays for everything okay so
like if you've got a chain of bars we
put this we put this leaderboard thing
in your bar with games that we which
games that we serve um and then a brand
like say Coke will be like we want to be
on all of those screen
and so they pay for they pay for the
activation the the spaces get money from

[53:03]
activation the the spaces get money from
the BR the the brand sponsorship some of
that money goes to the spaces to pay for
their daily prizes like the $25 bartab
or whatever they want to give out and
then the then the spaces get local email
lists so it's like kind of like a win
for everybody yeah um and then where and
then where we are right now is we just
started offering this because we kind of
like found our way to this product and
then the hardest part is talking to
brands that have the
money um it's just a world where I you
know I I I'm not familiar with I mean i'
I've kind of chipped my way into that
world a little bit I found ways to get
there if there's a better way say less
it sounds like the vibe is you're really
like you love what you do and you love
building the games and you love and and
that's like your passion and the dealing
with the big

[54:01]
with the big
Brands and finding them and getting in
those rooms and doing those deals
doesn't seem like it's exciting to you
and something that it's your unfair
Advantage is that
correct uh I don't know what you mean by
it's my unfair Advantage what do you
mean well I think whenever you're doing
a startup you do need an unfair
advantage and when I don't I haven't
known you for that long but it's clear
that you're a really creative person
like
you you have you come up with really
cool ideas and you put them into into
life right and around gaming and art and
music is that even just like looking
looking in your background like that's
the vibe I get yeah um there's literally
a cat just
like yeah it's perfect it's perfect so I
think what you need so I like the
concept yeah and you're also drinking
whiskey at what time what time is it

[55:00]
whiskey at what time what time is it
well I'm in New York we had brunch we
already started so parties on today you
know totally totally you're a rockstar
you're a gaming Rockstar so I I like the
idea I think it's interesting the idea
of selling to brands also you know
sounds like a big headache honestly I'm
curious if people sip or spit this idea
um feel free to put in the in the in the
chat but I think what you need
is do you have like an agency that
represents you
guys yeah we're talking to one we're
we're so so uh I come from entertainment
background which is actually I had a lot
to think about when the guy was talking
about video because I used to be a video
a television producer most of my time um
and then so uh about his many
documentaries I think he's right on for
that like Brands will absolutely love
that and you do it right and you just

[56:00]
that and you do it right and you just
plan it well and I think that he could
knock it out of the park because you can
keep your cost down that's beside the
point um [ __ ] what was the question I'm
so sorry I have ADHD do you work with an
agenc do you work with an agency
yeah yeah I have I have an agency for
some of my projects but not this
particular one but I am going to be
pitching into agencies right now we what
we do is I use the win mode database do
you know what that is no I don't WI
winmo W nmo is this database of all
companies and all of their staff who who
do marketing and sponsorship and it
tells what their mandates are how much
they spend what their spending is month
by month in some cases um wow I'm gonna
and and I'm going to give something very
valuable to everybody here if you um
depending on what city you're in uh the
New York public so the New York Public
Library gives you a free membership to
winmo if you have a library card and
it's worth 10 wmo's memberships are

[57:00]
it's worth 10 wmo's memberships are
worth $10,000 a year no
yes yes what exactly and then some and
then I checked and then some other
cities do the same thing I think Chicago
does it as well so it's and and it's
these it's a it's a giant database it's
so
valuable and you can get it for free
through the public library Business
Center in New York yeah I don't know
what you all think but it feels like
Victor is an angel and he's just come to
bless us with his three
tool what I found that transferred
really well to entrepreneurship is that
I used to be U for all those shows I was
also a highlevel researcher and then so
like if I like when we do do documentary
shows I'd have to research and make sure
that everything was 100% correct and so
I'd find things in Crazy spaces and then
so like that obviously translates um for
entrepreneurship you could just find

[58:00]
entrepreneurship you could just find
things that are
useful okay I like it we got some quick
questions for you and then we're gonna
have to move on but our quick questions
are someone Arian says sitp but why not
charge subscription fees to the business
instead like have you thought about that
yes we have thought about charging
subscriptions fees to the business
however the the um the thing is I the
the the long game is because every
business wants this every Mort brick and
mortar business wants emails of local
people period yeah um if if I had the
money right now I could fund this myself
and just put it in every bar that said
yes and then I would own all those
screens and then it would be it would
then then when we were in contact with
Brands it would be just super easy
because it's already it's already easy
now the brands that we have gotten in
contact with are very responsive to this
already so that's why I'm just like
digging to find out exactly how to reach

[59:00]
digging to find out exactly how to reach
people because it's when they know it
exists when they know that they can be
in these spaces and then and when they
know that at the end the very game over
screen is a is a clickable ad that they
could own like the brands want it Jamal
says dude I'm switching to Whiskey right
now so you're again an inspiration and
then Jam also says why not just
affiliate with people who are already in
the rooms you want to be in um I am
trying to do that I for instance Buck
Wild agency so I I have a contact
through Buck Wild agency and they are an
agency which has Brands and then so we
already we already kind of got in with
them because um one of my other Ventures
is a is a TV show idea that I have a
co-production deal and the company that
I have a co-production deal with is
represented by Buck Wald and so they're
representing a TV show that I created
and so that is like a kind of a weigh in
this just happened last week so I
haven't gotten chance to talk to them
yet so I'm trying to figure it
out cool and what's one quick question I

[1:00:03]
out cool and what's one quick question I
can answer for you before we head out I
just want actually actually one quick
question that you could answer is um do
you rem so I couldn't find when when you
guys were talking about octop playay on
one episode do you remember this
episode uh I know so you know is though
right the casin is the gaming
the of cars and blah blah blah yeah we
about with gambling yeah yeah and you
guys were talking funny I've been
approached by a guy who wants to do a
gambling we're gonna do we may do some
white label stuff here
yeah I mean why not but um but when
you're were talking about that um I also
thought of monetizing through
payperclick
ads um just because if we have all these
people playing these games we could
monetize through paperclick ads and you
mentioned um I wish I could remember

[1:01:00]
mentioned um I wish I could remember
what you mentioned do you like is there
a better alternative to paperclick ads
like if if I weren't gonna monetize with
Brands how else would I monetize besides
we talked about lead based we talked
about like give me your phone number
like you know give me your phone number
give me your email address
and um like we we talked about CPA cost
per no CPL cost per lead is what we
talked about so right companies which
which pay for that and then that in
Affiliates and stuff like that exactly
yeah right I think that's the easiest
sell versus trying to sell cost per
click because then people are you know
you're going to um a Chili's let's say
Chili's restaurant and you're like hey
would you you know would you pay a
dollar a click and it's like um maybe um
because then you're competing against
Google and Facebook and stuff like that
versus hey if I got you
25,000 email address addes and phone
numbers in your local area would you
give me $25,000 for that oh yeah all day

[1:02:01]
give me $25,000 for that oh yeah all day
long because they know that the lifetime
value of a customer is XYZ and it's
further down on the funnel right cost
per click is at the top it's like all
all it is is intent oh I have intent to
go to
Chili's that that's great and then you
also reminded me one of the reasons that
we weren't trying to charge uh monthly
fees to these places because we have to
educate them because a lot of these
brick and mortar businesses they don't
even understand e-commerce at all yeah
totally so you don't want to do you
don't want to do that it's it's harder
to educate them um yeah thank you and
before I just want to say second thank
you because I did reach out to Dicky
Bush because of your show okay um about
my writing app and um and we're actually
talking about doing something together
which is awesome there you go thanks you

from Miami I went to Michigan and I
moved to New York City and then back to
Miami you know where I'm from originally

[1:04:01]
uh my background's in Consulting ernston
young deoe um like implementing large
Erp systems but I've been working for
the man all this time and I really
wanted to venture out and do something
and so I have a lot of ideas um the one
I want to talk about today is something
I've kind of worked on a little bit more
than the others but um nothing really
totally fleshed out so what I'd like to
do is I kind of um
just if let me know if you can
see I have a little just a little
deck you know could you share your
screen yeah I'm trying to I might not I
don't know we've never done this you
know we've never had
uh someone do that but if you can okay
oh oh wow I see your screen hold on I
have to add it to the stage boom
all right everyone see it cool we're
we're we're live wait Journey all right
you have you have a few minutes to go

[1:05:02]
you have you have a few minutes to go
through it's only it's only one slide
it's just
something I just wanted some visuals so
that we can actually look at something
while we're chatting um so I wanted to
share I needed to lose weight I still do
actually but I wanted to build a
community to make it fun and also to
really monetize it so I was active
between 20 22 2020 and
2022 um I wanted to start monetizing it
via like being an affiliate ads YouTube
Etc um so I own weight journey.com as
well as the Twitter handle um and so I
started a YouTube channel I recorded
maybe about less than 20 videos I also
have a Facebook landing page for it and
um oddly enough Greg the reason this has
kind of like started to come into my
mind again because I I kind it kind of
died after 2022 but the Facebook page
recently every day gets like three likes
and like subscribers it's it's
subscribing by itself I'm not doing

[1:06:00]
subscribing by itself I'm not doing
anything and I don't know what's going
on with the Facebook I'm not I'm
literally not touching it and so I'm
thinking gosh I've got right now 624
people subscribed to this page um and I
can continue posting onto there you know
onto that page so you know it's kind of
fertile ground I I lost a lot of weight
with one product in particular one
course and um but then you know after
the pandemic ended up gaining some
weight back so I'm thinking instead of
putting so much pressure on myself to
share this journey the idea is um like a
spin-off idea and you know if you guys
don't don't you know like this maybe if
people have other ideas for other
spin-off ideas I'd love to hear them but
maybe a before and after app that would
be really similar to Instagram but
really solely for sharing pictures and
stories of people's before and after so
whether that's weight loss muscle gain
Home Remodeling plastic surgery results
things like
haircuts um I purchased a few URLs that
you see on the screen Shaz Shazam Max

[1:07:02]
you see on the screen Shaz Shazam Max
inspo for inspiration for people
beforeand
after.not is for that well thank you for
sharing Evette this is legendary and uh
the domain that you own way journey.com
is an incredible domain do you know who
tried buying it a few years after I
owned it and then now they have a patent
on it and I don't have a patent on it
but I own the URL is the OIC company oh
they tried byy yeah they they have a
patent on the name but um I thought you
were gonna say Weight Watchers who was
one of our clients one of our old
clients yeah that would make sense yeah
um but OIC also sort of makes sense as
well
um what's your what do you want to get
out of
this to be perfectly honest I really
want to work for myself that's and so um

[1:08:00]
want to work for myself that's and so um
it doesn't have to it has to generate a
certain amount of income to to have just
a certain lifestyle but not a huge
amount and so it's funny because I talk
I read you know I follow you on LinkedIn
I hear you talking about Millions I
don't even have to be there to just
really work for myself so it has to
generate enough to just be comfortable
um let's just say well under a million
and so that's one two is I feel really
passionate about you know weight loss
and health and how people approach it
and so I'm very interested and I think
you should do something that you're
passionate about yeah um because I've
tried I've thought about other ideas but
I'm not as passionate about them so they
don't come as naturally so these are the
things that I'm trying to get out of it
and I know that the you know in general
everyone's trying to look good and lose
weight so it's a fertile ground but how
do you tap into it you know well I think
what what I'm missing from you is what
I'm hearing at least is like a unique
point of view on how
[Music]
to approach weight loss okay you know so

[1:09:03]
to approach weight loss okay you know so
I think to me the the Instagram before
and after app like could it work yes but
you know is that the best way to achieve
your goals you know so many people come
up with startup ideas and they're just
it could be a good idea it could be a
sip idea but if it's not
really helping you get to your goal
um and and and you create that and it's
very hard to monetize like I have a
buddy who created a Instagram for
Fitness Enthusiast and it had millions
of users and he couldn't it's like oh on
paper it's doing really well but he
could he had issues monetizing it and um
you would think oh with millions of
users of course you should be able to
but then you're competing we talked
about this with Victor a little bit then
you're competing with um you're
competing with meta ads so you're in the
ad business and then you're competing

[1:10:00]
ad business and then you're competing
against meta and Google and that's a
very it's not a it's not a journey you
want to embark on what I think is you
know and I sound like a broken record
but what I think what I think how I
would approach it is like building an
audience around weight journey and and
and coming up with a unique point of
view on how you approach that you know
there has has to be some
unique way that you're approaching it or
you believe in or you partner with
someone who has like a a scientific
method or some way of approaching that
you're like I really believe in this
approach and I'm going to go create a
paid membership like for me it's like
super simple
audience p uh with a unique perspective
maybe it's like weight Journeys for
people who follow Brian Johnson or
people who are into keto or people into
you know these are unique point of views
um you know Dr Peter ARA then you can

[1:11:00]
um you know Dr Peter ARA then you can
spend money to you know you build some
audience then you can spend money
to uh you know Target people who follow
Brian Johnson Peter artia uh whoever it
is oh [ __ ] Cody's here Cody is here Cody
is in the
building um and then I think it's you
know you do a paid membership to beta
test what you're doing like you build
like a you know 20 bucks a month 5050
bucks a month you can sell coaching of
course um but I still I I'm really
missing the point of view I feel like
you can't start anything until you're
missing a point of view and don't I
wouldn't be building an app I would be
like you know building coaching and
building a paid
membership okay yeah you know Cody has
some you know you know massive community
of weight loss for sure um but I also
think like you can just do a paid you
can do a paid one a paid membership um
sell access to chap OB via text like
that's another idea which is like
there's this bigger Trend around
accountability and coaching via chat

[1:12:01]
accountability and coaching via chat
bots so if you can build the chatbot
once and just pay and sell it 20 bucks a
month there's an investment I made um in
a company called vid IQ vid IQ is this
Chrome extension does it's huge has
millions of users it helps YouTube
creators I have it on my YouTube yeah
yeah get better at YouTube and they have
a $99 a month um coaching
product uh and they use the mine share
they get from the Chrome extension to
sell coaching and I think you can do a
similar thing around like what is a free
product that you can give away and then
sell coaching and then eventually
automate via
AI okay Cody is saying you know we love
Cody he's saying what should I eat on
this yeah I think that's a big question
that people have like they want to be
able you know I had breakfast this
morning and at this restaurant and it's
like do I order the omelet do I or you
know sausage or bacon like I need help
um I should say I lost a lot of weight

[1:13:01]
um I should say I lost a lot of weight
during the pandemic on this one diet and
so I was an affiliate for it it's a
protein protein sparing modified fast so
I guess that was the niche initially
um and it was a great affiliate it was
like 80 paid 80% um for for the product
but um but I I think maybe shouting that
a little louder from the rooftops and I
love the chat idea the chat GPT idea
yeah as
a also like that's the type of thing
that you're gonna get pressed with so
like press is like looking for stories
around this chat oh my God this chat bot
saved me you know I lost 25 pounds with
this chatbot and tell you know you you
know telling your story and and going
out there and being like nothing you
know nothing was working for me and um
and I also just think so like coold
dming all these journalists and being
like here's my story and here's how chat
GPT helped me here's this GPT help me
getting is it like a chat is the idea

[1:14:00]
getting is it like a chat is the idea
like a chatbot GPT like cheerleader to
help you on your do that the idea I mean
like yeah I think like I think one of
the it could be I think what you should
do is actually write out if I you know
take a piece of paper and write like bot
in the middle AI bot and and be like
okay what are the different ways an AI
bot or AI coach could help
could help someone who's trying to do
what lose weight and it's like well
accountability like right you know did
you you know did you do XYZ today did
you not eat carbohydrate you know did
you not eat pieces of bread did you not
have fries did you not do this I don't
know um there's just general
cheerleading yeah general just like make
you feel good about yourself yeah um
Cody says there's 99,900 searches per
month for nutrition coach so there's
tons of demand for people who are
looking for these coaches um and there's

[1:15:03]
looking for these coaches um and there's
not that many AI coaches available so
now that's kind of an interesting play
that's a great idea you guys like think
about it as like a hub and spoke model
like bought in the middle and just like
what are the different things that come
out to it and and come up with that
point of view and I think that there's
probably an AI idea here and there's
uh there's probably just like a paid
yeah paid subscription you can do
awesome thank you very much I appreciate
it my pleasure thanks for coming up and
love to see where you take it
yeah all right Pat oh Patrick's already
been on here all right that's basically

cool that's pretty pretty pretty cool
this is better than Shark Tank oh
okay
wow you're here Cody what up believe I
see you more than I see my own
[Laughter]
mother I don't know I don't have any

[1:19:01]
mother I don't know I don't have any
response to
that how was your afternoon last
night how was your afternoon last night
is what I said how how's your it was
great man went to the park drank a
bottle of wine we had the dogs played
frisbee super chill then yeah went out
and got a got dinner with some friends
but anyway just working this weekend and
saw you were online and you know
naturally I I'm I'm a glutton for for
punishment and this is a compulsion and
so I have to do this um so anyway here
you are uh can I go off on the nutrition
coach thing real quick because I
actually think this is a really good
idea um I I I love I love these these
consumer apps that are starting to come
up that are basically like what's this
really expensive service that only the
the rich can afford currently um which
is terrible to say about like mental
health and like all this [ __ ] but uh
that's the reality and then like how do
I give an
80% as good version of that using you

[1:20:00]
80% as good version of that using you
know clobber together AI tools I think
there's a huge market for those types of
things and the coaching space in
particular like this is something that I
think is huge you could probably do this
in like business coaching and all these
other things um we're actually starting
to see this happen with like business
coaches or just coaches in general where
they're taking their whole back catalog
of content then they turn it into a chat
bot and they charge a subscription to it
where it's like okay um I have this you
know expertise knowledge and I'm going
to basically um almost like pay wall
gate it so for you to access it and what
this does is instead of you know they're
um it allows them to hit that part of
the market that they normally couldn't
you know extract any value from so like
as a coach like traditionally you know
you're servicing like 1% of your actual
audience who can pay you whatever your
price is you know 295 an hour Etc or
whatever your monthly cost is but um for
this you know for them what they can do
is they can be like oh this is $20 a
month you could access to all the
knowledge all of my documents in this
like way for you to like chat with it I
think that same idea you know leveling

[1:21:01]
think that same idea you know leveling
that up and applying it to okay how do I
spin this into consumer apps and that's
what I think this nutrition one could
totally be right it's like um a
nutrition coach on average is 65 an hour
in the US like if you can get that down
to where it's like 20 bucks a month and
I'm just imagining like you could be at
a restaurant you send an image of the
menu and you're like what should I eat
off this based off of my goals right and
it's like oh cool here's this like
almost like you know live and person um
you know nutrition coaching that's
happening and uh it's funny we almost
did this like two and a half years ago
at a company I was working at um but and
we were going to use like offshore
talent to basically like you know train
them on these protocols that these um
professional nutritionists would make
and then would like augment the
nutritionist so they could have like
these like live chat conversations but
now you could just do the same thing
entirely with AI so anyway but I have a
I have a fun question for you
so check this
so Weight Watchers which is the OG
totally weight loss company stocks down

[1:22:01]
totally weight loss company stocks down
95% of all time all time market caps
about 125 million bucks if you are
Weight
Watchers what would you do if I was
Weight Watchers um I think that them
having their own Instagram with like it
basically clone Instagram and it all it
is is just like you know before and
after pictures of people doing the thing
and their Journeys and then like maybe
you post their their stats like people
can have their stats on their profile um
but I think this this play is the same
thing right it's just nutrition Co their
their their game is a little bit
different though right because like
they're selling like prepackaged meals
and like all these other kind of you
know I'm just thinking about the like
the drink like that physical product
component of this um but I think that
you could probably go after this Market
with a lot of people just don't know
like they have questions and they don't
know what to ask who to ask or where to
ask or don't have the like the um you
know the the funds to basically afford

[1:23:00]
know the the funds to basically afford
that that professional coach like why
why can Chris hamsworth go put on weight
or drop weight like overnight right it's
because he has a nutritionist a private
chef and you know all these people that
are behind them basically doing that so
like I'm just imagining how do you do
basically 80% of what that uh that
person in public like that that public
figure has access to like all these
people how can you do that 80% in the
background and you know I mean this can
even relate into I'm at uh Trader Joe's
as an example I'm like taking a photo of
of one of the prepackage meals that are
there or whatever and it's like asking
my nutritionist my digital nutritionist
like you know does this fit my meal plan
like what how can I factor this in or
what you know what should I do and so I
think that's this uh that's how I would
think about the Weight Watchers thing I
have no idea because I I don't really
know their business model that well do
you know it uh decently Greg yeah I do
and there's only so much I can say here
because I've I've worked with with their
team their executive team totally um but
when you think of Weight Watchers
they're like the they're like the OG of

[1:24:02]
they're like the they're like the OG of
gamification literally 100% dude like in
the
1980s um early 1980s I think they got
started Oprah was like on the board and
the idea was just like points point
system for meals like calories is too
complicated for the average American
let's just do points and then Fitness
and then basically community centers
where they would do group wings like
they would do like wings and and they
you know so you have the totally the
peeress and you have the community
common so there there's these whole
there's I think there's two crossover
that I would do if I was in their shoes
I would go have you seen this app it's
called like Clear app or clear get clear
app.com went through YC uh I I randomly
stumbl on the founder on Twitter she was
like dropped out of Oxford or something
to go build this thing it's kind of
gangster so I don't know some some you
know traditional path but um basically
what it is is people like test they they

[1:25:01]
what it is is people like test they they
they put in their different skin like
qualities like in my dry skin in my
whatever and um there's this whole
subset of of community that like this
micr community that exists around like
skin routines right and basically
testing skin routines based off of like
what your you know your your um kind of
natural complexion your your natural
like you know fa skin basically like how
it how it functions right right so what
I mean just thinking about this but then
applied to weight loss is the same idea
like here's my body type here's this
whole thing there's this so I think
there is this space for like these micr
communities and showing the before and
after um I I just don't know like the CH
the challenge with this is always how do
you to your point like cut through the
noise like what they're doing here is
they're riding a wave that's happening
already right so like it's like skin
skincare and skin routines like face
skin routines are becoming more popular
currently so they're just like going up
with that um but that like I guess the
weight loss thing maybe it's just
something that's always happening I

[1:26:00]
something that's always happening I
don't know I weight loss is hard man I
don't I don't know consumer that well
you know
this totally yeah I will say one thing
on that on that get clear website they
have a quiz that you can take there's a
little quiz talk to me about how you
think about quizzes as a way to get
interest I I think about it is like
you're getting buyin without people
knowing that you're getting buyin right
so like if you do you know you spend 15
minutes doing this quiz and then they
ask you for your email at the end like a
lot of the times people feel this
investment that they they've just like
gone through and so it can be this
really powerful lead magnet especially
if there's like an educational component
that's provided at the end so like we
did this in the past um I was doing some
work for a company in the women's health
space and we had this uh basically like
a quiz that like once they answered all
these things it would build this like
custom plan for them right based off of
their responses super simple logic
nothing complex or like interesting but
but like again it would take you you
know we'll say 10 minutes to go through
this whole thing so it was actually a
lot of information and what we'd see is

[1:27:01]
lot of information and what we'd see is
like this super high conver it also you
know if a person is that far down this
thing like they have just shown you all
of the re like they have a huge need for
whatever the product is that you're
you're offering whatever that quiz leads
to um so I think it can be a massively
gent thing it's just again figuring out
how do you get that top of funnel uh to
like get people there but then it can be
like you know can you get at the end of
it can you get people to share out to
other people to see what their results
are um you know that type of thing but
anyway dope we're gonna bring Paul on
let's do it Paul what up how you doing
Paul what's good how's it going guys
good man how you doing good good um
thank you thank you for taking my um
taking this on um the idea here is um
really just I guess you could call it a
door Dash type app for car repairs and
the problem you're solving here is
trying to quickly identify um shops that
can take on you know either transmission
change or um an inspection and the focus

[1:28:02]
change or um an inspection and the focus
there is focus regionally and locally
right so you start our really small
moment shop mechanic shops and you know
if I need an ail change or if I need my
tire replaced go into this application
um and essentially have the businesses
compete based on price and service and
then I can make that selection and
schedule schedule that service over the
phone and so you know from my from I
don't know if I want to call it an app
or website but from the business side um
you sort of you know you take a
percentage from linking both parties
together here so that's that's the
general
idea yeah um so two questions come to
mind um so this sounds like a
Marketplace play which is always super
hard um so it's chicken and egg problem
you have to get one side of the
marketplace and have some type of um
Arbitrage that you only have or you only
see with that so for you it's it's auto
dealerships and then people or so you
know you know car owners um what I
imagine this probably serves the car

[1:29:00]
imagine this probably serves the car
owner more when you have like this
bidding war happening right um and so
the but the dealers are going to be
against this right so that's going to be
the uphill battle with this type of
thing unless you get so much volume on
the consumer side that they have to be
there um because that's where people are
going right so like door Das is an
example like why you door Dash has a ton
of these users on the consumer side if
you talk to a restaurant owner hate door
Dash they don't want to use it they want
nothing to do with it right because it
cuts in the margin but because so many
people are there they have to be there
component of this and then the other
question I'd have is around like how
what percentage of repairs Could Happen
uh like mobile like could it because
maybe it's just pulling out a subset of
this where it's like you know whether
it's uh like windshield cleaning or you
know I I don't know anything about about
the space but it's like hey we have
these three product offerings and that's
the you know these are the three things
that we do we do at a way cheaper price
and it's you know I almost think about
it as a business in a box then for some
guy that's working at Jiffy luo and he's

[1:30:00]
guy that's working at Jiffy luo and he's
like oh I can go you know I can do these
three things all day long and make more
money doing you know going out and doing
this uh an example of something that
reminds me of this is my friend's a
paramedic um and he runs like a an IV
business on the side and he like makes
more money from his IV business like
just like you know doing uh like IVs for
um uh like bachelorette parties
he makes more money from that than like
his job working for the government as a
firefighter so thinking about but again
so he contracts out to a company he's
like licensed to do photomy right just
with his his his job his work but he
contracts out to a company and they're
basically almost like this broker for
this so I'm imagining you guys could you
know fit into that same type of of role
where it's like oh we know that we can
service people anywhere they are with
these three things or whatever you know
your product offering is and then going
to you know these other guys where it's
like oh your day's off you can do a half
day and may you know what you would make
normally from two days of work at this
other other job but anyway yeah just
brained up I don't know

[1:31:00]
brained up I don't know
yep my uh my quick take on it so when
yeah I like Cody because we've we've
built a lot of stuff I feel like
whenever I hear Marketplace I'm like
allergic a little bit um the way I would
go about solving the problem would be by
creating a directory
of uh car mechanics so I would actually
think about how could you
you know everyone not everyone but a lot
of people have this feeling that you're
getting screwed uh when you work with a
car you know some car mechanic like oh
they're selling me more than than I you
know I don't really need to change those
break pads or whatever it is so I think
that I can think of like the leading
place where I can go and look at reviews
and ratings totally yeah for for car
mechanic shops and I think that
opportunity is just huge and I'd start
with that and build the SEO juice and

[1:32:00]
with that and build the SEO juice and
and then eventually go to where you want
to
build okay so in in that in that Avenue
your your I won't say Corner the market
but you're getting a you're building a
database of trusted car shops from that
exactly you're you're building the the
marketplace before building the
marketplace you know exactly yeah and
that's the challenge you have to find
one side of this right um but so like my
friend is building this company it's
called finders fee um it's basically
like a Marketplace for people to go find
luxury goods um and they have like
imagine like this Army of people that
like just go out they're kind of just um
uh I've seen like the luxury watch Tik
Tok like that whole category so it's
like imagine those people but in every
category like in cars in like private
jets and like I want to rent a yacht
that type of thing right um so for him
like his strategy was like he basically
own Tik Tok you uh YouTube shorts and
Instagram reals and he would be like
this person just made you know uh $2,000

[1:33:01]
this person just made you know uh $2,000
by finding this this car in this random
location here's how he did it he went to
finders fe.com blah blah blah but what
I'm what I'm trying to talk about here
is you have to figure out some type of
um like what which side of the
marketplace you're going after basically
to from from day one I'm again so when I
was working at this company called Rupa
Health this is we were a Marketplace we
were technically a three-sided
Marketplace which is even gnarlier but
we had practitioners we had patients and
we had the labs that we were working
with right so we had all when you're you
know in that Marketplace space like
you're basically having to service every
one of those customers and so for us we
saw that the path forward was like okay
we're going to hyperfocus on the
practitioners and on the patients and
because they're like related and they
were being underserved so we could
basically um uh assist the practitioners
with the patient management and then we
could make a better Pro
uh product for the practitioners then
what that leads into is like if you get
enough practitioners on the platform you

[1:34:00]
enough practitioners on the platform you
suddenly have leverage with the labs
that you didn't have previously like we
couldn't go in and negotiate with them
in the beginning right so for you for
again for marketplaces a lot of the
times it's like okay how do I get
leverage on one sides of this
Marketplace and then go and figure out
that you know that other side with paid
for for what you're talking about is
probably going to be like I think GRE
what Greg said is brilliant of just like
this massive directory there is no brand
right like there's no website that I
would go to right now that would be like
you know measuring mechanics against
each other of like from on a
trustworthiness basis and that's a huge
I mean first time you know first thing
you do when you move to a new city right
is like you reach out to somebody you
know there who's your mechanic that you
like that like you trust currently right
and so Imaging how do I build that
digital version of that but anyway yeah
know that was the key that sport that
sported this I remember going to a
mechanic shop and wanted me to do
something and it turned out I could do
it from from YouTube in 10 minutes and
he was charging me $75 right so that's
how this came about um from the GGO so
um Greg appreciate yeah that that sort
of change in Direction here in sort of

[1:35:01]
of change in Direction here in sort of
how to how to address this no worries y
yeah I appreciate it thanks Paul thank
you
guys all right we're gonna do one last
one before before we head out and we're
gonna bring up the lovely Joe she's back
sweet good afterno good morning guys
good morning m good morning Cody how are
you doing well how you doing great great
great thanks for having me back up um I
sent Greg and it's like so it's just so
serendipitous and there's so much
Synergy within this community that Greg
has built because the ideas that I I
sent over to Greg someone literally was
just kind of in the pocket in the same
vein with some of the things and so the
one I sent you over too but I think I'll
talk about the first one which was
creating a bot and just just let me go
over to my idea board so I can give you
oh you're our type of person you know

[1:36:00]
oh you're our type of person you know
you got an idea board you I definitely
do okay so because I'm such a YouTube
holic like my son is 13 I'll probably
meet him one day um he's like get off of
YouTube between yelling at the
politicians and studying and researching
so what I've been doing my phone is full
my iPad's full my extra phone cuz take
screenshots of the videos that are up
next because I might want to watch them
but I have Greg that I need to watch I
have Cody I need to watch before I go to
these new people and so I was trying to
find a way to curate you know by taking
a picture and then it can curate the
name of the video who the YouTube
channel a brief description of the um of
the video so you can have that curated
list and go back to and have something
to WR reference so that was one thing
that I was thinking about it might not
be useful for everyone but for people

[1:37:00]
be useful for everyone but for people
with ADD or ADHD it's good because
you're like Oh shoot what was that guy's
name that I wanted to watch he was
talking about
something and so instead of me having to
take a picture and then going and
writing it down and or talking to my
phone or my you know so I was figur
trying to figure out a way to build an
app that you know and my my I have I
have 50 million domains so mine is one
of mine is you can sell that you can
sell that.com because I I believe you
can sell everything I started my first
business when I was seven years old and
I hadn't stopped I've been corporate and
everything like that and based on I have
to just get my stuff together because
everyone globally knows me but I don't
have any real internet presence other
than real estate because that's been my
my sweet spot but that was my one idea
we get what do you guys think sip or or
no G what what's your thoughts I mean I
have a lot of thoughts on this so I
don't know if you know this Joe but
almost 15 years ago I built a video

[1:38:00]
almost 15 years ago I built a video
discovery app on top of
YouTube and it became extremely popular
it was sold to stumble upon which at the
time was one of the largest social
networks and it was all about curation
of
video kind of looked like this it was
like Tik Tok before Tik Tok but it would
be like Wednesday morning what are you
in the mood to watch and would hook up
to your YouTube
subscriptions so it would know what you
watch and what didn't watch and you'd be
able to save those videos and then you'd
be able to have these communities and
group chats around these
videos and unfortunately I think we sold
two too
early um I think that the problems
around video curation is huge I think
you can if you picked different
categories right
like uh creation for like there's
probably um hold on let me mute you for
a second because I hear myself

[1:39:01]
a second because I hear myself
cool there's probably uh like curated
videos for people who love startup ideas
curated videos for people who uh are
growth experts curated videos for people
XYZ I think you start with that like you
start building email lists around and
websites around curation of videos and
you do curated videos and you the way
you videos is probably mostly through AI
based on
certain uh you know creators YouTubers
are like this also people who like you
know Cody Schneider also like XYZ people
and then you you basically say that okay
once a video gets a certain amount of
views then it like pushes into the
system um I I think you could do it with
categories too just to pay you back off
of that um so like if you go down like
local real estate
rabbit holes you'll see this it's
actually crazy there's like all these
creators that are like here's what I'm
seeing in you know Boise Idaho for you

[1:40:03]
seeing in you know Boise Idaho for you
know XYZ like you know basically on the
front lines like what they're seeing
right um I know tons of realtors that
all watch this and consume this but it's
like 15 minute long videos talking about
how this relates to what the St Louis
fed is saying and all this stuff um
there's this company I'll drop it in the
Stream it's called like podcast not.org
um basically how it functions is you
they you like subscribe to these
podcasts and then they build you a
custom newsletter based off of what
you're subscribe to with that output so
I'm just imagining like you doing the
same thing where it's like uh you know
you you they would they would be able to
put in a YouTube channel um and oh
that's funny we're there uh so you put
in like a YouTube
channel uh basically anytime that a
video drops like you just Bas you take
the transcript you turn it into the key
takeaways or whatever the learnings are
the insights are and then every for
every person it's like they basically
have that output but I think the small

[1:41:01]
have that output but I think the small
version of this at a small scale is like
probably just taking long form content
media how do I make that smaller and
then build these micr communities or you
like the communities that already exist
how do I make a thing that that
basically Services them and have it be
you know the skim but at the smaller
scale I think that's something that
probably I I just know a lot of
professionals would want like I know
like I mean why AI newsletters and all
these other things take off like it's
because of that right and yeah I don't
know I I I think there's probably
something in in that of just like you
know selling people basically back their
time you build an audience and that
turns into okay I sell a product to them
you know whatever that ends up being or
just a subscription like like podcast
notes is a subscription I think it's 99
a year and you get act like you
basically can subscribe to whatever
these shows are and you get that recap
on a weekly basis right they're 100%
doing that with AI it's you know 100%
automated I think that same thing can be
done um for you and maybe it's just like
the MVP of this that I would probably go
after is like picking some type of

[1:42:00]
after is like picking some type of
category again like maybe it's local
real estate maybe it's like local
business news maybe you know whatever
whatever that is that you have some type
of knowledge in or some some insight um
and seeing okay can I get people
subscribed to this when it's like a
recap of everything that's happening um
and I mean what's great with this too is
you can piggy back off of these creators
um and and like what I mean that's why
you see these like Clips channels blow
up right that are like oh they're all
they're doing is just repurposing all-in
podcasts or like repurposing humman
clips and and these channels goes
because they're piggybacking off of the
uh the uh Fame that these individuals
already have you could probably do this
in the same way where it's like um you
know get a recap of these 10 different
creators of like what happened in the
last week it's probably going into like
the educational category though rather
than entertainment like I don't need a
recap of a Mr Beast video but I would I
you know but somebody would probably
want to recap of like here's what we're
seeing uh within like even local
government in this area of like a you
know a YouTuber that's talking about

[1:43:00]
know a YouTuber that's talking about
that and with the recap that happen so
anyway thank you Cody I think that kind
of morphs into and let me I have this I
have billionaire book club so I take you
know books like crushing it or jab jab
you know knock knockout and everything
you know Gary whoever it might be and I
condense it and I have videos where that
people have a subscription to so they
get these billionaire it's the
billionaire book book club and all the
books are condensed with the finer
points and then with each one they also
get like you know a spreadsheet or
something a checklist or something or
actionable tools so do you think that I
should kind of marry this into that or
would you keep it
separate I think it's I think that's the
bigger idea what's that what's that app
Greg that's like the book app that's uh
it's audio books but they're like 10
minute Clips I I'm trying to find the
name of it what is it
blinkink yeah blinkist yeah I think it's
the blinkist idea but just remix for
like a different category um like even

[1:44:01]
like a different category um like even
if honestly probably what you could do
is like every YouTuber that's in we'll
say like the oil and gas space or some
some industry that's like you knows like
big money and they're just on there
talking about you know that whole
industry or even all the podcasts are in
that you know everything that's in that
if you just had like a Roundup email
that was for that whole industry um I
think that those like you could build I
know I know you could build a new that
out in that space super quickly um
because again what you're selling back
to them is basically the the espresso
version the distilled version of this
long form content um which provides you
know you're saving them time right
that's the that's the whole concept of
what you're selling there that's the
promise that you're making and then you
can do this at scale now with AI that
you never could before and then the
phases of this is super easy right it's
like a a really manual version of it to
begin with in a specific industry and
then that levels up into okay cool now
you can select the different channels um
and then you know basically you can kind

[1:45:00]
and then you know basically you can kind
of stair step up into oh now we have
this whole custom thing where it's like
you drop in a YouTube URL and we build
you basically a custom newsletter about
every video that dropped on that channel
over the last week uh with the you know
the five top insights from this or
whatever that ends up being but yeah I
also think the name billionaire book
club like that con in the story behind
it is just so
powerful so I love that idea um Joe
thanks for coming up thank you guys
again for having me appreciate you see
you soon see all right Cody you've been
kind this is it
everyone it's been real what what do you
how long you been on here right now
almost two hours oh my god dude yeah
dude it it it literally flies by totally
I been it's so fun I think I'm going to
take the the yesterday one and just chop
it up I I I guess bail and stuff this is
honestly such a fun segment and just
like have people like pop in like

[1:46:01]
like have people like pop in like
friends that are like I don't know they
come in for like 30 minutes and yeah
just give their insight and then bounce
out I I I just it's almost like talk
radio in this weird way yeah I was
thinking of maybe doing it for like
eight hours like literally pick like a
Wednesday and be like all right all day
yeah and have like scheduled segments to
be like all right now we're having blah
blah blah on they're here from you know
the top of the hour until the end
totally yeah that would be super funny
um yeah I what you could do probably too
is then have those people like Pro
cross-promoted across their um their
socials so it's like yo I'm I'm you know
joining Greg's live stream at 9: to 10
um you know come yeah anyway super
interesting this whole idea and concept
is just really because a lot of the
times too it's like how do you get um
people that have like a lot of
experience to think about these ideas or
like you know I I am like obsessed right
now with this YouTube thumbnail thing
that we talked about yesterday I think
that's such a good business idea um and
like I never would have thought of that
right unless we talked it was it Yash I

[1:47:00]
right unless we talked it was it Yash I
think his name was yeah he was cool he
was super for people who didn't listen
to that you should really just rewatch
that segment probably about two hours in
Yash that guy was Top Shelf 100% just
how he's thinking about it super
interesting like taking a business model
that already exists and applying it in a
different place like that's actually
what really good entrepreneurs is they
just like they cross over between these
different categories with the knowledge
that they've acquired from some some
other or they're just taking something
that somebody's done before them and
like turning it into something new and
he was young how old was he I have no
idea there there I don't know there's
just Killers out there like that now
though they like they're like stumbled
in a Discord community and they were you
know
running like casinos
on on uh like World of Warcraft or
whatever and they're like oh now now I'm
going to do this because it's real money
you know like he was anywhere between 18
and 38 100% 100% I love it all

[1:48:02]
