[00:00]
dude I would pay $113,000 a month for
the ability to have a YouTube channel
because I'm attracting people you know
interested in the same things I'm
interested in and you know I could
create products then I can sell them and
services and stuff like that I don't
have to live in New York City or live in
San Francisco it you know because I have
a YouTube channel now and I have a
podcast and that's the whole point of
the owned owned media right like why are
we harping on this constantly it's
because what this allows you have the
rails you can put whatever you want on
it and it's almost like you're not even
playing the game at the pro level unless
you're doing this now especially like
this younger generation like I am
watching them print money on YouTube and
then they use that as a subsidy to go
build out these productized services and
build out these SAS companies and again
it's just it's just this new way to do
this B like business model which is so
interesting to me I feel like it's it's
changing the whole dynamic of how this
even functions or works
[Music]

[01:06]
[Music]
they should play music by the way when I
wanted to play music like it just like
you know have like thunder struck or
something tot ACDC classic dad rock or
Creed With Arms Wide Open Cody Schneider
he's back on the Pod startup ideas pod
one of your your YouTube videos on the
Pod has like 40 or 50,000 views I'm it's
insane I've just decided that I am uh
this is like a residency for me the
chain you know Vegas has the chain
smokers and then Greg's pot has me I'm
going to come back whenever they want
totally you send me a text you're on and
you sent me a text with a bunch of I
think nine really amazing
ideas so I want you just to get right
into it let's go let's go quick before
we do that can we talk about this dude
that did the cricket thing I'm so hyped
about this okay so this guy dm' me on

[02:01]
about this okay so this guy dm' me on
LinkedIn and he works at like a big 10
honestly a big five marketing agency
like it's like you know top of the list
one of them it employs one of the you
know the biggest amounts of people in
the US uh that's in that space and uh
spun it up got two customers already
he's just running Facebook ads getting
like 50 Cent emails just doing a drip
nurture basically upselling them and
he's like yo this is I'm like from the
outside looking in It's Gonna he's gonna
build a company on top of this and I'm
hyped for him so anyways this is what we
live for all right it's like people hear
this stuff and then they go and they put
it out in the wild and and tell Greg and
I about it so
anyway so you put out that idea on the
Pod he took it he probably built it in
72 hours right 100% it was like a
weekend project and it looks like he's
just using off-the-shelf tooling right
so just Shopify and then some like
Shopify apps it's the whole thing that
entire like company is that and it's a
it's a SAS business right like that is a

[03:00]
it's a SAS business right like that is a
functioning SAS business by all all
metrics he's got a good name with it too
what is
it uh SVG something he's really yeah I
think something like that yeah SVG
collections.com and uh yeah I mean this
is I think the exact execution of what I
envisioned this this would be he
basically did it and has the skill set
to actually like ship on it and it
sounds like you're just going to cash
flow it like this is his whole plan
which is amazing and is he using AI to
create the
designs yeah so that whole buildout is
using these AI tools right so you're
basically using mid Journey you're
prompting it to make like a black and
white image with a white background you
know black only and there's a promp you
have to just figure out the prompting if
you just Google like how to do uh you
know basically PNG images with with mid
Journey you'll find it and then based
off of the keywords people are searching
for goes and builds out these

[04:00]
for goes and builds out these
Collections and you can then take those
image you upscale them use an AI
vectorizing tool to turn it into a
vector which is what an sgv file is
right at its core and then at that point
uh he basically has unlimited amounts of
of products or SKS that he can sell on
this and then the structure of the
business is you basically have to
there's all these free products on it
but you have to be signed up so you have
to give your email to basically download
all the three ones and then all the
premium ones you have to be paying to
download those so there's a bump pricing
model right uh and when you think about
that funnel super easy it's just like
cool offer some type of free download
they can go and get all these free free
tools or sorry free svgs and then uh if
you know they're constantly going to see
like your most popular ones you just
make them you make them pay while gate
that's the whole the whole model around
this that I would do and I imagine
that's what he's going to do as well so
totally he's charging $3.99 a month
$3.99 a month there's no real cost

[05:00]
$3.99 a month there's no real cost
associated with it right like his costs
are are his meta ads that he's doing so
this is a beautiful business and I think
just for people listening don't just
listen like go take notes and actually
do the thing because people are doing it
they're listening to this pod and
they're they're cash flowing you know
10,000 $100,000 a month sometimes so
it's kind of crazy 100% And I think that
that's the thing with this is like it
looks tiny right now right but like when
you think about the audience like
cricket there's 10 million users like he
can blow this up into a huge business by
just being like a barnacle on the whale
of this massive company right and this
is already validated like this is he you
know this this is going to make money
like zero there's zero doubt anymore
right it's now just execution and so I
mean that for me this is like a this is
the Highlight You' live for this type of
thing when people actually go and do the
stuff that you're like suggesting from a
business all this is junk food right at
the end of the day unless you actually
go and ship on it so

[06:00]
go and ship on it so
totally so you saw that that that fired
you up and then you came up with nine
ideas just from that and here you are
what's idea number one idea number one
um so LinkedIn video is about the pop
off I've just got some data for from a
friend he did
700,000 uh
impressions in seven days he's been
doing stuff on LinkedIn for two weeks
and all he's doing he's like Instagram
Tik Tok famous already he talks about
like business content on those platforms
he's just been porting that content over
to LinkedIn like vertical video and it's
just been ripping so he only had 2700
followers when he started doing this but
still got that many Impressions so the
the reason this is happening is LinkedIn
is rolling out like a for you page feed
just like Tik Tok so what this means is
it's just blue ocean the content over
there it's terrible right like everybody
is like it's just you know bdrs talking
to like AES like that's that's what's
going on here and so what the

[07:01]
going on here and so what the
opportunity is is basically building out
a company that goes and services
Founders and the idea is is you
basically like would interview a Founder
you'd come up with you know here's these
seven different scripts we'd write these
scripts based off the conversation you
have so imagine you sit down once a week
and you interview the founder for an
hour you take those ideas you turn it
into scripts and then you send that back
to the founder they just sit down they
record it you you give them like
recording like show them the inflection
the pacing the whole thing they just are
mimicking it and they can crank these
out in like 10 minutes is what I've seen
and then you send it back to that agency
and then they create these clips and
they go and schedule them and uh this is
already validated like I had a friend
just buy this from like another person
um for like two grand a month and it's
like really what you're doing is you're
riding this wave the selling mechanism
is be that I would go after is like
there's this huge opportunity for
Founders to create massive personal
brand with this free reach LinkedIn is

[08:00]
brand with this free reach LinkedIn is
give like providing and then it also
creates like an inbound you know
generation for your your company but
that is this I think there's just like
that's a wave that can be ridden right
now from a company standpoint like if
you just have a little bit of execution
progress and know how to work with
offshore teams like this is easily I I
bet you could get this to 30k you know a
month in like probably 90 to 180 days
like no questions asked so hey everyone
if you're anything like me you've got a
ton of design that you need websites
landing pages emails social assets you
name it but you don't just want
beautiful landing pages or beautiful
websites you want the stuff that's going
to convert you want the stuff that's
going to actually drive value that's
where design scientist.com comes in it's
an agency that for one monthly price
will do all your design work all your
copy work all your engineering and do

[09:00]
copy work all your engineering and do
stuff that actually scales your Revenue
you don't need a designer you need a
design scientist let's go design
scientist.com I liked it so much I
invested in the
business a lot of people ask me oh how
did how did I get such a big Twitter
audience and I got a big Twitter
audience when threat two things happen
threads the ability to create a thread
you know they un that was that wasn't a
feature and became a feature on Twitter
and then number two the feed was uh
latest and it moved to algorithmic so
all of a sudden your content was getting
recommended to new followers exactly my
content game didn't change it was just
the platform changed so what you're
saying is really smart you're saying
that the platform LinkedIn is is
changing and there's going to be a bunch
of B2B creators that are going to take
advantage of it but they're going to
need sort of a
middleman uh to to to facilitate it

[10:00]
middleman uh to to to facilitate it
right th% it's and that's the biggest
thing with all of this is like I'm any
company I'm trying to start I'm looking
for like a larger Trend that I can
attach myself to right because I you
don't want to ever educate the market
like what you're trying to do is just
sell things that people already want to
buy right like what's going to happen
right now is they're going to start
seeing these creators like just pop off
on LinkedIn it's already happening like
it's happening at this moment it is
actively happening I know like 10 people
that are already famous in this space
that are all doing this and just going
ham on this as a channel right and
they're getting like 500 engagements
with this content with only like 3,000
followers on their account like that's
unheard of that's crazy that doesn't
exist right it's it's it's the same
moment that existed on Twitter for you
like you know when you basically grew
your audience and so the the angle here
is like Founders want to do that they
know they need to do that they have VC
dollars and so you basically go to them
and be like yo this is a done for you
solution it's going to take uh you know
let's just throw out a number like two

[11:00]
let's just throw out a number like two
hours of your mental energy three hours
of your mental energy a week and we're
going to handle everything else for you
we'll do all the data analytics we'll
get smarter with this and then they
start to understand okay cool like
imagine you uh give the like an
affiliate Link in the uh like the visit
my website section on your LinkedIn
profile and then like whatever if you're
adding a call to action to the comments
and then you can start to track okay
cool like these videos were the best
performers let's like more like this
less like this and it creates a a
flywheel so again I I I saw your Tweet
where you were like uh you know nobody's
talking about this but there's Founders
that built their personal brands on the
back of like VC subsidies and like this
is an angle this another thing that you
can basically do for that for that exact
idea you can just you know go and
capitalize on this but the people are
going to want this they're going to need
this and and so it's just a company
that's like right for the taking yeah to
me there's the entry level pricing which
is probably like 2500 bucks a month mon
with which is just exactly what you said

[12:01]
with which is just exactly what you said
but then for like five to eight grand a
month you can do lead magnets as a
service so it's like every month we'll
create a lead lead magnet for you
because like a dripa course totally
exactly totally yeah totally yeah and
then the third thing is probably just
design help so it's like we'll do your
you know your B your your banner your
cover art will go and create you know
beautiful infographics so you put that
together
Founders and that's the idea how do you
actually get to Founders though yeah I
think that that will be the hardest part
probably what it turns into is like you
are doing your own channel like you're
doing your own clip making and posting
on the platform and be like you want to
do this for yourself like book an intro
call it's probably like a community play
honestly it's like drip them into a
community and then upsell them into like
a service like this and where it's like
everybody's talking about how do they
grow on LinkedIn like you make the
LinkedIn Community for the people that
are trying to grow their accounts and

[13:01]
are trying to grow their accounts and
then they're going to see oh this is
really hard right because it is really
hard like I'm talking to you know like
I'm working with like two uh you know
two people I know that are really like
have deep knowledge in this space to try
to figure this out and we you know
there's no way I don't have that I have
the mantle bandwidth or energy to figure
this out right so think about that and
then that's what really what you're
selling you're selling the ideation the
creative components of this and for
these creators man like it's like I mean
this is a no-brainer like they sit down
and can crank these scripts out in like
I've seen them do it and like three
minutes right because they just know the
Cadence they know the sequencing all of
this um and it's just another play like
it's it's just it's just a product highe
service built around a Creator that's in
a specific category but this category is
business which we know because we're
both doing this is like a huge category
where a lot of money is sloshing around
so that's the opportunity here yeah
absolutely here's how I would do the
community aspect so I would get the
domain

[14:01]
domain
Founders going viral on linkedin.com
and I'd create a free community where
every week I'd give one tip on how to go
viral on LinkedIn like what's working
and then one breaking down another
founder and why it's working so it's
like this person Cody Schneider just got
a thousand likes on this post let me
break down why that matters you do a
monthly call where
you uh you know everyone kind of comes
in and and it's like a peer-to-peer
group and at the end you just say like
hey you know we've got this service if
you want the done for you service it's
going to cost
XYZ totally I think it's brilliant and I
mean it just again shows your expertise
and knowledge it's a repeatable thing
and you're already on the platform doing
this research already you're just
repurposing the stuff that you're
finding into into content that you're
using as a sales like tool right so
again another easy
one look for Trends you know the the
high level idea here is like look for
things that are bigger than you that are

[15:01]
things that are bigger than you that are
happening and then how do you attach
yourself to them it's the classic
Playbook like especially when you're
trying to bootstrap a thing or
self-funded it's the it's the it's the
only way to do it that I've seen it work
when you try to convince the world of
anything it's not going to happen right
someone in the comment section is
goingon to be like but you know LinkedIn
isn't going to be uh be video first
forever and then in 12 months you're
going to have to shift your business and
it's like well even if that is the case
at least now you have a 1 million AR
business with a bunch of
Founders and you'll just sell them
another service to help them grow in
LinkedIn thousand per. I think the other
piece of it too like as a Founder like
somebody that's building this audience
like you get to a scale where you can
just do whatever you want like Greg you
have a huge Twitter right you can just
basically do whatever you want you don't
even have to play the game and things
are going to hit and that's like there's
this there's this Tipping Point with all
these platforms that you can arrive at
and once you're there it's like the game

[16:00]
and once you're there it's like the game
the rules change of the game right and
so I think that's just another piece
like on you know not on the business
owner side but on the like why you
should even be thinking about building
this audience here uh because soon as
you have that I mean you can just cross
you know basically like cross promote
all of your other social channels and
then you have own Distribution on every
place that you're trying to so all right
my appetite is is wet you know I had
some some bread and I'm ready for idea
number two hell yeah all right right the
next one is a is a one graph business um
I'm going to share my screen real quick
and show you so I stumbled on this the
other day AI automation is the keyword
so this is the graph showing the growth
of the search volume for that keyword
over the basically its whole existence
so this is insane to me whenever I see
this I immediately you know Sirens are
going off what does this mean how can I
get involved with it and so what people
are looking for is basically like how do
I set up and again this is one of those

[17:01]
I set up and again this is one of those
things that's obvious like people that
are in this know this already people are
trying to figure out how do I create
automation with like make.com and zapier
and chat GPT apis and you know basically
just setting up these systems but all
these companies like if you look at
McKenzie what's happening right now is
they're just doing this for Enterprise
but there's this massive opportunity for
like SBS in small business to basically
provide this as a solution right and so
I mean the small version of this is you
build a consulting company that does
this sets this up where you ined with
them and you do a Sprint for whatever
three months and automate away the
better companies probably you go and you
create some type of produ high service
where you have like an embedded AI
automation engineer and all they do is
just figure out how to automate like
every part of your business that they
can and that's easily like you know I
you probably charge eight grand a month
for something like that just because
you're you're the cost savings is like
instant for these companies because it's
a lot of it's just like paper pushing

[18:00]
a lot of it's just like paper pushing
that you're automating but I think the
bigger thing here is they're looking
people are just looking for how do I
implement this in my company and that is
the larger wave that's happening and so
if you can just insert yourself here as
like a thought leader and probably the
distribution strategy I like I would
just bid on that keyword and then every
keyword related to like zappier make.com
any of these automation tools integrat
whatever I think that changed they make
actually but they like go and basically
create tutoral
like use perplexity AI to write
tutorials for setups and then have a
call to action that's like oh you like
one AI automation consulting or service
like you know a book of Discovery call
that creates all of your inbound and
then it's probably a YouTube channel on
top of that but that is again just like
another insane business you could
probably build and you own a company in
this space already which is like kind of
doing this for my understanding but I
don't know if you talk about it but yeah
I'll talk about it I'll talk about it
and the reason I'll talk about it is
just the space is so big that I don't
care if other people come in so we we

[19:02]
care if other people come in so we we
built a AI newsletter community business
called you probably need a robot.com
helping people be more productive using
Ai and the biggest lesson we learned is
people were asking for AI but what did
they really want automation so I think
that in the SMB space there's huge
demand for automation because what is
automation automation is cost
savings and everyone wants to save cost
so it's an easy sell so I think from a
pricing perspective what you need to do
is just figure out okay if I'm going to
save the these these guys
$200,000 how much can I realistically
charge them and that's like the mental
model that you need to come up with 20
grand just that's the number yeah that's
the number right I mean that's a way to
think about it and we're actually
launching something in July in the space
with and the beauty is we have this
media company that we can just like
launch these things to totally and
that's the whole point of the owned

[20:00]
that's the whole point of the owned
owned media right like why are we
harping on this constantly it's because
what this allows for you have the rails
you can put whatever you want on it like
anything you want to get out in public
like again the company can zero to one
in in 30 days and it's sustainable it's
like already cash flow positive and it's
sustaining itself when you have these
own media channels and so the again I I
it's so easy it's just like what like
content is a grind right like that's the
challenge with it it's like how do you
not do burnout but it's like just
figuring out that that you know what is
that thing that I can do over and over
again weekly monthly you know daily
that's not going to kill me and then how
do I put people behind me to basically
run those operations on it but what
kills me and what's so funny is that
like we were talking about this I think
on the live stream but if you go talk to
like like a banker or like the hours
that people are like oh content's hard
it's like this is not that many hours
like in all reality like it's not that
gr like it's not that grindy as people
think it is it's it's just like can you
show up and do it consistently that's
the hardest part with this but totally

[21:02]
the hardest part with this but totally
and I think it's also like spend time on
figuring out what's your tone what's
your voice what's your personality
what's your style what's your structure
like what's your format of the content
and then how are you going to basically
bring a pipeline of ideas of content
ideas in and then use that system to
help you create a lot of that content
that's what the game is you're more
think of yourself as more of a
you know an editor than a writer a
curator uh you know you're you're you're
you're conductor of the orchestra you're
not playing the flute thousand per
thousand per. I mean that's really just
good business ownership right as well
like you're trying to basically figure
out all the puzzles if you're that deep
in it even um but a lot of the times in
the early days there needs to be founder
energy to like break the laws of physics
and get into orbit without that it just
doesn't happen in my experience for
companies and then once you get to that
place like okay we're in orbit now then

[22:01]
place like okay we're in orbit now then
it's like okay how do I step back as
much of them as possible I love that
quote from the the kingo's founder I
can't remember his name but it's like
get out of your business and on top of
it I just always think that that's such
a simple way to say the the core of the
idea and it feels you know with the
content side it feels like the same
thing here and the company we talked
about in you know at the beginning of
the episode is literally that right it's
like okay cool like I'm help I'm letting
other people that are experts in it and
for a lot of a lot of Founders that are
legit like they could go figure this out
right but they have a I mean I got a
million other things that I'm trying to
manage at this time so if I can just
have somebody I show up for an hour and
like I know that content is going to
come out of that it's a no-brainer right
and so it's that same it's that same
thing here cool I love it what's what's
idea three yeah I want to do I I want to
talk about this like AI graphic designer
thing I it's I have a tweet that's like
going viral right now which is hilarious
like as we record this but it's wild to
me that there has there hasn't been of
these made yet that's good like and I

[23:00]
these made yet that's good like and I
get pitch these all the time like in the
comments right now people are like oh we
built that and it's like no you didn't
like all I'm talking about is like I
just want something where I give it a
brand Style guy like here's our colors
here's our logos here's our like fonts
and you know now make me a uh you know a
podcast thumbnail right or like make me
an email header for a newsletter or
whatever that is and it just like I
don't even need it to be perfect I just
want it to be like good enough so that I
can then be like oh I like this I'm
going to throw it in figma and I'm
basically going to recreate it something
like that almost like a co-pilot in a
way and it's insane to me that something
like I haven't seen something that does
this yet it'll just like all the ones
I've seen it just goes off in on this
tangent and you end up in no man's land
from a design standpoint or it just
looks like you know it was made in
PowerPoints in 2009 so I don't know if
you've seen anything like this but the
other piece of this as a software like
this is something that people are
searching for they're isn't a good
solution so if you just figure out like

[24:00]
solution so if you just figure out like
a small version of this this is a 100%
like a sass that can be built out and I
think you could sell it super easily
like what's crazy is canva hasn't moved
into this space already they like they I
feel like they're positioned so well
where you could just like prompt and it
like creates the thing that you're kind
of imagining and looking for based off
of your brand sty like your brand style
guide but again it just it just doesn't
exist and so anyway I'm curious your
thoughts on that I mean it doesn't exist
yet I think they're going to be going I
mean they're going in that direction
canva recently did did you watch any of
their they did like a massive event no I
didn't see it no one on Tech Twitter no
one on Tech Twitter was talking about it
and like that's the event like forget
WWDC you know the canva event actually
had like so much that if you're trying
to create profitable
startups go go watch it go watch what
they announced dude some of these titles
are
insane yeah yeah

[25:00]
insane yeah yeah
yeah it's wild so they're definitely
going into AI territory and I could see
them doing some of this but I I think
that even if they do it it doesn't
matter there's always going to be demand
for hey I need this asset
ASAP and I'm I'm worse than you know I I
I'm worse even even even if I'm good at
canva I'm not the best at canva so so I
think there's if it was just like
imagine like an AI align thing like you
like throw all the content you want to
be in there and then it just like
basically because that's really what I
think people are actually looking for is
like how do I have it so it has the
proper white space so it feels right how
you know it's it's based off the like
I'm just imagining like I I I put in the
title the text that I want right I maybe
I drop in like a background image and
I'm like okay cool like turn this into
20 different Facebook ads based off of
my brand style guys
and it just likeets those out right like

[26:01]
and it just likeets those out right like
that's I think what we're we're talking
about here it's not like and again to
your point I think you made a really
valid point of like it's it just has to
be better than I am it doesn't have to
be graphic designer level like if it's
an 80% of a graphic designer but a like
a hundred times faster than me you know
putting in a a request to my graphic
designer and then I have to wait on them
and like the whole that whole thing like
if I can just get something out super
quickly like you have a market there if
the if the pricing is right on it all
this stuff you I think you again you
could do super cheaply when it's
augmented by these by AI do you know
design
pickle totally yeah I mean they're OG
design OG been around for I don't know
10 15 years they probably
do uh you know 30 million a year in in
revenue and from what I've seen they
generate a ton of customers from meta
ads I'm constantly seeing their ads on
Instagram and they charge about $4.99 I
believe $499 a month so it's very very

[27:02]
believe $499 a month so it's very very
cheap to get in there I think that if
you're going to go build this the way to
do it is it's like $99 a month 99 and
design pickle only allows you to have
one thing in the queue at a time like if
you had it where you could like
multi-thread so you give it yeah or he
even here's a list of prompts and then
it's working on those simultaneously I I
think that that is something that would
be incredibly valuable to every company
I mean I I know want it just like I was
writing an email newsletter this morning
I'm like [ __ ] I just want this header to
be like in our style like I I can build
it in figma but I don't like I just you
know can we just have this exist in the
next two seconds right and I just copy
it over drop it in like that's the
that's the and maybe that's what it's
built on top of it's like it's built on
top of CA and that's your distribution
strategy it's built on top of figa and
it's like just another subscription
outside of it you kind of get platformed
that way I mean it's it's hard to build
you know really complex UI things but I
don't know I just think that this like

[28:00]
don't know I just think that this like
even if you it just gave back like
variations of ideas like okay here's 20
of them or something I don't know there
if we think about what's happening in
the AI writing space where it's like hey
we give it Source material and then
we're having it right based off that
Source material and it's making way
better outputs right so when I'm writing
from the general knowledge of the L like
the llm it's super like it's not it's
pretty average um but when I give it
awesome Source material it's going to
create really decent output is what
we're seeing so it's just that same idea
but it's applied in the graphic design
space right like here's these brand
style guides like I'm just giving you
kind of like a box that you have to work
in now go build within that box and like
what I found is that by putting
constraints on these AI to like just any
of these AI things like you can but that
those limitations allow for it to create
way better outputs or the outputs that
you're looking for more you know most of
the time cool I like this one I think I
do think that the pricing like
undercutting design pickle like design
pickle my guess is they have a ton of

[29:01]
pickle my guess is they have a ton of
offshore Talent right so the reason
they're able to charge so cheap is it's
it's offshore but my guess is they're
not going to create a $99 a month plan
right so you can you know they rode the
offshoring wave you can raid uh ride the
AI wave and there's a business here 100%
all right let's keep the pace going just
got through the Double Espresso so I'm
feeling energy now right this is another
done for you service for Founders uh so
every founder wants to have a newsletter
none of them want to write it and so
that same thing we were talking about
where you sit down with them for an hour
I mean this could probably be the same
service it's like you know another
offering that you have but you sit down
for an hour you interview them and you
take that transcript and you turn it
into a newsletter and so how do you grow
the newsletter a lot of the time what I
would do is I'd go approach people that
already have like a Twitter following a
LinkedIn following something like that
and I'd be like okay we're going to get

[30:00]
and I'd be like okay we're going to get
all those people that already followed
you on those platforms onto this
newsletter and like basically be a sub
sub to the newsletter so how do you
actually do that so you can actually we
just found this recently but you can go
scrape uh people's emails from Twitter
so like I've just been running this
scraper scraping emails from uh like my
Twitter followers and then using a
validation tool to like okay are these
real or not and like the data I'm
getting back is like almost like 40 to
50% of them are valid emails which is is
insane so the testing that we're running
is just sequencing them into the
newsletter and seeing what's happens
right so you can do the same thing on
LinkedIn use a tool called like sales ql
I think is what it's called but you can
again go and scrape all the connections
of a person um and then from that same
thing uh you can you basically sales QA
extracts the emails you go and validate
it sequence them into the newsletter and
then uh at that point like you can
probably get a list and again I would go
after these people that already have
these followings they want to do this
but they just don't have the operations

[31:00]
but they just don't have the operations
piece behind it so again another super
simple business and that that would be
really the whole thing just like set
that up and then the other component of
it is like build these automations for
them use something like Phantom Buster
where it's like every new person that
tries to connect with the found with the
per with your client automatically send
them like a subscribe to my newsletter
link uh with some type of like call to
action or offer and then the same thing
uh with Twitter anybody that follows you
automated DM that goes out to them to
follow and that's how you continue to
grow this um but I I I think that uh and
then again you just as they follow you
you just every month you go and scrape
them see slowly sequence them in like
200 a day to that list and then just
you're basically writing the content off
of the founders ideas and it could be
even just like a Ride Along on their
business of what they're doing right but
I think this larger theme that we're
starting to see is like these
founder-led like founder Le companies
are what's going to happen like there
you're a Founder is basically turning
into a media company themselves and I'm
just imagining like what the Bei founder

[32:01]
just imagining like what the Bei founder
uh like Tyler's doing with his his
newsletter that's just like updates on
the company how do you do a version of
that but for like every founder that's
have some type of uh audience that
they've already built on these other
platforms and then just run that on the
background for them and again on the
when you interview them you have the
language that they use you have the
ideas that they use you're basically
just translating their their you know
raw data that they're providing you into
a tone style and voice and you can
prompt it like yo just take the here's
an Insight from this episode here's the
transcript you know write uh write a a
whatever an two paragraph uh like
section based off this transcript about
this insight and the tone style and
voice that this transcript has and
you'll get it you know 95% of the way
there from a voice standpoint human
layer over the top of that but I think
the grow the growing side of this super
easy too you just go like DM these
people and it's just like send them hey
we grew this newsletter for XYZ person
right show them the data for it and it's

[33:01]
right show them the data for it and it's
like all you have to do is you show up
an hour hour a week you we record the
session and that's it we handle
everything else it's all handled on the
backside and you get this own
distribution channel that like creates
deeper relationships with your with your
followers and you know your customers
Etc so yeah I like this idea for two for
a few reasons one is Founders are going
to look at this as row as they're going
to be like okay I'm going to pay you
$100,000 a year but the lifetime value
of a customer to me is worth
$25,000 so I just need four of these to
work so I love that and I think that's
like a new trend just like looking at
audience as BR as return on audience
spend so that's that's number one and
number two everyone knows that being
dependent on any of these one platforms
is a bad idea so everyone's trying to
get off these plat forms into email or
text so this is just selling schmuck

[34:03]
text so this is just selling schmuck
Insurance 100% you know what I mean this
is selling schmuck Insurance don't be a
schmuck have an email list is like the
tagline so simple 100% The Branding
could be super cool too like around that
idea right yeah like just like somebody
with like you know they got their hands
in their hair like just like oh God I
just got platformed
on yeah oh no dude did you hear about
Roger oh what happened to Roger oh Roger
got Roger got thought it was a
real exactly Roger Roger's gone dude
it's
insane anyway and it's like that is I
think that's just an easy win and
everybody's trying to do this and trying
to figure out how to do
[Laughter]
this I like how I like how when I was
like first of all are you even friends
with a person named Roger do you even
know any I know Roger I hate him I've
never met a Roger I like I don't know
about you yeah that's true actually I

[35:01]
about you yeah that's true actually I
don't know what it is about Rogers but
uh they're polarizing put it that way
they're like olives they're like olives
that's right Rogers are like olives but
yeah I was like did you hear what
happened to ro Roger and your I saw your
heart drop dude immediately I was like
wait who is it somebody we know and I
saw your heart drop because you're
basically not wearing a shirt right
now so I can see your heart it's Peak
it's Peak summer here in Denver right
now and I am dying I'm just only in
linen and shorts that are way too small
but you have to I guess show some thigh
otherwise I look like a dad I'm out here
I'm just trying to wear car hearts and
everybody's like you're not a painter
right you work online you have soft
hands you do have soft hands I mean just
just because you do cold emailing
doesn't mean your hands are uh got
calluses on them 100% they're dirty but
not callous exactly that's right all
right I like that idea very

[36:00]
right I like that idea very
straightforward idea number five what's
idea number six okay six this one is we
did a live stream and I I literally
can't stop thinking about this idea but
it's basically YouTube thumbnails it's
really similar to the Cricut one that
initially like you know everybody kind
of got obsessed about but it's YouTube
thumbnails just like a whole library of
them as a subscription so YouTube is is
owning the Creator space like why is
that happening because monetization is
built into the platform they have the
best RPMs and so like you can just
basically make decent money off of your
content if you're good right that's the
whole concept behind it um why does
every tick tocker Instagram person you
know anybody everybody ends up on
YouTube in the long you know in the in
the long run over a long enough time
Horizon the reason for that is because
the monetization is is so powerful and
so with that said I think the
opportunity is basically you build this
whole library of these uh thumbnails
that you can just it's like plug and

[37:01]
that you can just it's like plug and
playay uh you can go you know access any
one of them you swap out assets like
it's like you know your face gets
swapped in and out that type of thing
and then the go to market strategy here
super straightforward you just go and
scrape every YouTuber's email address
you can do this like go to Fiverr search
scrape YouTube url your scrape YouTube
emails you give them like specifications
of where you want it to be like I want
over 10,000 Subs in the USA and uh you
know whatever maybe a keyword category
you want them in and then you go and you
just like cold email
them basically access to this tool like
hey we built a library of thumbnails and
maybe it's like some free offer
initially it's like you know they get
access to a 100 and it's like if you
want access to 100,000 then it's a it's
a paid tier you know or access to 10
initially or something like that um but
that that would be my whole dis be my
whole distribution strategy and I think
there's a huge play here like especially
like this younger generation like I am

[38:00]
like this younger generation like I am
watching them print money on YouTube and
then they use that as a subsidy to go
build out these product highz services
and build out these SAS companies and
then you know they go on Money Twitter
and they're like yo I've got negative
CAC and every every old head is like
looking down at them they're like you
little [ __ ] like what like like how
are you doing this basically right um so
I think that's the opportunity or the
larger wave that you can ride with this
like I think YouTube is becoming the
social media and they're owning it right
they're owning long form they're owning
podcasting they're owning short form
they're owning monetization like all of
the Tailwinds are there for this
platform to kind of just be the winner
and so I think that's where this goes
long term so when I post to
YouTube me and my producer come up with
like a few title and thumbnail ideas and
then we kind of just hope for we pray
for the best that's basically it right
so I think that there's an opportunity
to first of all not just do only
thumbnails combine it with titles

[39:00]
thumbnails combine it with titles
because titles are equally as
important and then putting putting data
behind oh this title is yeah is and I
knew you were I knew you were about to
go there this this speaks you right this
idea around okay there's a 75%
probability that if you use this
title uh it's going to generate 25% more
traffic because the search volume the
this the that and I can you can even
like I use uh vid
IQ yeah and vid IQ has a ton of really
good data and this this may be something
that you like pitch to vid IQ or work
you I don't know if they have an API or
anything but the data is available
totally 100% I think if you put that to
of like hey this video like here's the
thumbnail title combo and it got this
many Impressions this many views you
know just pull that data out of YouTube
and put that in the data set so like
their whole library is that right um I
mean you know create some filtering
capabilities within it as well like also

[40:00]
capabilities within it as well like also
like a time thing because like what I
found again people way smarter than me
that tell me how all these platforms
function what I found is that there's
like just like there's Trends on social
um like you know like Instagram Etc or
Tik Tok like with with videos or ideas
going viral it's the same idea with like
YouTube thumbnail and title combinations
so there's almost like a a shelf life to
all of these where you have to you know
you have to be cycling through this that
if you just use the same kind of form
format over people get uh there there's
fatigue to it right it's just like ad
fatigue it's the same idea they almost
get they get blind to that and so the
idea here is you could basically like
it's this constant feed which creates a
stickiness from a user standpoint as
well right it's like hey we're doing all
this data scraping for you we're pulling
in all these variations and then you're
basically providing these templates for
them and I don't even know if you'd have
to have it be templates to begin with
like I just kind of want access to the
YouTube thumbnail and titles like this
guy this kid I'm working with that's
like helping me on the YouTube side like
this is literally that's actually what

[41:00]
this is literally that's actually what
I'm paying him to do it's like cool like
here's my product and I'm going to go
find all these like YouTube thumbnail
and title variations that are like could
be remixed or like into what my product
offering is right and that's re like he
just has this pulse on how to do that
but I think there's like a layer in
there that you could add some type of
software that would augment that that
that ability to go and find those and
then you just pass it on to your graphic
designer um I mean you could have you
know some AI version of this is like how
you know what's the how would I uh how
would I take this title and translate it
into you know whatever for for the video
that I'm about to post but I think
really it's just like show them a
library of ideas with the data attached
and that is where all the value comes
from like you know canva what's
interesting you know we've been talking
about a lot today but like they have all
these templates that are there what I
want to know is like do these templates
actually work like especially if it's
marketing related like what's the data
like okay if I send this in an email is
this going to be effective and that is a
really interesting idea when you kind of

[42:00]
really interesting idea when you kind of
scale that up like what are these other
places that this can be applied in right
um so I I think there's probably like
tons of other businesses that are just
this it's like aggregating like what is
working and then what's the trend
analysis on top of that for all of these
marketing channels that people are
investing in currently yeah I like this
I also like you know it's just one of
those things where more and more people
just and you said it yourself they want
to be creators they want to be YouTubers
and it's interesting cuz now it's
bleeding in bleeding into like the B2B
space there's so many Founders I talk to
now that are like secretly like yeah I
want to be like bit of a YouTuber you
know like I want 100,000 Subs on YouTube
and I I'm like what 100% dude I everyone
I'm talking to is doing this because
it's like it's a clout thing which is
weird but the the the stranger part and
I think the layer like you know the
higher level layer of this is it's yeah
exactly
like what does it say I can't see you to
blurry right now
so the last 30 days on my YouTube

[43:01]
so the last 30 days on my YouTube
263,000 views and that's like long form
you know insane totally 31,000 hours of
time what's the ad reg for that to give
people perspective I'm gonna give it at
the end I'm not I'm I'm not just GNA
give it to to people how this works it's
not how YouTube Works bro I thought you
want to be a YouTuber and then I added
6,300 subscribers in the last
days and I made an estimated revenue of
$3,000 totally which subsidizes a year
totally subsidizes the cost of that that
building that audience right dude I
would pay $113,000 a month for the for
the ability to have a YouTube channel
th% because I'm attracting people you
know interested in the same things I'm
interested in and you know I could

[44:00]
interested in and you know I could
create products then I can sell them and
services and stuff like that so it's I
don't have to live in New York City or
live in San
Francisco it you know because I have a
YouTube channel now and I have a podcast
100% you can get like deep trust in a
one to many
format and which just creates inbound
for you but the bigger thing like to
your point of like you no longer have to
be there right like I think that that is
again another reason like why I started
building own media it's like I don't
have any pedigree right like I'm from
bum [ __ ] Idaho the sticks right in
comparison to everybody else that's in
this game and so this was like a way to
get a leverage point right and so
because of that like anybody globally
can now do this if you have good ideas
and you're sharing them regularly in at
scale like this is this way to do that
and oh by the way you can get paid for
it as well and like totally why is
YouTube G to win podcasting I mean we
talk about this all the time offline
right it's because of this right like
you can have like in an hour and a half

[45:00]
you can have like in an hour and a half
long video I can have what three to four
mid roll ads occur I mean [ __ ] it's just
a printer when you get to scale right
and so you're making that simultaneously
you know it goes all the you know down
funnel into their companies and again
it's just it's just this new way to do
this B like business model which is so
interesting to me I feel like it's it's
changing the whole dynamic of how this
even functions or works and it's almost
like you're not even playing the game at
the pro level unless you're doing this
now like I look at the stand store guy
like he's funded right like classic path
but he's also doing this and I'm like
you're playing at a caliber like at a
level that is so much higher than like
the average VC backf founder is now like
the game you're playing like it's ch
what they're doing traditionally is
Child's Play In what in comparison to
what you're doing right and I mean
that's a that's a bonus business idea
right there you make a list of all the
VC
firms and specifically I mean you start
with Enterprise B2B ones and then you

[46:00]
with Enterprise B2B ones and then you
make the pitch that their Founders need
to be media companies and their
businesses need to be media companies
and you try to sell it to them as a
value add to their portfolio hey we come
in and we'll we'll we'll create content
we'll create videos we'll you know do
thumbnails we'll do titles like all the
stuff that we talked about on this pod
but it's going to cost and your customer
isn't the founder it's it's the people
who raed fun 100% 100% also every VC you
talk to wants to be famous every single
one of they all get Envy on this [ __ ]
like this is something we learned at
Rupa I was just I killed me I thought it
was so funny like we grew their
Instagram from like zero to like 50,000
followers in like I think it was like
sixish months and all I was doing was
like we were basically repurposing
quotes from the podcast into like those
like quote tweets right that were like
stylized in a brand format and we were
just running Instagram only ads with
like follow this account for more

[47:01]
like follow this account for more
content like this to like all of
Instagram basically but the the account
just grew you know exponentially because
it was interesting like the like it's
Health it's interesting Health stuff and
what that turned into is like VCS were
then reaching out to the founder Tara
and they were like yo how are you doing
this what is going on and because
they're all trying to accomplish this as
well so I mean you could probably go
sell this to them too where it's like yo
well like it's like you know L
interviews that make cool viral moments
happen and like there's like a story arc
that happens in it because I think
that's a lot of what people don't know
how to do is like how do I make this
compelling story that is actually going
to get reach on the platform right
that's this whole other component of it
so yeah I mean 100% I think there
there's a whole business in there just
like making these people famous and
selling it Downstream to them through
you know whoever just wrote a check into
them I actually think the better idea is
your idea like selling
selling to them and because they they

[48:01]
selling to them and because they they
could easily write that off as an
expense because it's it's deal flow
right they're in the business of getting
the best possible deals and they need
attention and audience to to do that
that's why th% people forget but in Tech
in Tech Twitter in the beginning the
people who had the most amount of
followers weren't the entrepreneurs it
was the
VCS totally like the Fred Wilson's and
you know all those guys use it as magnet
content yep yes exactly and use it as
magnet content to get inbound of the
best Founders in the world right so if
you do long form content for them and
you basically create this you know basic
you're making a fishnet to get the best
people like the ideas that they're
trying to convey out globally I mean
then they create inbound you know the
inbound volume and to your point like
you probably the price you could charge
a Founder you can probably charge 4X
that to a VC if you actually can like
ship on it and prove that you do this
which is crazy to even think about but I
think they're thinking about this like I

[49:00]
think they're thinking about this like I
mean every I feel like in the last six
months I've seen every you know TI VC
firms spin out some type of podcast and
like all of them are getting like 30
views on YouTube right now you came in
you're like yo I'm gonna like help you
do this and I think you actually how
you're doing it right now Greg is really
interesting where you you mix in the
long form uh like YouTube like or sorry
um like almost podcast content with like
the shorter form like 10-minute like
it's like a V you know a classic YouTube
video so that classic YouTube video is
getting the growth to happen and it's
kind of like a top of funnel entry into
the channel which creates like a you
know that initial initial touch point
and then as they get further down the
funnel and start to binge then they get
into the long form content which creates
this long-term deeper relationship which
makes them more buyer ready for the
product right and so I think that that
model just take that same idea and then
apply it like you know to the VC again
another company that is probably easily
a 10 million year dollar company if you
can figure out how to execute on it I

[50:01]
can figure out how to execute on it I
love it all right man what else you got
for us or I think we're at idea number I
mean I'm not even going to count those
bonus ideas but I think we're at idea
number seven right yeah I think we're at
seven this one would be quick it's kind
of it's more of a tool than anything but
it's software so um canva doesn't have
good video captions right now where it's
like you basically imagine I upload a
video into it and I just like want it to
caption just like all you know whatever
doe premere or any of these other tools
um if you built an app and there's some
apps in this space but again they're not
super good but I think there's an
opportunity to go and build this um and
it's like based off a search volume that
I'm seeing people are definitely
searching for it canva is like one of
the biggest tools it's one of the
fastest growing video editors it's
insane when you look at it it's actually
nuts and all the all this is is you
would basically like they put a video
imagine you put a video into it there's
like an app section that's in the bottom
left hand corner they click it it's like
caption this video
it transcribes it just use like a large
whisper model and then that gets added

[51:01]
whisper model and then that gets added
and you have like a you know you
basically can tap into the font Styles
that's already built into canva and then
add some different variations with like
karaoke Etc but I think I think this is
like a you know a cool 20K a month type
company that's using the distribution if
not bigger that's using the distribution
of canva um I know I have friends that
have done this for like plugins for
Adobe Premiere and uh like all of these
other kind of like larger tools that
more traditional uh uh like video
editing softwares um but why is like V
beating canva right now it's because it
has stuff like this like go and just
really you could probably just go build
what V has had like V has built and if
you clone that into canva and then just
like offer that as like a suite like you
would basically I mean there's probably
an acquisition strategy there as well
because it's like okay okay canva
doesn't have to go build this they just
basically just acquire it and you know
they roll it out to their whole their
whole group but anyway yeah just I I
something we I stumbled upon and um
through swell like just people were you

[52:01]
through swell like just people were you
know talking about it and I was like oh
this is like a very interesting small
little tool thing that is probably a
great little company that could be run
yeah so I was thinking the same thing
you get to 20K a month and then what you
do is then you you T you take like 20K
of your profit and you spend it on PR
and you and you just get into like Tech
Crunch and and all these places and
that's when you reach out to canva and
you're and you're like tuck tuck tuck
here's all these articles about us we're
doing 20K a month you know we love what
you're doing we want to be a part of the
mission you know is there an opportunity
to talk about m&a and then you sell it
to them you know at some totally you
know and that's what you do you and and
and that's that's the playbook for that
one so I like that
idea uh it's one of those sneaky small
ones that could be big totally yeah and
the next one another sneaky small one um
yeah so do you remember Scott cheap
flights I remember when it first came
out I was like you know and I was I was

[53:00]
out I was like you know and I was I was
turning credit cards for points I you
know I still do it to this day just
because it's fun it's like more like a
hobby type thing but I remember when it
came out I was like this is so legit
it's sick it's now going or something
stupid and it's just evolved into this
like just bohemuth that you know it's
just it's lost all all flavor right um
so I think that there's this opportunity
to resurrect that business idea and I
think there's a really low code version
of this that you can do so Google
flights you can now go select a city as
like your home City and you can turn on
alerts on Google flights to like every
city in the world and what then happens
is at any time in the future that a
price between those cities that you've
set up drops like dramatically you get
an email from Google automatically it's
like hey like you're trying to fly to
Dublin like the price is 350 right now
and like that's you just get like I you
know I've done this where imagine like
you get 10 different emails a day of
like any place that you're trying to go
to right so what I imagine this as a

[54:02]
to right so what I imagine this as a
business could be is like you say okay
cool I go on Facebook I Target people
that have like a um frequent traveler
interest on Facebook this is a category
and interest group that you can Target
you then run ads to those people that's
like fine cheap flights from Denver to
anywhere and you send them to a
newsletter and then that newsletter is
all it's doing is it's aggravating the
Google flights that are coming in and
it's just put putting those into uh uh
like this larger newsletter and then you
like monetization is charge of
subscription you can probably get a
kickback on those uh as well like I know
kiwi has an affiliate program that you
can do but then you know don't just do
that for one city do that for like all
the major metros in the US and this is
this like super low code thing that you
could do with probably just like a
zapier setup that could honestly in my
opinion like that again another easy
like 20K a month company that you could
build and at all those people that you
get onto the email they'll they'll

[55:00]
get onto the email they'll they'll
forward that email with all of the
flights to their friends and that's how
that list grows like organically as time
goes on so get another just like small
random one that if I was like 20 this is
this is what I would go do because I
think it would be fun I honestly
wouldn't build this because I just think
it would be super fun but here's what I
would do in in in in this space because
I think you're on to something you're
right
that uh Scotch cheap flights has no soul
anymore in fact it was rebranded to
going.com
which come on that's like there's no
soul to that name versus Scott she
flights like I connect with that so I I
was doing some a little bit of research
and I found out that
there's a Canadian version of Scott
cheap flights what's called sh my screen
real it's called so the the holding
company
is called I think why deals and so what

[56:01]
is called I think why deals and so what
they do which is really smart is they
own for all the different Canadian
cities they have so the the uh airport
in Montreal is Yul so they own yld
deals.com and Toronto is YYZ so they own
YYZ deals.com
super smart but if you look at the
website like 1998
Vibes and the guy claims that there's
millions of Canadians that are
subscribed
so this there's an opportunity to you
know reach out to someone like this and
be like how much cuz doesn't feel like
he's I mean literally like there's
images of like travel 2000 and just
Toronto to Iceland like it it looks like
a oh my god dude this amazing look has
it totally has Craigslist Vibes it's
Craigslist Vibes and whenever you see
Craigslist Vibes you know they're
printing money no you know it you know
it they don't need to change anything
they've got something that's working
working and uh there's probably an
opportunity there and if there isn't an

[57:00]
opportunity there and if there isn't an
opportunity to buy it I think you can
just clone a similar version and just
bring it into 2024 what's insane is
they're not even ranking for like a ton
of keywords so it must just be like they
literally have a massive list that
they're just every deal goes out through
that people don't realize too like you
get crazy kick kickbacks from these
airline companies if you sell to them as
well like why did Google spin up Google
flights like that is the reason they're
yeah basically an affiliate is what it's
turned into right which is a huge item
line if you actually look at their pnl
it's super interesting but I again I
think that it there's I love I love
ideas where it's like it happened before
and it's like now eroded to now where
like its current version is just
terrible and how do you just like do
that same idea over and over again like
and that's really what the internet
feels like anymore it's like if you go
through enough Cycles you just see the
same [ __ ] happening like I'm dying right
now watching this younger generation
like go through the whole pickup artist
and like how do I make money on the
internet through an agency like how to

[58:01]
internet through an agency like how to
build it you know they in these Discord
channels like here's how to build a
Twitter DM agency and make you know tens
of thousands put a rly on your wrist
from your parents basement like that
type of thing and it's like man this
just literally feels like what Tim
Harris was Hawking like earlier on when
we were all you know in that that
beginning stage so anyway yeah like the
the great thing about this too is it's
already validated you know these you
know that people want this and this can
exist it's now just okay what's the
execution piece but I think just like a
simple newsletter like you just build
this on top of beehive right yeah and
all this turns into is like each
location has a newsletter I mean the
other side of it too is you probably I
mean you could probably go sell the like
that whole like if you had you know 50
of the top cities in the US and they all
have a list and each list has 20,000
people on it like that is not a small
number right and you could probably go
and just flip that to like a larger
media org um so I don't know just
another another random thing espec on
the tourism side which is like a huge
play like everybody is you know anything
travel related is typically a really

[59:01]
travel related is typically a really
high uh CPM that you can you can you can
sell to that so absolutely and then you
can you can you know if you have these
lists 20,000 50,000
75,000 you can also do like okay now
we're going to do a weekly here's what's
happening in my city newsletter th you
can create different newsletters off
that foundational newsletter so it's
like come come for the deals and stay
for like local news
so I think there's there's a lot of
opportunity here I think it's it's a
sneaky big idea too um and then yeah you
you it's about getting the right domains
like I don't know LGA LaGuardia you know
LaGuardia deals.com or something like
that um and also it even if those are
taken in the US and Canada there's also
other countries you know think think
more globally and so there's a lot of
opportunity in this one I like it a lot
all right we promised people nine
official ideas but you actually had
eight on your list I'm going to give not

[1:00:00]
eight on your list I'm going to give not
that I feel bad by the way because we
gave like a bonus like three or four but
I'm gonna give one more uh I have a I
have a notes file with all my ideas and
I add I don't know two or three ideas
per week that just come to me and I just
I just pulled it up and I'm gonna I'm
gonna bring up the latest idea and I'm
curious you're your I'll just give it
away screw it so did you see this Finn
final Loop no what is it so finalo just
raised $35 million in series a funding
which I didn't even know like series a
funding 35 million no that's like yeah
you know a typical series a is like 5 to
10 million so it's it's a massive
something is working um and basically
what it is is
uh e-commerce accounting software and
service that never slows you down so
it's realtime bookkeeping for D Toc
multi Channel on wholesale so they've
they've taken something which is

[1:01:00]
they've taken something which is
basically QuickBooks which we've talked
about in the past oh God and they've
niched it down
to uh DC and Ecom I love it and I think
the old so we use a uh lay checkout uses
a service called bench okay
bench.co um this is the old way
of of creating a startup it's kind of
like we're you know Cloud bookkeeping
and it's going to be like 300 bucks a
month and we're gonna it's going to be
great but it doesn't speak to anyone
right it doesn't speak to SAS it doesn't
speak to crypto startups it doesn't
speak to too broad it's too broad so
here's my idea my idea
is what what could what what okay the
idea is QuickBooks for X yeah now what
are those different categories I don't
know um they're probably something like
QuickBooks for SAS QuickBooks for
agencies real estate real estate you
know what you could do is you could go

[1:02:00]
know what you could do is you could go
to the QuickBooks extensions and just
look what everybody's trying to
intergrate with them and that will give
you all the industries that are related
to it and then just look at the biggest
categories and from there you could
assess okay cool this is going to be you
know there's a huge category that people
are trying to connect their Quickbooks
data into I'm just thinking about the
real estate one because like I know
there's a platform that's like which is
hilarious it's like a platform that's
built for tax and account for Real
Estate that people are trying to get
into
QuickBooks for their
accountant um but I mean that that's
probably how I'd go about this of
assessing like which one of them is the
biggest Market opportunity and then you
just go and build build that out but
would you focus only on internet
businesses or would you try to go for
like more
traditional my my hunch is that for for
internet businesses there's probably a
lot of competition so I would probably
go
towards like non
you know like I wouldn't go to I I
wouldn't start with SAS I bet you

[1:03:00]
wouldn't start with SAS I bet you
there's something maybe a little bit
similar nonprofits this is what you do
4,400 searches a month how I'd start
this is i' would list out like I think
your QuickBooks idea is really smart
just like look at the extensions I think
i' I would write in a list what what are
all the different categories based on
that and based and by prompting chat
gbt and then I would say and then I
would go look for competition I would
say like what what is the competition
I'd put that in my Google sheet and i'
and then I'd say I I'm not going after
something with a lot of competition I'm
just not interested at this stage of my
life I'm just not interested in going
after you know companies that have
raised hundreds or if not billions of
dollars so totally and then I'd pick I'd
pick one based on you know is it a
growing trend is it you know does it
have low
competition well like I think an to give
a concrete examp example of this it
would be like QuickBooks for like Airbnb
entrepreneurs or whatever like something

[1:04:00]
entrepreneurs or whatever like something
like that where it's like you know it's
a larger wave that's happening and
there's businesses that are being built
on top of it I would just look at these
platforms because like really D Toc is
kind of that right like they're all kind
of built on top of Shopify so it's like
find that version of that in these other
spaces like what's a bigger thing that's
happening and then just like build a
custom that's super interesting um this
is happening in the EHR space like in
the health world where it's like you
used to have like this Mass massive you
know single EHR that everybody would use
you know I think one of them is epic.com
I think is the name of it or epic is the
biggest one they Lobby so much it's
insane do not build an EHR just full
stop do not build this like if you're
listening right now never even think
about this idea never approach it
there's no way you can win you're
fighting the government um so the I
think the bigger thing here though is
that people basically spun out like ehrs
that were specific for all of these
different practitioner types and you
could basically it's that same idea of
like okay how do I take this like larger
thing and then just the Craigslist

[1:05:01]
thing and then just the Craigslist
untangling in a different space right
but do it for accounting it's all the
same ideas just remixed in different
places so but yeah man I I think that's
super interesting of just like you know
even the nonprofits thing all all those
people are super easy to contact as well
like like final loop as an example like
what they're probably doing for growth
is they're just cold emailing every
Shopify owner and being like yo we we
built a custom you know uh taxes
integration for for it just plugs into
your Shopify and it runs on the back end
or whatever your your you know the
system is that they're using for uh
there's like skew management and all
that P all that but I don't know I think
uh I think the bit the the play here is
always just like going back to like
where what is a bigger platform that
people are doing or like using or a B
some type of business category that you
can then go and build that custom
solution for so that's it man that's it
that's plus a bunch of bonus ideas Cody
Schneider how you feeling about this
episode dude I feel good I think the

[1:06:02]
episode dude I feel good I think the
first one had the energy you know like
people are going to get tired of me real
quick and so that is uh we're trying to
bring trying to bring the sauce every
time I think the the bigger thing here
that I'm like always I I want to talk
more the next time we do this on like
what like here's the actual tactical
components of this of how to go mark
because I can say like go email every
Shopify person but like what I'm really
saying is like go to Apollo and you
scrape every person that's using Shopify
out of Apollo and you go and you
validate those emails with zero bounce
and then you set up a smart lead
campaign and you basically are cold
emailing every one of them that like yo
we do this this this type of service
this software right so like the actual
tactical components of that I think that
that's like a piece of this as well
because like the idea is fine but unless
you got the distribution part of it and
I think that's why the Cricut one was
such a bit like a banger thing so
anyways I'm going to hold myself to that
on the next one is like with everything
we talk about it's like what's the
what's the TA itical distribution that
we're going on and go really deep and
heavy on those pieces but yeah cool so

[1:07:02]
heavy on those pieces but yeah cool so
on YouTube comment if if you want to see
that from Cody I know you want to see it
and uh don't forget to
subscribe on YouTube and also to follow
what if you're listening on Spotify or
you're listening on Apple podcast don't
forget to follow because then then
you'll know when Cody comes back on so
appreciate it Cody thank you so much uh
people can find you on Twitter yeah
Twitter and Linkedin are my most active
and then the company I'm building right
now is swell AI we're doing basically
content repurposing powered by ai go
take a look and be stoked to have you so
thanks again J always so fun man I live
for these things they're awesome yeah I
love when you get just so excited about
an idea like halfway through and I just
see your brain just like it's like
you're a kid getting really exciting
totally you love it I love it I love it
it's a compulsion like it's 100% like
can't not think it's just for some
reason it's like the puzzle piece I just
get the dopamine hit right when it's

[1:08:01]
get the dopamine hit right when it's
like yo we like here's this thing and
like here's you know these people that
want that thing like what's the bridge
that we can build to do that like I that
that is the thing I live for is like
that whole that bridge building piece
right um it's funny like because I'm not
a long term I don't I I don't want to do
ops right like I want to figure out the
puzzles and hand them off to people that
are you know can ship on them and just
do that over and over again run that
process I love building the process and
that whole piece you know it's kind of
that Orchestra conversation that we were
talking about but uh when we do this
it's just like you know it's junk food
for me right because it's it's like
here's this idea how would you how would
you actually grow it and then it's like
boom here's all these tools in the tool
belt that we can tactically you know go
to deploy and it's the same playbooks
over and over again I think that's the
thing that like a lot of people don't
realize with this stuff is like
everything is exactly the same from a
growth standpoint it's just different
tweaks that are happening and you know
it's only 10% that we're changing to the
core you know distribution idea so
totally yeah I think you know it's it's

[1:09:00]
totally yeah I think you know it's it's
like a few Frameworks it's like okay
this idea Works how do we bring it to
another G Geography okay this is a trend
here that's underserved it's just and
that's that's why I love going through a
bunch of ideas is because you're hearing
okay you're you're you're starting it's
starting to get into you okay this is
how I would approach the problem it's
not this specific idea that I want to
take it's just in general this is how I
could if I come up with an idea this is
how and Cody would come you know would
actually create create something like
this 100% 100% it also is again like
this at bats thing like it gets me more
at bats like when I can hear from your
perspective of how you would approach
like okay how do I grow this company and
that just creates this like I don't know
you connect all these thoughts and ideas
together right that you otherwise like
that synthesis happens when you think
through these from like other people's
perspectives and then you can go and
like apply that to the you know whatever
it is that you're building currently so
that's this whole other mechanism I mean
it's what's is like I know you and I
probably have I don't know 10 of these
conversations a week or five of these

[1:10:01]
conversations a week or five of these
conversations a week only one of them is
recorded right like this episode but
like I I have founder friends that I
talk to like on a weekly basis where
it's like yo I'm seeing this what are
you seeing this is working this isn't
that type of thing right and all I'm
trying to do is just more at bats more
looks at pitches so that when I come up
to the plate it's like I have you know
more knowledge of what how the pitcher's
throwing Etc right or whatever and you
know to that that is really the the
value of this all we're doing is just
taking those conversations and putting
them in public and that that same idea
can be applied in any industry this is
what kills me right it's like this is
every industry that you're trying to
like build a company in you can just
literally just have these conversations
that you're already having put them out
in public and you will get followership
through that and build reputation and
build knowledge and like also just build
leverage through that that piece of
media that you build and it could be
super small like something that's like
super Niche like I have a friend that
all he talks about is like digital out
of home advertising right but has like

[1:11:00]
of home advertising right but has like
one of the biggest podcasts in this
space and like he gets invited to these
like events like with media buyers and
he just talks about the trends he's
seeing based off the conversations that
he's having and like again that looks
like nothing from the outside but he
makes a great living doing that right so
anyway just another another way to think
about it totally and you don't need that
many followers for it to be super
impactful like I know guys girls
whatever who have five 10,000 followers
are making millions of dollars a year
from that uh from that group it's just
the right amount of followers with it's
it's not the right amount of followers
it's it's the right followers it's about
attracting the right people and it opens
doors um you know the way we met is kind
of funny which is you probably had like
five or 10 thousand followers on Twitter
and I was following you because you were
you were a real one you were actually
putting out this is how I'd grow this
thing and I was like oh man in a world
where where where Twitter is just like
so sterile and manufactured it felt so

[1:12:00]
so sterile and manufactured it felt so
amazing to see what you were putting out
there and I would basically feature you
in my newsletter with like has you know
75,000 Subs every single
week so funny right and I think the
first thing I said to you is like my
grandma put me back in the whe because
you put me in your newsletter or
something like that that was the cold
open yeah it was and I was like I like
this guy
I like this guy but that is the bigger
Trend right like an easy way for people
to think about this is like look at a
physician or a doctor like traditionally
all of that knowledge used to be trapped
behind them then the internet came and
like now it's all in public and so the
authority that they had The Gatekeepers
ship that they had was eliminated
through that process with that said
though then these people saw this and
they're like actually all this knowledge
is pretty terrible and that's why you
see like the huberman and you know the
Peter Tia and all all these people in
the health categories come out and own
these categories that are talking about
these things that aren't in kind of the
general knowledge that exists online

[1:13:01]
general knowledge that exists online
right it it's that same concept here
like if you just like UNG gatekeep what
used to be
gatekeep like you will get people that
are interested in that same thing to
just start reaching out to you and
that's just the natural effect that
happens when you do that and it's it's
it's not complicated it's just like but
a lot of the times like again I'm anti-c
course because I I just won't do it like
I think that teaching is like a public
service right like I'm on here because
this is St you know State mandated by my
parole officer like I have to be talking
to you right now because they require me
to share this information no but in all
reality like this is just a way to talk
about this stuff in a public setting
that I had mentorship that you know
there's no way I I shouldn't be where
I'm at unless I had you know I wouldn't
be where I'm at unless I had that I was
I worked for this dude that just
basically taught me like how to do all
this stuff right and and you feel this
almost as obligation to but what happens
the knock on effect is when you put all
this out there in public then suddenly

[1:14:01]
this out there in public then suddenly
you just start to get inbounded like you
reaching out to me or you know stuff
like that where it's like it wouldn't it
otherwise wouldn't happen right and and
that bigger media play is that game here
that's the whole the whole strategy
behind this and like really that's just
another business like pick pick a
category you're in like I was just talk
another friend that's in the Supply
Chain management uh space she SP up a
podcast like now one of the leading
voices in it this was like two years ago
she did this
and dude she's making a great living and
again like all she's doing is it's super
niched down there's maybe 10,000 people
that listen to it that's the whole
audience but they have so much buying
power and it's so under service like
we're talking about this LinkedIn thing
with like you know there's like video
content there's a it's blue ocean there
well look for all these spaces that are
like unsexy and where blue ocean exists
and if you just build media there you
can build companies on top of that and
like whatever that is whether it's
consulting or service businesses Etc and
honestly that's all these podcasts are
turning into more and more is like it's
just a sales tool it's just sales and
disguise right like Greg and I have a

[1:15:01]
disguise right like Greg and I have a
trench code on like he's sitting on my
shoulders and we're just like using this
platform to basically talk about this
stuff that like we know is junk food
that we know majority of people won't go
and actually do but in reality like
what's going to happen from this is like
it's going to create all this inbound
you know volume that will go down into
the things and the companies that we're
building and that's what you know the
the byproduct of doing this in a public
setting does I mean also you know I
think a bunch of people listen to this
podcast and just it's entertainment for
them it's like watching Shark Tank so
totally I think there's that but I also
think that there's a sub there is a
group of people who listen to this
podcast like the SVG Collective guy or
collections guy who are like wow I never
thought of that I'm gonna go and do this
thing and it's going to be a success and
when it's a success he's going to reach
I mean he reached out to us already but
he's going to reach out to us and
he's going to be like thank you Cody
like you changed my life and and I won't

[1:16:00]
like you changed my life and and I won't
forget that and then he's going to start
his own podcast and he's going to you
know pay it back and so it does you know
that's that's also just a cool part
about doing this totally 100% And it's
like I think that thing way I think
about it more and more is like I'm just
trying to create as much surface area as
possible to create like greater
Serendipity it's like one of the best
quotes and like the easiest way to do
that is build media and just be
everywhere and it just from that you
just create yeah I talk about this all
the time but it's like I'm trying to
create digital gravity right like for
Brands and for self and for all of this
it's just as much digital Mass on the
internet as possible to create as much D
digital gravity as you can as possible
and this is another vehicle for that so
and and one one thing that I've learned
is be yourself you know when I when I
first started podcasting I wasn't myself
really and it was only recently where I
was like you know I'm just going to how
has that changed just I'll give you an
example people you know people say that

[1:17:01]
example people you know people say that
uh I talk slowly or I have a calm voice
so what I would do is I'd counteract
that and I would be like I try to put my
Gary V hat on you know and try to get
super and it's just it's not me they're
like oh [ __ ] this guy have you seen that
Meme and it's like Gary ve showing up to
your yard
sale it's like they're like oh [ __ ] not
him again and he's just like bartering
with them on like [ __ ] Hot Wheels and
they're like God damn it just get out of
here like I love that so
much so good yeah I was someone who you
know I really wasn't and the reason I
did that is because I was like oh these
are best practices therefore I need to
do it as soon as I started being myself
and also another part of that is talking
about what I want to talk about which is
startup ideas even though the best
people in the world told me that's too
Niche the best podcasters when I when I

[1:18:01]
Niche the best podcasters when I when I
pitch this idea originally they they're
like to Niche and as soon as they said
that I was like I'm on I I'm G to be on
to something and and you know what there
there's people who are listening to this
who are going to be like I wish you
would talk faster I wish you did have
more energy I wish you did these and
it's like okay well you're you know
you're listening to me you're listening
to Cody cuz you like us
presumably and you find you're that
person hate listening this deep into
this I'm so proud of you I want that
energy yeah it's like what are you doing
it's an hour plus deep and it's like why
are you listening to us th% you don't
like us that's when you know you
actually made it though I love this
quote it was from this uh this Runner I
can't remember her name but she's like
she's like if somebody doesn't hate you
like you aren't even in the
game it's like I think that that's so
true like if you don't like if you're
not even playing you're not at the at
the highest level unless there's like a
subset of people that just despise Your
Existence so um and you know what's

[1:19:01]
Existence so um and you know what's
exhausting being someone who you're not
is exhausting th% man it's just a
character at that point like you know
being Tucker Carlson you have to play
that dude I don't think he believes any
of that [ __ ] the zins piece that's he's
for sure he's on I I think he's aligned
on the zins but everything else it's
like you know this is this character
you're playing but man I think it's
interesting though like you also have to
think about about it like you want to
bring these differing uh like it's like
different tempos like that's actually
what good writing is is it's like the
you know it's it's that uh I think they
call it perplexity and burstiness and
it's like you're like short sentence
long one you know short short long one
it's like creating this kind of like
variety and that's like one language
like oration when you look at it like
that's the how it's like the composition
of it and why it sounds good and it
moves us Etc it's like music right it's
like it actually is music and I think
when you have this variety of people on
you create like it's like different you
know almost rhythms that are happening
and different pacing you're the Baseline

[1:20:00]
and different pacing you're the Baseline
that's just constantly going and like
for you I feel like from the you know
outside looking in it's like okay how do
I bring these like ridiculous almost
like again manic like people onto the
show that are like they're going to play
the solos or whatever on this top level
and then I just get the Baseline this
whole time which is like it creates this
really interesting composition right so
anyway yeah I just I makes sense also
the the kills me that people told you
that and I probably know who these
people are that said that this was a bad
idea but I'm over here and I'm like this
is the best business move that's
happened in 2023 2024 thousand like zero
doubt like people live for this this
there's a vacuum in this space right now
all the people that were in this space
have leveled up and they're now like we
want to talk to billionaires and that
[ __ ] and that's like this not accessible
right it's like Kanye talking about like
you know private jets after he does uh
like 808 and heartre or heart or
heartbreaks right he it'ss like oh like
you're talking about like just getting a
whip so that women's like you and then
now you're talking about Jets like I

[1:21:00]
now you're talking about Jets like I
that that leap I can't even make I can't
even like fathom or think and I think
that this thing that you're doing it's
like you're you're riding that common de
nominator of like you know the 200
million people that want to start a
company but there's only whatever it is
it's like 10 million that actually have
right like you get to service that whole
group of people so again I me we could
talk about this all day from a strategy
and a standpoint but I just think it's
just like a no-brainer from the outside
looking in it looks ridiculous
so um all right we got to run we got to
run this has been great Cody thanks
