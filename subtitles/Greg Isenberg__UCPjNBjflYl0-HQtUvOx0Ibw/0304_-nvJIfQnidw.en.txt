What if you can validate a startup idea
without actually building it? So this
episode I chatted with Justin Mayers who
built a hund00 million plus business
called Kettle and Fire and he walks us
through how he comes up with the idea,
how he figures out value props, how he
uses Google Trends, how he spent $50 on
Google Bing ads to actually validate
demands. He walks through the entire
story and at the end we use chat GBT to
redesign
uh what Kettle and Fire could be, how he
would build Kettle and Fire differently
in 2025 with all the tools available.
This is a really interesting episode
around frameworks for coming up with
ideas and validating the ideas because
there's a million startup ideas you
could be building, but you want to work
on the right one. Enjoy the episode.

Okay, Justin, by the end of this
podcast, what are people going to get
out of this episode? By the end of the
episode, people will understand the day
one steps, really the day zero steps
that I took to start Kettle and Fire,
which is now a 9 figureure annual
business. All right, let let's jump in.
Cool. So I I wrote a blog post on this
that I I I think is worth going through.
But basically in 2014, I was sitting in
my job. I was at Rackspace. Uh and
basically I was like trying to think
about I wanted to start my own company.
What do I do? Uh I'd heard a lot about
bone broth from friends at CrossFit and
been reading about benefits of bone
broth for skin, gut, joint health. This
was at a time when basically no one was
talking about bone broth and you
couldn't find any online. And so what I
did is I thought a couple things like
this is a product that I know I want.
And what I didn't know was just how many

[02:01]
And what I didn't know was just how many
people are there out there in the world
that actually want this product and are
there enough of them or will they spend
enough on the product that I can start a
meaningful business? These were
basically like the two main questions
that that I wanted to answer. And so I
thought about, okay, question one, how
do I figure out like how many people
actually want this product? Um, is this
okay, by the way? Like me just kind of
running into this. This is awesome.
Okay, great. Um, cool. So, I had I had
to figure out how many people want this
product. I looked at places where
basically pale people in the paleo
community, which I was one, uh, people
in the CrossFit community, like where
are these people hanging out? Uh, I
looked at Mark's Daily Apple, Paleo
Hacks, Reddit, and just kind of saw how
much traffic is there, how engaged are
these threads, you know, on Reddit and
the like that are talking about bone
broth for skin health, gut health, joint
health, all these things. And when I saw
that these people were like super super
engaged. They were talking about
recipes, how do you source bones, how
long do you cook it, all these things,
you're like, okay, there is a small but

[03:03]
you're like, okay, there is a small but
like certainly like fanatic and like
interested in this in this product group
of people. And then at at at the like
very micro in these tight-knit
communities that I wanted to target. And
then I looked at the macro level and I
was like, okay, how are how is bone
broth trending from a Google trend
standpoint? And you could see it was
starting to take off. More and more
people were talking about bone broth. Uh
and so between those two things, um you
know, I figured out that like there are
at least enough people, several thousand
people that are interested in bone broth
and looking for this product. At the
time I was 24 years old. I was not
looking to start a nine figure business,
which it is today. I was literally
looking at like, can my brother and I
start a business that pays us each 10
grand a month? And you know, if we could
get to a $200,000 a year business,
probably we could get around 10 grand a
month in in profit from that. You only
need a couple thousand customers to do
that, spending, you know, a couple
hundred a year each. So, question one

[04:00]
hundred a year each. So, question one
figured was answered. Um, any questions
on that so far? What do you say to
people who say the best businesses
aren't started by looking at something
like Google Trends? You have to go out
there in the world and just fix your own
problem. What do you What do you say to
those people? I I I think that's I think
that's totally true. And to be clear,
like I was fixing my own problem. I
wanted bone broth. This was like I was
talking to people in my CrossFit
community. I was looking to start a
business and it was a product that I
wanted to help with my own gut, skin,
and joint health. This was not like a
random thing. I'm looking for any, you
know, any sign of life on Google Trends.
This was like literally a product I
wanted that people that I respected in a
space that I cared about and was
passionate about were talking about.
Then I just use Google Trends to
validate that this would be a decent
business as opposed to just like
Justin's side project or something like
this that doesn't actually go anywhere.
If if you went to Google Trends and
there was, you know, no sign of life, do
you think you would have ended up

[05:00]
you think you would have ended up
starting the business? Uh if if I had
gone to Google Trends and there was no
sign of life and I had done this next
step which I'll talk about and it didn't
work, I would not have started the
business. quick break in the pod to tell
you a little bit about Startup Empire.
So, Startup Empire is my private
membership where it's a bunch of people
like me, like you who want to build out
their startup ideas. Now, they're
looking for content to help accelerate
that. They're looking for potential
co-founders. They're looking for uh
tutorials from people like me to come in
and tell them, "How do you do email
marketing? How do you build an audience?
How do you go viral on Twitter? All
these different things. That's exactly
what Startup Empire is. And it's for
people who want to start a startup but
are looking for ideas or it's for people
who have a startup but just they're not
seeing the traction uh that they need.
So you can check out the link to
startupmpire.co in the description.

[06:01]
startupmpire.co in the description.
Cool. Let's talk about the next step.
Yeah. So the next step that I had was
like what I think is the biggest one is
will people pay enough to make this a
meaningful business. So, I bought the
cheapest domain name I could find that
had bone broth in the name. Bone broths,
you
know,.com. Um, and I had the genius idea
to name it Bone Broths Co., which is
like embarrassing in retrospect. Uh, you
know, so we still have that the name
still haunts me. I still have the bone
broths.com domain name. And what I did
from there, spent $9.99 on the domain. I
then went to Fiverr. Now, you could get
AI to do a way better logo than this,
but I went to Fiverr and had paid five
bucks for someone to develop this like
god-awful logo. Um, and and some
renders. And I basically put this all on
a landing page that looked like this. I
used Unbounce. Again, you could use AI
to build something way better than this.
This these were like the tools in 2015.
Um, and so I used AI to build this this

[07:01]
Um, and so I used AI to build this this
thing and I was like, okay, I looked at
Paleo forums. What are the things that
people care about? They were interested
in healing leaky gut. That was a big
thing in paleo at the time. They were
focused on convenience. Uh, you know,
you have to cook bone broth for 24 to 48
hours to get all the nutrient density
out of it. So, talked about that like
this is way more convenient than making
at home. And then we use only organic
ingredients and we talked about um, you
know, the health benefits, 100%
grass-fed, grass-fed grass-fed
grass-finish bones and the like. So,
this was the landing page. That was the
horrible, horrible thing. And so what
what I did is after I had that landing
page um is I set a price. I had no idea
how to make bone broth. I had no idea
how we would go about this, but I
figured that I could easily sell bone
broth at a profit if I charge $29.99 for
16 ounces. Um if you go to the grocery
store, broth and stock is selling for
like five d five bucks for like 16
ounces. And so I was like, great, if I
can charge six times more, I'm pretty

[08:00]
can charge six times more, I'm pretty
positive I can figure out how to make
the economics work. And it's a very very
good sign that if people are willing to
spend 30 bucks on a product they've
never heard, tasted, smelled, whatever
that doesn't exist on a landing page
that looks like it was a scam, that is
probably a pretty good sign that this is
a a thing that people really really
want. And so, uh, what I did is this
landing page, when you hit order bone
broth now, what that did is that took
you to my personal PayPal where you
would send me JW Bears a like $29.99
purchase on PayPal. And as soon as
people did that, uh, yeah, so this was
literally the flow for someone coming to
the website was someone would end up on
the site, hit order now, and then get
prompted to send money to my personal
email address. Uh, and so after I got,
you know, after spending about $100 um
on Bing ads because Bing was cheaper
than than Adwords, uh, we saw that
people are actually like paying me
money. Like you can see, you know, April
12th, someone paid, April 15th, someone

[09:01]
12th, someone paid, April 15th, someone
paid. April 20th, someone paid. April
21st someone paid. Like these are very,
very small um small dollar amounts, but
I had a tiny advertising budget because,
you know, I just that's that's what I
was doing. Um, and so even without a
product with a super sketchy checkout
flow, people were actually converting.
And so this after the entire test was
over, um, we had about a 30% conversion
rate where people ended up clicking the
order now button. And so over the course
of the two week test that I ran, uh, to
this janky checkout flow, to this bad
landing page, uh, made almost $500 in
revenue. And I figured that on that $500
in revenue, I think I was spending 250
or so in ad revenue in ads. And I based
on the conversion rate, uh, the
incredibly janky checkout flow, you
know, the ad costs, all this sort of
stuff, I backed into the idea that I was
fairly certain that if I made a product
that we would be able to sell um, you
know, something on the order of like a

[10:01]
know, something on the order of like a
$100,000 or so per year under this very
janky flow. Um, and so to me, question
two is answered. Like, people will
actually pay for this. The best part of
the story is you use Bing. Yeah. Like
how ghetto and sketchy Bing is. I was so
broke. It's perfect. Yeah. No, but I
think there's a lesson in there, right?
The lesson is, you know, you were just
trying to validate your thesis
ultimately, right? So, it didn't make a
difference if it was Google or Bing.
Exactly. Yeah. And so um I I can also
talk about the next steps here because I
think the next step is is important too
because at this point had validated the
macro there's enough search volume and
people and people care about this in
communities. I' val validated the like
the economic and the the micro piece
which is people actually click on the
order now button and PayPal me money.
And then what I wanted to see is like um
basically can we actually make the

[11:00]
basically can we actually make the
product? And so the first thing that I
did after validating those two things is
I sent this email to every single person
that had placed an order and basically
just said like hey I'm the founder of
Bone Brothco. I wanted to reach out and
say I'm very excited. We don't have the
product in stock because I'd never made
it and we had no product. Um, but I was
like, either I can refund you in full
today or I can give you a 50% discount
and we'll ship in a few weeks is what I
said. That was extraordinarily
optimistic. It ended up being like eight
months. Um, but we still had people that
that were on the list and they were
like, "Figure it out. I'm excited to try
the product whenever you do it." Um, and
so anytime a customer, everyone was
happy. I was very upfront with them.
Most of them decided to take the 50% off
deal. Um, you know, and the few
customers that didn't, I just refunded
them. And so through this entire
process, this is basically like how I
validated the idea for Kettle and Fire.
I made sure that this was this was an
idea that enough people cared about that
they would actually send me money that I
think we could build a good business um

[12:00]
think we could build a good business um
and do it in a way that, you know, we
had people that were uh that that
basically were paying us money for a
product that didn't exist. And then it
was just time, you know, it took me the
next eight months to figure out how to
actually make this and scale it and like
all these sorts of things that go into
business building. But I think that this
was this was really the start of our
experience uh you know building Kettle
and Fire. So Kettle and Fire was started
years ago and my question to you
is it's 2025 now a lot has
changed. What would you have done
differently
today? You mentioned AI.
Yeah. So I think today I probably would
I mean the land the the landing pages
the like all the stuff that I made would
be much better if I was doing it today.
Uh you know you saw the landing page I
used it was terrible. The I so I think
that there's an improvement there. I
think that there's also ways that you
can use AI and other tools to quickly

[13:01]
can use AI and other tools to quickly
scrape and get a sense of like sentiment
analysis across Reddit. Uh are people
talking about on forums? what are people
saying about it on Twitter? There's all
these really powerful tools that didn't
exist then. But I still do think
fundamentally that the um that the core
thing of like try and sell a product
even if it doesn't exist now and see if
people will give you money for it. Even
if it means like DMing people on
Twitter, emailing friends, texting
friends, like just try and get like 10
people to pay for the thing that you're
that you're trying to build and you will
have it. It will be massively validate
validating and you'll very quickly
understand is this a thing that people
care enough about or not. You you have a
history of building CPG project
products, you know, Kettle and Fire,
Shirley Wine. Now you're building more
of a marketplace software product. Do
you see like for the person listening
who's who's looking for startup ideas

[14:01]
who's who's looking for startup ideas
who wants to build a business who
believes in the framework that you have?
Um you know is there still opportunity
in CPG? Should people be focusing on
software? Uh I think that I think
honestly that's such a personal
question.
Like there's not really like the the
people that end up making the most money
are generally not ones that are like I
want to focus on software because I want
to like make the most money in the
world. Like I often think that I often
think that like I had really I it ended
up that I've had a bunch of good ideas
in CPG, but that's because I'm very very
interested in the health stuff. And so
like I have consistently been early on
bone broth, was early on the keto trend,
was early on the non-alcoholic stuff,
all because like I have this macro
passion and interest in in just like
improving human health and so and trying
to solve the chronic disease crisis
which I think is the biggest problem in
the country. Uh I think that generally
people should probably go to wherever
they are like on the frontier and they

[15:01]
they are like on the frontier and they
are among the most interested like
top.1% of people interested in a topic.
I think that that frontier for most
people is where you end up having a lot
of good ideas is one where you're just
like naturally spending a lot of time
and because you're spending a lot of
time your ideas are much more likely to
be new and interesting and and different
than if you were just like hey I'm going
to find a software company just to find
a software company you know I want to I
want to end this pod with two last
questions one is well the two questions
are what are the three
trends that you think there's
opportunity in. Um, and then what are
the three
tools that, you know, you mentioned
using all, you know, new types of tools
now easier than ever. What are three
tools that people could use today,
uh, that they might not be using? Yeah,
I think one of them is, uh, there's a

[16:00]
I think one of them is, uh, there's a
company called Bolt.new new that is like
a very interesting kind of tool that
that you can use. I I think that I think
if you're
not trying getting obsessed about like
how to use this newest wave of AI tools
and building a business like you're just
going to get left behind. These things
are so insanely powerful and it is going
to change how people build and scale
companies over the next one, two, five,
10 years. like I have zero doubt about
that and so I think that getting
familiar with these different tools like
uh bolt new is one rok is another one um
and just sort of and frankly playing
with just the frontier models claw gpt
gemini um you know it just makes a lot
of sense in my view and becoming a like
top 1% user there's probably few things
that you can do that will be as high
leverage as that uh from an opportunity
standpoint point. It's an interesting
question. I I I I think I think the

[17:02]
question. I I I I think I think the
things that I am interested in right now
is I like to think about like what are
the big problems in the world that have
relatively few people focused on them or
where there's more energy moving in that
direction.
I cared a while ago uh you know started
caring like 10 plus years ago about the
chronic disease crisis and all of this
like our food system being poison uh all
of this like health and wellness stuff
and more and more people are starting to
wake up and care about this and they're
starting to wake up and care about it
because it's a massive problem like the
average American is sick people are
getting sicker our kids have never been
sicker type two diabetes rates are going
crazy uh cardiovascular it's just
everything and so I I think that
generally so often I advise people to
find a problem that really lights them
up um or that they find interesting,
like more interesting than than the
opposite, and just kind of circle that
problem for a while until you find
interesting ideas that potentially solve
that problem. And if if there is a
problem that you're really interested

[18:00]
problem that you're really interested
in, then naturally, like if you can
figure out a way to address a top one of
the most important problems that people
have, and their health is certainly one,
you can build a business that that does
quite well doing that. Uh, and so I
often like that's kind of what I
recommend people. I love it, man. I love
it. Simple. It's like find something
that you care about
and basically your first product that
you're going to build might not be, you
know, hit escape velocity. But if you
keep kind of circling around it, I think
that eventually you'll hit something.
Yes. Exactly. But I think your point
around like you need to validate, you
need to validate the market. You need to
understand the pain points. Look at
Reddit, look at community sentiment. Um,
all the data is out there. It's just
about, you know, distilling it in a way.
I think what you did, I don't know if
you did it manually, you probably did,
but on your original Kettle and Fire
website, you had like the three uh

[19:02]
website, you had like the three uh
almost like problems that you're
solving. Yeah. And it was so clear. you
wrote it like, you know, you wrote it
like you talk, super super plain
English. Um, I think that, you know,
what you can do now with AI is you can
go and sort of distill that simply use
bolt.new to actually build the landing
page, launch it. Like we're talking
about a startup in like a day. Totally.
I mean, if if anything, I think that
someone that has a big or has like a
strong opinion on a product they want to
make or a direction the world is moving,
they are almost at an advantage with
these AI tools relative to like a small
or even medium-sized team. Because if
you are someone that like has a very
strong opinion of like what the world
should look like, you can use these
tools to build that product. Whereas a
team of three, team of five, team of 10
can do the same. But it requires
coordinating a vision across like all of
these different people. And so I I
basically think that the new types of

[20:00]
basically think that the new types of
there's a whole universe of products
that can now be built by like one guy in
a basement uh using these AI tools that
can be as good if not better than many
of the you know tools that have
previously taken like tons of people to
build.
Dude, have you been playing with uh the
chat GPT40 image?
Not yet. It just came out today, right?
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I'm getting a
bunch of texts about it, but I haven't
yet. So, let's just let's just do this
for fun. I I attached the Kettle and
Fire um
product. Let's redesign that product and
and using ChatgBT40 and see what
happens. Like let's see if Chat GBT
could redesign this in a in a beautiful
way. If you were talking to your like
chief design officer, what would you say
for fun? Like how how would you what
should I prompt it? I'd be interested
like if we wanted to make a functional
beverage or a drink like what would that

[21:01]
beverage or a drink like what would that
look like and how would we make it
accessible and look good?
If we wanted to make it make a
functional beverage, how would we design
it to make it
look fresh, cool, engaging?
Um, we being we're kettle on
fire and let's just see
if what
happens because in in your day in your
day in our day really we would have to
go to like Fiverr, right? And but like
if you can create something that's high
quality and it's just
by the way I think you do need to pay
$20 a month for this but it's literally
$20 a month. It's it's a you know you
could be testing dozens of startups a
month to find that right one for you.
Totally.

[22:04]
Okay. So, usually I've noticed it takes
about like 30 to 30 seconds to a minute
to generate these. And it's funny cuz
when I'm watching it, I'm always like,
why is it taking so long? But it's it's
like this is actual magic.
I know. It's It reminds me of the Louis
CK bit of like people complaining about
airplane Wi-Fi, you know? Right.
Exactly. We're h hurtling through the
sky at 30,000 miles an hour and you're
like complaining about or you know 600
miles hour whatever you're complaining
about like airplane Wi-Fi being slow.
Exactly. And by the way, we gave it like
basically no basically very
little constraints, right? Um if we were
working with
a a designer, I think we pro like a real
designer employee, we probably would be
I mean we would have a kickoff meeting.
we would have like a one pager, right?

[23:00]
we would have like a one pager, right?
Yep.
And I actually think that's best
practices for for a lot of that is, you
know, create like I I do find that a lot
of these AI models work better when you
do give it a bit more constraint. Mhm.
So, we're getting some it's it's
starting to load.
Um, and you can see that it took the
image and it's making it look like the
same, right? It doesn't look like in the
image I gave, it's a non- 3D image,
basically.
But what what do you think so
far? I mean, this is it's pretty wild. I
haven't played with this at all. This is
amazing, right? 10 grams of protein,
collagen. I don't know if that's
accurate.
Yep.
And it's like it's cool. It's definitely
cool. Yeah, totally. Man, this is so

[24:00]
cool. Yeah, totally. Man, this is so
So, how does how does this change how
how people build CPG products? I I think
that there's all of these barriers to
building CPG brands. It's basically
like, can you make the product? Can you
design it? Can you build a good brand?
Can you market it well? And I think that
the barriers are just more and more
coming down. Like this is great design.
You know, my day we paid an agency I
think 60 grand to come up with this vibe
and look and all these sorts of things.
Um maybe if that collapses to $200 a
month, you know what I mean? Like all of
a sudden it's it's a it's a different
kind of thing.
Totally. Look at that. The functional
beverage logo coming on right now. Yeah.
like pretty
fire. People in the comment section are
going to be are going to love it or hate
it, but yeah,
like this was one prompt. Like we one
prompted a whole new product line.

[25:01]
prompted a whole new product line.
Wow. It's crazy.
So, it's not fully loaded, but you get
the idea. Um Justin, thanks so much for
coming on the show. Uh, I'll include um
where people can find you in the show
notes if they want to follow you for
more. But is there anything else you
want to leave people with? No, I just
want to say thanks for having me on. I'm
super excited to chat about this and and
uh yeah, love it. All right, my man.
I'll see you around. All right. Thank
you.
