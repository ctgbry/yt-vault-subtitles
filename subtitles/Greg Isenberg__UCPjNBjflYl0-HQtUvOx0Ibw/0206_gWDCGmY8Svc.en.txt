[00:00]
what's up everyone good to have you back
today I really want to talk about
something that's been on my brain for a
long long time this idea of anti-trends
you know we talk a lot about Trends and
building startups for those Trends U but
I don't think enough is talked about
about
anti-trends and today I'm going to talk
about how you can come up with startup
ideas based on those anti-trends how to
identify anti trends some of the tools I
use and just kind of bring you in inside
my workflow because why
[Music]
not
so let's talk about why I care about
anti-trends in in the
beginning so in software in
startups it's a very competitive place
and everyone goes for those Trends and

[01:01]
and everyone goes for those Trends and
what I've noticed it's actually quite
easier to go to those anti-trends now
what am I talking about what is an
anti-trend if everyone is talking about
ai ai
free might be a great way to position
your startup there might be so much
demand for AI free that yes there's
billions of dollars going into building
startups for you know that are AI um and
you see like every agency website saying
Ai and every SAS website saying AI what
if you uh what if you didn't what if you
said AI free and these are the little
things when you identify an anti-trend
like that and you're
first um it's a really good Mo so you
know the question is like how do you
come up with anti-trends well number one
you go out there in the real world and
it comes to you you just see it um now

[02:00]
it comes to you you just see it um now
now in the example of the AI free thing
I actually saw I'm going to share my
screen so sorry folks who are Audio
Only I actually saw and I tweeted this I
saw that there was this study that said
AI is a turnoff for
consumers so a new study suggests
artificial intelligence and product
descriptions lowers purchase intent with
implications not only for Brands
integrating AI but of The Wider category
challenges of the technology faces it it
has become widespread point is if you
don't use AI on your website especially
in I think B
Toc I think good things might happen for
you so how do we identify let's talk
about some of the tools that I use uh
when I when I want to identify a trend
or an
anti-trend so uh and some of these by
the way are so underrated so listen or
watch to the end so you you understand
all of them one

[03:00]
all of them one
is uh Pinterest here I'm on Pinterest
this is actually Pinterest Canada one of
the things I definitely uh just because
I signed up when I was in Canada uh one
of the things that you see here is a
bunch of Trends so these are some Trends
in Canada fall outfits weekly change of
30% monthly change of 400% back to
school obviously dress to impress home
gardening color book Nails okay
interesting main character mode has a
10,000 plus monthly change Sun Soo
spaces 10,000 plus when you start seeing
these 10,000 plus like these are things
that are are getting real big so one way
to come up with ideas for anti-trends is
just to look at what is trending on
platforms like
Pinterest and do the opposite of it and
yeah I see that brat is is trending a
little bit here but even brat you they

[04:00]
little bit here but even brat you they
talk about brat summer and now it's
demure fall like that's the anti-trend
to brat right um there's always an
anti-trend so let's just say you know
I've been thinking about this trend
around slow living now what is slow
living slow living I just noticed that
there's a lot of talk around like hustle
culture working all the time deadlifting
cold plunge wake up at 5:00 in the
morning don't don't you know don't stop
work until 10 p.m. um that sort of thing
it's kind of the opposite of my My Vibe
actually so I think that slow living is
going to be a more more
important
Trend um so I'll use a tool like
Pinterest Trends to go and see like okay
where am I going is it going down is it
going up the one bad thing about
Pinterest Trends is that it does only go
to one year but what I like about it is
it tells me related Trends so minimalist

[05:01]
it tells me related Trends so minimalist
living rooms so now it gives me ideas
right so I I start with my anti-trend
and now it gives me ideas around what
are the products that I could actually
be building here so maybe there's an
opportunity to create like the slow
living interior design
agency um cozy and you see you know cozy
bedroom you see these are these are
terms that are coming up and then it
allows me to go check through popular
pins um so I can open up a p a pin here
that's popular um so let's just say this
one living slow learn to do nothing put
down your phone accept rest drink water
go on a walk social media cleanse learn
to say no smile be still connect with
your community you know all this stuff
and what allows me to do then is like
now I'm learning about what is
resonating with this audience I'm
learning about what are the philosophies
and principles of this particular uh
community and in this particular
anti-trend and it gives me ideas and

[06:02]
anti-trend and it gives me ideas and
then I just take out my notebook and I
start writing down what am I observing
you create a little page take out a pen
you take a little page and you say
observations and what am I observing
about this anti Trend I'm observing that
uh you know putting down your phone is
like a big part of it or resting is a
big part of it and then I ask myself
what are products and services that I
can go and create
so that I you know I can monetize and
you know build a community in that space
sh don't tell anyone but I've got 30
plus startup ideas that could make you
millions and I'm giving them away for
free these aren't just random guesses
they're validated Concepts from
entrepreneurs who built hundred million
plus businesses I've compiled them into
one simple

[07:00]
one simple
database compiled from hundreds of
conversations I've had on my podcast but
the main thing is most of these ideas
don't need a single investor some cost
nothing to start I'm pretty much handing
you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your
startup
shortcut just click below to get
access your next cash flowing business
is waiting for you so that's Pinterest
um there's also of course Google
Trends that you can use which is
similar so let's go put slow living and
you can see over the last five years
this is
worldwide it's progressively going up um
this is beautiful to see you know I look
at this and I'm like there is certainly
some opportunity to be building in this
space this is a trend I like to see it's
not like up into the it's not like crazy

[08:03]
not like up into the it's not like crazy
growth and I actually almost like that
better because uh to me this is a
sustainable uh sustainable growth then
you can see uh what people also search
which I find really interesting but I
always check the questions to me the
questions is is the most important uh
place to start what is slow living how
to practice slow living what is the art
of slow living this basically puts you
in the mind
of uh people in this
anti-trend so Google Trends you know
it's completely free to use I don't know
why more people don't use it I forgot to
I forgot to say so I actually added
this Chrome extension I have no
affiliation with them at all but it's
this Chrome extension called Glimpse
discover Trends before they're trending
and it just maps on it basically just
supercharges Google Trends so so it also

[09:00]
supercharges Google Trends so so it also
adds things like related Trends which is
super good to
know um so I can go and see all the
related Trends and Glimpse gives me that
I think it's free to use and uh you know
I haven't paid for it or anything like
that um and and that's really
really you know helpful obviously to to
know related Trends because then you go
back to your go back to your um your
notebook and you start writing what are
the related Trends and and why you start
asking yourself like why are these
related Trends why is um why do we think
food sustainability is in there
sustainable business Euphoria party like
what do these things mean and it puts
you down that rabbit hole the other
interesting thing about Glimpse Plus
Google Trends is it gives you you know
where are people uh like where the
where's the most activity on social is
it on Twitter is it on Instagram you can
see here it's a it's very much on in
stagram so when I'm in when I when I

[10:01]
stagram so when I'm in when I when I
decide I want to create a a Social
account to build an audience here
because you know me I always like to
start with the
audience uh you know yes it's nice to be
on Instagram because that's where the
people are but maybe I go on Twitter
maybe I go on Twitter because uh the
competition isn't there and there's an
opportunity to do that you know I have a
friend who um is a coach um and health
coach and she was on Instagram and she's
like where else should I be and I was
like you know go to
LinkedIn go to LinkedIn cuz you know
health coach for busy entrepreneurs her
Niche no one's you know no one's talking
about health stuff on or not a lot of
people are talking about health stuff on
on LinkedIn and she's built like a huge
a huge audience on there so it's and and
you know when there's not a lot of
competition there's uh it's worth
peeking in and then you can see the
topic map so you can see like self-care

[11:02]
topic map so you can see like self-care
Green living journaling I just find this
to be a helpful
way to um to just see what is going on
in a bird's eye view and then these are
the uh Google Trends related topics and
related queries so you can see like just
what are you know what are some breakout
topics um slow living with a
princess um these these you know you can
just start scrolling through them having
fun spend spend 30 minutes here spend 30
minutes and start um observing and uh
and and and writing down um another way
to obviously discover trending topics so
you'll find things that are trending and
look for
anti-trends is um if you do download
Glimpse you can go to the Discover
Trends tab you can go to discover Trends
tab you can you know click into things
Home Improvement let's say and it takes
a few seconds but it'll pull up like

[12:01]
a few seconds but it'll pull up like
what are the different graphs and what's
starting to um go up what's the search
volume um so you can see like AC
cleaning High income business and then
from that again you have to come up with
ideas uh around around what what can I
be building here and uh I've talked
about uh how I use Gummy Search in a
previous video a fous YouTube video how
to do that um and I think I might create
a video and pod around how to validate
some of these ideas if if if enough
people are into that uh comment on the
YouTube if you want if you want me to
create a video around that or pot about
it but um coming up with ideas are on
places like on Gummy Search or just
asking yourself okay what do these
people need so Glimpse SLG gooogle
Trends is something that um is very very
helpful um another thing that I do is
is I'll go to a platform like Cloe and

[13:04]
is I'll go to a platform like Cloe and
by the way in a previous video everyone
calls it made fun of me of call that
that I call Cloe instead of
cloud um but I speak French and you know
think about Jean clode
vanam you you know I wouldn't call it
Jean Cloud vanam that's not how you say
in French though I'm sorry I'm gonna
keep calling it clo um I might be wrong
in in English but that's how you say in
French so um so then I then I go to Cloe
and I'll say I want to build a business
in slow living give me a list of the top
creators in
slow
sustainable
living and top websites I can go show I
can go check out for some

[14:00]
can go check out for some
competitive
research slow and you know now I I I
generally like to like really Define
what it is slow living is the
antithesis of hustle culture and then
give me uh 10 of each let's see what
they come up with so then I've got the
list of the top creators in slow
sustainable living and then I'll just go
and check them out and then the top
websites so this like add this to your
document add this to you know and some
people don't like writing down that's
fine put it into a notes file like
literally a notes file you don't have to
use anything fancy the reason I like
writing or using just a notes file is
not using something fan you just you
know go with what you got and then you
can take some of these websites like you
know let's see what slow. Co is I
haven't checked this out okay so it's a
a newsletter for for for slow living and

[15:00]
a newsletter for for for slow living and
then you can go and you know so I'll
generally like look okay what okay
there's something called the
minimalist.org
[Music]
and what sort of traffic like you know
how are they
doing um and then I'll just start
literally playing around like what are
the opportunities any low hanging fruits
in terms of
SEO um back links I'm always interested
to see like how many backlinks do they
have what are their top pages top pages
are interesting because it it signifies
like okay what do people actually care
about on these websites that gives you
Intel into into what to do the organic
compet ition is really

[16:00]
compet ition is really
interesting um so just play around with
um a
atfs and just see how
competitive uh these anti-trend ideas
are um because that'll give you
confidence um around what to do um where
the opportunities lie um so I would I
would definitely do that you can also go
to the keyword
Explorer and just
see how difficult certain terms are and
then I also love looking at the
questions you know me I love the
questions part like what is slow living
um and this just is it's it's it's
interesting to
see interesting to see where are people
clicking in from like randomly Indonesia
for example is like the top search
volume so it's like that's really
interesting what about Indonesian
culture lends itself well to slow
and then how hard is it to rank in

[17:02]
and then how hard is it to rank in
Indonesia and do I want to rank in
Indonesia or do I just want to rank in
the United States um so these are the
type of questions that uh you get to ask
yourself it's amazing um when you're
playing with some of these
tools um another tool that I use um so
once you have the list of the creators
you can use a tool like view stats which
is uh Mr BEAST's tool they also have a
Chrome extension
and you can actually plug in so let's
just say um be more with less let's see
okay does this person are they trending
up like are they trending down are
people list you know let's let's go
let's go see so pretty small 11,3 like a
lot smaller than I thought like not
doing much so I look at this and I'm
kind of like there's there's not much
competition
here at all
let's go check how

[18:01]
let's go check how
about this guy Joshua
Becker and by the way I'm doing this
just so you can like jump in my brain
how I think about things like feel like
a lot of you have asked like how do I
how do I live cook basically so I'm
going to do more live cooking
podcast and YouTube
videos so this guy is crushing it he's
you know definitely adding subscribers
he's making thousands of dollars a month
um um things I look for is like how many
videos he's doing I also love to look at
long views versus short views I like
basically don't even acknowledge short
views anymore it's all about long views
in terms of affinity so if there's a lot
of long views it means that there's a
lot of trust here um I look at I have to
look at you know what videos he's doing
too right um this might not be all slow
living so this might this you know look
it's like some stuff about just tidying
stuff and decluttering
but there's also stuff of like 10

[19:00]
but there's also stuff of like 10
reasons to escape excessive
consumerism so there's definitely uh a
part of it that's L still living in a
part of it that's just like
minimalism so there you have it I gave
you my secrets I told you exactly how I
find anti-trends which are kind of like
the trends you should really be really
be paying attention
to and I hope you liked it and if you
did uh like comment and subscribe just
so more of this stuff is in your feed
it's the least you can do you want your
feed to be dialed if you want more of me
in your feed you got to go and do that
and it also just lets me know that I
should be creating more videos like this
um I did a video on how I find startup
ideas with AI and uh if you haven't
checked that out already go and check
that out and if you want me to do a
video on and Pod episode on how I
validate startup ideas let me know and
and I'll do it for you I'm here for you
this is what these are about uh lifting

[20:00]
this is what these are about uh lifting
the veil giving new startup
ideas and uh it's more fun when more
people are building you know and uh
let's uh let's go get him all right hope
uh hope this got your Creative Juice is
