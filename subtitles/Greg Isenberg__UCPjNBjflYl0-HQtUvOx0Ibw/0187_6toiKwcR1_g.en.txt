[00:00]
my take on this is that every person has
a ignorance tax that they have to pay
down so no matter what your goals are
there's a price that you have to pay to
learn to get to your goals quicker and
by living in San Francisco New York some
of these places yes it's might be two
times more expensive to live but you
will just by as osmosis pay down your
ignorance debt way way way faster
[Music]
J cream is back hey time to sip time to
sip you haven't been you haven't been on
the show in like three weeks so you're
just like super super electric about it
I was so sick I got covid got that bat
flu right in my brain and it just really

[01:00]
flu right in my brain and it just really
messed me up it stopped me from being
sharp there's nothing more scary as an
entrepreneur especially if you're
running your own businesses than your
brain moving slower than usual I think I
don't know if you've ever had something
like that where you get it you get sick
or something happens and you become more
stupid no nothing my my brain is never
slow and is never stupid it just hasn't
happened ever
yet that's just the standard uh speed
for you right I just take a a sip and
I'm back I'm back back where I need to
be well you Americans right and I was
really thinking about that this week you
Americans are all like you've got this
Zin stuff yeah I actually don't know if
it's a patch or if it's chewing if it's
a chewing gum no Zin is the rage in in
in America it's basically like a it
looks like a um piece of gum and people
put it like on their lip it's just
like it's a ni

[02:00]
like it's a ni
[Music]
thing it's a little bag that you put up
here yeah oh okay a lot of people in uh
the Nordic countries use that too but
not for productivity because hey guess
what nobody from Nordic companies is
going to be watching or countries is
going to be watching this show for
productivity ain't the thing but uh yeah
I was thinking I was literally like
maybe I need to start taking some of
these powerful concoctions of stuff that
Americans take to get work done um but
yeah in the end I just ended up waiting
till I didn't have Co anymore but I do
have some fun topic I I do have one main
topic for you today I think it's like I
when I saw this and I've been looking
into it for a couple of weeks I was
thinking okay your audience a couple of
people in your audience are going to be
smart enough and hustle enough to take
this and actually turn this into a
business um and it's based on I was so
I'm in a couple of different
entrepreneurial groups and one of the
groups I was in I was listening to the
call last week again I was like out of

[03:00]
call last week again I was like out of
my head with Co just like slow sweaty
whatever but I was listening to this
woman and she was getting help with a
with a marketing challenge she was
talking for a while and eventually I was
just like I'm really sorry do you mind
if I ask you how much your coaching
program costs and she said oh yeah yeah
it's $38,000 per year and I was
like what the [ __ ] what do you how and
the reason I was so shocked is because
what she's selling is she's selling a
program it's not an online course it's
like a kind of one-year program of
coaching to teachers who don't want to
be teachers anymore and who want to
transition out of that career into being
something else and then I was like okay
wait a minute there are a lot of
different careers that people are in and
they probably don't know that they can
take their skills and turn them into
something else and get a different job a
lot of people get burnt out from
teaching a lot of people realize like
from their perspective when it's too
late that they actually don't like it

[04:00]
late that they actually don't like it
and it's a super super popular thing for
people if you look at it so I started
Googling it then I looked at her website
maybe I shouldn't I don't know maybe I
shouldn't tell people about her specific
website on this uh thing because I'm
sharing things from within my
entrepreneur group that would be maybe
get me kicked out of that group but she
spend she there there's a couple of
companies that do something like this
for example there's if you just start
googling t teacher
transition uh new career there's one
called teaching transition Academy
there's things like that and these are
super high ticket programs where not not
all of them are high ticket some of them
are lower ticket but where essentially
you know a team of people will help you
figure out what you can do next and what
I love about it is that this is
something that so I run a company called
ajn
smart.com we help people become facil
facilitators and we realize one of the

[05:01]
facilitators and we realize one of the
most powerful things that we do is we
help people go from where they are which
is usually like product management ux
design project management to something
well more like facilitation which is
what they specifically want to do but
looking at this I was like you could
literally take almost any job like
nursing uh teaching I still think is
really underserved I was looking at it
you could even look at Consultants who
go and work at Mackenzie and then
realize they don't like it
you could also look at things that are
getting like laid off like product
managers really think about how could
you actually help this person get in and
especially if they're later in life
maybe they don't they already have a
family maybe they're already kind of
locked down to where they live how could
you actually find something that could
help these people a program that could
help these people or could you figure
out an easy thing that they could
retrain themselves on and honestly that
can be a Killer Business and I was just
shocked shed when I was talking to her

[06:01]
shocked shed when I was talking to her
and she was like
[Music]
$38,000 Teachers Pay $38,000 usually
spread out over the 12 months but I was
completely shocked that this was I I I
honestly expected her to say maximum
$3,000 maximum hey everyone if you're
anything like me you've got a ton of
design work that you need websites
landing pages emails social clets you
name it but you don't just want
beautiful landing pages or beautiful
websites you want the stuff that's going
to convert you want the stuff that's
going to actually drive value that's
where design scientist.com comes in it's
an agency that for one monthly price
will do all your design work all your
copy work all your engineering and do
stuff that actually scales your Revenue
you don't need a designer you need a
design scientist let's go design

[07:02]
design scientist let's go design
scientist.com I liked it so much I
invested in the
business so so what you're saying is
there's a bunch of careers that I mean
most careers honestly there people don't
like there's a there's a subsection of
people who don't like what they're doing
and there's an opportunity to get those
people to create content to attract
those people and then sell coaching and
other services to help them transition
from what they're doing to what they
want to be doing that's what you're
saying I think there's a couple of
nuances to it that I would focus on if I
was starting this business I would focus
on people who are who already have kids
who are already settled down where they
live maybe their kids are just like
starting to move out maybe they're
starting to realize maybe this career
isn't for me so I wouldn't be targeting
anybody like under 45 or maybe like it
would be more like 40 and above they'll
also have more money to spend as well so
there'll be more they'll have felt the

[08:00]
there'll be more they'll have felt the
pain also of being in the industry that
they don't like for a long period of
time and so I think that's why teaching
is such a an amazing Target like
teachers often I know a lot of teachers
they get to the certain point when
they're like 35 36 37 my sister for
example when she was 33 she transitioned
into
facilitation I think it takes a while
for her them to realize oh [ __ ] like my
salary is going to go up really slowly I
can already see I already know what
salary is going to be when I'm retiring
and this is what it's going to be like
forever and I think there are a lot of
different jobs like that teaching is
just one of the most obvious but
immediately for me what I'm always
thinking is what would I do if AJ and
smart failed and one of the most obvious
things after hearing the price of her
coaching program was well I'd probably
look for jobs that people feel stuck in
I I do feel like it has to be the pain
that they have to feel is that they're

[09:00]
that they have to feel is that they're
stuck and that their skills are not
transferable right you don't want to be
getting so you don't want to be
targeting like people like you and me
who are like full stack marketer
entrepreneurs who can kind of do
anything you want to be targeting people
who spent their entire year building
towards one career and their entire life
building towards one career and then you
can actually help
them gain the confidence to move back
into the market uh into something
different so I think it's it's like a
career coach on Zen you know career on
Zin exactly that's a good oneliner yeah
and like okay so how do you build this
business literally especially if you're
not a teacher if I was building this
well first of all you would ideally find
a teacher as your potentially as your
co-founder teacher who's already
transitioned out another thing is so
literally in one day first I would
Google the [ __ ] out of it I would look
at all the qu posts I was already doing
this today looking at all the qu
questions about how how to transition

[10:00]
questions about how how to transition
out of teaching looking at all the
Reddit posts about how to transition out
of teaching looking at all the different
things people are doing then I'd reach
out to a lot of the people who've been
posting ask to interview them just
gather all these ideas then of course
I'd look at the competitors I'd look at
all the different websites all the
different things if if I'm looking at a
lot of these they're fairly low quality
from a trust perspective I would say
they look very salesy and and like bad
and so I try to I would just build a
more trustworthy version of these things
and go content first and who I would
make the content with would be teachers
who have transitioned out right I'd
learn from the people who've
transitioned out of being teachers and
build like the best content Hub but yeah
I mean you would just then try to I
guess it would be some form of Education
business coaching business even better
if you find like the thing that they can
transition into but honestly I think
would be a super it would be a super

[11:01]
would be a super it would be a super
powerful business to at least replace
your normal day-to-day corporate salary
with and you would be helping people you
wouldn't be helping the kids who who you
know are in the schools but you
definitely fix you want to fix the
education system dude you're not exactly
fixing the education system but yeah I
hear you I will say okay you check this
out so one of the first things that I do
whenever I come up with an idea is I go
to Reddit and I noticed that there's a
subreddit called teachers I was on this
exact subreddit today you would be you
would be teachers in transition okay so
it's it's it's pretty massive uh it's
34,000 members it's actually a perfect
size top 3% Rank by size and I one of
the things I like to do is I go check
the top posts so this month the top post
is a post that says in case anyone
questions why 50% of teachers leave in
their first five years
and it's basically these text messages

[12:02]
and it's basically these text messages
of parents just following up cards cards
so bad it's like I'm curious as to the
interpretation of the grading rubric
right and then there's 213 comments of
other teachers being like one of the top
comments I don't care about grades quote
unquote and proceeds to rent about
grades so I think the way to to build
this is the way I would build this
teachers in transition or whatever in
transition is I would actually go and
build um the subreddit if it doesn't
exist like go and build a subreddit
moderate the subreddit I would try to
collect as many memes as possible and
the memes is how you attract the
audience you just end up sharing memes
for teachers nurses you know
dentists um that sort of thing get a
bunch of you know thousands of followers
and from there then that's when you

[13:00]
and from there then that's when you
create your high ticket offer and that's
when you you know you you sell them
stuff and te teaching was just an
example because just there's a lot of
people in my life who've quit teaching
and found it very stressful and and the
the stressful part is that there's a lot
of fear of leaving teaching and a lot of
fear of won't be able to do anything
else and what that does is also makes
people stay in something that that's
going to burn them to the ground and
eventually they end up on sick leave for
well sometimes years I don't know if you
know any teachers who are in that setup
I do and I think that's there are a lot
of people that I meet especially older
people who hate what they do they
absolutely hate it and sometimes people
come into our programs and they're so
and it wasn't it's not even the
intention of what we do at our company
but they're so thankful to have found
something that they actually enjoy doing

[14:00]
something that they actually enjoy doing
and they never thought they would see an
alternative and I never connected even
our marketing doesn't even touch on that
topic but hearing somebody talk about
building this teaching transition
coaching business where you have
multiple coaches hired don't care what
you think about coaching businesses it's
just an example but there are just so
many people stuck in jobs like so many
people stuck when they're 55 in a job
they just despise
but the fear the fear of not being able
to do something else you can really you
can create things that are just super
valuable for these people but yeah this
teachers in transition subreddit is the
perfect place to fill yourself up on the
problem teachers have it's mostly
negative posts if you look at it yeah
and and and basically gossip yeah you
know um but it's you know if you're a
teacher and you're in the subred it you
you you read a post and it's it's kind
of like real recognize real you know

[15:01]
of like real recognize real you know
like I see you other teacher like I've
been there we've all been there and if
you can get that feeling that's that's
basically the feeling that you want a
reverse engineer the other thing I
thought of is um and I found a couple of
examples of this as well again all I
like finding examples we talked about
this with the Deep Brown noise thing
it's a it's like fragmented scattered
all over the Internet tiny little
pockets of it but uh paid communities
again paid commun for teachers who are
still in teaching who are looking for
essentially a support group but also
maybe looking for a way out and just
having like a private space where people
can also share things that will help
each other have an easier teaching life
again this is not something I would
personally pursue because I'm not
interested in teaching but just watching
this other lady in my entrepreneur group
running it I'm like holy crap like this
is genuinely you're doing a business
that makes money but also takes people

[16:00]
that makes money but also takes people
from being burnt out and hating their
lives to genuinely feeling completely
different about their Futures it's just
crazy how many different jobs that fall
into this category I almost can't think
of a job where it wouldn't fall into
this category I could even imagine if
you want to go to the super high end
like the very like the end game of this
is what do you do when you're an
entrepreneur who sold their company and
you're like 40 and you're you've nothing
to do anymore because you've nailed it
and finished the vid the video game of
business how do you transition into
something else I even think that could
be a cool thing to help people with I'm
not there yet so I can't do it I'm just
trying to think okay so what job titles
need this the most and I think if you if
if you think about some of these
positions like teachers or dentists or
even doctors doctors even yeah doctors
like they spend they basically decide

[17:00]
like they spend they basically decide
that they want to be these people at age
like 1 Architects Architects hate their
lives usually often so they might you
know in their mind like you know their
parents or you know they had an uncle
who was a who was a dentist so they
become a dentist and then by the time
they're you know in their mid 20s or
late 20s or early 30s they're like whoa
I don't like being a therapist it's
horrible people are just telling me
their problems so I think a lot of job
titles where there's a lot of studying
and prep and long
hours that's what that's what I'd go
after I mean you could even simplify it
down to whatever jobs require you to
decide at the age of 18 that you're
going to do that job the chances of you
actually liking it by the time you're 36
is very low like a lot of the people in
my town in Ireland uh anyone who was

[18:00]
my town in Ireland uh anyone who was
smart and good at math was basically
told to do civil engineering I I don't
think I know anyone who actually does
that job now I don't even know what
civil engineering means it's like
engineering the engineering kind of
mathematics behind like stressors on
buildings and stuff like in
bridges so it's like if you you study
civil engineering you're you become an
engineer right a civil engineer so what
does that even mean I don't [ __ ] know
but one of my friends is a video game
designer right now I was just going to
say the name of the company but I won't
um and he yeah like that's an example of
a transition path that not a lot of
people who went into civil engineering
might know
about I mean in the end sometimes it's
just about seeing what other people do
right sometimes how you calibrate what
you want to do with your life is just by
looking at someone else and being like
Oh yeah like I could do that with my
life well it's it's the the power of M

[19:00]
life well it's it's the the power of M
mic desire do you ever read that book
I've never read that book I think it's a
book I can't even say that I'm not even
going to try to say it yeah it's called
wanting the power of mic desire in
everyday life by Luke
Burgess it basically says that even if
we don't realize it we do things
to to to try to mimic other people in
our lives and how we don't have as much
like we think that we're doing things
we're independent we're human beings we
you know if we if we want to be a doctor
it's because we want to be a doctor but
we don't realize that it you know it's
99% our environment and just us trying
to fit in as people I 100% believe that
um that's why I also like so we talked
about this before I live in Europe
Europe is very laidback um you can see
it from the economy but it's like it's
super laidback I even live in the
country with like one of the best

[20:01]
country with like one of the best
economies in Europe I live in Germany
it's so so laidback compared to the US
uh from a career point of view
and I do have to sometimes just get on a
flight like I am in a couple of weeks
and go to California just to like you
know be in San Francisco be in La hang
around with other Founders who are just
a lot
more focused and successful and like
driven than me they're just on they're
just on a lot more Z then you are I
didn't know that dude now I know no okay
some of not everyone is but I definitely
learned uh I learned a lot about Zin in
the last few
months um yeah Americans
definitely uh have a very unfair
advantage of having like a lot of
chemical compounds going at the same
time to keep them very awake uh I don't
know what whether I think that's a good
thing or a bad thing I just
I'm now aware of this but yeah it's

[21:02]
I'm now aware of this but yeah it's
there there's also just this energy in
the US this energy in places like San
Francisco which I then if I'm there a
few weeks I do start to mimic it right I
do start to there there's this like Tony
Robin says proximity Is Power I think
nothing beats it right if I spent more
time with you in person I'd become more
like you if you spent more time like me
in person you'd become way cooler
but really it just is that right I it's
it's really hard to get away from this
proximity thing uh totally separate
topic but it's also why I I speak to a
lot of entrepreneurs I'm in a lot of
entrepreneur groups and one common
problem people have is like things
aren't working out for me BL and I often
ask where do you live like as in do you
live like near where stuff is happening
oh no like during Co I moved out into
the middle of nowhere and like I've got

[22:00]
the middle of nowhere and like I've got
this amazing house but it's like 3 hours
from anywhere and I'm like it's really
hard to simulate the proximity thing
like you do need to be near stuff
physically the energy like I live in
Berlin and I live in an area that's
super busy and there's a lot going on
and it feels it just there's a momentum
there's something about and not to say
that being in a nice peaceful still
place isn't a beautiful thing to have
it's just if that's your day today you
will also become more
chill you you you start to mimic that
environment as well I mean where you
look like you're in a pretty chill place
right now but you you're often in Miami
right yeah I mean the what you were
describing being in the middle of
nowhere is exactly where I am now I'm in
like literally looking at it you know 95
Acres of mountains and there's no one
around here I'm in the I'm in
Canada and so I live I like to live my
life you know from extremes you know

[23:01]
life you know from extremes you know
Miami is like you're in it and here I'm
like you're not in it and sometimes I I
I'm I find it really helpful to dip in
and out of the extremes yes so for you
you're going to come to San Francisco
you're G to get this like dose or
injection of silic and Valley into your
veins and but you know you're going to
be taking your flight home and on your
flight going to be wow should I raise
venture capital and you're a guy who's
never thought about raising venture
capital in your life and that's because
if you spend enough time in San
Francisco you will think about raising
around because that's what everyone does
there for sure um so you know then then
you're gonna go down to LA and you know
on on your flight on your flight leaving
La you're GNA be like oh you know I've
been I've always been thinking I should
really get into
vlogging because everyone wants to be
famous in LA
so I think the hack is you have to write

[24:03]
so I think the hack is you have to write
your goals like what are your goals
personal career and then cities can help
you get to your goals but too much of
one city could
also you know kind of hurt personal
goals or hurt other career goals so I
think that you should treat a city as
just like um a utility in a way right
like you you get something out of it um
and but I want to say one quick thing
which is I also don't think you should
be one of those people that are
constantly on a flight because if you
don't have a home base you don't have
like a community that's also just like a
terrible way to live I was gonna I was
going to push you on that one because I
lo I'm I am really trying to build a
community in my in my physical
neighborhood here in Berlin uh like two
nights ago I was hanging out at my
neighbor's house just downstairs we're
in a like a high-rise building I guess
uh playing the new Elden ring

[25:00]
uh playing the new Elden ring
DLC um I'm cooking dinner for Neighbors
I I know the people working in the
different shops here so I do love to be
integrated into my
community yeah this is interesting right
a city is a utility and this is this is
actually this is a totally different
topic I guess we're just on topic two
there's a lot of I I never I don't post
about remote work versus in-person work
and cities versus Urban environments
anymore more because people go people
who are like who've made the decision to
like no cities forever get so angry
about it like if you now for example had
moved to wherever you are right now and
had decided I am now a monk living in
the middle of nowhere and I was like
cities are a great place to get like
this proximity and you'd be like oh no
you can't say that for everyone but
because you're flexible you can move
between these two worlds it doesn't

[26:00]
between these two worlds it doesn't
bother you and I think it the objective
truth about this is first of all if
you're all if you're already balling out
of control unbelievably rich and your
like your momentum is crazy and your
network is insane sure move sell
everything leave the city live in the
middle of nowhere you don't need any
more money and you don't need any more
connections and let's say your purpose
is gardening then you do not need to
think about this ever again but if
you're still on your journey I do think
cities are they're not just a place to
go have fun they are a utility that you
pay for like there's a reason also
people are like oh if you live in Berlin
you pay this much for an apartment but
if if you just move two hours outside
you can get a house for that price and
I'm like yes I'm not just paying for
physical space I'm paying to be close to
people who are doing things that I want
to do I'm paying for this energy it's it
is actually a service to live in the
city I actually heard like someone was
commenting someone was posting recently

[27:02]
commenting someone was posting recently
oh Munich is getting so expensive it's
ridiculous whatever blah blah blah uh
and this other German guy underneath
wrote and and everyone was agreeing
right and I was also like yeah sure like
Germany is getting expensive everywhere
is getting expensive and I was kind of
in agreement I was like okay yeah
everything's expensive [ __ ] this and
then somebody rolled underneath it's not
your human right to live in the center
of a city like it's it's not a human
right to live in the center of an
expensive city obviously different story
if you live there now you're getting
kicked out because of gentrification but
you as a you know me as an Irish guy who
went to college I have absolutely no
right to live in this Center of Berlin I
don't by the way it's actually insanely
expensive but I have no right to do that
so I it's it is a utility it's a service
and you're paying a premium because of
the services and the amenities provided
that's a whole whole separate thing but
like for example I know if I wanted to

[28:01]
like for example I know if I wanted to
live in San Francisco where the center
of this AI explosion is right now if I
was in Ai and I wanted to like basically
increase my chances of a successful
outcome I'd have to pay the price and
live in a place like San Francisco I'm
not looking for that but that is really
the price of getting the rewards of
living in a physical space that brings
you closer to all the things you want
and I think a lot of people need to
change their mindset about that when
they're saying I can get a seven story
house out in the middle of nowhere it's
like yeah you can and you just need to
understand the tradeoff you can do that
and that's really cool it's just about
understanding these tradeoffs is
important am I gone down a Bad Rabbit
Hole no no this is great my take on my
take on this is that every person has a
ignorance tax that they have to pay down
so no matter what your goals
are there's a price that you have to pay
to

[29:00]
to
learn to get to your goals quicker and
by living in San Francisco New York some
of these places yes it's might be two
times more expensive to live but you
will just by as osmosis pay down your
ignorance tax IGN ignorance debt way way
way
faster and the question for you is or or
the person listening really is you know
at this stage in your life and with the
amount of money that you have saved up
does is it worth spending an extra
$1,500 a month or whatever it is for the
premium to potentially get an extra
client a month or learn about how VCS
work or you know
XYZ that's what it is it is absolutely
that like a great a practical example of
this is talking to someone today who is
saying like talking about digital
marketing and how do I do this and how
am I how do I get calls and like it's

[30:00]
am I how do I get calls and like it's
really difficult to get calls and and
then I was like I was trying to give
advice but then I was like but the truth
is how I started was I was in a
co-working space in the center of Berlin
which was full of startups and I
physically talked to them and then I got
work like I went drinking with them that
like that's the truth and now I could
move out into the middle of nowhere and
build a career but but it
is of course possible to build a career
remotely and not in a city it's just the
challenge it is kind of like playing on
hard mode versus easy mode you get the
the it's like in a video game you're
putting the attributes into Comfort
you're putting all your points into
comfort and convenience but then the you
have like low ability to get leads and
build a career and I and I agree I I
think all of these options are like
people who want to live out in the

[31:00]
people who want to live out in the
middle of nowhere like you right now I
think that is absolutely amazing as long
as you understand the tradeoff and I
think a lot of people are convinced by a
lot of people who still haven't built
their careers yet are convinced by some
sort of part of the media to move out to
the suburbs before they get any momentum
and then there's like sometimes a little
bit of resentment later in life like oh
I could have I could have have done this
I could have done that and it's like
yeah you would have had to pay the city
tax to get that to get those things or
you have to become a [ __ ] amazing
content creator which is hard to do or
like a worldclass marketer which is also
hard to do yeah I think you could move
out to the suburbs or live off the grid
if you build a big audience because then
what what is an audience an audience is
just puts you at the center of digital
gravity yeah and then it's all good

[32:01]
gravity yeah and then it's all good
because you don't need to be in New York
you don't need to be in San Francisco
you know you're tweeting and you're
getting a million views yes but so I you
know if you're starting out or or you
just want to accelerate your career I
think you want to do both things you
wanna you want to do the digital gravity
thing and you want to build an
audience uh and that's kind of your
insurance and also it's your fallback
plan for when you do you know you've
been in New York and you hit 30 and
you're like I'm tired of this I need out
totally totally dude I I want that
insurance too yeah who doesn't want that
insurance I think it's but it's I know
again yeah we've we've gone deeply into
another topic but I I would love if some
of my friends and entrepreneur friends
had not jumped so aggressively on the
covid everything is going to be remote
Now
train and now are like oh it's really
weird weirdly hard to get
work like yeah it is it is diff it is

[33:03]
work like yeah it is it is diff it is
difficult when you when you are when you
didn't get that momentum career momentum
before you went away I think that's the
challenge I think there has been this
like it's back to your mimetic uh the
wanting book I got to read this I think
the mimetic desire thing works more
powerfully in
person it just has more of a powerful
draw in person but also godamn it iners
stuff's just easier to it's it's it
feels like it's easier to start a career
when you're in an environment where just
other people are doing that too and and
you just like for example when I moved
to Berlin I just copied one of my
friend's
careers he was a ux designer we both
studied digital media production and I
was just like you you're doing what and
like we would go out drinking and I
would talk to him about it and then he'd
show me his portfolio he tell me how
much he got paid and like I'm just like

[34:01]
much he got paid and like I'm just like
I'm copying you dude Eric thank you so
much for letting me copy everything you
did I appreciate it dude um but yeah
that that [ __ ] would be very challenging
to do uh where I come from which is a
small town in Ireland um because I don't
know if there's a ux designer there you
know what I mean a ux designer I don't
know if there's one I don't know if
there was one back when I was starting I
went down we we we we rabid
well that's what we do that's what we do
we we burrow we burrow you know that's
that's our style how do you split your
time between this place you are right
now and Miami I'm I'm in I'm in Miami
call it seven to eight months a year
eight months a year probably and then
three three months summertime here and
then maybe a month during the winter so
that's the other thing I like about here
is it's got the craziest seasons of all
time it gets to like minus
45° and like snow is like 10

[35:02]
45° and like snow is like 10
10t
um and Miami is like you know the the
complete opposite of that it's like
hurricane season right now so I don't
know I I I like I like again I like the
diversity I like uh I find that I work
I'm actually more productive up here uh
it's a great place to write like think
I'm in like a cabin in the woods
basically right so it's like so good for
writing so good for creativity
um and uh that's also just helpful like
if I have
like 10 blog posts I want to write just
fly up here spend a week here and fly
back that's so cool and and you know
here's the thing audience if I would
spend more time with Greg then I would
get more successful and be able to have
two places where I
live so I just need to spend more time
in Greg's proximity absorbing his energy

[36:00]
in Greg's proximity absorbing his energy
and then just those
dollars come flying in that's how it's
going to work I think I think we can end
it here I got to ask people to like on
