[00:01]
and we are live startup ideas brainstorm
number four number
four back at it impromptu out right now
we're clocking in some people are
clocking out but real ones are clocking
in real ones are know that the weekend
is a good is a good creative quiet
creative Zone it's kind of like the
mornings of the
week you know how the mornings are like
Cal and and you can actually get deep
work done yep well
that's that's where we're at that's
where we're at right now that's where
we're at beautiful so um as people are
trickling
in I was thinking there's a few options
of sips something to sip on that I could
be sipping on and I need everyone to
tell me what I should be sipping on
before we get to the startup ideas

[01:00]
before we get to the startup ideas
I I need to know so we have three
options option one Budweiser zero
non-alcoholic uh non-alcoholic beer 50
calories zero grams of sugar you know
what you see is what you're going to get
so that's option one budweis or zero
option
two is your classic carlburg Danish pner
the light beer you you know it's a nice
nice uh nice can by appointment to the
Royal Danish court and it's got the sort
of
bonus effect that my last name is
Eisenberg and carlburg kind of sound
similar cousins cousins we're basically
cousins and last but not least we have
our I'm not g to try to
chatar we got our chatar
which is uh our original Czech

[02:03]
which is uh our original Czech
logger owned by the Czech Republic so
you know that the government of the
Czech Republic's getting a few cents
from this never had this could be
interesting it's only brewed in the
Czech Republic kind of interesting so a
bit more interesting than carlburg so
what's it going to be I need everyone to
go in the chat tell me what to be
drinking start with the carlburg
carlburg
pilsner let's get dizzy oh okay no votes
for the Budweiser zero I need to try Bud

like a oneliner two liner a thre liner
just outlining what the idea is or what
you want reviewed like hey I'm working

most interesting DMS I'm going to send

most interesting DMS I'm going to send
you a link you're going to come up on
stage and we are going to jam live in
front of
everyone uh and we will we'll give you
feedback so that's how it works but I
will say one
thing
so if you come up here you have to be
prepared for what we call a sip or
spit now if you come up with a good idea
here what people are going to do is
they're going to they're going to sip
that idea that means that's a good
idea exactly but if it's a not good idea
people will say
spit so that just means it's not that
great of idea you got to go back to the
drawing board so that's how the startup
idea brainstorm
works and without further Ado cheers
it's
Friday delicious very light basically
tastes like a bud zero honestly and

[07:02]

this is you know we'll get you Leo we're
not going to forget about Leo come
on Boom hello guys how do I pronounce
pronounce your name Eder Eder yeah yeah
yeah it's our name from B
country from where weird where is it
from B country oh cool well welcome to
the
stage thank you thank you guys what do
you got for us well uh I'm actually uh

[11:00]
you got for us well uh I'm actually uh
the kind of testing uh developing an MVP
uh which is a web app right now but it's
uh meant to be yeah I don't think it
makes sense for it to be an app just a
web app I think it's fine uh it could be
something like um
well uh the idea consist
on let me put it in words because it's
right now it's just an idea and I'm not
used to to pitch it but
I'm going to try
um let's say you want to contact some
expert in something that has an
Instagram account or it is an influencer
or something and uh these people usually
have a lot of uh different um contacts a
lot of people trying to contact them and
of course uh they cannot attend every uh
message they send them or they cannot
even uh speak with their users right so

[12:01]
even uh speak with their users right so
uh this is an idea that will allow
people to contact
influencers UM by paying them I mean you
can you as an influencer could for
example create a a profile on this web
app and then set some pricings for video
call for a normal call for chat and then
uh put put this link on your video on on
your social accounts and then people can
contact you can request a contact and
when you accept it and you contact with
them you get paid the amount that you
that you set and which
influencer like you know any influencers
or are you specific to a type of
influencer yeah I think mostly
influencer that uh are not too big
because uh most of the times these
influencers have their like agencies and
and stuff and this Co comp the the the

[13:00]
and stuff and this Co comp the the the
scener
because um well uh they they also want
to get paid uh because uh all that
happens with that influencer they want
to get paid because of it so mostly like
small or medium influencers that are
experts in some topic maybe marketing
influencers maybe you know influencers
that don't have agencies behind them and
they have a business model besides the
the visualizations and the and all of
these apps and stuff they they do on
their social media yeah so we I asked
people if they sip or spit this idea and
you're getting a ton of sips you're
getting tons of sips people are people
are obsessed with this idea and
great
my my personal opinion is it's a spit
and it's a spit because it's really hard
to do what you want to do so what you're
trying to do is very similar here let me

[14:01]
trying to do is very similar here let me
share my
screen uh so it's very similar to
essentially
intro um sorry can you repeat can you
see my screen
yeah. it's called intro so you have
people who you know you can buy sessions
these are these are influencers and
experts that you can buy sessions with
them and there's a bunch of different
Cate
Wellness career Style Beauty astrology
so these are Venture backed this a
venture backed
company um doing Millions a year in
revenue and what they're doing is just
it's so hard if you know anyone who
wants to create a Marketplace anyone
who's listening to this like think about
how hard it is you have to like get all
these people to say yes and these are
all like really busy people so that's
one side of the marketplace and then you
have to build the
traffic to to get people to book because

[15:01]
traffic to to get people to book because
you're not going to get you know Alexis
oan the co-founder of Reddit to keep
that Lincoln bio unless he's seeing
bookings so the hard part about this is
the market that you're trying to Target
here is really busy people who like
don't really need the money and then
you're competing against people who you
know look at look at some of their you
know Kevin Hart is an investor
so I don't think this is a particularly
a good idea but here's what I would do
uh I think that the core of your idea
which is there are influencers that are
smaller that could
use new ways to
monetize like that's the core of what
you're saying it's like you know you're
not talking about Kim Kardashian you're
talking about Nano and micro influencers
yeah there's an opportunity to build an

[16:00]
yeah there's an opportunity to build an
service business an agency that is
specifically focused on that market so
it's like we don't touch influencers
over 100,000
followers once you get 100,000 followers
or 500,000 followers whatever the number
is go to CAA go to UTA go to these big
talent agencies that'll manage you um
and you know let them have it but
there's probably a you know 10K to 100K
a month business uh that is just
Consulting working with some of these
influencers and help and just and and
just building an agency around it now
that doesn't mean you can't create the
marketplace in two years from now it
just means that step one is to build
relationship with the nanom micro
influencers through a service business
way easier than building a Marketplace
and then step two eventually don't
forget your big vision

[17:00]
forget your big vision
but you know step two is basically once
once you've built that credibility and
you're the you know the guy who is the
Nano influencer guy or the micro
influencer guy then you can you you can
think about building the marketplace so
that's that's my take on your
idea okay kind of kind of like it so
nice to have your your opinion on this
and thank you to your community seems
like they are love it like but of course
uh um having the same place uh
influencers and users of course users
are more open to this than influencers
so I understand that that this is the
the the most difficult part of the of
this business of course so thank you
Greg and thank you thank you so much
thank you for coming up here you're a
legend have something to to to say
or yeah I agree with Greg and you could
even start very small with like a
newsletter as the the MVP where maybe

[18:00]
newsletter as the the MVP where maybe
you get people to subscribe Nano
influencers subscribe go get go win a
couple brand deals or whatever and send
them opportunities that could be like
the lowest hanging fruit where you could
start this today even so um I agree
with okay thank you guys yeah good have
a good later meet
you
Leo uh no we don't hear you but we see
you now which is
positive we switched inputs last time we
couldn't see
him now we can't hear
him Amy to the
stage welcome Hi how are you guys good
are you excited to be here I am I am a
new follower um but already a huge fan
and I um I've had a ton of ideas lately
and so something like this is just
awesome I love what
doing well we're we're lucky that you'll

[19:02]
doing well we're we're lucky that you'll
share it with this with this community
what's what's on your mind all right so
uh my background is in uh fintech
proptech and uh one thing that U I had
an idea around is there's not currently
to my knowledge a service or a tool that
is aimed at home
sellers that uh helps them offer seller
financing as an option to to to sell
their home a lot of the seller financing
like resources that you see online are
mainly aimed at at buyers and so the
idea here would be that uh a service
that that basically serves Sellers and
helps them with everything from you know
Soup To Nuts as it relates to seller
financing so getting contracts um you
know Finding uh a potential buyers um
qualifying those buyers underwriting
those buyers um and then all the way
through like closing and collecting

[20:00]
through like closing and collecting
payments um and really uh the idea would
be aimed at those older sellers who um
don't need uh you know the cash upfront
but would rather have the steady stream
of income um and and really be able to
serve them from start to
finish so how would that exactly work so
and and maybe you can explain seller
financing while you're while you're
explaining it for folks who don't know
what that is because I mean I'm
interested in this I my apartment is
listed for sale um I've locked in
a
2.875% 30-year mortgage yep
um and uh yeah how how would you work
with someone like me how would that work
yeah um so you uh you have your home
listed on the market um so I I actually
got this idea from my own situation
where I have a rental property that I
want to offload in the next year or so I
love my tenants um they they're great

[21:00]
love my tenants um they they're great
tenants they pay on time they've really
settled into the home so I would want to
sell it to them but they have really
shitty credit and so the idea would be
that
um I I would be able to go to this
service that I'm thinking of and say hey
I I happen to already have a buyer in
mind but maybe I don't need to um what
are the what are the steps that I need
to take to be able to close on a seller
finance deal so I obvious as a seller I
need a promiser note and I need to
record a lean on title and I need to
figure out a way to collect payments and
I need a way to structure the deal so um
you know how much do I get down from or
how much do I ask for uh as a down
payment what are the monthly payments
how much do I charge in interest those
are all things that I think um there
needs to be a resource uh available for
these sellers who really don't know
anything about the mortgage process like
yourself um but um uh but like want to
be able to take advantage and I I think
also as the market right now obviously

[22:01]
also as the market right now obviously
it's it's more of a sellers Market but
as the market turns and becomes a
buyer's market I think it also becomes
an advantage for a seller to be able to
offer um financing uh and not have your
buyer have to go through a
bank this is a major this is like such a
sip
idea yeah it's like it's a gulp it's
it's it's one of those ideas you hear it
and you're like why doesn't this
exist yeah which is a media green light
media green light how would
you how would you what's the business
model of this of this business so I
think you can easily monetize it with an
upfront fee um I don't I haven't thought
like specific numbers yet but um an
upfront fee plus a um a percentage of
the payments that you're actually
collecting on the back end so like a a
loan servicer for example you know
collects 25 bips on every payment that
they collect on average U so it' be
something similar to to that your
credibility also just went through the

[23:01]
credibility also just went through the
roof when you said bips bips
baby and it rhymes with SIP so I'm kind
of like you know where do I wire the
money this is I'm so glad you like it
because I had a hard time validating
this idea because I don't know very many
people in the same shoes but um
encouraging how do you actually go and
start this thing like what do you need
to do to actually start this
thing honestly I think uh it's something
that you can start small I think the
biggest thing is getting those like
legal uh resources to be able to draft
contracts that's not my area of
expertise but um like I I think there's
an easy way to Market this to homes that
have been on the market for a period of
time and haven't sold and sellers who
maybe are having trouble selling um also
targeting again uh like uh Boomers who
are ready to downsize their home and
again want that that steady stream of
income um but but I think you start
really simple with you know a basic

[24:00]
really simple with you know a basic
landing page some legal
resources um there may be some licensing
uh involved as well that you'd have to
get licensed as a a mortgage you know um
servicer but um I I think that would be
pretty minimal so yeah so I think
there's there's like the startup cost of
the legal side right and then there's
the startup cost of like the landing
page the name um and then there's the
cost of customer acquisition which you
know to me is a lot
of um you know
if if property has been on the market
for you know 120 days or more then send
messages so there's a huge cold there's
a cold email cold DM campaign um that
you can do and then there's obviously
the whole social audience building
content thing where it's like so many
people have heard of seller financing
but they just don't know how to do it or
they might not know what it is let me

[25:01]
they might not know what it is let me
show you a graph I'm going to show you
this graph and it's one of those graphs
where when I when I when I see it it's
just it's
beautiful so I'm going to share my
screen whenever I I I find an idea I
always um check Google Trends so I check
Google trends for seller financing the
interest over time and it's just it's
really just going up and up and
up um it's it's something that is you
know more and more top of mine look at
that from you know November it's
beautiful you know you don't get you
don't see this this is a gift you have a
gift um yeah that's right around the
time that interest rates went up and so
um it this makes total sense to me so
you can focus on different regions that
are looking at it the most it looks like
Utah Arizona Hawaii Florida not
surprisingly uh
Florida um you know I know there's a lot

[26:01]
Florida um you know I know there's a lot
of selling over there right now um so
that's something I would do is think
about how do you target the the
geographies that want this the most um
and then building content around these
queries right so like Niche content SEO
um this is something that you know it'll
it'll get your customer acquisition on
autopilot you just build these Niche
Pages you do some cold DMS content
around it this is like a great idea yeah
and and you know what I like about this
so much versus like my my sip versus
spit of the other one the other the
other last idea was like there's so many
things that need to go right for this to
work you know it's a marketplace right
you need a demand and Supply you need
liquidity but with this you don't need
that much to go right um it's quite
validated we've checked on Google Trends
this is a good idea and I hope you do it
awesome well thank you so much I really
appreciate the feedback of course
thanks for coming up send it when it's

[27:00]
thanks for coming up send it when it's
live we're ready to absolutely we'll
[Music]
do you know we're going to add to the
stage right now it's time you know you
know what time it is it's Leo time it's
Leo
time no it's not Leo
time no we
no it's cool it's and I'm I'm excited to
talk to Leo because I've actually
chatted with Leo on Instagram and and so
it it's it's tough it's tough but it's
not listen
sometimes sometimes it's not Leo time
and sometimes it's Leo time and right
now because you're in here twice Leo and
right now
it's it's not Leo time I mean we could
add Let's see we added double Leo Leo
chat say something oh yeah you can hear
me problem we got audio Leo and buy
myself a Lut ticket I apologize
apologize to you and the audience I did

[28:00]
apologize to you and the audience I did
everything I could I downloaded the app
but for some reason but I'm so thankful
to be speaking with you both uh Greg
you're a true inspiration I'm a huge fan
of yours and thank you so much again for
giving me this time of course so hard to
pitch after the previous uh uh bu
startup idea which was brilliant I'm I'm
mine is nothing compared to ours no come
on come on first of all Leo tell people
who you are
yeah the people need to know uh um my
first name is agil my middle name is Leo
my last name is abim I grew up in
Montreal uh so I am a keca and um I
practice law and I'm also a musician I'm
a professional touring
musician amazing and what's your idea um
so it's been a while I've been thinking
I've been looking for a way to stop
exchanging my time for money
and um to a large part thanks to you

[29:02]
and um to a large part thanks to you
Greg like I said you've inspired me so
much so I've been thinking I've come up
with this it's not a a new uh I'm sure
it's it's not a new idea it's been there
um subscription based legal slm
marketing SL Media Services cater to
creators you know given the growth of
the Creator economy and the fact that
legal services are not accessible to
everyone because because mainly uh of
the
cost um I
thought you know I would create a
subscription-based business where I
would provide value in educational
material to creators to artists I mean
it could be it could be niched down and
focused on for example musicians or
creators in general YouTubers
influencers and provide with them
because many of these creators um
don't have the the

[30:01]
don't have the the
knowledge uh when it comes to
intellectual property and the fact that
these are assets and then these assets
are capable of creating long-term income
recurring income and
so basically making them aware of of
this opportunity I think it's valuable
and you would you know price you would
also include like educational material
on taxes business
formation um branding I mean you could
focus on one thing or you could just
offer a number of
services and you know to to provide
Great Value you would even throw in you
know a 50% off uh trademark application
for a 12 month with a 12- month
subscription to the service then you
would have access to all these online
classes weekly um legal information
sessions weekly business uh coaching

[31:04]
sessions weekly business uh coaching
group coaching so this is a not in a
nutshel d
idea J Mi you want to give your opinion
I I'm
curious you gotta Niche
it gotta Niche down all the way no
marketing none of that what what's your
what's like your superpower in law so
I'm I practice entertainment law more
specifically music law sweet I also have
my firm also does have a a an
immigration practice tailored towards
entrepreneurs and
artists so I loved the uh trademark SL
patent that offering for a subscription
service I think is really unique I I
like that a lot um because that's a very
daunting activity to for Crea and
someone who you know they want to feel
protected but it's a great way to retain

[32:02]
protected but it's a great way to retain
um a client and yeah I would just like
hyperfocus
on a the law Niche and B offering like
I'm a big fan of this like help desk
type model right now for like membership
communities um where it's like four 500
a month or whatever you get access to a
Leo chat bot plus Leo in uh like
Community or membership model so I think
that could work here but I would say
Niche down on Law plus um your
superpower so thank
you legal
practices still it's crazy to say this
but in 2024 still don't understand the
world we live in in terms of customer
acquisition product I
Services niching
down uh like what what every Creator
does just from like a funnel

[33:00]
does just from like a funnel
perspective um
workshops uh you
know all these things they don't do so I
think that there's tons of opportunity
to build
a a a new legal practice or a legal
practice that has that does what we
do in mind um I agree that like there
needs to be a niche and it you know I
think for you I think what it could end
up being is you have like multiple front
doors so you have your like immigration
front door you have your uh
entertainment front door you have your
creator front door I think for you I
would think about who's G to pay the
most and who's most willing to put the
money out you know musicians for example
maybe lesso
creators maybe medium but immigration is
more of like a immigration and
trademarks and IP is more of a need to

[34:01]
trademarks and IP is more of a need to
have so I would probably start with like
from a prompt perspective think about
who who needs this the most and then
what can I borrow
from just people in our world in the
Creator spaces like the Shan pories the
mes the S pars the you know all these
people and build
funnels um because there's so much you
can do in terms of customer acquisition
that you'll be able to you know acquire
customers like I actually was talking to
um a big firm the other day and they
wanted to a top firm I don't want to
name them but they you know I was
shocked to hear how big of a budget they
have for travel and entertainment and
events and although that's you know and
sponsorships actually just like
sponsoring you
know local hockey teams and basketball
and stuff like that so you're going to

[35:00]
and stuff like that so you're going to
do so much better by audience building
content organic YouTube AI assisted
content uh cold DM cold
email
um and on then you know the icing on the
cake is positioning that's actually
going to resonate with creators or with
your audience because when I go to
insert Law Firm name here it all looks
the same it all looks like a
WordPress like old website with a lot of
jargon on it so I think that's your
opportunity and I think there's
tremendous I have tremendous
interest in in where law goes and how
legal practice practices evolve um and I
think there's there's you know this is
like a multi1 million opportunity for
for for someone who gets it right there
was um Justin Khan I don't know if you
remember Justin KH he's the co-founder

[36:00]
remember Justin KH he's the co-founder
of twitch twitch which sold to to Amazon
for a billion he worked on something
called Atrium and he was trying to
reinvent the law firm but raised like 40
or $ 50 million seed round doing it um
he had a lot of good thinking but I
think there's an opportunity to do it
Leo like producti service don't raise
money
um so anyways all that to say this is
sip for me I love what you're doing
Niche down and uh I think it'll be great
thank you so much it means so much again
I apologize for the technical issues of
you don't have to thank you so much it
was such a such a pleasure speaking with
you both pleasure was ours pleasure was
ours both both your video and your audio
thank you
post we could have just kept his uh
audio here for this for what a legend
measure um how you feeling how you
feeling about these ideas before we get

[37:00]
feeling about these ideas before we get
to the next person feeling pretty good
got got mod yeah just special
delivery uh from Courtney my wife so
shout out Courtney for the model yeah
absolutely that's awesome that was that
treating you it's pretty yeah it's a
special as they say oh wow it is Friday
so why not all right so we're gonna
we're going to get to it um we're going
to bring uh on to the
stage welcome welcome hello um yeah I
don't think you're going to pick me so
bit shock and then and then we picked
you and then you know that's the way the
world works yeah it's great thanks so
much for having me this is really
cool um our pleasure what's on your
mind so um so my idea is kind of based
on two experiences I had in previous
jobs I worked in um so I worked in

[38:00]
jobs I worked in um so I worked in
software engineering for a couple of
years and then I decided to try working
in operations so like just total
internal business
stuff um and I worked at a charity as
well in operations and uh they had like
basically nothing was automated that
they did um like everything from like
expenses to annual leave claiming Etc
was just people passing emails around
and [ __ ] like that
um and I built something while I was
there which was essentially all within
Google workspace um and it was a annual
leave management tool that basically
like allowed you to just have buttons to
click approve and stuff via email and it
would just fill in a spreadsheet with
like this calendar effect um on the
spreadsheet um and the idea is
like a lot of small companies like they
don't want want to leave the stuff they
know and there was nothing about this

[39:00]
know and there was nothing about this
that was outside of what they already
knew which was Google
workspace um yeah so the idea being like
a suite of HR tools where everything is
just in Google workspace like yeah it's
kind of like on the idea that people say
like every sass is a spreadsheet but
then if every sass is a spreadsheet then
just keep it in the spreadsheet and
maybe some people will like
that um yeah what do you guys think
jmx I'm trying to V I'm trying to
visualize
it uh yeah so like imagine like a Google
form where uh people can put in like the
dates they're going to they want to take
off and like the code like the
reason um as soon as they hit send they
get a Gmail saying like their line
manager gets a Gmail saying like do you
want to approve this request they can
press a approv button in the email and
then in a in a Google sheet there's like
there's like a each cell is like a date

[40:00]
there's like a each cell is like a date
and it looks like a calendar and it will
like fill in the right places uh based
on like what they've selected basic yeah
does that make more like visual
sense yeah makes yeah it makes sense um
and it's just for like PTO like
vacations is it for specific
industry I think that's that's the thing
in my mind I don't really know like
annual leave doesn't seem to be
something that has a niche in my mind
like every like maybe based on like
company size or something but I have
that thing of like how how do I find a
niche for
this and like a legitimate Niche not
just saying I'm just going to pick
something and gonna you know just say
put the name on
it what's your thoughts JX then I'll go
next yeah I want to hear hear your
thoughts I'm I'm having a hard time find
and like that the application or like
the like why I would want to look at a

[41:01]
the like why I would want to look at a
spreadsheet on of leave versus just like
a
calendar um and like what the value for
me would be as like if I was the
business owner so um yeah I'm confused
could you could you can you convince
him um so the value is like so what
these companies are doing before is
they're simply just like emailing each
other saying please can you like please
can I take these dates off the person
has to kind of go to spreadsheet fill it
all in somewhere where they're storing
this information but this is all just
connected now like it's all just kind of
buttons that people can press and forms
that people can fill in but they it's
not like an external application where
they have to train their staff on that
new
application yeah we've got like a shared
calendar that we that we use and it
works uh it works pretty well because
people like put the like request date on

[42:00]
people like put the like request date on
there and then everyone can see that
calendar and then it just like overlaps
exactly with our with our calendar um
so Jordan's out he's I'm SP for sure
spting so
here's here's what I gather from the
idea when it comes to
pto's and figuring out when someone's on
and someone's off we've all had issues
where oh my God I didn't realize that
Jordan's going to be off next week and
it completely
derails our entire week and lot you know
there's material impact to people who
have
PTO now Google Calendar or calendar
Microsoft Outlook you know the
Assumption there is that I'm looking in
a calendar and the assumption is I'm
seeing it I think that there's an
opportunity to build an app that and

[43:00]
opportunity to build an app that and
when I say app I mean like web app I
think there's an opportunity that just
focuses
on on solving the problem
of we will inform your team like we are
the best platform for letting you know
when people are on and off so I think
that for example you could do something
like you know it's a slackbot that
basically says Hey reminder uh uh you
know Jordan's going to be off next week
and it post to a public Channel like
that in itself is super valuable because
now it's being socialized that that
person you know and no one likes to do
that no one likes to be like oh hey
reminder I'm gonna be off you know it's
kind of like annoying so I think there's
an opportunity to build like the PTO app
just like that there was an opportunity
to build um you know I'll show I'll show
this business real quick
um give me a second I'll share my

[44:02]
screen
so this business
Lis this is for performance reviews this
is like a multi-billion dollar
company and it's just software around
performance
reviews comp cycle management
Integrations there's some like AI stuff
obviously team analytics like wouldn't
it be cool to see analytics on like PTO
and and who's taking it oh hey you're
not taking PTO maybe you need a break
you know I feel like that there's an
opportunity to build like the lattice
for PTO that's my sip idea for you based
on what I
heard so that's what I would love for
you to think
about uh over the weekend and you could
integrate it with like slack like you
said Greg or notion so it's like when
you're planning projects and I go to tag
Greg or Colin or whoever like it's like

[45:00]
Greg or Colin or whoever like it's like
go that that's going to be pushed
because he he's going to be out or
whatever I think that that would be that
would be super
useful and you know oq in the chat wrote
is PTO a small enough Niche it's a small
it is a small enough Niche I don't I'm
not sure that
this like my here's my name for it for
you pto.com nice
and I think that there's an opportunity
just to drive traffic to something
called PTO pal by the way someone in the
chat don't take it that's not the rules
you can't do that you know we can't have
that here this is a POS period startups
are hard enough as it is we don't want
that yeah so a little lock up period
Aman gets 24 hours to uh to buy it if
she wants and um but yeah I think that
there's that's where the opportunity
and uh thanks for coming
up and uh I'll see you online thanks

[46:02]
up and uh I'll see you online thanks
guys later thank
you all right we're gonna bring up Alex
and then Yer you are on
dck hi how's it going Greg can you guys
hear me Greg Jordan yeah I'm a big fan
of the show so thank you guys very much
I'm a fourth year university student uh
from California
I'm an undergrad in chemistry and I had
this idea of starting a newsletter where
we just share insights about just
chemistry Science and Technology kind of
related things um what I've been
learning you know just through you know
this is kind of my second career I
worked in healthcare for like 10 years
and then you know now I'm in chemistry
so I'm about to graduate I'm finding out
that um you know chemistry information
is very it's like it's just a small
small niche people who don't really
share that with anybody else and I found
that you know when I tell somebody else

[47:01]
that you know when I tell somebody else
something some kind of insight that I
have you know in regards to the toxicity
of a product whether that be like a
shampoo uh just any cleaning product or
anything like that people are shocked as
to how many carcinogens are out there um
and just these kind of thing medicines
how how they work and you know how they
harm you or what not and so I thought
about just a newsletter where you can
share uh stuff like this right like you
know scientific papers journals we
talked about this on the show the other
day and I've been thinking about this
idea for at least I'd say a few months
to a year and I I'm a college student
right so don't know really how to
structure a business or or even think
about scaling or starting so I just kind
of want to come on here and share my
idea and see if you guys would roast it
for me uh pushing me down the right
track and as a non-technical person uh
stuck in the very extreme of Sciences
you know I just want to come on here and
see if you guys can give me your advice
and your

[48:00]
and your
thoughts J
X beautiful I love super technical
people that are diving in to to this
world uh there's not enough and we we
love to see it I think there's a yeah
there's a huge opportunity have you seen
live
Oasis no live- oasis.com it's like a
basically like a water toxin
microplastic directory
and I think there there could be an
angle thank you Greg um there could be
an angle here with like everyday
everyday uh
products and I just learned about like a
Teflon coating I forget what what it was
called yeah it's really bad for you yeah
so like the paint like you could have a
whole Niche around just like cooking
pans I think uh right cutting boards and
like maybe start
yeah hyper niche in the kitchen right uh

[49:00]
yeah hyper niche in the kitchen right uh
I could see that I could see that
kitchen cancer I don't know that's a bad
these kind of videos on social media
that I I've seen I've come across on Tik
Tok Instagram whatever they tend to get
a lot of traffic and a lot of views a
lot of Engagement because people are
shocked at these kind of things and so
when I talk to any of my other friends
whether they're in law or you know other
Industries they really have no idea you
know as to what products in their
day-to-day lives are carcinogens or
affecting them or whatnot medicines or
whatever maybe we talk about uh people
are shocked every single time so I just
thought there's so much value in
information especially as Niche Niche
down as I am in like chemistry
biochemistry it gets really complicated
so it's really nice to stand out and be
one of those scientists who can
communicate those things well because
typically in science there's really not
that good of communication right or
entrepreneurship and you know we go to
far length to study this kind of thing
and we just don't share with anybody we
publish papers and it just stays there

[50:01]
publish papers and it just stays there
you know sometimes we do research for 10
years on one medicine and then just move
on you know what I mean and and there's
so much value for other people to be had
from sharing this kind of stuff that I
just thought free newsletter you know
just post about it somewhere on on the
social media platform hopefully you know
uh get people interested and you know
just start sharing information and
monetization I have no idea maybe
Partnerships you know sponsorships and
you know ad rep Revenue through it
through um I don't know it could be
medicin medicine companies healthcare
companies biotech companies anything
like that but anyways that's my idea um
you know let me know what you guys think
so in the kitchen agreed I think you you
do short
form and it's
really you're kind of selling fear in a
lot of ways it's like did you know that
there's 1.2 billion you know particles
of plastic on and then you like show it
and you're actually really good on

[51:00]
and you're actually really good on
camera like I feel like this is a Tik
Tok right now like I feel you know like
I see tons of them every day and I just
feel like you know the more far down you
are into the science the more kind of
nerdy you are and the worse you are at
posting content but that's why I thought
writing would be a little bit easier for
me to get into because as scientist
you're not really a content creator you
know and as as much as you can do it I
think riding would be the Le the least
passive resistance you know what I mean
but I I hear you but I think that with
writing in a newsletter for example
you're not going to like you need top of
the funnel and the top of the funnel is
going to come from short form I think
they need a lot I think you need a lean
into I'm a scientist and let me tell you
something like lean into I'm smarter
than
you
and uh milky nky TV in the comment
section wrote uh like Bobby approv
approved and so Bobby approved right I
don't know if you know him but know yeah

[52:01]
don't know if you know him but know yeah
yeah and so my sorry go ahead Greg his
uh you know for for f folks who don't
know who he is he's I think his Tik Tok
handle is flave City flave and he goes
around to Costco and Publix and Florida
and ALDI and all these grocery chains
and he picks up regular products and he
says it's like you think that this is a
good product and let me tell you why
it's not a good product or right and
here's something else that you know you
buy cornflakes you shouldn't buy
cornflakes because there's processed
sugar and there's this and there's that
and there's orange 12 which is banned in
the US let me tell you you know you
should be buying um this and Aldi's own
brand of corn flakes actually has three
ingredients and then what he's done is
he's created a directory called Bobby
approved this is Bobby approved and the
guy is making millions of dollars a year
right I had a friend come to me exactly
like this and he asked me the same exact

[53:00]
like this and he asked me the same exact
thing he was a retired attorney and he
told me like like Alex give me your
opinion on this and he shows me the
video of Bobby and I'm like this guy is
incredible he's really niched down and
he got you know all these you know
people who are maybe retired stay at
home moms or this kind of crowd that
really follows him and goes to Costco
and looks at these products I thought
that was amazing and so I think the the
more credibility you can apply to that
the better and I think I I was just
thinking about you know my leverage as a
scientist to be able to really really
get down into the science of things and
really explain things really well and
from my experience in healthcare people
want to know you know how how those
medicines are toxic right like you if
you take something today you want to
know what what potential you know harm
that can do or you know little things
like this but I I totally agree that
social media should be top of the funnel
and so uh given the circumstances we
have now with Tik Tok and Instagram and
the kind of it might be going on off the
you know it might be shutting down what
do you think where to start you know I

[54:01]
do you think where to start you know I
me now beauty is vertical video you know
so it doesn't matter if Tik Tok shuts
down because what you create for short
form you know you can put on Instagram
reals you can put on YouTube shorts and
you can put on Tik Tok if Tik Tok no
longer exists then it doesn't matter
like you just put on you'll be putting
on reals and shorts so I think that if
I'm you I'm spending the next four
months and be and or four or six months
and be like how do I become the best
possible um Authority in the niche in
this in this and and and learn about how
to be amazing at short form video and
just watching a bunch of short form
video taking notes um I do think that
there's a
bigger like the macro trend is really
Bobby approv for X so for people
listening who you know Alex has a
specific Bobby approv for ex that he's
working on but there's probably like
aund ideas where you could go up and

[55:00]
aund ideas where you could go up and
basically have taste and have curation
and have technical analysis create a
point of view and then send them to to a
directory like that's the idea but for
you specifically I think in you know in
in the kitchen Nob brainer this is an
idea that's GNA work I look forward to
seeing what happens it's got some
built-in virality I think we got to do
the first one this weekend I want the
lab Cod I want you to print out the peer
review paper it's so boring you're gonna
hold it up rip it in half be like I read
this so you don't have to and then
exactly much right into it and this is
what I do fun anyway on my free
time let's see it exactly all right
thank you guys so much for having me on
you guys have to start a community more
like this all the time I would totally a
th% join um I watch all your videos so I
I appreciate you guys coming on here and
helping us out well we do have a a
community it's called Community
empire.com
uh for those interested that's right
right and uh we do do jams like this we

[56:01]
right and uh we do do jams like this we
had one yesterday where we were just
jamming on ideas so um check it out um
and there's also a free you could just
sign up to the free course as well so
it's there's a free five day email
course thanks a lot Alex doe thanks you
guys so
much all righty you know what time it
is what is it the gajer time let's go
let's go he's been in the queue too he's
been in the queue but his his video
wasn't showing so it wasn't yeah I I was
keeping my video off but hi Greg hi
Jordan how are you guys great good nice
to see you here thank you uh and uh it
really means a lot for me to be here as
well because it's 2:30 a.m. in India yes
so I've already I've already I've
already so I've already come across your
post link post of having these kind of
chats and I found them super useful but
then I always looked at the Times Z the
EST I'm like oh no not going to happen
but uh I was awake today and another

[57:01]
but uh I was awake today and another
post I think perfect back on so let me
just quickly introduce myself right so
I'm from India I just like Leo I have
also started law so I'm a business in
law graduate I've graduated this year
I'm 23 years old and I am building a
startup which
basically uh makes learning fun so just
to give you a bit of background in India
so all the education which I have been
through I have personally found it very
boring and found it very monotonous
because in India at least the high
schools focus on Dr learning so what
I've decided that I'll be focusing on
21st century skills with games so for an
example I've created this game which is
a board game just like Monopoly so it's
a two to two to four player board game
it's called startup high and uh what it
is based on is the fundamentals of an
entrepreneurial mindset so now what what
I want to do eventually is I want to
take this game and many many more games

[58:01]
take this game and many many more games
like this into schools tell them that
okay uh I I I I don't think books are
useful anymore anymore any longer take
this board game give an experiential
give a game based give a peer-to-peer
learning opportunity and access to
students so that they can actually learn
21st century skills which is much needed
I think in today's world and then uh
lead on irrespec of whether you want to
be an entrepreneural respective whatever
they want to be I think being problem
solving being opportunistic being risk-
taking are important things which
everyone needs to learn so yes looking
for your opinion your ideas everything
right
it
JX that's really cool I love that we got
to see though we gotta do you have a
website up for
it uh the website is under construction
but I think uh what do you want to see I
can redirect you different fures for
that oh yeah just like would love to see
the game the pieces it's cool that

[59:00]
the game the pieces it's cool that
you've already got a physical game made
um thank you so love that I I do I do
have a YouTube channel where which I put
on the trailer and a couple of more
things regarding the video uh I would I
would also recommend you to check the
trailer out if you are uh if you like
cinematic pieces I've tried my best to
make a cinematic trailer of this uh
should I just uh tell you the YouTube
channel yeah sure yeah or'll drop it in
the chat after
sure I'll do that cool um yeah I really
like it I mean my mind immediately goes
like how do you get this digitized as
soon as possible um yeah what is the
digital version of it just from a so a
shareability perspective correct so but
I think so there are two pins there are
two thought processes of M regarding
digital version so one is so the
industry which I'm targeting is actually
edutainment which is basically Education
Plus entertainment right why I'm not
bullish on digital three reasons one I'm

[1:00:01]
bullish on digital three reasons one I'm
not a tech person the uh I find edtech
or education technology has actually you
know done more harm than good for sure
it has uh democratized education but I
think people actually need to get back
to peer-to-peer learning get back to off
screen learning for some time in in the
in the curriculum and then go ahead but
of course I do realize technology I
think is a great distributor uh and uh
it democratizes a lot of information so
I think uh I am working on a tech
version but I think it will slightly
take much more longer time than expected
so for for the next three four months at
least focusing only on the offline
version offline based
learning yeah I love that um I love the
the mission behind that I think I would
think about how to design in
yo I would think about how to design in

[1:01:00]
yo I would think about how to design in
uh like the IRL
URL uh Bridge basically like how do you
get peer-to-peer learning your time in
you can earn points digitally and almost
like tamagachi throwing back the
Nostalgia like little kids had to keep
these like digital Pets Alive or like
the Farmville craze I think there's a
big opportunity to actually like create
a secondary world around
startups entrepreneurship you know a lot
of people want to entrepreneurship so I
don't recommend it but if you want to
play it would be cool to be able to to
to play and build up like Equity or you
know coins or whatever I don't know what
you guys think about that I think I
think you know the what excites me about
what you're doing is there's a huge
percentage
of parents that want their kids to be
entrepreneurs and there's no good ways
for them to like there's no there's not
enough structure there's not enough
product structures for them to go and

[1:02:01]
product structures for them to go and
become entrepreneurs so I think there's
like a big holding company opportunity
to basically you know you're starting
with a board game but I think having a
suite of products that inspire people to
become business owners if you can make
that there's tons of search volume for
entrepreneur game for XYZ too actually
um it looks like Amazon ranks what I
would do is build like launch on Amazon
and then you could do build links to the
Amazon URL because an Amazon URL already
ranks you can probably uh dislodge that
and replace yourself with it um is what
I've seen occur in the past um and then
uh you can Target parents that are
business owners that have uh kids under
the age of 18 on Facebook with Facebook
ads and then it's just a creative game
of like you know how do you how do you
get but that targeting is super easy to
do you can also buy those email
addresses of people too you you probably
C email people this of like like make

[1:03:00]
C email people this of like like make
your kid into an
entrepreneur um but you can buy parent
email addresses lead lists like and then
it's just like you know C I think it
would probably make more sense on social
like I feel like social is going to be
the way that I would do this and go and
find like Mommy influencers uh like um
uh and like kind of that whole category
and then do like Partnerships with them
of uh you know like here's this game
that teaches your kid the skill sets and
what I would try to do is like tap into
another uh like game that people know to
it's like you know mon Monopoly was
actually created to like teach people
how land like yeah exactly capitalism
right like like how landlords exist um
but what I would say is be like hey
we're the Monopoly for the 20 you know
for the 20 for 2020 for the 21st century
or whatever right um so it's like
basically taking this old idea that
people already have a connection with or
what I would actually position it as is
like were the Monopoly for the internet
age something like that and then
basically the game teaches them how to

[1:04:00]
basically the game teaches them how to
like you know whatever like build
internet-based companies in this whole
new paradigm um yeah I mean that there's
your your whole go to market strategy is
pro probably somewhere in that
but interesting I think uh lots of
interesting points
here uh by the way Jordan if you want to
look at the website you can still I
don't think it's complete but it's
startup high.in so you can just check
that out I think you'll find the trailer
there cool well we'll check it out but I
think that's like that's the big idea
look at look at search volume build
multiple products I think you'll have
physical ones digital ones and I I I I
see you know it's validated right so we
love to build things where it's
validated that's a validated thing so
we'll keep an eye out for it thanks for
coming up perfect thank you so much
guys what are you sipping on
Cody dude I've been drinking coffee all
day I'm about to go get a gen and tonic
though if you if if we uh should we do
that you guys you guys you guys on I'll
I'll go get a

[1:05:00]
I'll go get a
get
okayed what you're fine you're you're
crushing it okay cool I thought it was a
little delayed I didn't know if it was
streamyard I'll be right back whatever
what is everyone uh what is everyone in
the in the Stream sipping on what are
people sipping on I mean what are people
sipping
on something surely something if if Cody
Schneider's getting a g&t you certainly
should get something um I think
that what we'll do for the rest of the
stream
is
um I think I'm just gonna I'm gonna jam
with Cody for a bit and then we're gonna
head out dope um and and I just want to
see what's on Cody's mind right now um
but while while we're waiting let's
bring uh meat is that your real
name you're on you're on mute
meet just a sec yes sir yes I was uh my

[1:06:02]
meet just a sec yes sir yes I was uh my
name is meat it's meat Shukla oh
beautiful yes welcome to the stage do
you have an idea for us uh so it's not
an idea I W I'm currently working on a
product which I think is dying down I am
probably going to switch or pivot it a
bit but uh so the thing is that I'm
basically a software developer right now
in otwa very near to you Greg yeah uh
and so I'm trying to I just graduated
from master's degree right now and so
trying to build this product night and
like on nights and weekends so this is
my first prod like first try at building
a product from scratch so it's called
clip. it's basically a tool for creators
to sell digital downloads and also sell
their time so as in like a calendly
alternative within the product itself I
know it's I was just building it
for like learning and stuff but tried to
convert it into product so it thought it

[1:07:03]
convert it into product so it thought it
was a huge Market that's why I converted
into a product and I just wanted to know
if you guys have some growth tactics or
what things I could do in to get few of
the initial users or it's how do I spell
that K Li i p p. I well that's your
first
problem the the double P the K and the
double p and you know I think uh it's
hard to spell but let's see what we can
do all right so I've got it live here
best fit for modern creators and
entrepreneurs launch your digital store
in five minutes so digital products
schedule meetings offer coaching
solidate links in your link and bio
store
interesting so who do you compete
against so yeah we are competing against
Str store and that's why they're doing
20 million ARR and they're a VC baged
company so we thought that we can maybe
take a cut of the pie but uh that's not

[1:08:01]
take a cut of the pie but uh that's not
really happening I tried to DM like
about, people on Tik Tok and Instagram
but they're really very much Affiliated
like they're not even earning money the
creators who are using Str store and
then also they're trying to they're like
wannab be wnab be creators and so
they're only following the creators who
are already bigger than them and all of
them are using stren store so I'm not
sure if I can get those creators but
they don't have a lot of users on
Twitter and Linkedin EXT store
themselves so I was maybe thinking to
Target soloers and like Sol side of
Twitter and
Linkedin okay and let's check out Stan
store like from a features perspective
are you like very similar would you say
I think I I have about 70% of the
feature watch 10 store
has But but so like why would someone
ask actually use you versus stand store
if you have 7 that you right like you're

[1:09:00]
if you have 7 that you right like you're
right on that part like I am also not
able to answer that question to be are
you honest so that's why you know what
it is don't compete in these markets
like yeah why do people do this to
themselves you know it's like you're
didn't Stan raise like [ __ ] 20
million in their last round too yeah
um
[ __ ] h
yeah yeah it's too much work for you dud
like you should focus this energy
somewhere else what's the most valuable
part of this how can you abstract that
out into like another place um is it
like the the payment process I again I
don't know I sorry I'm coming in late I
was
like trying to find my cabinet so to be
very honest it didn't took a lot of
development effort like because I've
been a developer since like last three
four years so it just took me two months
to develop so it's not too much of
developing effort but and I was very new
to like next St and stuff so like that's

[1:10:00]
to like next St and stuff so like that's
why it took a little bit of time but
otherwise it would take only a month to
bit so not core value too much in
development but it's like I thought like
doing all of the parts of digital
products and scheding which a lot of
creators use newsletter a lot of
creators use Ken Le for their scheding
part sell digital products so merging
all of them inside one two what's a
niche you can go after that they're not
going after
that's a great that was my next question
so like convert kit as an example like
they were competing against mail champ
how' they win is because they went after
bloggers and they were underserved and
they built products that were specific
for them it's like that same idea like
basically at you know picking a subset
that's under ser and this is the hardest
part of this what you're doing right is
like and with like a stand store the
problem too is like you're competing
against like they're just going to go
hire influencers to promote the tool and
then other influencers are going to see
the tool and then it's just like it's
going to create this like so the thing
is I talked to one of the creators who
is on stand store and they are paying
like $500 a month to those creators yeah

[1:11:01]
like $500 a month to those creators yeah
just to put videos on I can't compete
against that yeah I can't compete
against that yeah um so that's why I
thought that maybe I can go on Twitter
and lingon and solo preneur on that
thing on on whole that Niche because I
don't think a lot of people on Twitter
also knows of St store itself totally um
hold on I gotta find this company I have
an idea for you um
and I think you could go after coaches
doing this uh practi have you seen
practice no I haven't
seen so sorry I'm in some like LinkedIn
growth pod [ __ ] with this person so
I gotta go find whatever it is here it
is okay I invested in this
business a16 zbed like it's just you
don't really want to compete against
these types of businesses you know so
hard
yeah um coach boox doai here I'll drop

[1:12:02]
yeah um coach boox doai here I'll drop
it in the YouTube I got it I'll share my
screen coach boxit AI yeah and they
build if I understand correctly I still
them confused like their [ __ ]
positioning on their website is very
confusing but um what I believe they do
is they make like a digital chatbot for
like coaches and creators for their
think character AI but like for a
business like coach right or like a you
know mental health coach or a fitness
coach or whatever um they basically like
take all of that person's knowledge and
then they build like a digital version
of them that people can pay to access um
I think that there's something probably
in here with like what you've built and
then also this um and then your you know
your go to market is just like go sell
coaches on making a digital version of
them because that what you're doing is
you're creating a new Revenue stream for
them right and then you take a rake off
of the subscription service is like how
I believe it structured so it's like
you're I mean she's paying like 99 but I
I mean probably how I would do it is I

[1:13:00]
I mean probably how I would do it is I
would go and like train a model like
make like a what is it called like Lenny
bot have you seen this grg yeah I think
exactly make like a lenot um is it Lenny
bot.com or doco yeah.com here I'll drop
it in the chat too um and I would do
basically like that but for coaches or
creators with all their knowledge and
then they get to charge Their audience
for access to them or if they're just
like already a coaching because like
when you think about coaches right like
what do they do they build all this top
of funnel and then there's you know
probably 90% of the people don't
actually buy from them they're just like
consuming their free content and then
10% turn into actual paying you know
it's probably even less like we should
have a coach on at some point to talk
about this Greg have a coach on at some
point to talk about their unit economics
that would be super interesting um but
the uh the that whole other set like
what the the the product offering or how
you could go to market with it to get
the positioning right is like you have
this whole group of people that you're
not you you will never actively coach
they will never pay for coaching but you
could still monetize them with a tool
like this um that's at a way cheaper

[1:14:00]
like this um that's at a way cheaper
price point so they get like you know
we'll say 70% of the effectiveness of
the coaching or 50% of the effectiveness
of the coaching um but it's just uh like
you know at a way cheaper cost you know
a tenth of the cost of what the coaching
is and like I think that that's an
upsell this this idea is the same idea
as the uh uh the AI like voice chat Bots
that people are starting to like employ
out for like car dealerships and [ __ ]
their angle of how they're getting into
car dealerships is like yo when your
team is offline like it's like you know
9 pm at night and somebody calls you
instead of going to voicemail we're
gonna answer this and it doesn't have to
be as good as the person that is in the
daytime right it just has to be good
enough of what's currently happening
which is no one so it's of course it's G
to be good enough so even if it you know
increases Revenue just a small
percentage it's that same idea so it's
like you can basically you make a new
Revenue stream for them that uh they
otherwise couldn't have off of the
audience they already have it's just
like they deploy it so anyway just a

[1:15:00]
like they deploy it so anyway just a
thought but and then and then you can
charge monthly yearly for it or even do
a REV share so you can give people the
option yeah free tier with a REV share
and then like a teachable has great
pricing like this where it's like yes
yeah it's like I think it's 10%
transaction fee if you're on that free
and then Bas you know bump up so sorry
Greg didn't mean to cut you yeah no no
teachable is like they crush it here
yeah they're so good at this um yeah so
what is that $1 and 10% Like think about
that like that's insane right so it's
like of course I'm GNA buy the 39 or go
up all all the way to the 199 yeah you
know and if they're a legit coach like
I'm just thinking about some of these
like marketing coaches like like a
[ __ ] Amy Porterfield or something
like that um that's charging whatever I
don't even know her number anymore it's
like, 1500 an hour or something like
insane um like if they can go and right
and somebody can subscribe to her thing
for $29 think about a hundred thou I
mean she's got a top whatever you know
top one marketing podcast in the US
right like I mean she's going to sell
100,000 of those and of course she'll

[1:16:00]
100,000 of those and of course she'll
pay you you know whatever 99 a month to
be able to have that chatot live that
people can interact with I think it's
gonna be the weird part is going to be
figuring out how do you get them to like
coach you know it's like hey this is a
you know and and it's based off of the
source material so you build this whole
Corpus of information of their knowledge
you know C and then and then that's like
transferred into the chatbot and like
acts like them talks like them uses the
vocabulary like them so it sounds like
them it feels like them but I mean again
I I I know a little bit about the space
just with the typee of product I own and
and I I think that there's a huge
opportunity for this so okay yeah it was
great thank you thank you so much guys
hell yeah brother good luck man good
luck go get
him I removed
myself hell yeah honestly I I felt you
know I felt you feel bad for that you
know people like that right like they
spend a bunch of time I know he just
says two months but it's just like the
energy into something and then you
realize like you're competing against
behemoths but here's the thing you can
still it's still like

[1:17:01]
still it's still like
not wasted time right because if he just
niches it you know sort of pivots and
niches down he's got something totally
totally also the St store founder is
like a [ __ ] gangster like I wouldn't
want to compete against him like zero%
chance have you seen his YouTube it's
absolutely popping off yeah yeah didn't
he come from a Wall Street too yeah I
think he was IB before this um which is
like I mean they just know how to crush
content they're used crazy hours right
yeah exactly it's like 100 hours minimum
100% it's like dude this is nothing I'm
doing 70 hour nothing yeah exactly
that's a that's a chill work week for me
exactly that's a long weekend work week
for me yeah and Bob's not breathing down
my neck at
midnight I don't have Stacy texting me
at 2 am and expecting a response in 15
minutes dude I had a roommate like that
it's like it was like you had a 15minute
rule like you had to respond in 15
minutes if a superior reached out yeah
they'll just dip out like we're at

[1:18:01]
they'll just dip out like we're at
dinner just they're gone 100% And what's
terrible is like I feel like they just
did it to like Lord power over people
you know it was like it was like oh like
he let's see if he's up at 1:00 a.m.
like they're like out with their boys
getting a [ __ ] drink and they're just
gonna like hit up hit up Jack and be
like oh you up like you got to do this
perspectives right
now PowerPoint better be loaded
exactly
man I I invited a couple more people
before we head out one I just I just had
to I don't even know what this means med
school in a weekend like oh that's sick
I'm so down you know that's the thing
the pitches that work like you know
because now I I'm getting like 100 DM
you know 75 DMS right totally just say
it in like five words you know what I
mean totally totally and like have it be
like a hook like like that right like
what do you mean med school in a weekend
like IM totally totally impossible no

[1:19:01]
like IM totally totally impossible no
what do you mean med school is four
years totally four hour surgeon four
hour surgeon four hour surgeon all right
are you the med school in a weekend guy
yeah exactly hell yeah Hy you you look
like med school on the weekend and I
mean that as a compliment thank you so
this is just like a half bed idea I just
saw your live and it just came up
something we are here for half aake
ideas for Half Baked
ideas okay so yeah I'm a finally a
medical student so the the idea is like
right now A lot of people are hyped
about hubman optimization running
clubs peptides stem cells everything all
the good things so but not everyone like
understands like the basic like
physiology and Anatomy about all the
things so the idea is to create like a
course called med school in a weekend
where I just go through the whole med

[1:20:01]
where I just go through the whole med
school curriculum very basic very simple
so people can like get an idea what
everyone is talking about like so you
understand what hman is actually saying
in three and a half hours oh super
interesting yeah this is a lock for me
it's a lock dude yeah this
ising look up [ __ ] background you don't
see our screens right now but we're all
doing research yeah this is a lock this
is a lock and a half so so the thing
is I have to think about how to get like
traffic to the site so essentially I
thinking in the beginning I need some
like probably need some testimonials for
like some repal people in the beginning
maybe the codes the
Gregs this is a social play so this is a
social clip play of like you have some
hook and use hubman I would just you
literally show huberman like hubman said
this on the last podcast right and it's

[1:21:00]
this on the last podcast right and it's
like some [ __ ] art you know esoteric
[ __ ] that nobody knows what it is
and coming exactly exactly and then
you're like you're like let me know like
like uh like let me let me explain to
you in plain English what this is and
then it's like boom you just go into it
or like I would probably you need to
probably add some social proof there so
it' be like I'm I'm a fifth year med
student let me explain to you what this
means boom and then it drops right into
that and then that's top of funnel and
then you just lead them into you know
it's the classic you know Community to
you know whatever whatever Greg's
Playbook is now to like drip them down
into to uh to this thing I me you could
probably just send them right to the
course and then run remarketing and that
type of thing but what your guys
thoughts yeah I think uh yeah audience
Community product right it's simple
short form top um I think that the name
itself is VI is just viral like it it it
it creates curiosity and Intrigue so
somehow the domain's available so get it
someone I said a domain that was
available before and someone took it I
think so get it like right now I don't

[1:22:00]
think so get it like right now I don't
know why you're listening to us right
now like I have my assistant right
brother oh you have an assistant
literally by the domain like right now
some [ __ ] will go do it it's there's
too many people here not did that on
this it's probably happening right now I
know I know I was like don't do this
yeah so rules exactly yeah I think uh
what what are you GNA charge for
something like this yeah that's the
question my my now I'm just ripping
right now so I'm thinking we know you're
ripping we've known you for two minutes
you have you have nothing but a domain
now yeah let's go so so I'm thinking
like you can begin like lower in the
market start with like Twitter Instagram
Etc then you can take that as a lower
tier course I don't know like $49 or
something then you can buy up some
traction more way more five $4.99 at
least
start with that you know how much med
school costs B one I live I live in

[1:23:00]
school costs B one I live I live in
Denmark it's free no what do you mean no
no you live in New York City now and med
school cost
$400,000 yeah okay and that's on the
website you put med school for you know
Columbia University $400,000 with a bar
chart and then you say med school 499.99
yeah but but the Years start with like
yeah maybe go higher in price and then
and you can use there will be more trust
sorry this is a psychological thing the
higher the price the course is hell yeah
I love carlburg you got green cans right
now let's go um yeah the higher the
price is the more trust is built into it
so if you actually go lower it's going
to negatively affect the sales that you
get like every course I've ever helped
people sell I don't sell courses because
it's a rule um but every course that
I've ever helped people sell uh it we've
increased price and only seing
conversion increase over time so it's
it's you can start at a course maybe
higher price and then when you build up

[1:24:00]
higher price and then when you build up
some traction you can do another course
a bit more advanced and you consider to
like people who are Premed nurses Pas
people who want to med school or nursing
school and then you can build up some
traction there get some testimonials and
then try to roll out to high schools
maybe I Consulting for this company
forever ago um they did like
certifications like career
certifications um dude they printed
money and it was literally just an
online course business like they had to
get actual CER you know CER like
certified at a government level um but a
lot of the times if you're a
practitioner you can go and get that
super easily like that that we're going
to teach this course and this is a cuu
or whatever but like it was a
requirement to get into nursing school
right and then all they did was just a
Content play for like top a funnel down
into this like you're this company you
know the first version is you sell
through this hubman thing we're talking
about but it probably evolves into that
where it's like oh this is a career
certification for the medical industry
type of company right um yeah I mean
that's that that there is like a 50
million to100 million a year business

[1:25:02]
million to100 million a year business
when you get it when you get it get out
of here get out of
here you you've got one want in I can I
can send it to you the first version Oh
I would love to see it we love we love
when people actually ship on this stuff
the time nobody does anything so don't
don't be an idea guy be a product guy
entrepreneur even though I have one in
my
Name by
entrepreneur all right man get out of
here go build get you and your
assistant get your who is this guy it's
his brother my brother yeah we have the
same name
almost amazing per are you in mid school
too I go to law
school even better weekend I mean what
are we
doing franchise dude Law School in a
weekend is so such a good idea pay for
business law school in a weekend totally

[1:26:01]
business law school in a weekend totally
all of us Entre I literally have a
business law book that's sitting in my
library and like I haven't touched it in
three years and like it's the [ __ ]
most dense [ __ ] ever just tell me the
[ __ ] exploits I can use in business
like that's all I want yeah let's go
thank you guys later yeah good luck man
nice to meet you
guys all right we uh we're gonna do one
more we do one more one last [ __ ] that's
such a good idea fck that was a good
that was a good one he's good I like the
energy I like that young energy too that
was cool the assistant just brother yeah
lawyer Love
It O Henry in the
house oh awesome I was literally working
and this is the first live one I
listened to I was like oh [ __ ] I'll see
if I can get on deck and you're
here sweet um so my idea i' started
started working on this a little bit
before I got derailed is um I have been
watching a whole bunch of people I know

[1:27:00]
watching a whole bunch of people I know
go through retirement so my dad
is tell me what it is I'll tell you how
to sell it I'm already in all right all
right all right so uh my parents
relatively low income I'm the first one
for my family to go through college and
all that and I've been watching my
parents go through retirement and it's a
total [ __ ] show now I'm in banking and
finance and you know my buddy who got me
in is turning 65 he's retiring in
through three weeks he was telling me
it's been a total [ __ ] show for him and
you know he makes six figures good money
so like okay this is [ __ ] the
American retirement system is just
totally backwards so I started playing
around on this idea of a retirement
concierge um is all the white color jobs
are getting replaced with AI so I was
training a chatbot in chat GPT and I was
able to replicate the advice that my
banker friend and my par parents were
getting that they are paying 2 3K for
meeting with retirement advisers and you

[1:28:00]
meeting with retirement advisers and you
know I could do it in 8 minutes sticking
around and chat GPT with a bot that I
had built what would they call that
retirement planning like what how would
somebody search for this online like our
name so when you look for retirement
Finance advice really you're kind of
going against Forbes
Investopedia things of that
nature um there is sorry guys I haven't
worked on this in like a month so I'm
not Super Fresh perfect
um there there is um Medicare cones
something like that that is what could
really print but I think you do need to
have licensed Medicare people on your
team Medicare agent I did Consulting for
a company that was a CRM for Medicare
agents you do it's kind of a [ __ ] it's
also just you're [ __ ] with the
government it sucks I would not do it
again yeah
um so that was kind of that was one of
the ideas of what you could Branch into
but the the starting MVP would be this

[1:29:00]
but the the starting MVP would be this
retirement coner so create a bunch of
content around retirement is your free
lead magnet although that's kind of hard
with Google's latest
update but you know uh let's call it a
100 bucks 120 bucks a year for people
it's like 10 bucks a month for people
turning
65 and it'll run you through the a toz
of retirement I had it print out
retirement plans kind of check that with
people I know
you know you'll go through your assets
and it'll kind of like it's not supposed
to advise you they say chat GPT cannot
give you Financial advice but it totally
will so I can get it to work you can get
llama to do this too if you just like an
open source model will 100% do this as
well so that's what I thought yeah all
right I'm looking at keywords right now
like retirement or dentist retirement
planning retirement income planning
Orlando like there's just thousands of
these keywords related to this yeah if I
were you I would be building like
dentist retirement
a.com yeah you know doctor retirement

[1:30:02]
a.com yeah you know doctor retirement
ai.com
lawyer I think he's trying to go broader
though those people that can't afford a
r like a traditional um a traditional
like Financial what what they call this
person a retirement would it be a
financial adviser like how would
somebody search this right yeah yeah
that that's kind of what I'm struggling
with is for so many people it is the
financial aspect but it will give you
legal advice it will give you medical
advice just as good as basically 80
retirement planning that looks like it's
what it is um here hold on I can give
you the keyword volume give me one
second uh I wonder if you start like
even like younger when you're like
buying life
insurance yeah so it's a cross sell
that's happening at the agent level
because then you can use them they're
like an affiliate then they're all
they're already used to selling these
packages too that's all they do that's
how they which sucks that's the only
problem yeah you know I think you can do
kind of like an affiliate thing like
okay you're through this step now you're
at the choose your Medicare provider

[1:31:01]
at the choose your Medicare provider
affiliate linkout to the top rated
people um things of that nature oh you
need oh so it's a lead gen tool for yeah
you could do that
um I had it given very advice you think
so that Community like it's plus 60 to
65 and uh I mean I I ran these ads
before they're so cheap and they'll
click on anything it's insane um and
then just do like a conversion campaign
to them like this is totally exp like
exploiting them but 100% um it can't be
an app that will have trouble installing
it it'll have to be like some type of
form that they fill out on on mobile um
and then that leads them kind of down
into it I don't know how you do that
honestly what I would probably do oh
this would be super interesting is like
get it into a like a text then it's like
a text message thing and uh just use
like twillo and that's how it initially
happens so it's like they fill I was
just looking at automations yesterday
100% um and then they can text the

[1:32:01]
100% um and then they can text the
advisor like questions and [ __ ] um I was
Pitch my friend's probably G to build
this new company and it's basically that
but uh for like a nutrition uh for like
nutrition coaching I think it was
actually after the call we had like two
weeks ago Greg or whatever um but uh
he's going to just do it over text
message because that's how everybody
wants to interact with this like they
don't want to like it's just like a
something that's built into every phone
right so do you have to get consent for
that because I thought there were some
laws around Robo messaging no so if they
fill out the form it can be a
notification message like hey thanks for
signing up for blah blah blah like you
can text this number back at any point
with questions and like your digital
financial advisor you know digital
retirement adviser will help like work
with you or whatever um I don't know the
financial regulation laws around this so
that's the only thing um like the
compliance piece what is it finra I
can't remember that yeah do your own
research on that I think that you guys
remember Miss
Cleo

[1:33:00]
Cleo
no okay Miss
Cleo was a she made tens of millions of
dollars and what she did was
she she did advertisements like 1 1800
number for tarot card readings oh [ __ ] I
do remember this okay so I wonder if
there's an opportunity to create like
the Miss Cleo for retirement using your
idea Cody of like if texting is the new
1800 number like the mental model they
understand and you're like what does
that look like and you create these like
videos around it and it's just a
character that might connect a little
more than just like retire.com
I think
that's and then it's just a sign up form
I would do Facebook ads again to 60 to
64 probably um I can tell you how many
people are in the US actually that are
with that yes give me give me the info
yeah yeah yeah that's why you're here
Henry that's right you're here for the

[1:34:02]
Henry that's right you're here for the
info yeah I got it to work phenomenally
well and I was thinking about building
traffic through topical Authority but
then you know with the last like Google
update it's like okay you're just going
to get crushed by Forbes Investopedia so
I think yeah marketing directly to that
demographic if you're an app though like
if you're a legitimate business you can
can do well in these spaces still going
after longtail keywords but it's like
have a public business profile like some
type of physical address that's how
we're kind of hacking this right now is
like make like make it real companies
still rank with SEO content like at
scale is what we're seeing like being
kind of filter but Greg probably more
data on that too is it's not to like you
know kind of grift off that age group is
that they do have a little bit of money
but it's to help them just get that
information without all the [ __ ]
like I was having it make legal forms
like that power of attorney
easy there's five to six million people

[1:35:01]
easy there's five to six million people
in the US between the age of 60 and 64
you can Target on Facebook right now and
I bet you could
do I mean I would just run a lead form
you could probably spin up a WordPress
website with like sign up to get free I
don't know some some type of I don't
know what the offer would be on that um
because they're probably hesitant on AI
I wouldn't even call it AI I would call
it I think what you're saying the
concierge that that positioning is super
good um like maybe it's like financial
planning concierge like something like
that I had like 10 AI names I just I
threw them all in the [ __ ] trash I
was like people everyone who's over 60
is terrified of it but they would
benefit tremendously from it it's just a
PR dad in the bunker already I mean he's
like he's down there um and then another
marketing channel I was thinking of
would be affiliate marketing with
Millennials giving them like a lifetime
Rev share if they sign their parents up
you know every kid out there is like
Jesus Christ dad let me just help you
with this your parents never let you

[1:36:01]
with this your parents never let you
just you know like I don't know we're
all in our late 30s early 40s or
whatever you know you could walk your
parents through this and you could get
affiliate income from them being signed
up and then eventually work towards like
Tax Services I I find that a bit weird
personally but it might
work has no one else been in that
position where your parents are
struggling with someone like something
technically and then you
got account with your parents it's like
you know Mom sign up to this you know
with this link it's you're gonna love
it I mean you know with Bitcoin the
printer but I've seen her do [ __ ] on
Facebook that's insane like I stuff I
don't even know and I do this for a
[Laughter]
living or okay man I think the concierge
the retire like calling it something
like retirement concierge that domain is
available but it's 15 grand that's not
crazy that's not crazy I would do a
variation of that and then you buy that

[1:37:01]
variation of that and then you buy that
so I bought retirees do online just to
start I I would get get a. get a
variation of that doc because all that
age demo has a really like their trust
is built into do domains totally um and
then I would buy that domain as time
goes on so you like do like you know uh
I don't want to actually give this away
but like retire retirement coner app.com
or retirement concierge you know like
something like that um and then you you
can always go and buy that domain like
nobody's gonna go spend 15 grand right
now on this thing you know if you're
gonna do the uh the Miss Cleo thing it's
like Johnny the retirement concierge.com
it's great yeah so it's like a name yeah
like John the coner yeah some name that
fits that Boomer demo that they're like
I know a John I trust a John you know
like whatever that is that like here
let's look it up actually what's the
most trustworthy boo Boomer name I'll
have perplexity write them up for
us um what do you guys think about

[1:38:00]
us um what do you guys think about
productizing and service like that
because I would love to put like lots of
free information out there just like the
the [ __ ] that you want to Google as
you're coming up to retirement that is
so hard I want there to be free
information um but like what do you guys
think is a fair price point for
basically aggregating this information
and pointing them in the right
directions when I'm doing app [ __ ] like
this I do free info that leads into some
type of service that's like a repeat
purchase because the customer lifetime
value is insane on this right like great
great company that does this is like
flow the period tracking app I think
they do like ovulation and all stuff too
but they they put out like a ton of free
content like it's actually an
unbelievable like resource um but all
that leads into is like they're just
selling you you know a subscription to
this $10 app or whatever um I think that
that to me that's that's the angle where
it's like okay you help a ton of people
and then
simultaneously you are also uh you know
creating that sustainability with the
the cash flow but here's what the other
guys
think
okay and yeah Greg I get what you're

[1:39:00]
okay and yeah Greg I get what you're
saying with the name that kind of
reminds me of um oh my God uh marketing
Secrets book [ __ ] guy out of Idaho I
can't remember his name but you know
creating that charismatic character for
them to align with yeah these are people
who need a character you know the they
need a character and it's going to the
dot com's going to go away away like
it's going to go a long way
the character is going to it also just
gives you opportunity to create
interesting content and interesting
creative around it um so I think that's
that's the play and then yeah in terms
of like pricing it I
think it you know these are customers
that could last 20 30 40 years right so
it's just really about getting them in
the system and then getting you know
they don't churn too because they don't
know how
to so like once you're in their clv is
crazy I got the most how do you think
good oh good how do you think a customer
like that would stay if the if it's to
get them through retirement A to Z and

[1:40:00]
get them through retirement A to Z and
then they hit retirement what is the
appeal of saing staying with the service
like that I think there's still
financial planning right like I
throughout that whole period and like
maybe checkups or I I don't know well
think about it you know Market goes down
10% and you know what does that mean for
me you know I think that the whole goal
is you you're going to build retirement
with Johnny retirement concierge.com
over this 10 years and it's like great
congrats you've now graduated from
Johnny the retirement concierge to like
I'm Johnny your homie and you have any
question about Finance this that or the
other like I'm here for you and you've
already pluged into their Fidelity and
it's like yo don't
worry the market will correct just send
them inspirational quotes all right
here's the most uh trustworthy Boomer
names for you Michael James William
Robert and John based off of all the
data that we I just
scraped you know it's funny the old uh

[1:41:02]
scraped you know it's funny the old uh
kind of Rich Banker guy that I sat down
and shot this idea with his name is
Michael and he's retiring in two weeks
so I might try to make him my avatar for
this business because I know he's going
to be bored as hell uh in the baby
boomer generation 833 th000 men were
named
Michael very
original uh I feel like William could
rip to it means Resolute
protector seven most popular Boomer name
I kind of like
Jeffrey Jeffrey could be cool too
Jeffrey yeah isn't it the butler yeah
exactly I'm thinking like ashes meets
miss it needs to be above the butler
though right like mentally it needs to
be it needs to be like oh my I would
trust my banker right so like it needs
to be at that level because like a
Jeffrey you're like oh [ __ ] do I want
him touching my
finances I don't know maybe I'm wrong
but I'm just thinking about brand is so
I'm I'm broke as [ __ ] I have a disabled
wife and two young young kids um what is

[1:42:03]
wife and two young young kids um what is
a way I could try to make this generate
quickly would it be like a paid weit
list kind of like a quiz like are you
ready prod service producti service for
sure um I would like that exact same
marketing strategy we were talking about
sending to that landing page and then
like what you just did for your dad how
do you turn that into like a Playbook
that you can run with these people um I
don't know what the pricing would be
need to be Pro like for it to be even
worth it for you it's probably 500 bucks
and then it's like they have like a you
have an add-on Subscription Service
where it's like you know if you hundred
bucks a month if you want to continue to
do this and then you whatever you build
you turn that into a piece of software
um yeah damn I was thinking like $10 a
month to make 120 a year but no man I
would I would way more ESP there's a
trust Factor that's built into it right
like the higher you price it the more
trust is going to be built into it it's
finding that it's finding that Tipping
Point of like what the average person
can afford and what is you know it's
like basically that threshold of what

[1:43:00]
like basically that threshold of what
they'll pay um but like the higher you
can go the more trust there will be
probably with something like this so and
that's true like with my parents example
you know they paid you know two grand
and they had to wait like a month to get
a response and I just basically did that
same thing in parallel and got the
response in eight minutes yeah totally
totally I mean okay so so you said they
charge two grand so charge 20% of that
so that's
400 yep and then do the digital version
of it I would start local where you
based out of like out of Seattle Seattle
work that's a big enough demo I would go
there locally um because then it's like
they're like oh like and I would I would
emphasize that like we you know it's
like local this is Seattle you know I
just I just do this digitally because
you can tap into that and then there'll
be a rollover effect into the greater
Washington area you hit Spokane you know
you go down to Portland you go to Boise
Etc um so give them the full service for
500 basically like whatever the
retirement questions are yeah something

[1:44:02]
retirement questions are yeah something
like that I think that could be I don't
know the regulation on it that's the
only thing like you probably need to be
uh a certified financial adviser you
sound really [ __ ] smart though I've
seen people test for this in like two
weeks just by
cramming um so that could be a way to do
it it's like literally just a test you
have to do that's that's all it takes
financial advisor in a weekend straight
up yeah that's franchise awesome or I
could partner with someone right because
I know some financial advisers yep you
could run it and they sign off on it I
mean that could be the other side of
this is the done for you service so
you're the back end of these companies
you go scrape every financial advisor in
the US and then you're like yo we will
do Financial plans for you for $199 a
piece they already have the the inbound
they're charging 2K they you know pay
you 200 and they get a report back
that's standardized that they then pass
off to their client I mean that's that's
the be way easier to do that by the way
probably way easier to do that and
honestly that's a really [ __ ] good
company so careful it can we back up 10

[1:45:03]
company so careful it can we back up 10
10 seconds what was that
Greg no I just said I just said that I
would like if I were you it's way more
difficult to do what you to build retire
ease and build a brand and build you
know there's so much there's so many
unknowns with with actually just working
direct with financial advisers and being
like hey I'm going to make your job a
lot easier you're already producing
these reports I'm going to do it at 4%
of the cost and I'm going to charge you
like you're going to save money by doing
this and I'm going to be your AI partner
to to create beautiful
looking AI assisted Financial reports
and your clients are going to love it
and they're going to stay longer and you
and you just charge for it that to me
is way
easier okay I'm I'm going to go
basically [ __ ] off the rest of my
workday and workshop that as well
