the world's strongest prison is right
between your two years ooh
guys we just finished an awesome
conversation with a personal hero of
mine apollo ono greg what'd you have on
it
usually we talk about startup trends
where the world's going
startup ideas this hit absolutely
different we talked about
life lessons we talked about
happiness we talked about
so much that don't i think doesn't get
talked enough about
totally true we also talked about a
personal passion project of mine we are
going to buy the x games so wag bxg
you're gonna love it let's just dive
right in
greg why do you
look so tired i look so tired because i
did not sleep last night have you never
slept well or is this a new thing
it's not that i can't fall asleep i fall
asleep
like right away but i wake up a couple

[01:01]
like right away but i wake up a couple
hours later
and i'm just sitting in my bed and i
look at the ceiling and i can't fall
back to sleep and i don't know what to
do so i was literally you and for the
longest time
i was this like hustle culture bro
sleep when i'm dead
didn't want to sleep didn't care about
my sleep and then i honestly i started
reading more of the research and
realizing how impactful sleep is to your
longevity to your health all of these
other things and as part of that i found
ate sleep which has completely
revolutionized the way i sleep i've
heard of eight sleep can you tell me
more about it think of it as like the
future of sleep all of these mattress
companies have created these mattresses
they're just stuck they're stock
mattresses eight sleep is technology
plus sleep combined so the whole product
is built around optimizing the
temperature that you sleep at and so you
read about sleeping cold is the key to
sleeping and it's not quite true
everyone has a different optimal sleep
temperature and it changes throughout
the night which is the crazy part about

[02:00]
the night which is the crazy part about
it so you might need really cold to fall
asleep and then you might need it to be
a little bit warmer to keep you asleep
and the eight sleep actually transitions
your temperature through the night to
keep you at the optimal sleep sleep
temperature at any point during the
night it keeps you asleep it helps you
fall asleep faster and i actually since
i started using it have been sleeping
better and feeling so much more
energized during the day as a result
sounds like i need a nate sleep i think
everyone needs innate sleep
so if you're tuning in right now and you
want to try out the eight sleep to
completely change the way you sleep rest

all of life's challenges check out

and use code the room at checkout what's
going on man
not much uh
what there's a bunch of [ __ ] i want to
talk about today so i kind of just want
to dive right into it but i saw this
really cool thing the other day
this i think it was the wall street
journal there was this article about
chess and ever since queen's gambit on
netflix i've been like sort of into
chess and um
it was this article about magnus carlsen
who's like the most legendary i think
now considered the most legendary chess
player of all time
and um it's about his like new nemesis

[04:00]
and um it's about his like new nemesis
who like right now i think as we speak
they're playing in dubai and the like
world chess championship it's like a
best of 13 or something series and they
keep facing off um and the cool thing
about the story and like the human
interest side of it was that this guy
ian nepo something it's a very
complicated last name uh
was
basically a prodigy like he served as
the second they call it for magnus
carlsen like seven years ago at this
event which is the person that basically
like shadows you and kind of like plays
the opposing role to you and so it's
like at the time people were saying oh
wow this is kind of crazy uh magnus
carlsen's using this guy like this guy
might end up being one of the best
players in the world he might have to
face off against him and then it would
have been an advantage and now like
seven years later they're literally
facing off against each other in the
championship and this guy apparently is
like the best chance at taking down
magnus carlson that has happened in the
last like 10 you know 15 15 years
whatever since this guy's been around
that's insane so it's kind of cool it's
like a um it's this cool story of like

[05:01]
like a um it's this cool story of like
something actually coming to fruition
and like the prodigy like is actually
coming and going to take down the mentor
the student has become the teacher yeah
it's kind of cool so i was like
reflecting on it and
one of the things i was reflecting on
with it was like why do i even give a
[ __ ] about chess i had never played
chess
that was my next question well yeah i
like never played growing up really i
dabble but queen's gambit was my
connection point to chess it was during
covid
yeah queen's game but if you haven't
seen it as like this show on netflix
freaking amazing it was so good so
engaging and when i looked it up to do
some research for this episode i saw
that like chess uh
play and chess purchases skyrocketed
after queen's gambit hit and so it was
this very cool example to me of like
culture um and media driving some like
esoteric
uh nuanced niche sport
or
game or whatever it is into mainstream
and that got me thinking about an idea

[06:01]
and that got me thinking about an idea
that i want to talk more about
and that idea is i want to buy the x
games
i like where this is headed
so
just to set the stage for anyone that
doesn't know the x games were an extreme
sports event
not dissimilar to the olympics um there
was like a winter and a summer started
by i think by espn in like 1995
providence rhode island was the first x
games um and became a
kind of a mainstay like for the 2000s
when i was a kid the x games were kind
of dope like yeah the winter x games
sean white was like the big guy
snowboarder red hair um you had you know
like the tony hawks of the world and the
skateboarding on the x games it was a
big deal it was a big thing um
and then somewhere along the line in
like the 2010s and beyond it started to
languish and
it declined i don't know whether actual
uh
participation in the sports declined or
whether just espn and disney after they
acquired espn did just a poor job kind
of amplifying um the games or what it

[07:00]
of amplifying um the games or what it
was but somewhere along the line it
started to decline and it's not like
extreme sports declined it was just i
don't think i don't think that was the
case i don't think so i mean i'm on the
board of some companies in the space and
it's been like gdp growth low
single-digit growth generally speaking
in these extreme sports but fervent
you're a community guy fervent
communities people just love the sports
are very very into it um and so it got
me thinking about the x games and what's
going on with them and so i did some
research turns out espn last year
said they were trying to sell them
they're prioritizing streaming and other
things at the disney level and so espn
is trying to rid themselves of this
originally they wanted 100 million
dollars and they were going to keep
producing it no one took them up on it
and so then they were offering the x
games you could buy all of the ip of the
x games for 50 million dollars
and
i want to go buy it
and i'm very i'm quite quite serious
about it and i want to like i want you
to tell me why i'm being dumb or why
this isn't going to work so my vision

[08:00]
this isn't going to work so my vision
for the x games
is
you go and you create
a cultural moment so like what did
queen's gamut do so well with chess what
did drive to survive the formula one do
so well that vaulted formula one it was
that they created a personality a face
that actually went with these sports um
drive to survive previously it was
watching a car on a track and it was
like you're just driving around all of a
sudden you watch drive to survive and
you know the faces of all these athletes
suddenly i'm looking and it's like
that's not just a car that's lewis
hamilton that's max verstappen
and that completely changed the game
formula one viewership through the roof
now in america as a result crazy
why can't you do that exact same thing
with the x games amazing personalities
with big cult social followings good
looking people in general that are very
athletic and working on really cool
things you have the base of this fervent
community
all you need to do is suddenly like
expand that with a cultural moment and i
think you could do that by creating one

[09:01]
think you could do that by creating one
of these like kind of follow along like
rags to riches type stories where you're
following people and the personalities
and you create these personalities and
this tension that then you can play off
of in the games
so much i love about this
sometimes i like to just disagree with
you on please do
but it's hard to on this one
i think like the question for me really
is like beyond the content production of
hey let's let's commemorate these people
and create these moments
um
what else is different
in in in this new version of the x game
so for me like what what i would do
is
i would
web 3ify the x the x games right like
give people a vote
um
let's do this let's do this exercise
this is a great i love that you went
this direction i hadn't thought of this
i was thinking like
you just go do the x games in a new way
with this culture moment let's do the

[10:01]
with this culture moment let's do the
what is web 3 x game what does the web 3
future of the x games look like
well i think the first is to your point
you start with the
the athlete
and
you
reward the top 1000
[Music]
fans of each athlete with an airdropped
nft or token
and that token gives you you know
certain access and and
you could vote on where this person can
go or what they can do you can go to
different events i think like i love the
idea of like if there's 5 000
athletes
um on
on the x games like f they should be
throwing there should be an event every
single day that these athletes are
throwing and that are bringing like
local communities together it shouldn't
be that these athletes
play just for one week in
this the summer and the winter but that

[11:00]
this the summer and the winter but that
they're like like musicians they're
touring you know two-thirds of the year
and i think
with your idea around content and
creating content which are just
essentially excuses to talk about things
and web 3's ability to reward
fans and give them certain levels of
access and and voting
i think that
you know
that version of the x games is
yeah interesting yeah so what you're
hitting on is
super interesting which is
when you go and do this
the x games ip doesn't give you access
to the athletes you need to give the
best athletes in these extreme sports a
reason to be a part of this and so part
of the whole pitch i think web 3
actually creates a really good pitch
here which is we're going to give the
athletes and we're going to prioritize
the athletes with
immense
tools to become monetizable in a much
deeper way and to create way more access
and we're going to build ip around you
as an athlete that we know is going to

[12:01]
as an athlete that we know is going to
expand the value of the x games and the
property we're building but it's going
to arm you with ways to monetize that
you never previously had you have big
social followings now we're going to
give you arm you with ways to leverage
nfts for specific access to events to
amas to different things you know super
fandom around you we're going to go
we're going to go do
an interesting like series tour rather
than just having it be a summer and a
winter games where it's like so event
driven and it's a couple of weeks we're
gonna make it a much longer thing we're
gonna do this show around it maybe
there's nft access to the show where you
now have uh people that are kind of
directing and pitting matchups within it
so that it's like creating and stoking
intrigue the same way
conor mcgregor kind of created um you
know ufc in a big way i mean actually
ufc is a great case study of this
because i've seen an interview with dana
white where
i was just talking to my friend who
launched the xfl sam schwarz dean as his
name he was at stanford with me and he

[13:00]
name he was at stanford with me and he
launched the xfl it unfortunately fell
apart due to covid but it was an
incredible case study of going and
trying to do something innovative he was
telling me the story about dana white
and dana white talks about basically ufc
was on its last dollar and they threw a
hail mary and that hail mary was the
like ultimate fighter series thing that
they did where it was like a
reality show of trying to make it to the
octagon and like go make it to the top
and that was fundamentally like going
and doing something that kind of
created personalities and created a vibe
around it and we're going to go do that
for these athletes it's going to create
immense value for them and make the
games much more valuable also make these
athletes much more valuable
the other layer to this which i have to
say
is i think we should form a dow to go
buy the x games right and
it would be the first time that like a
large uh
games property ip was owned by a
government you know collective body and
a community and it would be so cool

[14:02]
a community and it would be so cool
because the games themselves and the
sports
have such amazing communities
and so to be able to involve the
communities in the decision making
around what these games look like what
these properties media properties look
like what the web theorification looks
like it would be such a cool example and
case study and like constitution dab
just went raise 40 or something like
that to go try to buy the constitutions
a piece of paper
no utility to it the x games that's like
real utili i mean there's an event
there's things you can go to there's
like real business value to that and so
i'm staring at it like we should we
should go form a dow to go buy the x
games yeah i think uh what i like about
this idea is there's
there's
so much
trust that's been built between athletes
and viewers already and the communities
exist and it's just about
like you mentioned kind of like stoking
the you know giving the tools or arming
the rebels for athletes and it's also

[15:02]
the rebels for athletes and it's also
about arming
the the audience like it's give you know
supercharging the audience so that they
could
be more involved and get involved so
um i like this idea
i also it gets me thinking about like
will traditional sports leagues like the
nfl and hl mlb
start embracing web3
or
will there have to be
or will there be like dao's buying
the xfl the x games whatever or
will there be
like brand new web 3
sports leagues and esports leagues that
come out and we're starting to see this
i think there's one i forget the name
and esports
um
i think uh that's the question and i
believe that
we're probably like number three and
number two are more likely to happen
yeah it's an interesting question
because
um sports are a great place for this to
happen because fundamentally the

[16:01]
happen because fundamentally the
community is creating the value and it's
like green bay packers what is the value
of the green bay packers but for the
incredible fandom that's built around it
and when i think about the x games
that's what i think about that's why i'm
so excited about this idea honestly and
i want to do it i'm actually being
fairly serious about i don't think 50
million dollars is actually i don't know
whether it's a dow or if you go pitch an
investment fund on going and doing it
and going doing it but if i can't get
excitement around a dow i don't know
what i can get excitement around um and
so i'm actually pretty serious like wag
bxg wag bxg we're gonna buy the x games
that's what i'm coining um but we should
bring in our guest to talk about this
because our guest today
is this is crazy for me he's like
someone that he's like your hero well i
hero i don't know maybe it's a strong
word i've looked up to him for a long
time grew up watching him um compete win
at the highest level two olympic games
you look up to yeah i think he's amazing
um and i've recently connected with him
in this new life context and we've

[17:00]
in this new life context and we've
become friends and that's crazy to me
yeah that like how the world like the
universe and the way this has all come
together and now we get to sit down with
him and chat absolutely we're gonna
bring in our guests apollo ono and we're
looking forward to the conversation
we're gonna buy the x games first time
that uh we've interviewed someone with
multiple gold medals yeah first time
maybe the last i don't know we might get
michael phelps on the show but for now
most gold medals ever won on the where
it happens show so enjoy it wag bxg
did you guys go to the yacht party
yesterday no i heard about it though it
was like a lesson in marshall yeah so
dude i just left before they even
performed yeah and then someone was like
asking someone's asking me they're like
why would you do that and i was like
that's a good question and then like i
came to the realization i was like i
just i personally don't really care yeah
exactly i understand music i love
marshmallow i've done events with him
before um
you know like i love alesso i've done
stuff with him in the past but
i guess like you know when we have like

[18:01]
i guess like you know when we have like
different career paths or different
things that are what we believe to be
important those times yeah we then like
carve out time necessary you're also
able to make better decisions around
stuff like that when you're sober so
like the fact that you don't drink i
actually think helps i'm making a bad
decision while i'm sober imagine if i
wasn't yeah like seriously i mean like i
have a really tough time
making a decision to leave something and
like
make that trade-off when i'm like past
the point of being a bit drunk like i
just that's when i'm like someone comes
up and says like oh come on it's
marshmallow and i realized
later i'm like i don't care that
marshmallow's here i don't even know who
that is right that's it that's my my
take is that
there's so much noise out there and that
there's like i see people on twitter
saying like i need to be an art pass i
need to be arpes so it's like
you don't actually like you might have a
really good time at arbazel and that
like it might be super fun
but like from like a
career
business perspective
my take right now is that
new world that we live in like just go

[19:00]
new world that we live in like just go
and build the thing that you're building
be in the discord just yeah like
it's probably more alpha yeah and like
get a good night's sleep yeah i do think
i mean like when you're first trying to
get into it immersing yourself in it in
a few different ways like i had never
really spent time in the like crypto nft
web 3 world until nft week and i spent
that whole week going to events
and that was the first time i was just
like i was just holy [ __ ] man like
there's the the techno optimism of it
the like positive sum mentality of
people all being together and all of the
like cool things that were being built
and just like the
wild [ __ ] that was happening around it i
found amazing i just thought it was so
cool to see
um and so for me that was like
that was definitely worth it the second
it's diminishing returns right the
second set of events you're like this
week i'm not quite as motivated to go to
the full slate that i went to that week
that's awesome that you feel like um
it's a good perspective well because i'm
gonna see the same people for the most
part right to your point the same people
one thing i want to add

[20:01]
one thing i want to add
because bob back just my friend just
walked in one of the reasons i
left that party was
it was like one of those like big lines
guest list
bouncers yeah and like i had a plus one
but they didn't honor my plus one very
la new york yeah exactly and honor my
plus one so my friend couldn't get
inside i heard he was very strict very
strict and like i kind of don't want to
be in the like i don't want to be in
that room
straight up i actually do not want to be
in that room because you don't believe
that
like exclusivity unnecessary i don't
like that vibe like i don't know it's
something i guess i grew up with like i
just don't
i don't like the vibe where it's like
there's some people
who are excluded i don't like that
exclusionary vibe where they make a line
for no like no reason
yeah yeah
that's interesting yeah it's interesting

[21:00]
that's interesting yeah it's interesting
it's also web like crypto and web like
it's i personally i think of it as like
open access meritocracy borderless
anyone can do it a kid on the streets in
india has the same access to that
discord channel as
a kid growing up in greenwich going to a
country club i keep using that example
but it's very true and so then when you
like stick a line in front of something
and it's like guest list oh you're not
on this list you can't come in it
actually does feel
anti the ethos of what we're all here
for and what we're trying to build
that's why i like fwb
so they're throwing a party tonight
except the party is you just need at
five fwb right what is that how much
does that cost what is five fpv tokens
now i don't know 50 bucks maybe okay
we're talking you know so it's like
nothing crazy and they allow people to
go and buy it which
versus like hey i'm gonna select who is
on
and this is not a you know i'm not
trying to like
this kygo like i'm sure you know he's a
great guy and like the people who
through the event moon pays like they're
great i love them
i love that team it's not like a knock

[22:01]
i love that team it's not like a knock
on them it's just like a knock on like
yeah the list
like culture yeah yeah
um
so i think we were are we rolling okay
yeah he hit us with the cold open so we
were yeah we're good but i think that's
like very human though yeah
but like so i think
you know like
right now we've got these like layers
right and everyone's like trying to put
these like you've got this bottle of
bottle of like liquids that are like in
chemistry and every like layer is like
labeled something right
and right now it's like all shaken up
everything's mixed up right and over
time that [ __ ] just goes back to normal
right because humans are still operating
in the same kind of
neanderthal like ego based
still chasing the same thing and i think
we like to hide behind this idea that
we're here for maybe a greater purpose
and cause and i do believe that is the
case like if you really zoom out but
still i think in the acute moments we're
still driven by the same things that we
want desire want to reflect upon i mean
it's the same cultural phenomenon that's
existing we're just using different

[23:00]
existing we're just using different
tools to
exemplify what we believe we should be
hiding behind or represent in certain
perspectives i don't know that's that's
my
take i like that unpack there
i agree with you in principle i do think
i think humans are status signaling
monkeys the exact same way we were 10
000 years ago and i think we're seeing a
lot of the new manifestations of that
and i do i agree with you there's like
there's nothing i'm not a particularly
religious person so i don't particularly
believe in like some you know brilliant
afterlife i sort of just believe that
you're here to procreate and you're here
to
hopefully have fun and smile along the
way but that the reality of it is like
your purpose is what you make of it and
if you can you know create and
rationalize a purpose and something that
motivates you and makes you happy then
that's great i like
that's also why i just believe in being
nice to people and i like being around
people who are just like you and i only
recently met but the first time i met
you i was like this is just like i
admired you and looked up to you for a
long time as a kid because of your work
ethic and the things you were doing and
what you were about the things you spoke

[24:01]
what you were about the things you spoke
about and then i met you and i was like
oh this is just as positive a guy as i
hoped and that's not always the case
that you meet people and you you feel
that same way that um they just you want
other people to succeed and you're happy
and you just like that vibe and that
personality i think is infectious and so
it bums me out when you then meet people
and they don't have that or they're kind
of a dick and you're just like why are
you being an [ __ ] we were talking
about this last night with a famous
investor that we all know
it's like why are you a dick there's
absolutely no value to just being an
[ __ ] just be nice to people it
doesn't cost you anything
so anyway it's a weird transition but i
um well i mean the transition i will say
because i don't know you we just met
like a second ago but i will say that
we've done this is our fifth recording
today
and
[Music]
three out of five people
when we've said that you're coming in
they're like oh that guy's such a good
guy that's such a nice guy oh tell him i
say what up yeah you know so

[25:00]
say what up yeah you know so
what you know i feel like
you're leaving a trailer you're leaving
a trail and i feel and i think
well so first nice to meet you nice to
meet you yeah
it's the cold open man i love the cold
open but it is um
this whole thing is very funny to me and
um we're gonna die i swear we're gonna
talk something like interesting life in
business though but the whole i do need
to track the course of this because as i
said i grew up watching you and really
admiring your career and everything you
were about and your work ethic i was
someone that was driving for something
athletically and it was very um
empowering to me to see someone that had
worked at something so hard and your
grind and the effort you put in i
thought was amazing um what i now think
is amazing is we live in a world and
we're doing things where somehow
our paths have crossed and we've
connected and
now i'm sitting here and i'm having this
weird like holy [ __ ] life moment of
someone that i like grew up watching
admiring all of a sudden i can sit have
a conversation with and learn things

[26:00]
a conversation with and learn things
from and be present with and hopefully
other people can listen to it benefit
from it in the same way i felt i did
so there's this crazy thing happening at
least for me in my mind of like the
universe and the way all of this stuff
comes together and so i'm just
personally very grateful and excited to
uh excited to get to chat about tech
business web three
your ethos on life um can we start with
your idea you're talking about
yes i do want to start there i do want
to start there so the way the way the
show works is super casual we just like
to jam on cool things with with friends
and it's not an interview per se but we
want to like go deep on cool topics and
so one thing i was pitching recently and
that greg and i just spent a little time
jamming on
is sort of at the
it's something you're going to
understand because it's at the nexus of
like cultural movements and sports um so
you're familiar with the x games yep
okay so the x games
been around for
now like i don't know what is it 25 plus
years like it's been around since 1995

[27:01]
years like it's been around since 1995
espn owned it for forever
has languished
they haven't you know they've kind of
disney has gone in a different direction
and they're not doing anything with it
last year they basically tried publicly
said they were trying to sell it and so
initially they said it would cost 100
million to buy it
no one wanted it they came down and they
basically said they would take a 50
million dollar offer for the access for
all the ipads
together i want to create a day read my
mind i want to create a dow
to buy the x games you buy all the ip of
the x games and basically completely
reimagine the x games for a
web 3 and crypto enabled world nft
access
special events athlete nfts so that they
can further monetize and have and
capture more of the value that they're
creating with their social presence
video games licensed peak is [ __ ]
like skateboarding video games are rock
and they were so tony hawk pro skater
was so sick so an x games video game i
think would be amazing with all the
different sports

[28:01]
different sports
sell the rights to the broadcast make it
more of like an event series like ufc
rather than just like two times a year
like the olympics which you obviously
participated and know about and just do
so much more with the ip than i think
what disney was able to do and what you
know what espn did um so what do you
think
um
where am i wrong tell me like tell me
why i'm being an idiot about this i
don't think you're being an idiot about
this i think people do the same thing
when they're trying to buy michael
jordan's old house
sean courier those are like
fractionalize that idea i think it was
actually a really interesting i mean in
terms like monetization i think there's
some friction points there i think the
idea in essence is still strong right
like there's still a strong community
that loves extreme sports
um just like people love michael jordan
as do i like had i known about that
opportunity i probably would have
come in much earlier just because i
think it's cool to have like some piece
of history about someone who i looked up
to when i was a kid yeah um
but uh i i think

[29:02]
but uh i i think
so here's an example that i thought of a
long time ago
so i think nbc you know who broadcasts
and buys like they spend billions of
dollars to have the access to the
olympic games to broadcast them
um
i think that those numbers have been
somewhat going down over time because
the cultural shift is changing where i
think the olympics is trying to figure
out where it lives inside this next
generation's like day and is it
important and why is it important i
think that conversation is kind of an
important one but
um something they did was they invested
into snapchat and i i don't know what
the amount was it might have been like
500 million bucks some like absurd
amount of money that i thought it was
crazy
in hopes that that would attract the
next generation of viewers and i thought
i was like well why would they just give
the money to a public company versus
going directly to the creators
themselves
the top top 50 creators in the world
right speak different languages and
saying
we're going to give you all access
rights
we're going to get a whole crew with you
each and you're going to go experience

[30:01]
each and you're going to go experience
an olympics like you've never even
dreamed of doing we only ask that you
broadcast this daily to your fans
right and if they did that how much
would that cost to get 50 people in the
room to give them this incredible
experience the creators themselves would
love to do this because they're always
looking for cool unique pieces of
content
nbc has never had an ability to counter
to directly communicate and engage with
an audience that they feel
really really behind to
so i i thought about that i was like why
would they do that and i just figured
out that like
it's i mean it's obviously much harder
to do but i mean that's what i would
have done so like take that idea
and then instead of going to the
traditional broadcasting rights like go
to the twitches go to the existing
streaming networks and say like hey
let's build like an entire like
worldwide phenomena kind of like what
sean white did with his
kind of like what's called um air and
style i think it's called um and then he
sold it right to a chinese-based company
so like i look at stuff like that and
i'm like this is pretty it's pretty
smart right so you can definitely create
something it may not even have to be the
x games but i think the branding is

[31:01]
x games but i think the branding is
definitely an accelerative tool there uh
i think it's cool man i do think so i
think you're hitting on a lot of the
things i've thought about with it too
which number one i think you need to
reinstall it in culture so you brought
up that kind of culture that shifted
away from it
i see things like
culture is now creating movements around
all of these topics drive to survive
what they did to formula one and
viewership of formula one with that
netflix show the secret sauce of that
was they installed personalities behind
the car so when someone's watching it's
not a car anymore it's lewis hamilton
right or it's max verstappen and you're
watching and now you're like invested in
that guy because you've seen him without
his helmet on and you really see him and
you could do that same thing like an
x-games drive to survive or an x-games
like queen's gambit did it with chess
chess all of a sudden during covet
became this cool thing why not go do
something like that where you install
personalities you played a somewhat
esoteric sport or you competed in an
esoteric sport but you were a huge
personality you weren't probably able to

[32:00]
personality you weren't probably able to
in the way you could today profit from
that as much if you had nfts if you had
all these things that you know could
have provided unique access giving you
the tail of value associated with it
today we live in a world where these
athletes can they have huge social media
followings a lot of like cult community
followings that they could grow and
build from and so you create some sort
of
show or ecosystem whether it's streaming
or something unique that installs
personalities behind it and then on the
back of that give those athletes a way
to monetize it to incentivize them to be
a part of the new x games that we're
creating
and i think you could i mean 50 million
dollars
just doesn't feel like that much to me
for something like this you could
probably go sell the streaming rights to
it for the games and finance part of the
purchase price of it because espn's not
going to do it so you can go do
something with them but i i just have to
believe there's a way with all these new
tools we have to give the athletes a
reason to do it to give fans a reason to
want to come back and be involved in it

[33:00]
want to come back and be involved in it
i'm on the board of an action sports
company
fox racing which is this amazing
motocross mountain bike business and the
community and the fandom around it is
insane people have tattoos of the fox
logo on their bodies like that's a next
level thing you see bumper stickers
tattoos on their cpu you go to the races
and people have like oh yeah check out
my box tattoo and they show it to you
it's nuts and so
if you can channel that that's that's
the
crypto right i mean that's web 3 is
community yeah i mean i think
what we're not talking about here is
that in sports and by the way preface it
i'm like the most
non-sports guy even though i did drain a
couple of three pointers outside he did
that's not on camera but
someone saw it right
today fans don't have the ability to
really have any say in professional
sports like you
like for example like baseball is how
many games like a 162 it's 162. so

[34:01]
many games like a 162 it's 162. so
boring and i bet you if fans had the
ability to vote on that decision maybe
they'd make it 62 instead of 162 or
maybe they'd change it from nine innings
to seven innings i don't know but giving
them the ability to vote
web 3 in a web 3 oriented way
makes a lot of sense to me i think that
the fundamental shift that's happening
is that
people especially younger people
don't want to be passive consumers of
stuff
and that's why i think web3
3 is so interesting from like an
entertainment and community perspective
is if you could
you know actually enable two-way
conversation um
great things could happen have you seen
mad realities have you seen this new
thing yes have you seen this no you'd be
interested in this so it's um
i don't you might have seen it when
clubhouse happened there were these um
group of women out of nyu that did like
nyu
chicks roasting tech bros i think was

[35:01]
chicks roasting tech bros i think was
like the name of it it was this
hilarious thing that went pretty viral
shoot your shot yeah like they would
come up and pitch something and it was
like a dating thing sort of and it was
very funny and they went very viral one
of the women from it who i actually went
to high school with incidentally has
started this company called mad
realities which is the first nft
uh reality
dating show and so anyone you and i can
go buy an nft for a rose and then we can
vote on the outcomes and actually drive
the outcomes of this reality dating show
that they're going to film in new york
and it's kind of a cool version of
exactly what you're saying and the
application of that towards this x games
idea could be cool you can involve fans
in like
who are you staking head to head in some
event because now the personalities
matter and you want your athlete to be
going against someone you can kind of
like pit people head to head i'm i'm
meeting somebody on saturday who's
raising a a series b
basically a fan controlled community
economy around sports that was really
cool invest in it yeah yeah it's it's

[36:00]
cool invest in it yeah yeah it's it's
pretty cool yeah i'm seeing a lot more
of it that's cool and i think that's the
that's the shift right is going from
like one single entity
now saying like
you know creator economy and then now
you know like your fans should be
actually voting and staking based upon
what topics and direction that you guys
are talking about how much time you
spend who you shouldn't do next how you
reach out to that person are they
incentivized to and why i think that's
where the concentration happens out on
sports specifically i think that's going
to happen a lot more i've seen many
iterations of it on the kind of gaming
side so like online kind of gambling
side i've seen a lot of different kind
of conversations around what sports
looks like and how people can interact
and so just i think that now we've got
like the tools to really
actually produce those things in real
time and that's cool right like i don't
know i mean it's never going to happen
for the olympics right that's such a
centralized controlled entity i mean at
the beginning of this year in january i
remember having a conversation with some
friends of mine
um and saying like hey like why don't we
produce a dao

[37:00]
produce a dao
to see and identify where the next
olympic city should actually be held
aside like a radically transparent way
where communities and participants it's
tough right because i think
theoretically people don't usually vote
when it comes like mass scale
but what if they could and what if there
was like an economic trail where you
could see like hey this is going to
benefit the local economy in a way
that's really really beneficial and also
this is really important from a societal
perspective so that your daughter son
whoever can see the impact of having
olympic games here or maybe you don't
think it's important maybe you don't
want this here and you should have a say
versus like six people who are
controlling a particular entity so you
were an olympic athlete yeah how many
gold medals did you win two two gold
medals insane gold medalist uh how would
you reimagine the olympic games like if
you could change things about the
olympic games make them more athlete
friendly make them more fan friendly
like what would be the things that you
would envision changing about that
um

[38:01]
um
that's a great question that's a long uh
that's a long question i think
i love the fact that like the world
comes together
um i i would like to just see more
access right that's that's my biggest
thing so nbc does a really good job of
like providing
like all different ways to consume the
content like they're really good at that
but i still think that they
i mean it could always be improved right
so like how do you get
more people participating
um it's it's a bit of a catch-22 right
because the olympics as a whole
as a business like if you take the uso
c for the usopc the united states
olympic and paralympic committee their
business model is to generate metals
which then in turn attracts sponsors so
that they can continue their jobs and
have trickle-down effect to supply the
training and resources for olympic
athletes that's the cycle that's the
feedback loop right so it's tough when
like we talk about like how what do we
want to change because even like with

[39:00]
want to change because even like with
mental health and sports today we want
athletes to be open and vulnerable
around how they feel
um simone biles did something that was
perhaps previously unthought of by
dropping out of an olympic games i think
it was four out of the five events she
was competing in
um and saying like hey this is i'm not
okay this is not okay and then we saw
the backlash of sensitivity around which
polarization view you were taking as an
individual saying hey i believe that my
strongly held um you know conditioning
says that you should act a certain way
respond a certain way as an athlete
because that's what i always believed in
and i get that like that's how i was
brought up right but then on the flip
side there's a new era that says well
she's still a human being i have no idea
what she's actually going through why
should my opinion of how she should
represent herself actually come into
play at all she's one in one individual
person so
like all these i think about all these
different kind of fragments of what's
happening in the olympic space
and how much sports has changed and
where it's going and why it's important
but i say that because the cycle and the
commercialization of the games is

[40:00]
commercialization of the games is
all-time high
and they're just adding sports like
esports will probably become an olympic
sport at some point
whether i believe that is valid or not
it doesn't really matter right i think
there's enough people play esports to
say like it should be a sport and we
should have some kind of control
mechanisms around who should be crowned
winner and receive a gold medal now like
traditional stick and ball sports uh
american sports we'll probably say like
that's stupid we don't believe in it
just like people will probably point to
equestrian or curling and say that that
is dumb hey i was on the curling team
so i take personal offense to that
trigger
i had to be a part of a team sure in in
high school yeah and it just felt like
the easiest
i mean i grew up in canada okay
side story i can't believe i'm you know
we can cut this out but
nice or keep it in
um
but basically

[41:01]
but basically
fun times biggest game of the year he
like didn't he he was supposed to be
it's harder than you think it's harder
it's a cool sport but what i'm saying is
like yeah because it doesn't
replicate the athletic belief that i
think should be going into like
wrestling for example like to me
wrestling is like one of the hardest
portions right that's my conditioning
and belief because i used to live with
those guys i watched them train i know
how crazy they are right and i learned a
lot from them but then someone who plays
chess
like who it's not that much of a
physical sport although it takes like a
lot of mental brain power like you know
someone might say like that's not a
sport but it kind of really is right so
i don't know we're just like what would
i change about the games dude i changed
so many things yeah i think that the uh
i can't even give you the straight
answers the uh
the ability for the athletes
what one of the things that like broadly
bothers me about sports is it's a very
short-lived career you have an extreme
peak of your
relevance and your fame and all of these
things and the olympic athletes it's
even shorter an olympic um gymnasts

[42:02]
even shorter an olympic um gymnasts
sometimes get two games but a lot of
these olympic athletes the sprinters
they get one game for the most part
where they are like for three weeks a
hero of their entire country and they
are not able to capture that value for
the long term and i do personally think
like i know everyone always like the
bitcoin fixes this web 3 fixes this i
really do think there's an angle here
where like michael phelps is an extreme
example you're an extreme example but
there are people where
if they minted a hundred of their gold
medal as an nft and you could own one of
a hundred of whoever apollo's gold medal
as an nft there are a lot of people that
then like oh okay you get to go to an
annual meetup or something and or you
get on an ama and you get to chat with
people if they have access to this
ticketed events things like that with it
it's sort of a cool way to like
provide these athletes with more of a
payback on all of the effort that
they've put in for quite literally their
entire lives to get to that point
and i think that there's something
beautiful there because so many of these

[43:01]
beautiful there because so many of these
athletes they're they're literally
relevant for two three weeks and then
they go back into anonymity and not able
to profit from what has been an entire
career of crazy sacrifice and like
debilitating injury in a lot of cases
so i've been having this conversation
for years
last year i started having conversations
with
the usopc
around kind of reinventing the way that
the distribution of payment to athletes
has handled and how they can monetize
their own branding so like with every
influencer that's on instagram or tiktok
or youtube or wherever the distribution
channel is there's like ample ways to
monetize that right um and audience is
typically the number one way to do that
whether it's your merchandise or
whatever you're kind of selling and
shilling it's great with olympic
athletes it doesn't work that way so if
you look at like nba top shop right they
have the kind of athletes commissioner
so to speak right um that controls
effectively all the rights so all the
athletes that are competing in the nba

[44:00]
athletes that are competing in the nba
they almost like relinquish their rights
because they're playing in the nba and
they're paid like handsomely to do so
but there is like a give and take there
right and because the players
association
oversees all of their rights they can
effectively work with what's happening
with dapper or
you know top shot or whoever the
entities are that basically say hey like
if these things are sold on our platform
you basically are only receiving a
fraction of what you normally would
receive and then when you see someone
like gronkowski go and do his own he
scrubs the image of all the kind of
likeness and ip and all these things
does it have relevance does it have
value what's happening the challenge of
giving that context because with the
olympic space
you've got nbc you've got the ioc you've
got the usopc you've got getty images
you've got the individual athletes
you've got the other athletes in the
same race then you've got the individual
sponsors that are also there and then
you've got the ioc sponsors there so
like i originally had this idea of
saying like hey
i want to go create a repository of all

[45:01]
i want to go create a repository of all
of the greatest historically significant
olympic moments in time
jesse owens right muhammad ali michael
phelps like whatever you want to do
right like
tommy on the stand you know like holding
his fist in the air like really
historical significant moments in time
and have them as a part of like a
virtual intra real life museum like that
should be here wynwood walls right is
here's how you bring sports to an
audience maybe that doesn't care about
sports and you bring it through culture
through music through politics whatever
that is and i had this idea to create
all these moments as nfts
and then have
like a museum and only like you could
have like a proper museum like this in
place like abu dhabi where like they're
willing to pour like billions of dollars
into this like cruelly cool like ar
immersive experience
um and the challenge that we had that i
ran into very quickly was that the
athletes actually don't own the rights
to their own [ __ ] damn i was gonna say
this sounds amazing

[46:01]
a little over a year ago i started
having this conversation and i was like
really really hardcore because i was
like look
and then the way this benefits is like
the the platform can take a small sliver
right of the fee and then we can have
the majority go towards the athletes or
the athletes families or whatever the
the entity or the estate or whatever it
is or like some like organization that
helps oversee
also we could pocket like a side over
here to say like 10 is going to go
towards helping athletes transition
beyond sport so that they
can communicate to the world that they
have extreme productivity they just need
to be kind of given guardrails again
outside of the olympic realm that's the
biggest we talked about this when i saw
you last was that like the reinvention
for an athlete is this like closely held
identity to one side and then all of a
sudden there's this great divorce that
happens and the identity that they love
that was that they taught him everything
i'm writing a book about this so i'm
like i'm so passionate about it it tells
them like you're no longer good enough i
found someone younger who's better and
no matter what you do you can't come
back to me
so you either go be a coach should be a

[47:01]
so you either go be a coach should be a
part of the team somehow but you can no
longer compete and be the star light
star athlete again in the olympic space
it's a very short window and so the
athletes then like [ __ ] like what else
am i good at what do i do like what
skills do i have i've like pushed off
school i pushed off social life
i'm like this like very narrow isolated
person that has incredible attributes
underneath this layer but i've never
really expressed them outside of leaning
on the levers of like my fears of
failure or like rage or
you know like insecurities and
self-doubts to prove myself in my sport
because i could physically do that now i
have to do that against if i'm trying to
work in like web 3 or i'm trying to
become someone who's a new creator i've
got some 17 year old kid who's faster
smarter or more experienced than i am
and i'm 25 or i'm 26. so like there's
this like uh letdown that happens and so
i had this idea about creating all these
little pockets of like i deeply believe
in the value that athletes can bring to
society and to to to economies because
they do contain
really cool life lessons that are
usually taught later on in your life and

[48:01]
usually taught later on in your life and
they have them right out of the gate
and the work ethic the discipline like
the the being coachable all those things
are natural they got punched in the face
punch in the face many times but they
need to be kind of molded and still held
in the same way and mentored in a new
environment in a new career
and it's like really frightening and
like very visceral in terms of the
breakup that you have with that first
identity and so like this nft platform
or this like nft museum was like my
my way of basically funneling this other
idea around something that i cared about
and it never took off and i i was like
very sensitive around like pursuing a
project
um that i wasn't going to be able to
spend like a ton of time on um who owns
the rights are owned by like a whole
series of people so the ioc has like the
ultimate say over what's happening but
then the person who took the picture for
getty images
also has the rights um then the athletes
that are also there also have a say and
then the above the athletes is the u.s
olympic committee body so that's like
the u.s speed skating right the u.s

[49:00]
the u.s speed skating right the u.s
olympic committee um
yeah so it's so basically what i'm
trying to say is it's really complex and
it's convoluted and it should change
because
there's like a lot of value there like
to me when i think about sports and like
the pinnacle of achievement in the
olympic space
um it is quite unique right and whether
you watch sports or not like there's
something cool around
someone dedicated an entire lifetime
around a moment that lasts nine seconds
or 40 seconds and in that moment of time
whether you're in a saint bolt or
michael johnson or michael phelps or
whoever that person is like the
difference between first and like being
off the podium is like fractions like
hundreds of seconds and because it's
like that what happens that person who's
in fourth who's in fifth
i watched this like really cool
documentary i think it was a bbc
documentary on the only person who beat
floyd mayweather
and it's just i think it's i want to say
it's this guy who's somewhere in like
eastern europe and it showed the two
dichotomies of lifestyle difference you
got floyd right it's like crushed it
like super flashy like all you know like

[50:00]
like super flashy like all you know like
money money mayweather you've got this
other dude who like lives in this like
localized town that looks like it's been
bombed like 10 times
and he's like known but he's like had
like his own bouts of like depression
and issues associated and he was a
celebrated hero in his hometown because
he won a medal right in his in his for
his home country and i just think about
that stuff all the time and like why do
two different like people go down
different roads it's typically because
they've been celebrated by one i'm very
lucky dude like i know that i'm very
grateful because i was chosen by nbc to
be a spotlighted athlete but why me just
because i was winning there's like other
people who in the olympic space that
have crazy cool stories that you've
never heard about and i know because i
live with these guys in the olympic
training center like coming out like you
know being like imagine being olympic
gold medals i'm gonna say the person's
name but winning a gold medal for like a
really hard sport and then retiring for
like 10 years
uh going and living your life getting
married having kids then falling into
depression and then having like a drug
problem and then losing your family
losing your kids no longer have access

[51:00]
losing your kids no longer have access
losing your job you have nothing and
then coming back to the sport because
the sport is the only place that you've
found that gives you some semblance of
feeling important or some sense of like
purpose in some capacity and then the
first match that you have against the
number two in the world you beat him
after 10 years
it's like really cool right um i have no
idea where that guy is now but i
remember sitting in this like olympic
training center and seeing like an
unfamiliar face
that could definitely could tell he had
been through some [ __ ] in his life and
then sitting down with this dude and
being like dude like what's up man like
i've seen your picture in the halls in
the training center because you're a
legend
but where have you been the past 10
years i mean like just for like three
hours tells me his life story i'm like
[ __ ] no one has told this story like why
is nbc not commenting on this so but
that's the power of streaming and that's
why you guys can bring cool people here
it is just the
i have so many thoughts on that i mean
i've as a former athlete on a completely
different scale than you but i played at
a high level in college sports we were

[52:00]
a high level in college sports we were
the number one team in the country a
number of times and i think about the
thing you said about a few seconds
feels like a light you've spent your
entire lifetime preparing for a few
seconds gives me chills thinking about
that because i have a moment like that
in my career where it was one game and i
was out there and i had to get the last
out of this game and it was a big crowd
and it was a huge game and i think i
thought about that while i was out there
like holy [ __ ] i've literally my entire
from little league the first t-ball
field i was on to like this moment this
is it and it's either gonna go one way
and like this guy's going to hit a 800
foot home run off me and we're going to
lose or it's going to go the other way
celebrating i just was sitting there and
i was like and i was it was like a 2-0
count on the guy was a pitcher and i
remember thinking like am i really going
to walk this guy we're going to lose
like this is it my entire life of like
training for this moment that's what i'm
gonna do and it went the it went a good
way luckily i ended up it was a
celebratory moment but that transition
you talk about
and the mental health of athletes and
the ability to manage that transition
the lack of resources to help them

[53:01]
the lack of resources to help them
manage that transition i mean i've had
i'm sure you know hundreds of people
like it sounds like you're writing a
book about it which i'll eagerly look
forward to
i've had one of my best friends in the
world was
and i don't think he'll mind me saying
this he's one of the most talented
baseball players i've ever seen on a
field um he was a first overall pick in
the mlb draft like got paid six million
dollars insane one of the most talented
people ever has not made it to the mlb
was called the biggest bust in mlb
history in mlb draft history and dealt
with serious struggle as a result of
that just like defining who you are
because it was for your whole life
driven around this one persona who you
are and he's br and i've had to spend
hours talking to him
you're brilliant you're an amazing
person it had nothing to do with
baseball that was one iteration of it
but there's a whole new life out in
front of you and we don't do a good job
having the resources to actually tell
those people that like the things you
learned and the lessons you learned
weren't so that you could go throw a
ball or so you could skate quickly or so

[54:01]
ball or so you could skate quickly or so
you could wrestle well it is so broadly
applicable to what you're going to go do
next but we don't have institutions
resources to go have that conversation
with those people at that next level and
it's it's not just olympians or
professional athletes like think of
um
you know u.s veterans or or veterans in
general like failed startup founders
there's millions of
veterans who come out come out of
training and and service and
[Music]
they're like okay like what next and
then they fall into depression and they
fall into you know a lot of
dark places but they you know like you
know training for the olympics or like
training for
uh you know
high-level sports they've got they're
rooted in a lot of um
great skills it's just how do how do we
transform
those people into the into the real
world i know there's some people trying
um there's organizations right yeah i

[55:01]
um there's organizations right yeah i
think
these are all a lot of this is like
psychological on a lot of its
conditioning
you know i think a lot of people when
they come home
from service
they probably feel alien
less appreciated
like no one knows what they did what
they went through and no one can relate
because that's how i felt right i felt
like
you don't you have no idea what it took
i wasn't even genetically gifted in my
sport like i had to go to places like
you don't even know about like that was
my thought right
um and so we absolutely need like real
transitory like just transition
mechanisms to help a lot of these people
because uh they're powerful man but like
i think people go through this all stage
in your life everyone has to reinvent
and pivot at some point you know like
when i finish the book which i like
when's it coming out what's the book
called it comes out in february it's
called hard pivot okay and it just talks
about like i think our all of our human
struggle with reinvention adaptation to
uncertainty um and how to how did i
figure out kind of my own personal way

[56:01]
figure out kind of my own personal way
as i'm figuring it out and just like
kind of transparently give like some
tool kits some things that i've had to
go through both on a personal
development level where my own micro
traumas have come from
um and all these things right like i
grew up in a single parent household
where you know my father was japanese
i'm i'm half japanese and he had like
extremely high expectations for me right
so very tiger father driven like amazing
love like super lucky to have this but
also like no matter how bad i failed he
was like oh like you can always you can
always pick yourself back up no matter
how i even if i won it was always better
so like that like level of
fear of effectively letting down the one
person that i sought the most love from
my life which was my dad was like deeply
rooted at a very early age and so it
drove everything that i did
everything like everything was always i
think and i didn't know this too much
later in my life but i think a lot of
people go through that process of like
the micro traumas and the experiences
that we've had as kids in school
relationships through work they affect
you unless you deal with them in some

[57:01]
you unless you deal with them in some
capacity and that's why like during the
beginning of the pandemic like 18 months
ago
i was like man like not only athletes
are going through this i think a lot of
people are going through this and
there's got to be a better way
um it's never easy but at least if we
can embrace parts of this journey and
know that it's not easy and know that
there's perhaps a different avenue for
us to grow like at least it makes life
a little bit less like sisyphus you know
what i mean yeah where
it's just so painful to like always go
back down again and i don't know and
finding the communities to have that
outlet to talk about it with peers
because i always find these things are
built up in your mind more than they're
real like for me that pivot away from
baseball
i
was hurt it was very clear to me
abundantly clear to me that my career
was over and that i needed to
hang it up and the hardest conversation
you bring up your dad the hardest call
in conversation was to call my dad and
tell him and i still i mean i still
think about it and feel like emotional
thinking about it when i called him and

[58:01]
thinking about it when i called him and
i was like dad you're gonna be so
disappointed that i'm having to hang it
up and he didn't care at all he was just
like
you've accomplished so much i'm so happy
you know that you feel that you need to
call me but there was no
like these people love you and you have
so much support out there and you we
need to create systems where people
realize that that there is that support
that you have that community right like
the team rallies around you the people
that you've trained with your whole
career rally around you but you need to
not be afraid to seek that out because
when people go inward
and you just retreat into the shell
that's when you end up with the real
struggle i found when you're when you're
able to just say like hey i'm really sad
about this i'm having to change and make
strongest prison is right between your
two years oh that's great like it
literally is yeah you can have the most
and we see this with like crypto and
web3 and everything that's being created
today like it's the most powerful tool
in the world it's also like
the most damaging tool if it's used

[59:00]
the most damaging tool if it's used
against you in the wrong way and i lived
in that space for a long time like many
athletes do where
like you are literally your own worst
enemy and if you listen to that voice
that tells you often that you're not
good enough and it's not good enough and
it's never going to be good enough
you're not tall enough you're not
attractive enough you're not smart
enough and other people have more than
you and you know like
that's a really like uh confusing and
also can be really really um
i think just destructive
you know and you can sabotage yourself
and i think that
you know i i for years used that as a
lever to like get me up early and keep
me up late at night it was a very
motivating tool but it also kept me like
in a little bit of my own prison in a
sense like where i wasn't fully
able to accept myself and also love
myself for my own inconsistencies and
self-doubts and beliefs and just like
being human right it was i wanted to be
a machine
and uh that's the uh
that's the scary part for me about web3
and crypto like the dark side of it is

[1:00:01]
and crypto like the dark side of it is
you know it's a
financialization of everything and
everything is liquid and
while that has a lot of benefits it also
means you
you're playing a game
and you're playing as [ __ ] mccormack
calls it the great online game
and you want a high score and you're
just it's 24 7. it's not like the
markets that close
on holidays or the weekends and
there's a public score card it's a
publix everyone sees it everyone sees it
so i think
you know for people playing in the game
the people listening like
set your own goals and it's f it's great
to like hit milestones but i think that
you know
there's gonna be a burnout
i predict a burnout
uh and i'm already starting to see some
individuals that are just they're taking
it too far
yeah
it's uh
but i'm talking to a

[1:01:01]
but i'm talking to a
you know a two-time gold medalist you're
looking at like a one-time jump shot
not even bronze medalist in curling
it's funny there's levels to it right
you just
we all struggle with the same things
just in different ways and iterations i
do think athletes it's a very very i'm
so excited for your book because i have
so many friends i went through it
personally
i'm super excited for it i'm like share
it with a lot of friends because i think
colleges should be sharing that type of
context with their athletes ncaa had all
those commercials like 99 won't be going
professional we'll be going professional
in something other than sports and for
some reason we didn't hear that message
in college enough and i i mean i went to
one of the best sports schools in the
world and we didn't hear that message
and so many of my friends were feeling
lost after i felt lost there were times
when i was like how am i going to have
done this and like accomplish what i
feel like i've accomplished and not have
a job or not be able to go make use of
the skills i feel like i've developed

[1:02:02]
the skills i feel like i've developed
and now i have a lot of friends who've
gone and played a few years
professionally in whatever sport
football baseball and they're like holy
hell if the rest of my life and they
might have made i have friends who have
made 80 80 million dollars playing
football or whatever it is and now
they're like well [ __ ] i'm 28 and yeah i
have a ton of money but like i have a
whole life to live i need to find some
reason to get up in the morning it
doesn't matter if i have a lot of money
um those transitions are just so hard it
doesn't matter the money doesn't fix it
on your point with like the burnout and
there for sure is an incredible unique
opportunity that is existing right now
in in in all online activity whether
it's crypto whether you're jumping in
you're being a creator or you're trying
to develop a community economy like
whatever the iteration is that you are
latching yourself onto i think something
to make really important for anyone
who's building things in the space where
yes there's a small window of
opportunity and i'm i'm definitely never
one to tell you not to jump out of the
airplane with no parachute because
there's a lot of power in burning the

[1:03:01]
there's a lot of power in burning the
ships so to speak
but also
you can't have so much external
abundance in your life
but then be in like severe internal
poverty and if that is what's happening
where
if you're a trader in crypto and it
requires you to be
so glued to your devices all the time
and if you can't disengage for periods
you're you're actually no better off
than the guy who's working 18 hour
shifts like you're exactly the same your
number on the scorecard is just slightly
different but your life is the same
there's nothing that's inherently
different so
like
again like i get it right like
everything needs to like in sports we
use the gas principle and in tech you
know you go through like short sprints
and you know you go through sprints
right okay the next two weeks the next
week the next six weeks is going to be a
sprint everyone hands on deck it's going
to be
not balanced at all and i think that is
important but i also think it's
important to be able to disengage and
also be present right because this this
race of what's happening in in web 3 in

[1:04:00]
race of what's happening in in web 3 in
the development
it's we're like at the tip of the
iceberg like where we're heading in the
direction that it's going and the
opportunities that exist on the other
side
are the ready player ones like that is
literally what we are creating in many
iterations and if you are participating
in this in some way to reinvent
reimagine
and um just
just change the way that we think about
our values between each other between
the different games that we're playing
between the content that you're
producing and consuming between the
financialization of products um i always
ask myself like why does this need to
exist
at the end of the day like this is this
actually really important and if it is
amazing if it's not then i'm still
playing the game so
you know like
like i've done so much like personal
deep work and especially like the past
like i would say eight years
on like why do i act the way that i do
why do i operate the way that i operate
what am i chasing what do i believe life
wants for me and what do i actually
really want out of life are those things
aligned in some capacity and then i

[1:05:02]
aligned in some capacity and then i
sometimes find myself still being the
hamster in the cage
right just running running now at least
now i know that i'm the hamster i know
that i am still on the treadmill and at
times we just have to get off you know
and so like right now we're doing this
at art basel and it's the most insane
thing that i've seen in years
we kind of talked about that earlier
right like you showed me your calendar
yep and i almost puked
and i say that with like
i i i feel i felt for you because i was
like i think that you shouldn't go to
you have two through two how many
dinners two to three dinners
four dinners four dinners tonight
they're all at the same time yeah i
don't know like what's the yeah and
humans should have one dinner
and
[Laughter]
i don't think enough people are hearing
that message everyone's hearing the
message around and by the way i'm the

[1:06:01]
message around and by the way i'm the
biggest like the future is web3 the
future is creator the future is
community person
and
i also don't sleep a lot so
i you know but at the same time i
i pull myself out of it and i'm like
do i really need to do this right now
or can i go and
play the guitar or whatever or go and
just go for a walk in the park or go do
things that are quote-unquote mundane
can i ask you something about that
because i i think that's i think it's
really profound and interesting that
you're saying that do you feel more free
do i feel more free when i when you're
able to tap into that
yes
i've learned that from him and what does
the freedom give you like in terms of i
think of two things right fomo and fopo
right fomo we know of that exists
everywhere in especially in crypto fopo
is like fear of other people's opinions
which is sometimes directly correlated
with fomo
do you feel none of that
i feel i mean i'm a human being so i do

[1:07:00]
i feel i mean i'm a human being so i do
feel some of that
um but i think
i've trained myself to
not care what people think and just do
you know we were just talking about this
this right before where i was yeah
i was wearing this t-shirt and it said
snowden deli on it which is this jewish
deli that was like right next to my
place growing up
and
i wore it to like a famous person's new
york fashion week party and this like
well-known hip-hop artist came up to me
and he said are you wearing a jewish
delis t-shirt to a new york fashion week
party and i was like
i guess i am because i'm here you know
and it's like and he couldn't believe it
right it was like celebrities everywhere
and everyone was dressed in
i think that the freeing part of it is
you have yeah do to answer your question
do i feel free i feel free when i when
i'm able to
do what i want to do isn't that the
definition of freedom yeah

[1:08:02]
definition of freedom yeah
it's awesome i by the way i love that
you do that exercise i think it's really
important for all of us to go through
that process
um
i think there's times when we when we
when we we decide not to we say okay
this is i believe this is important or
maybe i don't believe it's important but
i'm gonna do it anyway and it doesn't
mean you can't work hard right like i
now you gotta work hard you gotta work
hard pre-requisites yeah
right like you got to work hard and like
when i'm working i'm working right like
i'm all i'm dialed but when i'm not i'm
not
that yeah that i mean i i think about
that is like just being like really just
authentic man if you can be authentic to
yourself and then kind of catch yourself
at least be more mindful of kind of your
own internal emotional thoughts that are
pulling you or directing you in certain
ways maybe that don't
directly are in alignment with your true
north of what the ultimate goal here is
or what the next chapter is in your life
like it's it's hard to have that
perspective ongoing because we do buy
into the external
signaling of society telling us what we

[1:09:01]
signaling of society telling us what we
should have what you should be doing
which dow you should be participating in
which new token launch you should have
which new game you should be
participating which new play to earn
learn to earn whatever it is um and when
you're not you're less than yep right
and that's the biggest issue here is
like because you're not in the club
because you didn't get in at this round
or because you didn't buy it at this
price you're less than you're less than
smart you're not you don't have as much
access you're not in the club and
those things are true
right maybe in some instances but
they're also just like made up
so
iron man it's a i think it's like an
age-old conundrum that we are facing
right is like how to balance i think
psychologically between what we know
to be externally signaling to us as the
new wave of this conditioning is
happening which is to be con you know
connected 24 7 all the time and always
available and always ready um versus
like still being human and then like

[1:10:00]
like still being human and then like
balancing that it's tough yeah i mean
it's funny it's like
i'm in between you two sort of on this
where
i
came from a sports background and i had
the like
very similar mentality that i think you
had from what i've read about your
background and listen you speak about it
i was just like complete balls to the
wall like i'd wake up at four go to bed
at you know 11 like i had to work harder
than anyone else because i knew i wasn't
that talented and i was just like i just
have to work harder than everyone and i
took pride in that and it was like this
deep
i almost had a bitterness about the fact
that i wasn't talented and that drove me
like you were better than me but like
[ __ ] you i'm gonna like just do better
than you because i'm working harder and
i took pride in that and then i took a
job in traditional finance and that was
like a great breeding ground for that
mentality where if you just worked
harder and you worked more hours you
were like okay that was you took pride
in how many hours you worked 100 hour
week it was like oh great you're doing
this
and now i'm like in this sort of new
world where i'm getting to do more
creative things and i'm sort of

[1:11:01]
creative things and i'm sort of
able to work more like a lion than like
a than like a cow to use the naval thing
of like more in sprints and real
creativity and trying to drive things
forward and it's important to how i
think for me to actually
be able to think clearly and not be
foggy all the time because i haven't
slept
and so i'm somewhere in the middle of
that transition now of like i still have
that deep-seated
feeling of like being an underdog and
wanting to go figure these things out
neither my parents were in finance like
i want to go
make money and do a bunch of cool things
and like make my parents proud my mom's
indian i come from a mixed race
background as well and you know indian
parents it's like the old thing of like
why you're not why you not doctor or
like why are you not you know now it's
like why you not ceo of big tech
companies like all the ceos now but i
still have that but i'm trying to like
fight against it to some extent to adopt
more of these things but the secret is
if you end up having in this new world
that we live in which is like creativity
based like

[1:12:00]
based like
we're creators right we're creating
in order to be a great creator you need
to have balance
like that's what you're going to go on
that walk and you're it's going to hit
you hey i should
you know
i just had an idea for a startup i got
to go launch it or hey like you know
you're you're playing tennis or
something and like something hits right
with that so i think like
the more out like the more hours to a
certain point like it's a lot of
diminishing returns and like i think
people need to figure out what that is
for them is it 35 is it 45 a week is it
50 is it 70 and like pick something
that's less than 100
ideally
and uh and like i like how you put it
right be a human like i feel like that's
a good thing to end on right like just
what makes you happy man we're all on
like a rock hurtling through the
universe in space like we're all going
to die
and so like i just i think it's so fun
that we get to have conversations with
really smart people and get to meet
people on a daily basis that are working
on cool things that motivates me to want
to work a lot it's cool because i can go

[1:13:00]
to work a lot it's cool because i can go
and have conversations with smart people
this week you're here you're meeting all
these people
part of what's motivating about that for
you i imagine it's like there's a bunch
of cool people that are building the
future and you get to go have
conversations with them and be a part of
that and that's [ __ ] cool no matter
how you slice it that's a cool thing to
be in it you're in i mean we call this
where it happens it's like being in the
room where it happens that's what we all
want to do we all want to be a part of
it and
that's like the brilliance of all of
this and why i feel so lucky
i also think it's a great place to
cut off our time here because i know
we're up against the end so yeah man
that was uh thanks for having me that
was awesome so excited where can people
find you so i know we have pivot coming
out in february hardcover coming out in
february where can people follow you on
social
you know i'm on ig uh i don't post a ton
if i'm on twitter obviously yep um the
only apology out there i'm not on tick
tock i don't do snap okay um but i think
twitter's probably the best place yep um
to communicate yeah awesome well thank
you so much and tribe crypto um doing

[1:14:01]
you so much and tribe crypto um doing
amazing things so excited to see what
you guys built awesome team yeah it is
an awesome team i can definitely vouch
for that super exciting thank you so
much man real real honor
wow um
that was far-ranging i felt like we
covered
i mean he sat with us for a lot longer
than i thought so we ended up getting to
a whole lot of stuff which was crazy to
me by the way just like it's not a
takeaway but getting to sit down with a
guy that i've admired as long as that
who's become a friend
just super cool life moment for me so
i'll let you go first what was your one
big takeaway
i mean i'm impressed with you about this
too
you and him is just the
ambition and and how you you guys are
like machines like you
there's something about sports and
professional sports that just teaches
you really really
uh to push it to the limits and i admire
that
but there are is also some downsides and
we talked about it and i i think uh

[1:15:00]
we talked about it and i i think uh
i think that push and pull is healthy
but i i really enjoyed that yeah i mean
you've pushed me to think a lot on those
things and it's made my life better so
i'm like i'm thankful for that
personally that i have a counterpoint to
like be a sparring partner to help me
kind of ease up on things a bit so they
appreciate it so the takeaway for
everyone listening really is just
uh
don't push yourself too hard yeah and
also
push yourself well it's hustle but no
one to rest yeah you gotta know when to
rest it's like work like a lion yeah you
gotta sprint when you're sprinting and
really focus but then know when to rest
and like a lion knows when to sleep
after it sprints and then i can't leave
this episode
without my one big takeaway which is
i love this idea of buying the x games
and i like i'm gonna sing it from the
rooftops i want to go do this and if
it's still literally on the block for 50
million dollars i think we could do it i
think there's a massive opportunity here
like enormous opportunity for the x
games so if anyone's interested we're
going to jump into discord wag bxg we're

[1:16:00]
going to jump into discord wag bxg we're
going to buy the x games
four sigmatic is the secret sauce behind
the where it happens podcast you know
how much i've been talking about that
hot cocoa the one that's jam-packed at
the reishi mushrooms it absolutely has
been transforming my mornings i have it
at night completely chills me out takes
out all my stress and allows me to have
a good night's rest after those long
days of tequila on the set i'm sure
that's helpful i mean it does help
the sweet vanilla plant-based protein is
the one that i've been going to after my
workouts in the mornings it's been a
game changer 18 grams of plant-based
protein adaptogens
jam-packed with mushroom goodness it's
been a complete game changer for me so
to go check it out go to 4sigmatic.com
and use code the room at checkout greg
why do you
look so tired i look so tired because i
did not sleep last night have you never
slept well or is this a new thing
it's not that i can't fall asleep i fall

[1:17:02]
it's not that i can't fall asleep i fall
asleep like right away but i wake up a
couple hours later
and i'm just sitting in my bed and i
look at the ceiling and i can't fall
back asleep and i don't know what to do
so i was literally you
and for the longest time
i was this like hustle culture bro
sleep when i'm dead
didn't want to sleep didn't care about
my sleep and then i honestly i started
reading more of the research and
realizing how impactful sleep is to your
longevity to your health all of these
other things and as part of that i found
eight sleep which has completely
revolutionized the way i sleep i've
heard of eight sleep can you tell me
more about it think of it as like the
future of sleep all of these mattress
companies have created these mattresses
they're just stuck they're stock
mattresses eight sleep is technology
plus sleep combined so the whole product
is built around optimizing the
temperature that you sleep at and so you
read about sleeping cold is the key to
sleeping and it's not quite true

[1:18:00]
sleeping and it's not quite true
everyone has a different optimal sleep
temperature and it changes throughout
the night which is the crazy part about
it so you might need really cold to fall
asleep and then you might need it to be
a little bit warmer to keep you asleep
and they eight sleep actually
transitions your temperature through the
night to keep you at the optimal sleep
sleep temperature at any point during
the night it keeps you asleep it helps
you fall asleep faster and i actually
since i started using it have been
sleeping better and feeling so much more
energized during the day as a result
sounds like i need a nate sleep i think
everyone needs innate sleep
so if you're tuning in right now and you
