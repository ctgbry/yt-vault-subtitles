[00:00]
the format of like a venture Studio was
like really interesting for me it was
like wait it would let me do all the
things I love doing all the time and to
me that I think finding something I
could do for 50 years was actually like
what led me to picking this is like I
don't know if this is the highest
expected value thing I could spend my
time on maybe picking one idea and
running with it and trying you know or
being an investor I don't know but this
was the thing that I actually felt most
excited about a lot of people talk about
growth assistant which is hit by
millionaire they go Jesse why don't you
focus all your time on that that seems
like the obvious thing to do and I'll go
yeah but what am I solving for you know
anybody around this well you gotta make
the most money you can possibly make I'm
like well I want to focus on the thing
that's going to energize me the most for
the longest and so that's kind of what
got me into starting Gateway X which is
the name of the Venture Studio you know
the three things that are distinct about
it one every idea is kind of plays off
of my unfair advantages so there has to
something to do with customer
acquisition problems that Brands and
marketers have like something I
understand or have some inbuilt
distribution for the second thing is
they're all like what I would describe
as capital light businesses and I think

[01:01]
as capital light businesses and I think
there's a big opportunity between the
sort of Lifestyle business and the
Venture funded business there's a lot of
businesses in between and then the third
thing is they all kind of use my common
cultural operating system you know types
of meetings we run the way we give
feedback all those things are sort of
common so theoretically you should be
able to sit in any of them and feel like
you're kind of working at the same
company
I've been looking forward to this one
for a while Jesse Pucci what's up Greg
did you see my tweet on
multi-preneurship I think I did the
future is entrepreneurship yeah exactly
that's a bit of like a hook to get
people in but when I think of
multi-preneurship which is someone who
builds a company who builds companies I
think of I think of you you're like Mr
multi-preneurship yeah and aspiring at
least
no you're doing it like you're doing it
I saw you know one of your companies
pass 10 million ARR I believe yep
um you also just have like a supplement
company you've got some technology
companies so I'm I'm just selfishly

[02:01]
companies so I'm I'm just selfishly
interested in just learning more about
well first
do you consider yourself a multi-preneur
and and then just learn more about your
businesses yeah yeah for sure I mean
yeah I think so I I you know it's funny
I when 2009 before I had ever been an
entrepreneur I was working at Goldman
Sachs and I put together this document
and I still have it I'll send it to you
after and it was it was to my ambush
co-founder as the first company I
started and it was like here's the
vision for the future and I like to
share especially with people like you
because I was like man I was so early to
this like hold code thing but the idea
was literally we you know have good
ideas execute them focus on generating
cash flow and then once you have more
and more of them like just keep
multiplying it with the ultimate goal to
actually be to build a an awesome
organization where you get to coach
teach people learn and an organization
building has always been as important to
me if not more important to me than the
business building itself and we can talk
about the difference between those two
and then you know and then so I was 24 I

[03:01]
and then you know and then so I was 24 I
think when I wrote the doc then I
actually tried to start a company yeah
turns out it's really [ __ ] hard to
start a company and it takes every bit
of you emotionally physically and I
totally forgot about the doctor you know
literally just totally forgot about it
you know we end up through the trials
and tribulations of a 10-year startup
Journey which ultimately ended up in a
success you know we exited but as I
started working with a coach you know I
actually completely forgot about the
document but I started wearing the coach
and started doing the stuff like what
really lights me up you know what's my
why and like you know sometimes we think
of purpose as something we have to go
attain or it's like a long-term thing we
go get and one reframe he had for me
that was powerful was like no it's just
kind of how you want to be every day
like what's going to bring you energy
every single day I was like well there's
a few things that bring me energy that
that initial process of like spotting an
opportunity and kind of initially
peeling the onion putting the pieces
together go get it I love that part I
love and I'm very good at sort of like
mobilizing a lot of things in One
Direction and sort of that you know the
early stages of something I love
coaching and teaching people and I'm
much more powerful as a teacher or coach

[04:00]
much more powerful as a teacher or coach
usually than I am as like a straight
doer I love stuff like this getting to
know other people learning being
challenged changed and so as I started
thinking about what was next for me
after after kind of that successful run
at ampush this the format of like a
venture Studio was like really
interesting for me it was like wait it
would let me do all the things I love
doing all the time and and to me that I
think finding something I could do for
50 years was actually like the goal or
50 plus years that would keep me
energized and re-energize me and so
that's kind of how I got into this is
that's sort of you know obviously
there's lots of different people
influencing me along the way but that
what led me to picking this and this is
a really important distinction
especially on Twitter twitterland where
everyone tries to be right about
everything is like I don't know if this
is the highest expected value thing I
could spend my time on my maybe picking
one idea and running with it and trying
you know or being an investor I don't
know but this was the thing that I
actually felt most excited about and I
feel most excited about and energized by
and so I was like I don't really care if
it's the most high expected values might
not be the best Roi decision like a lot
of people talk about growth assistant
which is a 10 millionaire they go Jesse
why don't you focus all your time on

[05:00]
why don't you focus all your time on
that that seems like the obvious thing
to do and I'll go yeah but that's not
what am I solving for you know videos oh
you gotta make the most money you can
possibly make I'm like well that's not
what I'm solving for this that thing's
already making plenty of money and I'm
good I want to focus on the thing that's
going to energize me the most for the
longest and so anyway that's kind of
what got me into starting Gateway X
which is the the name of the Venture
studio
um you know the three things that are
distinct about it uh from my perspective
are one every idea is kind of plays off
of my unfair advantages so it has to
something to do with customer
acquisition problems that Brands and
marketers have like something I
understand or have some inbuilt
distribution for the second thing is
they're all like what I would describe
as capital light businesses and I think
there's a big opportunity between the
sort of you know lifestyle business and
the Venture funded business there's a
lot of businesses in between that I call
bootstrap Giants they're these ambitious
but self-funded profitable companies
that can grow for a really long time
that's the type of business we want to
start and then the third thing is they
all kind of use my common cultural
operating system and so they you know I
could talk about that but it's meeting

[06:00]
could talk about that but it's meeting
you know the types of meetings we run
the way we give feedback all those
things are sort of common so
theoretically you should be able to sit
in any of them and feel like you're kind
of working at the same company
um and that's kind of where the hold Co
element comes into place but it's a
different version of it because we're
starting everything so far at least
we're not buying anything but that's it
that's a quick story I want to read you
a text I got this morning there's been a
lot of people we know including myself
who've launched agencies including
yourself actually too I mean growth is
in a lot of ways is sure an agency so a
very well-known person sent me a text
message
and he says I've seen so many of these
agencies launch over the last six years
number one big announcement number two
get to 50K 50 to 100K a month mrr think
you're building the next Uber and agency
form number three uh-oh your way to
efficiency was stealing other people's
content and I'll go boosting number four
clients start churning faster than you
can replace them number five you hate
your life number six Twitter public
posts we've decided to shut down our
agency number seven

[07:00]
agency number seven
bring out the popcorn what do you think
about that yeah I mean I think they're
they're easy businesses to start they
can be very challenging businesses to
grow and operate I mean ampush ampush
was not intended to be an agency but we
turned into one
um you know the story you know my quick
story born and raised here in St Louis
my dad is an entrepreneur always knew I
want to be an entrepreneur one day I
went to Penn I went to Wharton which is
like the you know Wall Street trade
school and that's been a couple years
doing management consulting and then a
couple years on Wall Street and and by
the way you know Management Consulting
in Wall Street we don't talk about this
a lot but their services businesses just
to be completely clear they sell
Services they sell really high-end
services but they're Services businesses
so you can learn a lot about Services by
actually spending time in those places
and then we started ampush and we
started doing it in Performance
Marketing we discovered Facebook
Facebook called us in our first year or
so I said who the hell are you guys you
know we were one of the fastest growing
advertisers and we ended up being one of
their earliest marketing partners and
and they gave us access to their API we
built software we tried to sell the
software to people nobody wanted

[08:01]
software to people nobody wanted
software they wanted Services they said
hey I don't know how to run this and you
know our customers at that time were a
bunch of startups names a lot of names
you wouldn't recognize but then a lot of
names like uber Dollar Shave Club
Peloton blue apron and and we always
thought of it ourselves as a tech
company until someone was like well why
don't you just sell your Tech now then
we were like well no people will pay us
one or two percent of media for that but
they'll pay us 10 or 15 of media for our
services like why would we do that and
that's when we kind of realized we were
you know we'd become more of a tech
enabled Services business there was a
joke when I was a CEO I'd never call
Ambush an agency because I was like
we're so much more you know that's not
what we are we're much more than that
but you know I've talked to a lot of
people since then and I think like
people don't build them to scale
you know I had the benefit of coming
from management consulting where I saw
this hugely scaled services Enterprise
and I just things that they did
naturally became natural to me so for
example we recruited top young raw
talent and we trained the hell out of
them we always had a sales pipeline
running to go along with the business in
a very meaningful way we chose our

[09:00]
a very meaningful way we chose our
customers carefully we chose customers
who would grow over time so that like we
didn't have to worry about churn even if
there was some churn you would still
have like your your sort of monthly
Revenue would grow consistently and and
you know we I was funny there's like a
five-year period where I'd walk into
Starbucks with my wife and I would just
be like my jaw would drop and I'd be
like oh my God this place is amazing and
she's like what the [ __ ] wrong with
you I'm like there's five employees here
none of them owned this place none of
them make more than 15 bucks an hour and
they're all this this place is crushing
it and that's actually what we became we
like we need to make Starbucks and so we
started designing these little pods
internally where like every single you
know the systems the way things work the
way we manage them all became very very
common
um and that's how we scaled the business
to you know half a billion a year in ad
spending 200 people
technology helped also but but it was
really that Starbucks Suffocation of
each pod inside the organization and
then some of the reporting structures
and things like that so they're really
easy businesses to start then what
happens is the founder runs the whole
show they're never able to get away from
any sort of client delivery or client

[10:01]
any sort of client delivery or client
service or anything and then you know
all these everyone wants to take the
business in-house at some point I mean
that's that's just the natural uh way of
things and it's just a matter of when
not if that's another people lie to
themselves about is like at some point
they want to take it in-house one of the
fun things about growth assistant is
like it really is like a staff
augmentation business and it's like kind
of been the opposite of an agency like
we get you people and so we've seen the
retention in that businesses way better
than the retention was at ampush because
once you have a couple great people
offshore you're not trying to lose them
and you're not you don't care how much
you're paying I mean you know you're not
going to fight us over a few hundred
dollars of margin that we're taking
versus you or something but yeah I think
I think they're tough businesses to run
and scale yeah I think a lot of people
are seeing Twitter People Like Us
launch agencies and they're like well I
want to do that there's also that guy
Brett from design Joy who has a course
on productizing agencies and I think
that is a whole you know new new
generation of entrepreneurs who are

[11:00]
generation of entrepreneurs who are
looking at this and being wow so you're
saying you know going back to your asset
light thing so you're saying I could
basically build up a Twitter account
launch a service and then all of a
sudden be making seven figures a year
right uh this is the dream this shit's
so hard man you know I
that's the thing like have you ever done
the Enneagram no do you know what the
Enneagram is it's kind of like a better
Myers-Briggs I'm a huge fan of it and
I'm a type seven and type seven is the
Enthusiast and it's like the person who
like jumps from thing to thing and you
know gets excited by the shiny object
and a lot of entrepreneurs not
surprisingly are type sevens you know I
had I grew up in a my dad obviously was
you know with a lot a lot of ownership
kind of an immigrant style you know
upbringing I had good partners it would
help me keep me focused but I think
there's a lot of entrepreneurial types
out there who are the enthusiasts are
like oh yeah that like unless they get
that going and then to run Services is
hard enough to scale Services you have

[12:01]
hard enough to scale Services you have
to become a great manager you have to
become a great trainer you have to get
good at writing things down you have to
build it's boring ass stuff that helps
you scale Services any business really
but Services business in particular you
got to give a lot of feedback to people
you got to do a lot of things that are
are the opposite of like launch
something on Twitter and see if it'll
grow and scale and and I think it's just
you either got to pair yourself with the
right person or you gotta create space
in your mind that those things are
important I I have the benefit of like
knowing they're important not
necessarily depending my strengths and
so that allowed me to to kind of manage
around them and find the right people to
to be around
um and get out of their way but if you
don't really like I see a lot of hype
guys and girls out there and you gotta
go run these things man they're hard
it's hard to run someone else's ad spend
explain to them why it's working or not
working manage their expectations put
together a plan you can deliver against
um we had this moment this is a crazy
story actually so four or five years ago
uh five six years ago McKinsey walked

[13:03]
uh five six years ago McKinsey walked
ampush in uh to Stars Lionsgate and so
you know there's this huge movie house
they're this like uh cable channel
and they had decided they wanted to
build an Ott service you know like HBO
Max of stars you know it's a
multi-billion dollar company they had a
300 million dollar annual marketing
budget going towards like linear and
billboards and all these random things
and so McKenzie's like well we're going
to take half of that 150 million and
starts ampush is going to build you guys
a digital marketing program so we built
it from scratch built all the Google ads
the Facebook ads they've been doing a
little bit things but nothing that
interesting
we grow this program it starts to scale
and it's they love it because it's so
much more measurable than the stuff
they're used to they're used like
premieres or whatever the week before
their biggest show Power premieres and
what would happen is their CPA when
their biggest show content would launch
would drop by like 90 right their best
show is about to show that's when all
the sign ups happen and that's when you
spend the most money and then when their
shows aren't running you pull back the
spend and we did all this optimization I

[14:02]
spend and we did all this optimization I
think we were like two or three weeks
out before their biggest show and the
Facebook pixel breaks meaning all of us
and McKenzie had been I don't know if
they had been running it's something
they basically said well no keep
spending guys like and we said no no we
don't think we should keep spending this
no keep spending so the CPA went up to
like 300 they say keep spending we keep
spending and then all of a sudden
they're like we're like well why can't
we get the CPA back down I'm like well
we told Facebook that we were okay with
300 Acquisitions their pixel now thinks
that they're not it's not gonna work and
so this thing gets at their CMOS
involved their CEO gets involved I'm on
a call I get dragged down to La they're
like what is going on Jesse we pay you
guys 5 million a year in fees like
figure this out what is happening and I
said guys we need to delete this pixel
we need to go dark on Facebook for a
week and then we need to reboot with new
pixels by show or something like I had
some strategy that involves shutting off
Facebook is in the room with me and
they're like no we don't agree with that
plan and I was like I bet my account I
bet the account guys if I'm wrong
then take take this you know because we

[15:01]
then take take this you know because we
every quarter one of our clients pixels
got all [ __ ] up on Facebook and we
knew the plan and so we did the plan
finally they agreed and like the first
few days were dicey but then once we
turned it back on everything kind of
normalized again right ahead of their
biggest Premiere and then like whatever
everyone thought I was a savior but
there was a point to the story which was
like you know the you have to agencies
are hard they're hard you you you you
live in St Louis you get this call
you're you know you're on the hook right
you're on the hook like yeah we got down
this road because yeah you were on the
hook for someone else's results to
explain it to them to help them
understand it and to be able to like
take the risk and put things on the line
for it and it's not even yours and even
if you do it you get you know 10 of
spend or something like that and yeah so
it just part of the reason I got excited
about starting Adventure Studio was
getting to own the businesses and not
you know not doing it on on behalf of
someone else and so I think if they seem
like great idea does but in reality

[16:00]
like great idea does but in reality
they're very challenging businesses
another way to think about it is it's
almost like you know you're on the hook
and like you're going fishing you're on
the hook you catch a fish but you don't
get to keep the fish you just get to
keep the lure totally like you keep a
small piece of it you know the hope is
that you get a bunch of lures and and
that you can diversify and you know
you're not just you know focused on
whale fishing because if you're just
whale fishing like as you know like
that's another downside to agencies
which is churn
and clients churn
yeah I mean they churn and our little
trick we learned around this from the
folks at Red Ventures was to get long
wind down Provisions in the agreements
and it's funny because I'll tell this to
agency owners and you'll see their head
just explode when when we talk about it
and you know most of them are working
month to month with a week and and
they'll say well how would I say it's
like well tell them that you can't fully
invest in the account unless you have 60
days of notice so that you can properly
readjust your resources it's better for

[17:01]
readjust your resources it's better for
them it's better for you and they're
like oh wow and I'm like just imagine
how your life changes if you have 60
days notice before someone can actually
fully pull back the revenue and churn
but I think it goes back to maybe your
original point which is like people
start these businesses because they
think they're easy and and whatever and
they're actually it's that's never a
good reason to start a business but at
the same time you look at you know
growth assistant in in that business is
doing well like what why do you think
that service based business is
doing so well
um like is there a framework for
starting a successful agency does that
exist I think
um you know some of the things I would
think a lot about are I've been thinking
about this a little bit lately I think
number one is
I think it's important to figure out
what you want and what you're trying to
Aspire for right so do you want to grow
something to run it and make money do
you want to grow it to sell it do you
want to raise money like what what game
are you playing
um you know there's a one of my mentors

[18:00]
um you know there's a one of my mentors
though says what game are you playing
and then how do you win that game and
like how do you win is where everybody
focuses but what game are you playing is
actually usually the more important
question so what game are you gonna play
okay I want to start an agency I wanted
to get to 2 million ebitda a year
or 10 million ebitda what do you want I
mean there's very different answers to
that question how long were you willing
to take all that stuff then the next
question is like to me what's your
unfair advantage and this by the way
this is true for all businesses not just
service but but like what what do you
know and typically like it has to be a
multiple like it has to be a crossover
of at least two maybe three things that
you really like because normally in the
case of growth assistant like I knew
growth marketing well I knew offshore
well also you know Adrian had built a
lot of recruiting engines and that sort
of thing like there has to be a lot of
things crossing over and then you go oh
now I think I can be in the top five
percent of these things because even any
of them individually you're probably not
in the top five percent so what's your
unfair Advantage the next thing is like
I always think of like building your

[19:00]
I always think of like building your
one-page offer sheet like productizing
your scope and what you sell is it five
thousand a month is it 2 000 a month is
it 10 000 a month and then also solving
for gross margins inherent to that offer
so it has to be something that you can
push out and deliver and you're already
thinking about having at least 60 gross
margins so that you can go out and like
it's like you know because once you
shape the front of the offer and then
people want to buy that offer then the
whole part of the business is how do you
deliver that offer at that margin like
how do you consistently deliver the
quality of that at that margin and
that's step three step four is is like
go out and sell to people especially
people you know or people who know you
know right like people who are going to
be friendly is I'm pretty honest about
where the things are I'm like hey this
is new this is a new thing we're doing
right now like what do you think about
this uh and then and then the last I
think most important Miss is like you
got to deliver something amazing on the
other side that's a critical and then
once you deliver that amazing thing on
on the other side you have to figure out
how you're going to do it without being
involved as the founder or the CEO
that's like that part takes anywhere

[20:00]
that's like that part takes anywhere
from six months to six years which is
how can that thing happen when I'm not
involved and I always like remember at
ampush the Zen moment was like our sales
guy closed the deal our onboarding team
onboarded it the customers you know the
clients success person brought it on and
they did the services for it and the in
in finance team invoice and collected
the money and I had nothing but bullet
point updates like I nothing hit my I
didn't have to get involved at all and I
was like oh this is starting a business
and so yeah I think it's that last part
is where I usually tell people I was
just talking Alex Lieberman about this
you know he's starting one of these uh
influencer copywriter things for for
people building their personal Brands
and it's like you know you have five or
ten customers let's say how do you make
sure that it's less than 25 of your time
and they're getting a better experience
that may take you months like to
actually get to that point but that's
the point where you can scale and then
you have to hire and kind of plug people
back into that model consistently and
see where it goes so that's the last
part of it I think the other thing that
I would say in my case in both the case

[21:00]
I would say in my case in both the case
I think of ampush and growth assistant
you know you got to ride some Trends you
know I think like we rode Facebook I
mean that was the best wave ever right
there was a many many multi-year period
where we were the only like one of the
few companies who could do Dr on
Facebook
um and then for growth assistant this is
whole offshore Trend especially for
marketing like that's that's a new thing
it's not it's not a thing that's
everywhere and and I think there's a lot
of people starting these things that
they don't have any uh you know they're
not writing any Trends they're not
writing any sort of secular Tailwinds
behind that well it's a double Trend
which is one
from you know covid force a lot of
companies to go to a remote and then the
second trend is a lot of companies are
looking at Cost cutting yes and and
marketing is I I think this demand for
growth marketing Talent versus Supply is
way out of whack there's like not enough
people who know how to do things on
marketing and so plugging in people from
offshore and one of the interesting
things we've seen actually one of the
funny selling points we have especially

[22:00]
funny selling points we have especially
when we're talking to more senior people
for growth assistant is growth assistant
helps you retain your own team
like what like yeah you hire we're not
talking about the talent our talent
we're talking about the talent scarce on
your side so you don't want to lose this
awesome growth lead or this awesome
Facebook ads person and if you make them
do all the crappy work all the time and
you don't have a growth assistant
They're Gonna Leave You know if you have
them sitting there uploading ads for
four hours every day every other day
like they're not gonna like their job so
a growth assistant it takes on the work
they don't want to do and guess what
that person is going to stick around
longer
um and you we're starting to see that
exciting Trend where people move
companies and they're like hey I need
some growth assistance now and so I
think that's also been a big Trend
around you know marketing as a talent
it's kind of like engineering like
there's always been this missing
unlimited demand for engineering Talent
if you can find it and that's it's
really a supply driven game and I think
the same thing's happening in marketing
you talked about unfair Advantage a lot
of people listening to this are going to
be like easy for you Jesse you just sold

[23:02]
be like easy for you Jesse you just sold
you know ampush and have a hundred
thousand or whatever Twitter followers
or easy for you Greg you know you have
the this big community of people that
you can just
seed ideas to my question to you is does
everyone have an unfair Advantage yeah
like if you're I think the younger you
are I think the younger
your college student just starting off
like you know you're living in a you
know small town in India and you don't
have a huge Network either on social or
in your own town city whatever yeah I
think the the younger you are maybe the
harder it is to have a super valuable
unfair advantage
but you definitely have some unfair
advantage and I don't I don't mean to
say that it should be the end-all be-all
of your entrepreneurial career but it's
gonna make starting something easier
there's we have an intern this summer
who who goes to Duke and he manages the
tick tock for Duke basketball and I'm
like he's super entrepreneurial he's

[24:00]
like he's super entrepreneurial he's
amazing at he's doing all these
different you know stuff and he's like
what should I start Jesse and I was like
well what do you know really well and I
was like you know how to get into Duke
you should start a social you know Tick
Tock channel for how to get into Duke
and sell people a 50 or 100 guide you
know that it and I was like maybe you
sell it to a thousand people a month or
something like that you know I don't
know there's probably five million
people who apply to these these top
schools or whatever and I'm like it's
just enough to get you going and you're
gonna learn more through that process
and you're going to build other unfair
advantages as you do it
um and that's a big part of of getting
anything going we didn't we didn't know
anything about digital marketing when I
was 25 when we started ampush we knew
numbers and data and we had a you know
decent network from our friends in
college and other worlds and we just use
the things we we had we you know and we
tried to squeeze the most out of them
that we could and then we learned as we
went how to do more and more of those
different things so I think it's it I
think it's strange when someone doesn't
know anything about anything and they're
like they pick a random sector and they
start going in at it like there's some
people who can do that and it works but

[25:00]
people who can do that and it works but
the vast majority of people you know
it's a real struggle there's some people
who well first of all if you're
listening to this you have an unfair
Advantage yeah like if you're if you're
listening to this you beat 99.9 of
people because you're going out there
and you're trying to gain information to
better yourself you have some unfair
Advantage now there's going to be a
group of people who will tell themselves
who are not listening to this but who
will tell themselves I don't have an
unfair advantage and who play kind of
like that victim
mentality and I feel like you have
access to the internet you have an
unfair Advantage period yeah and I think
again remember it's multiple things my
definition of it is it's multiple unique
intersection points of who you are so if
you're in a town a small town in India
but you do you read Twitter it's like
okay you're you know you speak Hindi
you're in the small town you have access
to all these people and you read Twitter
okay those are enough unfair advantages
for you to construct something that's
going to be of value to somebody
probably it's educating those young

[26:02]
probably it's educating those young
Indian children about chat gbt or
something like that right there's always
some unfair Advantage when you look at
enough vectors of your life overlapping
that you're going to be the top five
percent of that thing and that's a great
place to just get going
so moving on a little bit to unbloat I
look at that and I'm like why is this
guy
creating a you know on like I first of
all like a d2c product like he he he's
got this like cash flowing you know
eight figure business that's doing
really well and then I'm looking at that
I'm like oh man that is probably so hard
to like go and find the product and
create it and create the brand and dude
like take out the Facebook ads why did
you why did you what got you excited
about that and where's what's the
opportunity that you're saying that
someone like me is not saying yeah it's
a good it's a fair question you know
it's it's uh I had built I had helped so
many Brands grow you know Hubble
contacts Dollar Shave Club Birchbox I

[27:00]
contacts Dollar Shave Club Birchbox I
mean you name it we had helped them
scale and if not scale built their
customer acquisition from the ground up
and so I think more than anything I was
like man I want to do this myself like I
want to do I actually know what I'm
doing is it actually different if I own
the brand or is it just gonna feel the
same you know I kind of said all right
well I know what works on these things
like high margin recurring Revenue
solves a real problem and has fun
marketing angles like okay so I kind of
had this formula you know this idea in
my mind of what could work and high
margin recur like you know you get into
the medicine supplement area pretty
quickly I was also trying to find what
else fit that profile that's done really
well and erectile dysfunction was like a
I don't know there's like at least three
multi-billion dollar d2c Brands started
off erectile dysfunction so it's like I
want to find something as big as that
and so we went and talked to seven or
eight doctors and asked them a bunch of
questions but the main question we asked
them was what's the one thing people
complain to you about that they can't
that you don't have a good answer for
and we got 43 different issues from foot
doctors and tummy whatever and we
literally just searched them try to see

[28:01]
literally just searched them try to see
the search volume how much Amazon volume
and then like are there products on the
market for them and only one issue was
as big as erectile dysfunction it was
bloating and it was like wow I would
just never have guessed that right I'm
sure you wouldn't have guessed that
either
that it's searched more often than Ed
um and so we're like well what is it and
and we actually started talking to
people and what tell me about you you
blow what does that what does it feel
like what does it look like and really
there was two and then we started
talking to kind of the people who make
you know stuff and supplements trying to
figure out what causes it and how do you
solve it and really it like came into
Focus for two reasons I think one is
similar to Ed it isn't not just a
medical issue it's like a very
distressing emotional issue because
nobody and especially women and
especially pre-menopausal women who tend
to be the biggest customers they want
they don't want to feel fatter or look
fatter than they are like they don't
want to gain weight and like it's a it's
a stressful issue it makes them like
want to go home from the gym or not go
out for the night
um like oh wow okay and then the second

[29:00]
um like oh wow okay and then the second
thing was like it's pretty solvable like
there's four reasons primarily why
people blow they don't digest food they
don't poop they have like issues with
their diet you know their digestive
system of the bacteria or whatever and
they're not getting enough of certain
things
and you can kind of solve all of it and
we like went out and looked at all the
skus on the market and realized you'd
have to buy four or five skus to get all
the things you need and we sort of just
did the dumb entrepreneur thing where we
said can you put this all in one pill
and the manufacturer was like it's like
an expensive pill but you can do it so
we're like all right let's let's try
that let's throw it all into one pill so
that was kind of how we got started with
it and then running the Facebook ads I'd
say definitely has been more challenging
than I expected but but you know the
business is at about 3 million in sales
it's making a little bit of money it's
only 14 months old I think like for the
most part I've been pretty happy to say
like a lot of the things that we built
at ampush and I learned over those 10
years has translated into being able to
like get this thing off the ground
successfully
um it's not perfect by any means but but
like there's a lot of opportunity I see
in it and

[30:02]
in it and
um and like we think it's the first of
many things we'll launch like that yeah
I think I actually think that there's
probably some commonalities that exist
uh between unbload and growth assistant
so I think the you know just unbloating
is a trend that you like I just been in
my own life just hearing more and more
people talk to me about I feel so
uploaded I feel so uploaded seeing it on
Tick Tock like I've Just Seen stuff
people taught how to stop bloating yeah
so I think you just like you tap into
that I also think that both growth
assistant and unbloat have really good
names like and enough people don't talk
about how important the name yeah is to
the success of some of these products
but unbloat.me I think is your url which
I think is really really high quality
the funny thing is you know we did a
painted door test to figure it out I
don't know if you've ever done one of
those but we had five completely
different brand names and like basically

[31:00]
different brand names and like basically
had the like fake brand where we were
like sign up for 20 off of the launch
and I think one of the brands was
feather one was rhythm
um I forget the other two and then
unbloat and like we spend 500 on each
just to see kind of click-throughs and
sign ups and unblow it was off the
charts relative to the other four yeah
just it's you look at it and you know
what it does uh you look at growth
assistant you know what it does so that
that feels very it just feels very
Gateway X now that I'm starting to see
what what you're creating which is
really cool that you're creating and I
think a lot of people should think about
this is how do you how do you think
about your values or your culture of
creating new products and maybe you're
just doing this it sounds like you're
doing this a bit subconsciously but
there's that and then I think you know
recurring Revenue you you have a
recurring Revenue component a lot of
testimonials and stuff like that a lot
of credibility
how do you think about paid versus
audience so
to me growth assistant correct me if I'm

[32:01]
to me growth assistant correct me if I'm
wrong grew a lot from
Twitter people talking about it uh it
feels like I'm bloat has grown more from
a paid marketing perspective how do you
think about organic versus paid when
you're creating new products yeah I mean
I'll much rather have organic or paid if
I can you know it's interesting I I'm
probably to a fault I under template
businesses because I just don't believe
that you can you can put everything in a
box and think it's going to work out a
certain way well I have a question for
you why wouldn't you have said if you
prefer organic to paid why wouldn't you
just look at start unbloat and just be
like okay everyone we are not gonna
spend one dollar on paid in the next 12
months just so we can build the muscle
for building audiences building
communities I think that's a good idea I
we started the first few months with
like Hey we're only going to do Tick
Tock organic to learn it
and you know we just didn't make the

[33:02]
and you know we just didn't make the
progress I think I would have liked to
make and I think you you know there's a
constant interplay between the people
running the businesses and different
skill sets and different things that
start to play out and you know you can't
you you have to you have to balance
those two things out with one another
all the time right and I think one of
the things that makes this model work
and and obviously one of the liabilities
like I can't be everywhere at all times
right or if I did want to be everywhere
at all times I'd have to go much slower
I'd have to do fewer things and it's
like okay first spend five years
learning how to audience build and
Community build use Jesse's genius at
doing this because I know how to do it
then we're going to learn how to like
disseminate that out to different things
which which could have been an option
for how we approach this and but but we
didn't we you know and so I think we
tried it we gave it I don't know three
or four months the team was not able to
come up with enough creative with it I'm
sure if I you know if I'd spend more
time we would have given us a better
shot at doing that and I said well we
knew we do know the paid media Playbook
Let's Get Enough scale in this thing and
that's going to be able to fund future

[34:00]
that's going to be able to fund future
ability to test different things let's
get that going and the other thing is
like that is a core skill set of mine or
core thing I know I know like I don't
know Tick Tock organic now I know
Twitter organic but just I learned that
On My Own by doing it over the last two
or three years so I don't know I'm a
little bit more random like I don't need
again templatized structured ways like I
think every business kind of Finds Its
Own Way and I think there's different
unfair advantages along the way I think
you can get better at certain things I'm
not huge on the like let's just do you
have to do it this way like find a way
the the way is not necessarily like I
don't have religion around it let's talk
about Kahani is that how I pronounce it
SAS product you've got your service
service based business you got uh your
d2c business and then you've got a SAS
business why'd you start that where was
the opportunity and what's interesting
to you about SAS yeah I think the the
SAS one I mean this one has actually
been the hardest probably by far
um for me at least in you know I think
and and maybe the right at least so like
it's the one furthest away I think from

[35:01]
it's the one furthest away I think from
what I know the other two are sort of
like decomposed amps like selling things
to brands on one side and then the other
thing's running ads which is sort of
what I did for 10 years you know I I
think this one was hey what's a big
what's a big bet we can go take and try
to figure out a solution for
and it was like Hey the Ecom experience
just seems old
and and seems really boring and
meanwhile you know we're on Tick Tock
and Instagram and they're so so
immersive there's vertical media you're
tapping you're swiping why isn't the
Ecom experience like that also and so
the first product we launched was
basically stories for the Ecom
experience so you could go into an Ecom
site and you could tap those circles at
the top and you'd be in the stories
experience and this this was a really
good lesson for us you know I think
every single person who sees it goes wow
that is super cool and then
they're like all right I gotta go and
you're like well when are you gonna buy
this and they're like I don't know I got
some other things I got some other
priorities on my list and so you know it

[36:00]
priorities on my list and so you know it
became a solution chasing a problem uh
it's just no we just noticed that very
quickly within six months of launching
and we had you know we had some decent
mrr and distribution but it just wasn't
you could just tell it wasn't
necessarily capturing anyone's
challenges like we we went to shop talk
and I had the sales guy from both
companies there and from Kahani and
growth assistant and growth assistant
you know they do all this matching stuff
the growth system guy got 25 meetings
that kind of guy got five meetings and
it was just very clear and now the five
meetings that Connie got were
interesting Nike was one of those
meetings and we were why Nike we asked
him why'd you meet us they go well we
need it we need better ways to do
discovery on our site and we think this
is really Innovative and blah blah blah
and so that one has been one where I'd
say we're definitely dealing with the
more classic product Market fit issue
we're trying to reboot the product now a
little bit because the signal we got was
that people really want ways to leverage
their influencer content and repurpose
it and then the other big one was like
if you can help growth marketers lower
CPA
that's when there's a real people will
pay you for something like this cool
little thing at the top like they may

[37:00]
little thing at the top like they may
buy it but it's just not that
interesting for them and so that one has
been an interesting one but but I think
like SAS I mean obviously it's it's it
scales it's software it's recurring
Revenue I think there's plenty of
problems I have a decent understanding
of but Building Product is hard and like
one of the big differences I learned
between services and and software is in
Services a growth assistant or ampush
you could kind of tell me your problem
in a vague term you know here's my issue
and I'd say well here's a human this
human can probably adjust themselves to
solve that really nuanced specific
problem you have in software the code
has to do that and that means you really
have to get intimate with a problem and
understand in a really deep way and I
think like it's just a very different
challenge how do you know when to quit
so how do you know with Connie you know
you're at this moment where it's like
okay we've got to change this we've got
to move this uh
uh you've got some signals that are
suggesting like wow there's something
here but you've got others being like
I don't know how do you how do you know

[38:00]
I don't know how do you how do you know
when to just put it up on acquire.com or
just like
shutter it versus like we need to double
down because you know Nike is huge and
they spend millions and millions of
dollars a year you know Nike itself
could be a five million dollar a year
account there's no perfectly right
answer for it I think from my
perspective my point of view
and like I I used to chase things a
little too long I think early in my
career and learned this from the guys at
Red Ventures and and Rick my mentor
there you know it's a little bit like
there's a there's an adage in trading
that you never go broke by taking a
profit and what they mean by that is
like yeah you may sell the stock early
but if you always sell when you're when
you're when your stocks up a little bit
you're never going to go broke you're
always going to make a little bit of
money and yeah you may give up some
upside whatever
I think the entrepreneur's version of
that is like you never go broke by
making a quick pivot
and so you know I think how long have we

[39:00]
and so you know I think how long have we
given it a year in change like I I think
the to me it's like no more than a year
you know and six months of like really
out there selling it pushing it pressing
it hundreds of conversations most great
businesses you know they start out great
meaning and yeah there's a classic story
of the pivot but even the pivot it's all
I was two years in and I kept going but
I did something totally different and
that thing took off right the idea that
something you've done for multiple years
and then one day it takes off I mean
again you can also hold a stock too long
and lose your ass like it's it's the
that may work for some people or the
Laura is it there but I'm one of these
people who goes I don't actually care
why it's not working anymore it's just
at some point I gotta blow the whistle
and I gotta I gotta like you know re
reshuffle the deck and and do that and
so I think it's like arbitrary it's you
know a year six months a year like it's
it's not that long yeah I feel like the
the Hallmark of a good multi-preneur is
someone who who knows when to shudder
things even though closing things down

[40:00]
things even though closing things down
or selling them those are those are
really hard to do because you're kind of
admitting yeah you're admitting defeat
and
as multipreneurs we're kind of just like
we've got a lot of conviction in the
ideas that we want to put out
um especially when we're putting it out
publicly right if you're putting it out
on Twitter and you're like hey you know
this is the future of shopping and then
six months later it's like you're like
no it's not here's here's the thread on
we're shutting it down yeah eat some
popcorn uh so it's it's well I think
it's the most brutal part is like you
know you you hire people I care a lot
about the people who I work with and
then you know in this case we had to let
go of a few people like you know there's
the people join they sign their careers
up for it and then you're just honest
and you say guys I just don't think this
is going to be what we thought it was
and you know I hope over we have enough
scale of Gateway X over time to absorb
people into different parts so it
doesn't their jobs don't have to be on
the line but we're not quite there yet
and that that part's you know it's it's

[41:00]
and that that part's you know it's it's
your idea your things and then having a
big human impact on on other people and
I think that's something you know I
never want to get comfortable with but
but it's a big part of of what we do if
someone wants to build their own Gateway
acts if someone wants to become a
multi-preneur
how to what what advice do you have to
them to do to be successful you know if
I could do it all over again
I would have remembered that document
earlier in my my journey at ampush I
think the the best multipreneurs you
know we talk about this on Twitter me
and you and people are doing it but like
you know Mark Zuckerberg is a multi
multi-preneur yeah you know how many p l
is running like he's got WhatsApp he's
got Instagram he's got the big blue app
he's got his Oculus stuff he's got some
AIS I mean there's a lot of
organizations you know and Elon Musk and
him aren't all that different even
though they're technically separate
companies right or GE or Microsoft or

[42:00]
companies right or GE or Microsoft or
Red Ventures or apple I mean these are
all anyone running these scaled
businesses is running multiple things
like there's just no way they're not and
and the same challenges come up you got
to have the right peoples you got to
have the right culture operating systems
in place all these different pieces of
it so if I if I could do it all over
again or if I was giving someone advice
I would say
find one thing like find one business
and just go really hard at it for five
to seven years and and make it enough
scale so that you can either sell it and
make a lot of money or it generates
enough cash flow that you can you have
some flexibility and make sure along the
way you built a culture and you train to
people so that you can be done you know
you can move yourself out of the
day-to-day at around year five or year
six and then from there start to like
expand out into multiple different areas
be using the unfair advantages you
developed over those five to seven years
right but I think the idea of people
come to me yeah I don't think I could
have done this I couldn't I tried to do
this at 25 I had the document and I

[43:00]
this at 25 I had the document and I
totally forgot about because I didn't
even know how to do anything and so I
think you need
some foundational skills knowledge
Capital have to a certain point now in
this case I started Ambush I learned all
these things I sold it now I'm doing it
in this new format and there's some
challenges with that you know in and of
itself but I think you need a foundation
I don't think it's a thing you can do
with starting at age 25. I just don't
um there's this you know Michael Rubin
I'm sure you you saw him it was so funny
when I was 19 there was a Wharton summer
camp
and we met him
and at that point you know his business
like it's just just to think about where
a guy like that started he had he had
three ski shops and he had just launched
Sports Authority's website as GSI
Commerce which was his first business it
was this business that took over the
dot-coms or created.coms for retailers
and fully operated them on the back end
and he ran that business for 12 years
I mean it was the most unglamorous
business you could imagine he had

[44:00]
business you could imagine he had
warehouses for Sports Authority and he'd
run all these outcomes and he had the
same he was kind of a big agency because
eventually they'd want to run it
themselves you know I don't know if you
know his story but they you know his
story at all I do uh yes and he sells it
to eBay then he spins back the best
assets to himself and the best of the
best assets like his brain clearly like
like I did with unbload he was like
what's the one group of people who's
always going to want to Outsource this
that have the highest value apparel out
there oh sports teams okay I'm gonna
sell my whole business to eBay but then
I'm gonna buy Fanatics back now Fanatics
is worth 10 times whatever GSI was ever
worth but that was like a 25 year
journey I mean he spent a lot of time
grinding and learning as he went and so
I think I think you need a good five to
ten year period of
depth and building fundamentals and then
from there you can spawn into launching
multiple different things using those
unfair advantages yeah fnatics is
actually a client of late checkout and
dispatch or design subscription and just
learning about that business has been

[45:01]
learning about that business has been
like nuts nuts I did a business
breakdown on I don't know if you've ever
heard that podcast that I record but we
interviewed their main investor at
Insight Venture and it's a Nutty
business yeah it's pretty cool but like
but like again he couldn't have started
that without 10 to 15 years at GSI
Commerce which was this like really
unknown unheard of whatever business it
was a grind yeah I think the the MVP of
being a multipreneur is can you create
content in one Niche that people
resonate with like can you before you
create product Market fit can you create
content Market fit in one topic then can
you do it in two topics and then can you
build one product and then can you build
two products and then it's just you
layer it on as you get older it's
definitely easier in your unfair
Advantage grows
um but you know unless I I don't want to
dissuade the 17 year old who's listening
to this who
you know because I think there's you
just just start yeah just start I mean
that's always the answer is just try to

[46:01]
that's always the answer is just try to
do something yeah I you know my one of
my biggest mistakes in college and I
always tell this when I talk to college
kids is like I always used to joke my
brain was bigger than my legs so I could
think I was a Wharton kid I was like oh
here's the market size and oh you know
we had a we had a teacher of business in
college that did 200 000 a year in sales
and like 70 000 need but uh like it's a
good business
for college kids and we thought we we
thought about expanding it once to be a
national college we basically did bulk
apparel for all the fraternities and
sororities that was the business
and our Big Wharton brains are like ah
the Market's too small this is not a
good idea and meanwhile like our legs
didn't know how to actually build a
business like that but just learning
anything we could have gotten you know
to something that would have been very
meaningful and actually one of my
co-founders friends started a similar
business on his campus and he came up
with this genius idea of like I'm gonna
have uh I'm gonna sell a sponsorship to
like Pepsi on the t-shirts and provide
them for free to sororities and
fraternities and I'm gonna make twenty

[47:01]
fraternities and I'm gonna make twenty
dollars a shirt instead of seven dollars
a shirt and he turns it into a
multi-million dollar business that he
ends up selling right and so the lesson
is just like just start get things going
solve the other thing I always tell
college kids is try to get your just
your hall on an app before you think you
can sell the world on something can you
get the 20 people who you see every day
to do it like to use a common app to
like plan groceries or something just
you build the app build a simple app and
I'm like you'll learn how hard it is to
get something done like to build
something and that and that lesson is
super valuable that's why I think
building an audience or building a
community even like a WhatsApp group
chat or a group chat is such a great
place to train yourself on can I create
something that people are going to want
to do because people are busy they don't
have time to download your app unless
you're Mark Zuckerberg and you're
launching threads
um you know so I think that's why I love
just starting with audiences and

[48:00]
just starting with audiences and
communities anyway yeah it's one of my
earliest pieces of advice too to people
is they're like oh I want to start a
business that sells life insurance to
Millennials and blah blah blah I'm like
well can you just why don't you just
start a newsletter for them and see if
they'll just like read about what you're
talking about right before you sell them
something yeah you give them information
for free exactly it'll actually read it
totally and they're like oh that's
really hard actually yeah Jesse if
people want more of you where do they go
and follow you in the journey uh Twitter
and threads I guess Jay Fuji uh jspu jji
Jessie gateway.xyz
