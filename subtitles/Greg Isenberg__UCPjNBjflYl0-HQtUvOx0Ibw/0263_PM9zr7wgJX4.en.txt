[00:00]
all right we got Joe MOA on the Pod
co-founder CEO of crew
AI uh probably one of the leading if not
the
leading uh AI agent platforms what are
we learning today Joe well first of all
thank you so much for having me uh I
think it's going to be a lot of fun so
we're going to be building a few
different things I was thinking about
your community and I was like what if if
we use AI agents to do things like data
enrichment so given that you're t
respect a lead it finds information
about them automatically writes an email
sent to them but then we take it like it
up a notch and we kind of like produce a
real time report and kind of like
generate a PDF I don't know just trying
to have some fun and if we get the time
we can do more fancy stuff towards the
end so I hopefully hopefully have some
spare time at the
[Music]
end and okay that sounds good and I

[01:00]
end and okay that sounds good and I
think could you explain you
know explain by the end of this episode
what are the tangible skills people are
going to get yes so by the end of this
you all should be able to BU Cru uh
fully understand what AI agents are how
to orchestrate them using crew Ai and
even deploy them into a production
environment if you want to use or free
tier on the Enterprise and you're going
to be able to do it there as well so
you'll be able to go now from this and
start building AI agents for yourself
and how to make processes and to be
clear there's like I'm not sponsored by
Joe at all like my incentive is to get
you people to build agents and make them
work for you because I know a lot of you
are Solo entrepreneurs solo preneurs
have a couple of employees or even you
have a business that has employees but
you're looking to have a army of Agents
do more work for you that's why I

[02:00]
do more work for you that's why I
brought Joe in um so without further Ado
maybe let's share our screen and and and
get to work I love that and it's good
that you point that out because honestly
with crew itself being like in startup
now we have a bigger team like there are
more people to help out in so many
fronts but from the GGO being able to
use AI agents to scale an AI agent
company was kind of like an interesting
kind like Inception like experience so I
I definitely can appreciate for folks
out there trying can like build
businesses how the idea of having an
agents automating certain processes can
be quite amazing actually um right all
right let me share my screen let's get
things going there we go all right so I
T about we start with a simple use case
and then we grow up into more complex
ones so let's Dy out what we're going to
be trying to do this one I think this
going to be an interesting one so in the
past especially when you're thinking
about using cases like about companies

[03:01]
about using cases like about companies
in general then start there's two things
that you really want to nail once that
you have a product or you're building a
product you want to make sure that you
do good marketing and you do good sales
right because that's not only like
Revenue but also an opportunity for you
to learn so you can learn what works
what doesn't work like what tracks with
your product and what doesn't so I
thought why don't we do something that
is able to do lead enrichment so let's
say you got a lead you want to learn
more about this person and this company
and there's a few questions that you're
trying to answer here once like is this
my ICP my ideal customer profile also is
this company a good match and like
should I actually spend some time
pursuing interviewing and trying to
understand more about them but then that
information alone like you you can do
only so much with it but could we also
use agents to take one step further and
make it actionable and say like all

[04:00]
make it actionable and say like all
right can we have ideas for how to use
our product given that we now learn
about this person so the agents will not
only do the enrichment and learn about
the company and learn about the person
they're going to come up with these
ideas on how they can use our product
and then afterwards can we just go ahead
and draft an email and kind of like
trying to reach out to them like hey
thank you for signing up um this is how
you could be using your product three
ideas for business business very excited
about it like let's chat so honestly I
think this kind of like a more
straightforward kind of use case we can
start building with no code but I want
to take a step further after this and
even further if we get the time but
before we get there let's get to
building so for this one because I want
to start very simple I'm going to start
with no code if you go on crew AI
Enterprise there's a free tier that you
can create an account there's some
setting up that you need to do but once

[05:01]
setting up that you need to do but once
you have done it you got to have access
to crew Studio crew studio is basically
a way for you to create AI agents by
chatting like you can chat your way into
an automation so for this one let's try
let's try to create one ourselves now I
have something in here for us to use and
I'm going to read it out loud with you
all so the idea is I want to create a
crew that will be able to research both
a person and a company based on their
name email domain of the company I
wanted to make sure to learn most that I
can about their business so their role
their seniority the company level how
big the company is what is their
industry their culture and three ideas
about how they can use AI agents and at
end I want to produce an email that is
friendly it doesn't sound like an AI
offers to explain how they cuse agents
on the business call and basically
describing a little more about how I
want that email to sound like all right

[06:00]
want that email to sound like all right
so now I have a plan right the outputs
the fully crafted email ready to send
including the insights there's going to
be three inputs for this agents the name
uh the email and the domain it's
suggesting to use three tools a serer da
um scrape website and GT3 let's remove
this so we don't need we don't need
gpt3 uh then three agents one for doing
the researching one for do do analysis
another one for doing the Mao Drafting
and four tasks so what you see here is
that with AI agents and crew AI
specifically you don't need to have one
agent to one task it's not necessarily
one to one so you can see the first one
is doing by the research agent that is
basically researching the thing the
person the second one is is researching
the company and it's also done by the
research agent and then the third one is
where the analysis agent comes in and
then the emo agent comes in after that
so this feels good let's create our crew
plan quick break in the Pod to tell you

[07:01]
plan quick break in the Pod to tell you
a little bit about startup Empire so
startup Empire is my private membership
where it's a bunch of people like me
like you who want to build out their
startup ideas now they're looking for
content to help accelerate that they're
looking for potential co-founders
they're looking for uh tutorials from
people like me to come in and tell them
how do you do email marketing how do you
build an audience how do you go viral on
Twitter all these different things
that's exactly what startup Empire is
and it's for people who want to start a
startup but are looking for ideas or
it's for people who have a startup but
just they're not seeing the traction uh
that they need so you can check out the
link to Startup empire.co in the
description and that's going to
basically take this UI uh up a notch so
we can actually see visually your tasks
and agents so here you can see profile

[08:00]
and agents so here you can see profile
researcher IDE generation email content
specialist and I can keep changing in
here if I want to so let's say that I
want to make this like a senior email
accountant specialist there you go um
and let's check like how they're doing
condu your research to together
information about individual domain this
that's their company domain all right
this this feels good let's do it
generate crew so this actually generates
the code for you if you want to download
it or allows you to deploy this right
away if you really if you really want to
do that so in here you can see it's very
straightforward we have three tasks the
first one second one third one we can
change the tasks can change the agents
uh one thing that I do want to do is for
example the research profile was using
serer and scraping the generating ideas
is I I think I want to also it to use
ser and scraping just in case it wants
to go a little like more broad on
searching for ideas online and the third

[09:01]
searching for ideas online and the third
task uses no tools now the other thing
that I want to do is for the idea
generator let's do GPT 40 instead of 40
mini and for the email let's go a little
crazy Let's Lose on ow and mini uh so
that we can get like some extra Fen in
there so uh let's see if it's going to
work honestly ow and mini in my
experience for gentic behaviors
sometimes falls short um just because it
already has like chain off tot and B it
on it it tries to basically like figure
out everything itself without using any
tools and kind of like outsmart a little
bit what you're trying to do but hey
there we go so we have our initial crew
in here very simple what I'm going to do
is I'm going to deploy this right away
so that we can go ahead and test it but
we're going to also download the code so
let me go back into that so that we can
um so that we can start trying things
out all right there we go this is do

[10:02]
out all right there we go this is do
one yes so let's do download The Cone so
that we can uh change a few things about
this make it more complex go extra
custom again you don't necessarily need
to use this UI in the end of the day if
you want to create this Cruise locally
using only the open source you can do
crei
create and name of your crew and that
will basically ask ask you a few
questions around like all right what is
the provider oh sorry create crew there
you go it's going to ask you a few
questions about like what is our
provider so you can say ah open AI what
the model you want to use you can say
well I want all my agents to use gp4 o
Mei you can specify individual models
per agent down the road then Jo I had a
question I had a question about the
models you know I think a lot of people
get to that point and they're like yeah
I don't know which model to pick for
this particular task how should how
should people think about that that's a

[11:02]
should people think about that that's a
great question Greg so usually the way
that I think about it is like smaller
models like smaller or 7B 14b they they
don't work as well you can get them to
behave as agents but they usually take
even longer because they go in so many
blind alleys and keep like retrying
things so you definitely want to go like
my goto is GPT 40 meaning and that
usually works great that said you can
evaluate different models locally we
have a feature let me go into this new
crew that we
created name of your crew we have a
feature called crew AI test and what
that does is it allows you to test our
agents using many different models so
you can test like all right how does it
does with GPT 4 how it does with GPT
mini so you can get like how each model
works and what are the score that each
task gets so you get a an actual quality

[12:02]
task gets so you get a an actual quality
score an actual hallucination score yes
of course it's missing my uh my key let
me added this in there make sure that we
can get
this all right I'm going to just come in
here I get this nvar I have a key that I
created just for us
today and let me copy it there we
go open it I API key and I'm going to
put ours in here all right so what do
you can do in the open source is you can
run this command the create test and
what it does is basically run your
agents but it's going to try to
calculate um the task let me do just one
interation by the way um oh I think
maybe my key is
wrong all right let me get another key
one second

[13:00]
one second
classic classic yeah all right there we
go as you're uh as you're fig putting
that in I have a question around one of
the things that I I noticed you changed
was adding I think it was like a senior
writing correspondent or whatever you
added the word senior how how important
is like does that actually affect the
outputs of your crew if you if you write
senior to some extent yes I mean not
necessarily senior alone right but
because these agents they're kind of
like impersonating roles you do get
different behaviors depending on you do
get different behaviors depending on how
you give them like a different role so
you can actually replicate this on chat
GPT like if you ask jgpt to like give
you an assessment on uh a stock it's
going to give you kind of like a report
but if you say uh behave as an FCC kind
of like a proven kind of like a St
analyst it's going to give you a

[14:00]
analyst it's going to give you a
completely different answer even though
all the remaining of the prompt is you
the same so um it's one way that you can
steer the model to behave in a certain
way if you really want to go
there so um here you can see like I just
run it just for one execution just was
one model but you can see what would be
your task scores your crew over score
your execution time so you can actually
compare many models in this and you can
run this like many different times and
see what happens and if you want to take
this up a notch on the Enterprise side
of things that again there is a free
tier so you can try it out there is let
me see one of the agents that I did run
tests for maybe the pr review there is a
way where you can compare yeah there you
go you can compare many models so you
can see here GPT 4 mini
andring individual tasks score overall
crew score and execution time so you can
see that overall son it was better on a

[15:00]
see that overall son it was better on a
lot of this but it tooks way way longer
so probably I probably don't want to go
there but I might replace a task or two
to use sonin if I think this is
useful uh so yeah again you can create
all your agents with the CLI if you
really want to go there and you can run
all those things locally I just use the
UI in case for the folks that are less
tech savvy and they want to start with
something
simple totally and you know in terms of
output they're I would imagine they're
the same right using the interface or or
CLI yeah the output will be the same um
the the thing is once that you're using
the Enterprise that automatically
becomes an API right so that open UPS
like opportunity for you to kind like
interact with a few like different apps
uh and we can integrate for example with
like zaper on this one and I think this
could be like an interesting one but uh

[16:00]
could be like an interesting one but uh
it's essentially the same thing so for
example I
downloaded uh creating yes I downloaded
the crew that we just created on the UI
and if you open it up you can actually
get all your agents in here so you see
like the profile researcher is in there
you can see our senior one in there that
you mentioned senior email content
specialist right in there you can see
that they're using o mini and JY 40 and
4 mini so so all the codes in here the
code generator is also in here so you
can kind of like inspect and take it
like an a up a notch if you really want
to uh well all right so while this is uh
deploying it just to be good um what
we're going to do is I want to I want to
do something uh a little fancy for us
today so I want to make sure that we
create a zapier to run
this so by the way now that this is live

[17:03]
this so by the way now that this is live
I can actually again because it's an API
I can see what are the inputs that it
needs so we can see that need domain
email and company name I can actually
run this right here if I want to so we
can do a task real quick let's say ja
crew ai.com
uh let's see the domain
crew.com and the company is crew AI
let's do a kickoff
and you can use web hooks like if you're
more Technical and you want to like have
progress bars on your app and you have
to have other things um but you can also
just do pooling as well if you want to
just see like how are things going oh
this one failed great so we're going to
debug life that's going to be that's
going to be fun but the other thing that
you can also do if you don't want to use
the UI uh like the API you have a UI
that you can use in here where you can
basically create a card for your your
agents and again it's going to use the

[18:00]
agents and again it's going to use the
same inputs and they're going to pick it
up and they're going to work like
directly from here or if you want to you
can also export a UI you can export a
react component right from here and that
usually that said let's the bug let's
see what what going wrong with our crew
uh we actually have it in here so we
should be able to do create install to
install dependences and create IR run
just see what issues there we get create
IR run
and whatever broke it in there should
break it in here as
well the first run by the way you're
going to notice is the first run takes a
few extra seconds because it sets an
environment um just the environment for
you to actually run it there you go the
agent is missing in the following
description that's great all right so we
know how to fix this uh the thing is on

[19:02]
know how to fix this uh the thing is on
the task there is yes there is no agent
for or second task to generate ideas for
that we want our idea generator so let's
make sure that we get this in there and
there we go um this should now be fixed
if we run it again it should work and
this might be an actually a good way for
me to show how you can actually deploy
this using G as well so let's say that I
build this thing like uh I bu it
manually right with code I'm going to do
grag test make this private
boom so now what I want to do yeah there
you go it tried to run and me start up
in a I key that's great means that it's
working so now let's do get init make
this a repository let's do get ad so we
add everything
in let's just p out in

[20:01]
here and there you have
it yes so now we can deploy this grag
test uh crew and we can do it directly
in here there's a GitHub integration so
again if you didn't do through the UI
and you generated things you can come in
here and you can do grag test I can add
my separate API key my open AI key that
I have uh pre-registered and I can click
deploy and um and there you go we're
going to deploy this one uh similar
thing I guess I I should have checked if
all the agents were assigned on the UI
there in the other one so let me delete
this one and while that does its thing I
want us to set up a webflow website that
is going to use the screw so um I'm just
going to choose random template in here
Joe's fantastic website that sounds that
sounds right sounds right by the way Joe
is there any particular reason why you

[21:00]
is there any particular reason why you
chose webflow versus framer or another
another product uh no really I'm just
turning out to be a webflow customer so
I really like use them um but this
directly should work with anything out
there the end of the day it's an API
call so you should be good to
go so let me delete all this grid and
delete the spacer and I'm going to add a
form
F block there we go so we know there's
three feuds that we need for uh for our
thing so I'm going to duplicate can I
add a few directly I think I can so fud
no I'm going to duplicate this once all
right there we go so it's name uh email
address and the other one was company
domain if I recall correctly so let's do

[22:00]
domain if I recall correctly so let's do
company
domain so name should be good let's
check
settings yes name email address it's
good should be email let's check how
you're calling it on the C well I guess
it doesn't matter we can map it since
we're using zapier and here I'm going to
make sure that we do company
domain and we can call this domain
all right let's check if I did it all
right email name all right this feels
good let's publish it for
now and we can start to set up our zaper
so one thing that you will notice is
that we have a few Integrations we're
still beating out more again this is
something that you can do manually as
well if you're doing the open seource
round but if you're using Enterprise
there's a few integration one of them is
zapier another one's HubSpot another one

[23:01]
zapier another one's HubSpot another one
is laack so that kind of can help you
out with zapier on that you connected
you can actually do you can actually use
screw AI in here so let's say that we're
going to start with a web hook because
we're getting this request from
somewhere um let's go for it now
continue and we can test this URL I
think I have Postman open here somewhere
yes so there we go
and it's uh domain email and
name so let's add name in here
oh and let's
do J MOA there you go send it boom
request
successful test trigger we got a request
all the data is in there there you go
and now we can open create I and we can
actually choose to kick off a

[24:00]
actually choose to kick off a
crew and our crew should show up in here
assuming the deploy is done uh it is
grag Task there you go I think deploy is
two yeah it's a two happening there you
go provisioning once that we deploy in
we're going to see it load up exactly
the same feuds that we want in here so
we're going to see the name the domain
and um and the email show up in here so
that we can map from what we're getting
from this web hook and after this I'm
going to use resend again no specific
reason um just turn out to be a recent
customer I really like zenoh haha I
think he's doing a amazing job in
there and we can send an
email and uh we're going to use the same
email that we are getting from our
hook and oh that's not the two yeah
that's two from let's say no reply
um reply at

[25:01]
um reply at
crew.com subject we can say
um hey there let's
chat by the way for people who don't
know resend is is a way to send
transactional emails um so meaning you
know a transaction happens an email gets
in and they've also got like a really
beautiful um analytics platform um so it
is a it is beautiful again I'm not like
associated with with recent or crew or
anything I just it's a cool product um
and they're doing cool things yeah I
agree it's funny when you think about
email like it's not kind of like a your
your go-to kind of like startup if
you're trying to think about starting a
business feels like such a Consolidated
Market but uh I guess there you go there
do you have it all right quick ad break
let me tell you about a business I

[26:00]
let me tell you about a business I
invested in it's called boring
marketing.com so a few years ago I met
this group of people that were some of
the best SEO experts in the world they
were behind getting some of the biggest
companies found on Google and the secret
sauce is they've got a set of technology
and AI that could help you outrank your
competition so for my own businesses I
wanted that I didn't want to have to
rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to
depend on ads to drive customers to my
businesses I wanted to rank high in
Google that's why I like SEO and that's
why I use boring marketing.com and
that's why I invested in it they're so
confident in their approach that they
offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money
back guarantee who does that nowadays so
check it out highly recommend boring
marketing.com so while this is deploying
let me explain what we're going to be
doing next after this okay and we get
this working into to
end well I find that an email is fun but

[27:04]
end well I find that an email is fun but
it's kind of like a it's kind of like a
demo right like it's what you see a lot
of like other folks do as well I think
we can do a custom report custom PDF
report something that looks more fancy
more drafted towards specifically their
company with more specific like we
already doing all this enrichment we're
already like having this uh agents kind
of create these ideas on how they can
use it so why not like go one step
further do the craft report and then use
that to be sent on the
email
so the custom PDF report this is
something that you would hire typically
a junior marketing person to actually
put together take the data make it look
nice maybe you want a designer there or
or whatever but it's it's someone you're
paying you know in the US at least kind
of you know 50 to $80,000 a year um

[28:01]
of you know 50 to $80,000 a year um
you're saying basically you can just
automate this whole thing yeah I mean
what you can do is you can get like them
to do maybe a 10 play right and then
based off that 10 play you can like
preview the information so you still get
like that very nice high quality that
you would get in terms of like capturing
your ense and what you want to the PDF
to look but then what you get is kind of
like this very kind of like custom
reports per for customer so as soon as
someone sign up like as a lead they get
something and you can go a little crazy
on this you can put their company logos
you can put like a bunch of other things
I usually I I love when I think about
marketing and I'm going back to my CLEAR
bit days here um one thing that I would
think is I would love to send a lead
materials that they would like to show
in a meeting right like imagine saying
something so beautiful that they are
okay taking that and going back to their
team and so like oh let me show you what

[29:00]
team and so like oh let me show you what
we should be doing and how we should be
thinking about this so I think there's
something special about that and just
helping your champion in your like lead
and your customer to actually kind of
like uh get some props in there so uh
for that for this custom PDF report
we're going to need a template so let's
figure out how we can get a template
going uh eest way for me to generate
templates now is using chat GPT uh I
love it so so why don't we go to chat B
here real quick and I have a prompt in
here write me a custom
HTML that is pretty that I can export to
make a beautiful report there's a bunch
of typos in there but it should still
works just fine so while chat GPT is
writing in our deployment is done so we
can go back into our zapier and let's go
back into configure there we
go refresh results I want to get GR
test and refresh in here make sure that

[30:02]
test and refresh in here make sure that
we got there we go so we can now use our
a company it's not a company name so we
can
use domain here I guess I missed the
point on that one
email and domain again there you go that
should be okay all right this is good to
go test St is going to try to kick off
the screw in crei make that it works
there you go and you can get you get a
ky off ID in here you don't need to
worry about that like the integration is
going to figure itself out so it should
just work and then as the HTML we
basically want the crew result um into
this one and we can test the step make
sure it's all fine uh c. oh I think
there is a typo in here yes. there we go
continue
test

[31:00]
stab and there we go so we can publish
this one uh because we just trigger this
you can actually get to see the
execution in here uh we just run this 34
seconds ago we can go into the execution
we can see what the email looks like he
I hope this finds you well I have been
follow cre impressive Journey truly
inspired about the Innovation Solutions
here are a few AI agent ideas St for
crei driven workflows remote teams
automated compliance Dynamic customer
engagement I I would use those
ideas I think that fits into my alley
right
totally so then again we could optimize
the prompt to make sure that no subject
is included that doesn't have like this
interpolation your name like we we can
work around all that but let's call this
a win for now let's good to go um
there's a few extra matrics that we can
talk about eventually but I think this
should be good all right so now we have
our zapier we have our URL let's copy

[32:01]
our zapier we have our URL let's copy
this one we can go into our webflow we
can go into our form and we can add this
I'm going to add this both as action and
redirect just in case and
publish in meanwhile I'm going to check
my email just get it ready there we go I
got an
email and I want to make sure that
we now get the email end to end on this
one all right so we publish it let's
test
it
boom by the way let me I think I lost
reverse side there we go is back so this
is our landing page amazing landing page
future is now give give our email in
here so uh in here we're going to say
jur email.
my domain ci.com as well and I'm going

[33:01]
my domain ci.com as well and I'm going
to do
subit um H I guess expecting this to be
an email let me fix that in webflow real
quick this is not an email Feud uh
uh
so style maybe let's check this
out
settings domain domain email form there
we go there we go it's a plane publish
it there we
go nice all right so now we can refresh
this and we can
do
J J cre.com and the company domain is
cre.com and I can click submit and there
we go because I didn't add the proper
redirect it took me to um the Json thing

[34:00]
redirect it took me to um the Json thing
but it should now have a running
execution in here
stopped what was this C I stopped by
this error missing company name company
name is missing let's see what is the
request that we got from the web hook uh
data in data out so query string name oh
I guess it's sending a get request so
again post requests publish publish like
domains all right so let's go back
refresh and let's do it again jaw
mow H at crew.com and crew.com and do a
submit there we go let's see if it's
running now
there we
go it's running so while the crew runs

[35:03]
go it's running so while the crew runs
and we get our email and everything's
going let's check our PDF template uh
there we go we have a PDF template I'm
going to just copy this for now because
we're ready downloaded our crew I'm
going to do some of the work in here so
I'm going to create a folder here that
I'm going to call template and in here
I'm going to get a flyo that I'm going
to call pdf. HTML I'm going to paste our
PDF in there and let's see what that
looks like just to make sure that it's
nothing crazy s temp plates
PDF let me open this up and bring it to
screen all right it's okay for us to
start again you can do like all sorts of
crazy things in the end like because
it's HTML and we're going to convert
this in PDF you can just make sure that
it looks exactly how you want you could
have images across the whole thing but
that feels good enough now we want to
make sure that this the content of the
is completely Dynamic so what we're

[36:00]
is completely Dynamic so what we're
going to do in here is I'm going to
basically ask it to update and I'm using
csor here I read love I'm going to say
replace the text content with variables
we can
interplate um using
their pattern boom there we
go so now we're placing title intro all
right this is this is good now we have a
bunch of information for us to
interpolate in this PDF right but our
crew is geared towards an email so we
need to change that slightly first thing
is with crew aai now for now our agents
are working mainly with text text in
text out it's email but this requires a
more structured output we're talking
about title sections so we want to make

[37:02]
about title sections so we want to make
sure that these agents are outputting ad
Jon or a penic object something that you
can actually use
programmatically so crew actually
supports you to have like that crew like
penic output or Jon output so let's ask
it to uh create a
penic object um actually model that will
hold out the data
necessary to interpolate on the PDF file
there you go by the way Greg do do you
use cursor or you are a wind surf
guy um well I'm actually more of a bolt
guy than anything oo I love it Vats
amazing yeah I I went to CS School
dropped out but finished most of my
classes so I'm somewhat technical but
like a bad technical person and I found

[38:00]
like a bad technical person and I found
that Bol has
been more geared towards non- technical
people I hear you I hear yes doesn't
mean I don't like mess around with
winser for cursor or whatever I I'm also
in the stage where I I want to play with
all the tools like I I've just been
playing with lovable
recently um which is another one and I
just like to like I'm a learner you know
so
we don't know who's going to win yet so
I might as we might as well play with a
bunch of the tools I hear you and yeah a
lot of people get to ask me this asking
like hey like what is going to happen
with the market like how are things are
going do you think like there's going to
be a clear winner and what I'm telling
everyone like it's very much early days
still like no one knows how the things
are going to play out and there's a few
things that are not in your control for
example you you don't truly know like
how this is going to impact like
companies or how this going to impact
jobs and everything along the way but we

[39:02]
jobs and everything along the way but we
don't have control over that but you do
have control around like what are you're
going to do with your your time right
what is happening right now so I usually
recommend people to just learn these
tools and as use them anyway because
doesn't matter what happens in the
future like what to wins or how AI
impacts like everyone in the end of the
day that will like that knowing these
things are going to set you up for
better like even independently of what
happens totally all right let's go back
into this so we just create this ptic
object uh now that we have this ptic
object we actually can go to our final
task in here and I'm actually saying
like hey outputs this object so there's
going to be a function calling at the
end that's going to convert the output
of our agents into this object that we
need but now that I just noticed I'm
going to actually remove this for a
while because we need to update this
task
so let's go into tasks and

[40:00]
so let's go into tasks and
say uh I need to update this
tasks to now instead
of coming up with an
email to
um get all the data
necessary necessary to create this
object and I'm going to copy the object
there this is the object that we are
going after so I'm going to
say there we go so let's see how it's
going to go about
things um seems to be keeping out the
same
agent the one thing that I would do is
let's update the agents as well to
factor this
in we are now updating we're now
updating this agent to generate to

[41:01]
updating this agent to generate to
gather all data to
generate
genate this
object instead of writing an
email there you go it's going to
probably rename our agents and change a
few things but that's
fine yes there we go there we go update
everything all right for Mini 4 o 4 mini
let's do 4 on this one as well uh and in
here now um update this to
use the
agent defined
in agents there you go I gotta say once
that you got used to this like new tools
like cursor and such it's hard to go
back totally it's so good it's so good
oh funny enough they kept the same key
so you can see it's email draft after
even though they change the role so
maybe we maybe we do update like update

[42:01]
maybe we maybe we do update like update
the key update the agent Keys reflect
the neurals there we
[Music]
go yeah go just changing this final one
the PDF drafter so let's update this to
use PDF drafter all right so now we
Chang our agents we changed our tasks
again I used cursor to do in AI so I'm
not really like taging along and
optimizing this prompts very much but if
it works it will be it would be pretty
good so now what we can do is we can ask
it uh update this class to use the new
agent in
tasks and it should it should do good
job about that well there goes by the
way we never checked our email uh I I
probably got an email already about this
and gu what I did get it got mail you
got it I got a mail I got a mail yes let

[43:01]
got it I got a mail I got a mail yes let
me let me move this into or view there
you go I got our first one that we were
testing on and I got the I got a new one
that now seems to be doing great let me
move this into
[Music]
view all right email no
reply move it
here no no no move it move it here
uh there we go there we go so you can
see that I got a mail and hi Jo I hope
this me finds Well my name is again we
didn't like necessarily mess around with
that I've been called impressive Jenny
reach out for some innovative ideas
about offers especially around strategic
Partnerships customer experience
Regulatory Compliance love to schedule a
call to discuss would be available to
check next week so again pretty cool you
could make this like so much much more
advanced if you really want to and more

[44:00]
advanced if you really want to and more
precise and this is kind of like where
you get more into kind of like what
we're seeing companies doing where
you're going to also integrate this with
like a Google Calendar you're also going
to integrate this with your CRM so now
it's not only kind of like uh in like
sending the email but actually
scheduling the call checking if you have
the times lot available and kind of like
doing going out the way but this would
be a good way for you to get things
started and again there's a few things
that we could change in the prompt to
not include the subject to not have
interpolation and everything but just
like a a quick example of how you can
get some of these things kind of like
going and um and how some companies go
about
this yeah I think you know tactically
speaking if you're if you're building
some of these things it's like that what
I just saw that email is good enough to
start and then spend the next few days
just tweaking
learning uh and making more advanced but
you don't I guess what I'm saying is you

[45:00]
you don't I guess what I'm saying is you
and I'm curious your thoughts like you
don't need to go and build the the
fanciest output from day one right don't
you want to just try and get the the
basics going first yeah a th% I think
there's a few things that AI really
shines in and and one of those is like
it's as it's I think it's the easiest
way for it to be a agents right now like
if you want to be the more custom ones
like ignoring like all like the the more
kind of like geared St kind like drag
and drop only simpler use cases uh I
think this is kind like the easiest way
for you to inate because now like we if
we spend like an actual couple hours in
here going about our agents and our
tasks and maybe doing all these
Integrations we could get something
pretty cool that we can just deploy
right away and turn it on it's connected
to our landing page and just have it
going but I think you got to the point
where you got a name in the head where
you want to make sure that you get
something out there and once it's
working then about inating on
it so um all right so now let's just

[46:02]
it so um all right so now let's just
wrap this things up like we we can now
pass an extra attribute C output penic
again we're getting more technical in
here because now you want your agents to
Output actual structure data and this is
the structure data that's going to
Output so we can actually use it and
what you want to make sure is that you
are
sorry what you want to make sure is is
that you are updating this PDF to now
include all this data that your agents
are getting to you so now we're getting
to more Precision what we have done with
crew so far is basically very fuzzy and
there's a lot of agency like the agents
are doing everything but then again as
the use cases got more complex you start
to need more precision and more like uh
repeatability and consistency on their
use cases so usually people start with
before and after hooks I'm going to show
that in a second uh but you can go into

[47:00]
that in a second uh but you can go into
guard rails and out the way into flows
and flows are way more complex way more
fun as well to build uh but they're way
more complex and you can get like some
crazy use cases once that you get into
kind of like the flow level but um that
is pretty
interesting all right so for S before
hooks we can basically do an after keyof
um hook that means that that is going to
run after the crew so you do The
annotation and in here you can say I
will create uh
HTML and you get the crew
output as an attribute in here that you
can use um that you can use down here so
I actually have an example that we can
use to ask it to do it for us so so
let's
say uh update this after key COV

[48:04]
say uh update this after key COV
function to
interpolate the variables in
[Music]
PDF here is a high level
example all right this is an example of
this again interpolating variables
loading the template and then
interpolating a bunch of variables and
it's exactly what it's doing right now
but very geared stores the exactly
template that we have and we can just
make sure that we do the OS
import so there you go it's loading the
PDF and then uh interpolating all the
variables so basically interpolating
with everything that we have for the
things that are arrays it's making lists
out of them and then at the end it needs
to return an actual crew output um
object and This Crew output object needs
to be there we go it needs to be and let

[49:01]
to be there we go it needs to be and let
me import This Crew object I think it's
a
from from crew AI is that it no I don't
think that's it and boom so that import
the right class so now we're returning a
crew output where we return the final
template now completely interpolated so
now there you have it this crew is able
to not only do the things that it was
doing before but generates the custon
PDF for us so with these changes we can
actually just give an update to our
project so um get comment uh making it
output a
template plate and get Bush
rain and now we're updating our crew to
basically being able to generate this
PDF so if I turned out Auto deploy it
will deploy right away if not we can
just trigger a redeploy by clicking

[50:02]
just trigger a redeploy by clicking
right in here so let's click on it and
that's going to start redeploying this
uh crew so getting back into this so we
are updating our crew now and that crew
is now going to be able to like to
generate the PDF templates for us so
that we can send them over email that
seems good so while that is deploying I
think we can take a brief look at flows
again those are more technical so some
of you might like say hey all right
maybe I don't want I don't want to Trad
go that far but a lot of you might want
to go that far uh and the cool
interesting about flows is that that's
where I kind of like a lot of the more
complex use cases really come to life um
and that's where we see like um like
Integrations with sap Salesforce pulling
out those different sources executing
some python before after Cruise during
Cruise things get a little uh a little
all over the place uh but it starts
simple it's just it can get complex but

[51:01]
simple it's just it can get complex but
it starts simple so this is this is how
it works you can start a flow the same
way that we created a crew you're going
to do crei create flow and you're going
to give your flow a name so I'm going to
say
educational
content flow for example and the flow is
an ability for you to have an even based
automation that have crews in it so let
me show you what this looks
like so the flow has also a similar
folder structure but you're going to see
that it has a cruise folder so you can
have many crews inside the flow and the
flow follows kind of like an EV like an
event based system where you basically
have an start function that you can an
with this start annotation and then you
can have other functions listening to

[52:02]
can have other functions listening to
functions before there might be a
meeting event so for example it's going
to generate a sentence count and then
the function generate poem is going to
be listening for once that one finishes
and this one's going to kick off a crew
and then save poem is going to be
listening to when generate poem finishes
and then it's going to save that in a
text file file so it starts simple but
things can get a little fence in here
where you can start something and then
you kick off a crew and that crew you do
some validation of the output and then
depending on the result you call another
crew if you really want to go there so a
good example in a use case where this
could be useful and and that's why I
named educational content is for example
generating long form documents so let's
say that he want to generate a crash
course PDF again for the sake of another
example where you go over like many

[53:00]
example where you go over like many
different chapters you're talking about
many different chapters like evolving
into a topic this is a great example of
our flow because you can have a function
together inputs from the user for
example what is the topic that this C is
going to be about what are the like the
like um the learning style for this uh
person and what are some of the main
interests that this person have so that
we can use those interests as examples
and throughout the educational content
and then you have a crew that generates
a plan it plans out what are going to be
the chapters that you're going to have
like what they're going to look like and
then you have another crew that writes a
chapter so again you're going to have
like a longterm content and like a fully
blonde kind of like PDF at the end with
like many many pages if you really want
to incredible dude yeah this this is
this is pretty interesting so again I'm
going to I'm going to real quick try to
show like what this would look like I

[54:00]
show like what this would look like I
don't know if have time to put something
end to end together uh grab keep me
honest here yeah I'd love just to see
what it would look like like to me I'm
visual so I need I need to see that
before you leave oh so if you're a vis
you're going to absolutely love flows
I'm going to show you one thing in a
second so all right let's change this
real quick so let's first um go into our
cruise and rename this poem crew to be
um uh let's
say
content plan
crew and rename this file to cont plan
crew and rename this to content
plan content plan crew there we go now
again I'm going to be very like straight
the point in here usually you would
spend a lot of more time on thinking
about your agents and asks but just
because we're trying to put something
Qui together I'm going to say I want a

[55:01]
Qui together I'm going to say I want a
couple agents to help me create a
Content plan for a crash
course a crash course on a
topic um
these this agents will take a few
interpolations like topic
[Music]
uh learning
style and uh
interest inter interest there you
go uh the topic is what the course is
about the learning style should
um advise how we plan the chapters in
the
interests should be used as for examples

[56:03]
interests should be used as for examples
and
such uh final output of this will be a
plan with many chapters there we go
let's see what they come up
with all right it updated it added a
couple oh sorry it added a couple in
here uh course planner account expert
and a learning specialist and yeah this
feels this feels very good now let's
make sure that we also update our tasks
so I
want tasks to help me create a plan all
right uh let's use the
agents there you go so hopefully between
the context of the agent ymo and what I
just typed in there as prompt it is able
to create me a good set of

[57:02]
to create me a good set of
tasks all right so the final one is
recommendation learning activities and
engagement for each chapter I actually
want def find all right so I'm going to
say I want a final task that
task that brings it out together on a
comprehensive list of our chapters
and our information about them all right
and there we have it the one thing that
I'm going to say is I'm going to add
this context for this
agent all the other tasks so create the
outline the develop and optimize so
whatever the output of creating the
outline task whatever the output of the
develop chapter content and whatever the
output of the optimizing learning all
those outputs are going to be sent to
this agent to help it to come up with
this final final result all right so now

[58:02]
this final final result all right so now
that we have this we just need to make
sure that we are loading the right crew
in here so this poem crew exists no
longer these is our new content crew and
instead of starting with a generate
count I'm going to say um gather user
input so what is the topic what is the
learning style what is the interest
that feels good now after gather the
input I want to generate content plan so
this going to be listening to that user
input and it's going to call our crew
and it's going to pass all the inputs
that we just gathered by the way it's
using this state we want to probably
update this to be another state there we
go there we go so now we're using
everything that we want in there so
after the Cent plan is generated in this
is where you can start getting things a
little more fancy we can say like all
right let's uh save content plan and we

[59:02]
right let's uh save content plan and we
can save this as Jon by the way let's do
Jon and in here we can say that we want
to get the Jon output out of from this
and in here we want to make sure that
we're updating this to use the content
flow and the content
flow and we have a plan the one thing
that I will change though is because if
you think about it the plan is a
structured object right we're thinking
about we have chapters and these
chapters we have kind of like
descriptions they're going to have
titles so what we can do is we can say
um create a pantic model that uses the
output and I'm going to copy the final
tasking here there we go the output of
this task
um to hold the structure data of a list

[1:00:03]
um to hold the structure data of a list
of
chapters and there we go so we know that
every chapter is going to have a title
with description learning key Concepts
all right a bunch of things and we are
going to have a Content plan at the end
so now we want to make sure that update
is through to use the tasks
and
agents so it's going to update this to
there we go use our new agents and our
new
tasks and we want this final task to do
an
output Jon that is conted
plan so we created a crew again we're
like we did everything very fast in here
I told you but call thing we got a
little complex and we uh and we have our
flow that we created in here so the cool
thing is we could like now have another

[1:01:00]
thing is we could like now have another
function in here after we save the plan
where we can say
generate um
content and this generate content could
be
listening here let me do this could be
listening to the same function to
generate content plan so this is an
interesting one you can see that after
you generate content you do two things
you save the content and because that
can happens synchronously we can go
ahead and generate the content directly
so we don't need to wait for the save to
happen for us to generate the conty and
this is where we could have another
crew and This Crew will
create uh each chapter in a loop for
example and after we have created each
chapter in a loop we could have a
another one that is going to be saving
content for example where we're actually

[1:02:01]
content for example where we're actually
saving the content so we can do a key
here there we go so all right so in here
you can see We Gather the user results
that's where thing starts then after
getting user results we generate the
content plan then after that we do two
things we save it and we generate the
content with another crew and then we
save that content somewhere the cool
thing is because Greg is a visual person
you can do now
crei flow plot and that will actually
plot you a visual showing exactly what
is happening with your flow so you can
see what are the crews that you have in
there you can see what are the inputs
like what are the different kind of like
functions and events that are being
emitted and that is something that
people usually add to their Ry files and
makes like parts of their documentation
moving forward so let me open this up
now it got generated so so I can show
you what this looks like right there we

[1:03:01]
you what this looks like right there we
go so we gather the user input we create
the content plan and you can see this is
a crew method so there's a crew in this
one then we have save a Content plan and
generate content eventually generate
content is going to be a crew as well so
it's going to be similar to this node
and then we save content and there's a
bunch of more things that you can do you
can do router triggers and and some
other things but you got a visual
representation
dude I I had a smile on my face I don't
know if people saw that because I'm like
this this this is what I need you know I
needed
this I'm going to say it does helps with
like this more complex flows because
like uh again you even if you crack it
and you get the hangout of in you're
still working on the team sometimes
there's beaing this so the more visual
that you can get for people to just like
wrap their heads around what's happening
the better and the easier it is for you
to kind of like build the more complex
flows like this one
cool uh and then again like if you if
you want to execute that is similar

[1:04:01]
you want to execute that is similar
thing you can do c flow key cough and I
think we don't let me double check one
thing I don't think we
have environment variables on this one
no we don't so let me get our
environment variables on this
one all
right there we go one second let me move
this in into screen
yes so now we can do crew
AI uh flow Ki
off and that will kick off our agents
again we're missing a crew in there the
crew that actually generates the content
but you get to hang out with it we could
like do that now and do that in the loop
but it's asking for input so the topic
will be a nuclear
fusion I'm a very practical learner
and the interest of the target audience
would be games and Anime there we go and

[1:05:03]
would be games and Anime there we go and
there you go our first uh our first crew
is starting trying to create a high
level curse outline so these first
agents are going to do their thing you
can see chapters introduction to nuclear
fusion the science behind it Stellar
Fusion process Fusion in technology
current challenges the future and now
the subject matter experts going to
create an outline for each of those
chapters
and things are going to keep going and
going but you get the hang on how this
is going to turn out to be now if we do
add our second crew in here what we can
do is because we pushed our plan into
this and we know that this plan is
basically this content plan that has
chapters we can Loop that in into
another crew so content plan here is
actually content plan
is actually not a string but

[1:06:00]
is actually not a string but
instead there we
go and what we can do is on this second
place we do content plan uh we actually
do for there you go for chapter into
each one of those chapters we can do
content creator crew and what we're
passing here at inputs we can we can
pass those things individ ually if we
want to or we can pass the whole thing
um if we pass the whole thing it's going
to be formatted weird but it might be
okay so uh reg how are we doing on time
can I keep going we yeah we we got we
gota we got to keep going a
little all right so let me just copy
this and letting me paste it in here and
now this is going to be the content
creator Creator cre
crew so now we have this other crew in
here let's rename this as well this is

[1:07:01]
here let's rename this as well this is
going to be
cont Creator crew in here uh we don't
need this
anymore and we can go to our agents and
we're going to say all right
uh
let's create new agents that are now
responsible for creating a
specific
chapter they should
research the topic online find
interesting angles and write the chapter
using
the interpolated
context day we get with the
following information and then and we
can basically tell like this is what
they're going to be
getting

[1:08:00]
getting
Mission and let's see how things are
going to turn
out all right this seems to looks good
let me approve this right
away boom so we have three agents
content researcher a technical writer an
education content writer this feels good
now let's update it our tasks so let's
update the
tasks to actually write to actually
write the content
now
for for a given chapter using the agents
defined in
agent we can remove one of those and I
want to say they will have it access so
this let's make sure to interpolate a
chapter variable so

[1:09:02]
chapter variable so
tasks uh let's make sure we
interpolate uh
[Music]
chapter variable that will include all
the
information boom there we go so while it
rewrites that I want to make sure in
here see it's trying to do some facing
things research let's do not do any
interpolations in this one this should
be
good oh the interest is good if we can
add interest in here I think this could
be interesting so learning style and
interest all
right this
feels this feels good all right what
about the tasks in the tasks let's
approve it right away as well uh I won't
try to do anything uh fancy about this
like trying to access the objects this I

[1:10:00]
like trying to access the objects this I
don't think would necessarily work so
what I'm going to do instead is I'm
going to basically
say chapter chap chap chapter
information and we can do just
interpolated the whole chapter thing
consider how content and there we go I
found this I found this way
better engagement
strategies boom and then we can do the
same thing for the other ones so
interpolate only chapter equal
equal in the same way we do
above there we go
all right so it's removing everything
just keeping

[1:11:01]
just keeping
chapter well do one thing though it just
did for this one so let me do everything
below
boom all right so chapter information is
in here with view chapter content this
is good optimizing for learning compin
to
final all right let's add chapter
information all right this one get a
little bit like a little bigger like we
have a a few more tasks but that should
not be a problem now we want to make
sure to um update this class to use the
agents
and
tasks and there you have it Con of
Creator
crew all right updating everything this
feels
good all right
now what we're going to do is by the way
one thing that we don't mention is what
format we want this I would say make

[1:12:02]
format we want this I would say make
this uh a markdown a markdown
file and what I want to do on here
is no I think this is good I think this
is good we shouldn't need any of those
as
well so now we can import our new crew
so we have our content creator crew
and we are generating this for each of
the
chapters and what we can do is for the
sake of just keeping things a little
simpler is I'm going to save here so
save res.
raw not raw
to uh markdown file
in um content slash there we go and we
can create here here a new folder I'm
going to say content for
now and there you go we basically got

[1:13:03]
now and there you go we basically got
the chapter
name this is good we need to interpolate
the other things as well yes learning
style
interest yes yes
yes all right like will this work I
don't know brace for
impact we did a lot in there you can see
that when we run our crew the first time
it did work like like we got all this
plan so let's actually open because it
saved that file that we asked it
to um I hope so where is this yes
content plan let's do Json
beauy there we go so we have all the
chapters introdution description learn
objectives key Concepts technical
content practical examples learning
activity so you can see the plan is in
here for all the chapters so this looks
good now now what we're going to do is
make sure that after the plan is
generated and we are saving to this file

[1:14:00]
generated and we are saving to this file
we didn't even need to save it we can
drop this part eventually uh and you we
actually call the thing that generates
all the chapters so this should be good
one thing that I'm missing though from
uh This Crew is that they're not doing
anything like they're using only the llm
knowledge I would love to use for
example um create I tools and U maybe
server so they can search line and maybe
scraping like I think those are probably
like the couple like easiest tools that
we can use and then we can give these
tools for some of these agents so they
can find more relevant up to-date
information so maybe the content
reviewer get thems as well um and and
that should be okay for these but for
the ones they're planning I think
they're even more important so the
planner should actually um use these
tools and and the outliner should
probably also have like these tools
accessible to them and there we go

[1:15:02]
accessible to them and there we go
because I'm adding the serer to I do
need to add an environment variable but
I think I have already done this before
when I copy down my environment variable
so that should be good um all right
let's let's give it a try let's see what
happens again we're doing we're doing a
lot of things live here but I'm feeling
optimistic are you feeling optimistic gr
I'm I'm always feeling optimistic
you're a better human than I
am I will say like when you know
obviously when you're building these
things you want to kind of limit the
amount of variables right but we we we
do have a lot going on uh but we do also
have the CEO of crew AI so I'm feeling
optimistic I love that all right so want
to learned about lucar Fusion again uh
learning style is practical uh games and
anim Ma and AI as well let's see if like
what a turn up in there all right our
first crew we know it works so let's do

[1:16:01]
first crew we know it works so let's do
its thing one thing that you can see now
it's using our tools uh searching the
internet nuclear ficient curse outline
educational examples and there's a few
contents in there from like K12 to um
Institute of physics and now it's
actually reading some of those websites
so it's going on and kind like trying to
get information now searching for
nuclear fusion curriculum development
examples uh in has an isal outline so
introduction the science of ficient real
word fish and popular cuture and debates
and perspectives this is good you see
this is what happens when you give it
like some extra tools the ability to
search now it can go like all right what
about the debates like is this good is
this bad I know a lot of people say like
we have a huge nuclear fish in the sky
the sun maybe should use that so you you
don't know um and then subject matter
now creates a description for each
chapter talking about the key Concepts

[1:17:00]
chapter talking about the key Concepts
the important and look at this up
engaging activity explore the use of
nuclear fusion in popular enemy series
like Attack on Titans so if there any
enemy funds right there like as myself
uh this this is very interesting I do
like that uh and for games it's
mentioning about Fallout and the
consequences of nuclear warfare so um
very interesting one so it keep on going
and going generating all the chap
um this should be good I think this is
the final agent now that actually
creates the plan so if something is
going to break it's going to break now
between finishing the screw and kicking
off the next one where it's going to
like it's basically the the brand new
piece that will be put together so cross
fingers uh I think I think this is gonna
I hope this is gonna
work I'm gonna say this is fun uh I
don't I don't get to do much coding like
uh nowadays just because of how the
business are going so it's fun to spend
some time doing this now especially live

[1:18:00]
some time doing this now especially live
coding it's live coding
yes I mean there we go of course we had
a problem the all the things were good
but then uh in the man to generate
content a string has no attribute
chapters all right so let's let's debug
this real quick see if we can fix it is
on this form right here so if you look
at this form is trying to Loop this
variable here and this variable is a
Json content so even though it is Json
Jon for now in here is a is a string
right so what I can do now is I can do
penic um so it's an actual object on our
planning crew instead of saying outp put
Jason I'm going to say I want you to op
penic for me and I think we we don't
need to save this anymore into AJ five I
mean we can still save it but maybe now
we need to do the the model dump

[1:19:01]
we need to do the the model dump
Json uh but yeah let's let's not not
just do that for now I'm for the sake of
running this faster I'm going to remove
our tools like we know that they work so
let's remove them so it's basically more
straightforward this agents run a little
faster and let's rerun them
and cross fingers let's see if it this
one's going to work now uh
[Music]
um curse is going to be again uh nuclear
fusion I'm a practical learner and uh
anime
games and
AI all right so crew now should be run
faster it's not going to like spend so
much time going over like the smaller
detail
so cross

[1:20:00]
fingers okay now I'm really
optimistic it's always like that right I
mean for for the folks that have played
around with like designs and everything
it's like this is the point where you
start to put underscore final underscore
two and and you're wondering like is two
the final
version but I think this going to be a
good one I'm I'm feeling optimist stick
on this one as
well all right uh the one thing that I'm
remembering now is um we did our our PDF
thing I don't think we ever we ever test
it out so maybe maybe it's worth it for
me to uh try to see if that PDF deploy
worked and we can check that out in a
second as well just to make sure that
everything is working fine on the PF
generator side of things I make sure
that we uh we don't drop the ball and
leave people hanging on that one n all
right so while this runs let me check

[1:21:00]
right so while this runs let me check
that
um all right so our deployment is
done so we should be able to update our
zapier now so let's edit our zaper real
quick all right so um there is a catch
hook that works still we're still
calling our same drag test that FS okay
let's make sure that this is working
that I didn't break in so I can re
retest
time uh all right seems to be
working okay now remember that instead
of sending the email now we getting an
HTML at the end so there's a there's a
service that I have used in the past
called PDF Co again I it's the only
service that I could found that is able
to trans like dynamically convert HTML
to PDF so I'm going to use in here just
for the sake of using it and what you
can do is you can get your output of
your crew so the
result and basically output it in um as

[1:22:03]
result and basically output it in um as
a pgf so I'm going to say I want a no
margins uh this feel good all
right so let's see if it
runs yes there we go and on our resent
now instead of like sending the this
content we can basically say here is
your
report and we can attach
the uh URL continue publish
publish
and there we go we have updated it now
so let's make sure that our crew is
running
accordingly
we should be able to kick off a new one
so I'm going to T is this the one that
we
I think this is a new one isn't it a new
one let me make sure that we're using

[1:23:00]
one let me make sure that we're using
the right one in here so the kickoff I
want to add this app real quick I want
to make sure that we are refreshing this
list I'm going to choose another one
real
quick let's find our grag one grag
test all right domain company name
continue continue
continue this is good continue continue
and well we didn't change anything all
right feel good let's try it out then
domain is cre.com company domain is C.C
I guess what happens is or cursor
Dynamic updates kind of remove the name
the person's name from the
interpolation that's okay we just make
sure this is running all right it is
running so this works so this now should
work all the way from the getg go so

[1:24:06]
work all the way from the getg go so
let's let's do a request
boom do we have a new
run yes we have a new run going on here
oh no that's not in there you go this is
in all right let's see how that goes
while that runs
we go back ah another error now is error
in the generate content content expert
so it's not finding an agent that is
called content expert I guess that's
what we get from doing everything on um
everything using curer so what happens
is if you look at one of our tasks it is
looking for a contact expert agent but
if you look at the agents we don't have
a coner and agent so we can do a Content
writer on this one and the other thing
is you want to make sure make sure our

[1:25:01]
is you want to make sure make sure our
agents in here exist on agents
and there we
go just to make sure that there you go
there was another problem in there
another one in here there you go now
it's better and then in here let's say
let's make sure we are using the r
let sir we are defining the r tasks and
agents and then we can use the Creator
and the
Creator and there we have
it so just to make sure because now we
have like two Crews I might have tagged
the wrong files I think that's what
happening
there yeah you see I think that was
exactly what I did so we don't need this
context in here for now all right let's
run it again we go back to our zapier
one so our zapier one it seems there's a

[1:26:03]
one so our zapier one it seems there's a
few that are stuck maybe is that what's
happening in here it's calling the crew
is delayed so maybe this crew is running
let's double check that on crew
AI get
status failed cre attribute has no
attributes benefit list again see me
thinking that cursor is going to replace
engineer so
[Laughter]
soon it's going to take quite a while so
this is it we're trying to look for
benefits list in what is there crew
object has no benefits list in that's
because we are looking crew output
directly we want to do
penic um output and we can do there we
go identic
and then our crew outputs we replace
everything with identic

[1:27:00]
everything with identic
output and F
so nuclear
fish practical anime
games and
Ai and then for our other one we just
update oh we just update the pr GS
Comon
fix push aring mang and then let's
do let's trigger redeploy in
[Music]
there redeploy there we go all right so
now we fix we fix both
hopefully let's make sure that the
things runs and that we got def the res
I guess third ch's a thirdd time is a
charm

[1:28:01]
charm
totally happens to the best of us man
yeah I gotta say this is live coding
right I think like to everyone's point
on like how AI is evolving coding is
still a very interactive process right
like uh definitely Ai and agents and
things like Davin now and like other
solutions they help a lot but um it's
still like a lot of of like just making
sure that from going going from zero to
one is very fast and getting faster and
faster going one to 10 is still very
much like um what traditionally has
been
yeah that's that has been my experience
so far all right a similar here but now
on the task side probably same thing I
forgot to reference something
somewhere so on the tasks I'm saying
create a Content out line I'm actually
saying create line and I don't have that
task in here so all this context should

[1:29:01]
task in here so all this context should
actually
be research
chapter uh should be right chapter
C and
compile final plan I think this is it
let me just double check this is the
right one this is the Creator all right
so compile defined curse
plan complete structure plan now this
this looks odd if you think about it
that's the content creator plan the plan
is the one where the tasks are about
compiling the outputs in the compressive
plan this should be actually right in
the chapter so if you look at this we
can
say inad inad stand off a plan we want
the final actual chapter on this

[1:30:03]
[Music]
one right a complete polish mark down
all right this feels more this is right
in content reviewer we have that agent
yes we do do we have those tasks yes so
we're using the research we're using the
writer and we're using the review
chapter content all right this feels
good
and this is our task so
now let me make sure that we get our
tasks from the content
creator I'll properly defined in
here um all right so research research
WR wrer chapal review review and then
optimize optimize this feels good and
then compile find course
plan we can keep that name for now even
though what's doing is actually writing

[1:31:00]
though what's doing is actually writing
the
markdown and the context in here we
don't need to pass it given that we
already passing in the
tasks and let's kick it off again I
think that's it only one way to find out
only one way to find out all right topic
do you have another topic by the way
other than nuclear
SE um
sure what about
seo what is your learning style you know
me I'm
visual Visual and any interests I like
games I think yeah all right games there
we go all right let's see what what is
going to be the plan for SEO for a
visual person that like games yeah uh
now I'm curious to see what the plan is
going to being all right introdiction to
SEO it's relevance in gaming oh there
you
go uh keyword research and optimization

[1:32:02]
go uh keyword research and optimization
onpage SEO fundamentals content creator
marketing strategies technical
Essentials tracking performance how you
feel about that s
plan yeah I think
it it makes sense you know makes a lot
of sense I wasn't yeah I'm I'm I think
it looks good all right well introducing
Concepts a couple use cases how fortnite
effectiv use SEO to rank highly on
gaming content and analyze Legend of daa
breath of the wide I mean that's a
killer game right there totally um then
keyword researches using things like
Keyword Planner Sam Rush a arffs that
feels good on page SEO again OverWatch
call of
study that's is interesting Destin 2
Hollow nine another great game
then technical results and SEO
performance directly all right s s the

[1:33:00]
performance directly all right s s the
track then there's the final plan right
there the whole Json thing and it works
generating content so now our content
researcher specialist actually is
getting all that objects so you can see
all the capture chapter information is
in here the title the
objectives like everything is in here
it's always matched together because
kind of like we Jem the entire chapter
like object in there we could make a
little prettier and now because this
crew we didn't remove the tools they're
searching the internet so searching the
internet finding information scraping
websites there you go a bunch of website
content that's kind like just reading
and researching
further and coming up with the actual
content so now is the actual content
writer we can see an initial writing of
what the topic would be over view key
concept the technical content the
Practical examples learning activities
there we go now I think we have uh the

[1:34:02]
there we go now I think we have uh the
editor kind of like doing a
review and again researching online
scrapping AB Pages like that the models
are getting so fast now that it's even
hard to keep up with everything that
they're
doing so there you go researching how
technical visual Learners like in
Practical and fun tips so making sure
that it gets like some of like that uh
that Insight in there yeah learning
gaming for
Education yeah it's going it's going out
loud all out
baby oh there we go all right so we
should be able to see like and by the
way this we're seeing all these logs
because we're running on verbos mode so
you can disable all that if you don't
want to get like everything and kind
like the the stream of cches of the
models and everything that they're doing
but H if everything works out we should
start to see uh files there we go
populated right in here y so it wrote
the first chapter Let's uh let's

[1:35:03]
the first chapter Let's uh let's
see let me actually remove those initial
markdown codes here that it
added there we
go and then let's do markdown
preview so introdution to se's relevance
in gaming the learning objectives the
key Concepts the C the Practical
examples
what they have done learning
activities we create infographic
illustrating how search Eng GES Works
wow that's going to be tough one um
assets methods success
metrics this feels good all right well I
guess we what we could do and we have
done like this like um this kind of like
flow before where you use for like high
level content creation is you can go
like way deeper on some of the pred for
the planning that's usually where most
of the kind of like the optimization
lies is making sure that the plans
reflect like what exactly what you're
trying to kind like go after like the

[1:36:01]
trying to kind like go after like the
the fact that he's trying to not use
game as examples but actually focus on
gaming SEO is a little odd and it's not
what we want so we could change some of
the tasks and agents around that it's
funny because I saw I saw that
originally and I was like that's not
what I want but then I was like actually
that's probably a huge opportunity in
like a
niche um
like you know I've seen a million
SEO uh you know courses and content
guides and stuff like that but I haven't
seen anything specifically spoken to to
to video
games yeah I gotta say definitely
definitely sounds like a nich something
that like U I think like people would
really like U do and you can see a
difference in there for like specific
Industries on how they're playing some
of this but um yeah so now what what is
what is happening there behind the
scenes again we have a new chapter now
now talking about uh the keyword
research optimization so we can double

[1:37:00]
research optimization so we can double
check what this one looks
like uh where is
[Music]
preview uh there we go so keyword
research and optimization in gaming so
introduction learn objectives the key
Concepts explaining what is the keyword
plan there what is the seam Rush uh and
going over a few others about search
volume comp competition
relevance um and then examples of flow
charts activities engagement strategist
success metrics how does this trct with
you someone that actually like uh that
actually does care a lot about like SEO
I mean it's it's directionally right you
know of course it needs to be
optimized yeah it would have been insane
literally if it didn't need to be
optimized but I think like this is this
is a this is a legit output yeah I think
honestly a lot of like the optimization
like happens especially on the firstness

[1:38:01]
like happens especially on the firstness
parts like on the actual agents is on
these agents and tasks like emo files
it's where like you're going to be like
uh spending a lot of time like to make
sure that you get the behavior that you
want yeah and then when you get
Precision is more on the python files is
where you spend the time like adding
checks creating this python objects
structures where you can use guard rails
and where you can use like before and
after kickoffs or where you can build
flows so this kind of like where we get
like where you optimize for precision
but uh and funny enough is a piece that
we spend less time on just because we
let AI right out our agents and tasks
for us but usually you do can optimize a
lot of this just by kind of like
revamping some of it and it gets
something very good so uh another
example of something that we have done
in the past and that was pretty
interesting is building a crew that
monitors AWS for us so AWS where people

[1:39:01]
monitors AWS for us so AWS where people
host a lot of like their software and we
had it to actually produce um a like a
markdown report at the end but in this
one we spend more time describing like
what exactly we need and this kind like
the level that you can get where we have
an executive summary table of contexts
introduction a very detailed analysis
and you could have actual link
you can add guard rails to make sure
that these links are not like
hallucination so if for example it's
mentioning a link in here and you can
click on that what you actually get is
control traffic two resources Pages yes
there you go so you can actually have
exactly the page that is a valid one
that's really cool yeah that's really if
you spend the time you can get amazing
thing like risk assessment Matrix road
maps um this is actually a demo that
we're going to be pushing with AWS in
general so it's going to be like on
their blog post and everything but uh
this kind of like the level that you can
get if you're really double down kind of

[1:40:00]
get if you're really double down kind of
like u a lot of this all right hey we we
covered a
lot I mean time flew to be honest um I
hope people stuck around like if you're
listening to this and you're in in the
deep end here with us
like you know you realize you probably
realize that I mean look at this look at
the outcome that you can you could
potentially get
um but there's going to be zigs and zags
along the way there's going to be errors
there's going to be you know it isn't
press a button and it automatically you
know you have this agent force
multi-agent you know ecosystem but it is
press a few buttons Zig and zag and and
you and you get it out so um Joe thank
you for spending time with us showing us
around bringing you inside your brain
and and really how you think about uh
this multi world and showing us crew
where could what do you suggest people
do I mean I know use crew but like what

[1:41:00]
do I mean I know use crew but like what
what do you suggest people do if they
want to get started in this world uh I
would say if people want to really dive
into this uh I would recommend checking
a couple courses that we have uh with
Ender Yang on deep learning AI so I can
send you the link so that you can put on
the descriptions but uh there's a couple
courses the first one is is pretty good
it's like very introd like from
introduction it's like very for
beginners out the way to can like start
building everything so if you do that
we're going to step back out the way to
kind of like what is an agent like how
agent Works what are tools what are llm
so you can watch that and catch it up on
that way and then there's a second
course that we did that was very
practical it's all about what we're
seeing in companies out there um and
there's an interview with the CTO of gen
on PWC on how PWC is using crei in
production and there's a few extra
informations in there as well that you
probably want to check it out so I would
say those two like we have over 100,000

[1:42:02]
say those two like we have over 100,000
people that enrolled on those courses so
I definitely recommend you to check it
out cool we'll include that uh get your
hands dirty and
and of course like and comment and
subscribe uh if you enjoyed this video
and uh I'll see you in the next one Joe
I'll see you around see y thank you so
much for having me thank you later
[Music]
