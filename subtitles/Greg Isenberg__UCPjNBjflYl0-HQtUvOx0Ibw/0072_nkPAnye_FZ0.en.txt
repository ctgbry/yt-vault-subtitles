[00:00]
when you look at the risk return of
going and buying a company and being on
your own and being on the ownership side
of the table it's it's truly
life-changing not only for you but
potentially for your your children your
grandchildren so
the risk-reward trade-off is is heavily
in the reward favor
[Music]
sieva xavier so excited to have you guys
on for this episode it's one that um
both greg and i have been wanting to
record for
for a while i mean obviously we're all
friends and we know you guys but you
know from afar getting to see the rise
of of what you've been doing and
building over the last year plus as
we've known each other um but even more
you know publicly as you guys have
started to share more about it and kind
of build in public quote unquote around
that journey and and uh you know and
around really this like
opportunity that i think a lot of people
have to kind of opt out of like
traditional employment and you know
potentially uh go and build and acquire

[01:00]
potentially uh go and build and acquire
and uh uh boring businesses and kind of
the rise of like boring business twitter
as it were um so super excited to kind
of just like dive into the details and
and dig into things but thought it would
be helpful for everyone um you know and
honestly myself included to just like
set the stage a little bit uh on your
guys backgrounds and uh really like
where you came from and how you uh how
you kind of wound up with the insight to
start building enduring ventures and we
can dig into the details on what it is
and the whole story and what you guys
are working on but would love to kind of
set the stage because you're both
independently quite amazing and um would
love to start there so xavier maybe we
can start with you um and uh we'd love
to just kind of hear more about you and
like you know you were born and now
you're here what happened in between
well i'm a little older so that gets
that's a long and boring story so i'll
give you the
the short version is i was always an
entrepreneur i think i was i was mowing
lawns when i was 11 at least a mini golf
course when i was 14. um so i was into

[02:00]
course when i was 14. um so i was into
boring businesses early pause
pause you leased a mini golf course when
you were 14.
yeah i was i was frustrated that you
couldn't get a job like a proper job
until you were 16 or some with some
would take you when you were 15. and i
really wanted to earn money and i was i
was willing to work you know whatever
was required and so i found out about
this opportunity where the small town i
grew up the the mini golf course uh they
weren't even gonna run it because they
just paid some kid to sit there all
summer and then i lost money
and so um i worked out a deal with the
guy who was head of the parks department
uh and the deal was basically i get 90
and he gets 10 but he doesn't have any
fixed cost i have to fix up the mini
golf course and then i have to run it
and whatever i make i make um so that
was my introduction into low marginal
cost uh business because it turns out
the key to a mini golf course is just
making it look busy even if people
aren't paying um and then other people

[03:00]
aren't paying um and then other people
want to go play on the mini golf course
and pay for it so that's amazing sorry i
cut you off i had to ask that's all the
that's also the key to the nightclub
business i think as well
[Music]
the creating the is
creating the buzz creating the buzz so
we sold um a few family passes comically
cheap it was 20 for the whole summer and
there was some families who would then
just send their kids down to like play
mini golf for four hours a day so they
could get some work done um
and then that that
created enough commotion there that
other people would walk up and and play
um we also illegally sold uh uh cold
drinks and uh uh chips i don't think
we're supposed to do that but
there's no other convenience store in
town so we
seized on the the window
love it it's like the your version of
the lemonade stand uh in a much more
complicated manner i love that um
it's just been like top of mind for me
the reason i paused you is because you
know i have this newborn um you know

[04:01]
know i have this newborn um you know
little boy and my wife and i have been
talking a lot about how i didn't feel
like i was raised in a uh household
where entrepreneurship was you know
really a focus my dad was an academic um
and my mom actually did have a business
although i never we never really it was
a consulting business and so i kind of
always thought of it more as like
services not really super scalable you
know tech enabled type business more
like renting out your time
and um you know i just felt like growing
up it was never top of mind for me to go
and do entrepreneurial things and now
that i'm exposed to this world and i
meet guys like you like greg and i spend
time with these you know people who as
kids we're just off doing business stuff
and like randomly cobbling together
businesses and trying different things
and like going door-to-door and selling
stuff and um all of that i just think
about it a lot now with my wife of like
i want to prioritize that same set of
principles and skills in my son as he
gets older and like be able to kind of
foster that same creative
entrepreneurial spirit in him that i

[05:01]
entrepreneurial spirit in him that i
feel like so many of my really smart
friends built from a young age yeah you
know and it's funny like my parents were
not entrepreneurs at all
my brothers were not entrepreneurs and
so i think about this with my own kids
too and i think you know i got to start
with the motivation so they got to
actually have something they want
because like my middle brother would
just keep any money earned in a pringles
jar never spend any money on anything
and so it was very hard for him to get
motivated enough to go earn money where
for me i was really into um i was into
early computers and i was into games and
that was like a bottomless pit of
money that you could sync into like mid
90s computers and so that was what was
motivating me to go out and earn my own
money because i wasn't gonna get that on
my own so i always think it starts with
the motivation and then once you have
the motivations like okay well here's
i'm not gonna just give you the money
but here's a path where you could earn
it i think that's that's probably the
best way to approach that yeah so um i

[06:01]
best way to approach that yeah so um i
started uh i also started an early proto
college social network in college which
would have been like year 2000 um so
that was um it was another that was my
first entrepreneurial adventure where
like it went bigger than like just a
small-born business it was like the
whole campus was using this site and
that was kind of cool
um i was a little early with that idea
but um i i was going to go to silicon
valley and try to start a company around
it uh in 2001 when that when the crash
happened so that was what
got me um was it literally like a
facebook or like social network type
experience
yeah we had a e-dog book feature so we
had a feature on it called the e-dog
book uh we had uh peer-to-peer teacher
reviews were actually the biggest thing
on our platform we hadn't gotten the
social dynamic quite right uh i would
say we hadn't thought of like likes i
think likes were sort of the early
genius of facebook's uh viral growth
the other thing we were categorically
wrong about is we thought that

[07:00]
wrong about is we thought that
hyperlocal was the right approach so our
idea was like i was nd today where i
went to school notre dame and then we
did a yale today and we did a pen today
and
the other ones just didn't take off in
the same way that the nd that one did
because i so intimately understood that
campus and was able to kind of make a
perfect product for it but a lot of the
features on the site ended up being like
large standalone websites uh someone
else did in their own right like i never
made any money off that but like rage my
teachers is like a big platform that um
we were doing kind of way back in those
in that proto
that swamp uh internet swamp of 99
um
and so that uh i guess it was really
necessity in some ways it set me off
selling textbooks on the internet it was
like in a way back to um
doing a boring business in a in a realm
i understood which was college um and
i'll make a really long story short but
i founded a company called better world
books that's a social impact company so

[08:02]
books that's a social impact company so
the idea is it um raises money for
literacy um and for libraries um by
taking the on-run books of the world and
selling them on the internet so lots of
people donate books to their alma mater
for example maybe you bring your whole
book collection to stanford when you
move
and um
students also often don't need the books
at the end of class and don't have the
patience to stand in line with seldom
and so better world books ended up being
built first around college book drives
and then around sort of every unwanted
book uh to take those books physically
take possession of them sell them in a
warehouse um put them into where i'll
sell them on the internet uh primarily
through amazon ebay originally now uh
primarily through its own website um
and uh that was that was sort of a
20-year journey of
i think the company has sold in
aggregate well over a billion dollars
worth of books on the internet since
since i founded it
yeah whoa that's crazy was it like kind

[09:00]
yeah whoa that's crazy was it like kind
of chegg before chegg
yeah we actually helped get chegg off
the ground um we had a jv with chegg uh
for a little while uh we should have we
should have gotten some equity in it but
um
it was uh chegg was focused on textbook
rental and we were really focused on um
taking books essentially being
outsourced online sales um and sometimes
organizing the book drives as well
so we would almost never pay for a book
like new york public library is a good
example they would send us semi semi
truckloads full of books that the good
people of new york had donated to them
and we would market that on the internet
and sell those books and then we'd
revenue share with them um and with the
literacy program that they picked
um and that was probably new york public
library alone was probably a two and a
half million dollar your account uh
where they would ship us books we would
sell well
um it's kind of a cool like there's a
greg you and i have talked about this in
general it's like there's a cool

[10:01]
general it's like there's a cool
business framework around that same type
of you know just like general
generalized idea and model which is like
you know take something that uh is not
their core business model and that they
are bad at or have no idea how to do and
sort of just like abstract all the
complexity away from them of that
process and like you take on all the
headaches and the challenges of it but
you're quite good at it for whatever
reason you figured out how to streamline
that process and so like for new york
public library they have no idea how to
sell things online it's just not their
core competency they have no clue how to
deal with it they would rather pay
someone and be happy to pay the margin
of that person to just get rid of it and
get it off their hands um i saw a
business recently that was trying to do
that with like lost and found for big
arenas and you know big locations which
i thought was kind of neat it's like
those places don't want to have to deal
with you know logging and categorizing
lost and found
and you know this company was basically
coming in and saying like we'll do that
we'll abstract all the complexity away
and make it a much better experience for
your customers you should be happy

[11:00]
your customers you should be happy
because it'll you know create a much
better more seamless experience um i
think it's kind of just like an
interesting general framework um
and then you ended up in um
in the solar space right like in energy
yeah so i i worked on better world books
for about eight years i went to business
school for a year
and then i was chairman of federal books
after that but i started this um
distributed solar company in africa
um also a social impact business so the
idea was to make solar accessible to the
mass market in africa um which it really
wasn't uh at the time
um and that was sort of 2011. so the
idea was if people could pay um in small
increments like a prepaid mobile
for the power that a small solar power
system produces
then that would be cheaper and better
than their alternative which is paying
for
kerosene for lighting for example or
there's actually a non-trivial industry
in africa paying other people to charge
your cell phone so going the going rate

[12:01]
your cell phone so going the going rate
is about 25 cents a charge to uh have
the guy at the shop charge your cell
phone crazy
crazy crazy all right so
we've got xavier's background um
and there's a lot to unpack there too
see eva i want to give you the uh i want
to give you the time of day before we
dive into all the uh all the fun and
games on enduring
yeah sure and i'm and i'm happy to tell
you a little bit about my career i think
in some ways uh entrepreneurial like
xavier's he's uh he's a little bit older
and wiser than i am
um and all of us i guess your
your original question was uh from birth
until now and
you know it's it's probably worth noting
that
my story or kind of the decisions that i
make in this world i think are largely
impacted by
the immigrant story in america
um i don't know if i've told you the saw
but um
my mother
immigrated to the u.s from the soviet

[13:00]
immigrated to the u.s from the soviet
union in the early 90s
there was a jewish refugee program going
on at the time
and she came over with me i was a baby
at the time
she didn't speak the language
she had heard that america was this
better place and that she could create a
better future for her kids
and it was just just this incredible
jump that she made and i think
you know when i reflect on like what
drives me what what gets me up in the
morning what keeps me going it's really
to
um do honor by the the kind of risks
that she took and the effort that she
put in
in those early days and i think i think
about that a lot um xavier and i ended
up talking about that quite a bit as
well
so i moseyed kind of through through
life living in california i had always
wanted to be a doctor
i'm in college i took pre-med i interned
and kind of shadowed some doctors at the
time
and then i think you know became a
accidental entrepreneur or business
person

[14:00]
person
um i wanted to start an education
company i felt like there weren't enough
resources at my public college to
support students
so
i built a tutoring company and then a
note sharing company
and
kind of a few startups later i guess
fast forward to
most recently i had a
built a healthcare network so totally
different industries i pivoted out of
education i went into healthcare and
built this network of clinical research
sites where
we powered
clinical trials for large pharmaceutical
companies so our customers were
companies like pfizer and novartis and
novoderm
and we built this network and we used
technology in order to connect
patients who needed access to trials as
well as those pharmaceutical companies
who wanted to accelerate
how fast they were getting patients into
those trials because it's so expensive
to to run the trial or to just keep one

[15:00]
to to run the trial or to just keep one
running um so that was pretty successful
and ended up selling that business right
before xavier and i started enduring
ventures
got it got it okay so you guys came from
both entrepreneurial but very different
backgrounds um presumably you met uh
along the way and and had become friends
what was the insight
that led to the creation of enduring
ventures and then can you just give us
the like quick uh point on like what is
enduring ventures what are you actually
creating and then i wanna i wanna
actually get into the like nitty-gritty
of this model because i think you know
the general characterization that i
would have for it which i think you know
we've talked about on twitter in the
past is like you're building a baby
berkshire hathaway warren buffett and
charlie munger's brainchild um and
there's something amazing about you know
two guys setting out to kind of go and
do that and sharing in public that
journey and how you're doing it and like
really the mechanics um and getting into
the weeds of how you're going about that
process so i want to get into the nitty

[16:00]
process so i want to get into the nitty
gritty of it because i think there's
probably a lot of people out there
listening that um you know they may want
to pursue something similar in the
future so can you just talk a little bit
about that founding insight and then
let's dive into it
and and one thing i just want to
highlight um
[Music]
so
before we get into that because i think
it's an that's a really good
like i also want to dive into that but
sieva and xavier were living in san
francisco at the time at least i met you
guys in 2016 in san francisco i didn't
know that sean
yeah sean poury was hosting these
masterminds
before sean poury had my first million
as a place to like get his ideas out
there
sean pory basically you know every few
weeks would invite different
entrepreneurs
into this room
in san francisco at his office and we
would basically order pizza hang out and
just talk about ideas
i show up
uh you know i was going to these things
often and the people that were showing

[17:00]
often and the people that were showing
up were like the nikita beers of the
world social founder
um
the josh buckley's of the world who at
the time had a you know video game
um
alex ii who's the founder of com.com
like
mostly just
mobile apps with social
features or social apps with mobile
features like
that's basically where it was at and i
show up and these two guys are in the
room
one guy xavier is like working on this
thing in africa about solar energy way
more ambitious
and
so i was like what
and
sievo was i don't remember exactly i
think you were working on your education
thing at the time
it might have been your
yeah your i think it might have been no
chairing at the time
and
which was also like completely like
uh
different than what people working on it

[18:00]
different than what people working on it
so there's something that you two have
which i find interesting and i'm curious
your perspective on it which is
you don't exactly
go toward the trend
is like you just kind of come up with
ideas that connect with you and you just
like
are curious and you follow it is that
right
i mean i think that's within hand
grenade range i think we're also both
very cheap i think that's something to
know about us
and so in some ways we've been much more
comfortable in the world
you know i had this experience of
building a bootstrap company with better
world books and then having the complete
opposite with the solar company or had
to raise absolute boatloads of capital
so you know over 200 million dollars
raised just on my watch for that
business and
um
the whole raising boat loads of capital
that was like 70 of my job was like
you know not just the like oh making the
pitch like that's the easy part but
really holding together a high-powered

[19:00]
really holding together a high-powered
board that had maybe different opinions
on which we think should go
on um you know on sort of navigating
funding rounds that don't always happen
at the time when the market wants them
to happen and so they can be tough to
close
so i think for me personally getting
back to the fundamentals of business was
was really interesting i think that's
something sieve and i kind of share is
like
both a sort of broader view about like
social impact beyond just like let's
make something that grows as fast as
possible and we can sell for as much as
possible and then also like
the real art and fundamentals of
business as an as a practice i guess
rather than like
what is what is the hypey thing right
now that you could dive into that if
you're lucky someone will buy your
company and i know see but what do you
think about that
well i i was going to say um you know i
spent five years just fanboying xavier
from afar i thought he was like the
coolest guy the coolest entrepreneur
he was building this social impact

[20:00]
he was building this social impact
business in africa lighting millions of
people's homes
um you know raising capital for flying
back and forth between europe africa and
california
and obviously very positively affecting
people's lives but simultaneously
building this incredible
recurring revenue kind of commodity
business that people really needed so
you know that was something that i
really looked up to him for and it was
greg was really in that room in that
mastermind that sean used to host where
xavier and i became really good friends
um and it was it wasn't until many years
later that we came up with the idea for
enduring but that certainly was the
genesis of it
and
sam do you remember what the actual like
when we came up with the idea i feel
like it evolved so organically like i
don't remember what specific
conversation it was it was like oh let's
let's do this thing
yeah i don't i don't recall the exact
day i think it really started with you
know you you hired a ceo at your

[21:00]
know you you hired a ceo at your
previous business and for years you guys
had worked together
you know you were ready to move on to
your next thing and we first decided
that we wanted to do something together
and then it evolved into this
conversation around well the next thing
we do
let's
reverse engineer what is the last
business we would ever want to work on
right like what is something that we
would want to work on for the next 20 30
or 40 years which is really different
from our startup experience both i know
you and i talked about this where you
start something you know in your head
you're like i'm gonna sprint after this
for five to ten years and then i'm gonna
sell it or i'll hire a ceo and leave and
the idea for enduring was really
how can we think long term about
something and then that's when i think
we really pointed our kind of uh our
laser towards uh towards warren buffett
and what he had done
uh with berkshire hathaway and i think
we were always fanboys of his of his
yeah but that's i think like anyone
anyone that had had that experience uh

[22:01]
anyone that had had that experience uh
you know of like being interested in
investing and you know reading the
berkshire hathaway annual letters uh you
know probably had that like same
uh
feeling of like fanboying around it
right like you know the general story
around berkshire and and warren buffett
just for anyone that doesn't know it
that you should go read it if you're at
all interested in investing but
basically they bought you know he bought
a dying textile mill berkshire hathaway
and it was cash flowing um pretty
significantly i think like on the order
of several million dollars a year um and
at the time he was like reinvesting you
know the money into the dying textile
industry
quickly realized that that wasn't the
smartest way to reinvest the dollars for
the best long-term compounding return
and so started reinvesting the dollars
from that um from that business into
higher profit you know and more kind of
like macro growth industries which you
know has now grown into a massive you
know hundreds of billions of dollar
conglomerate or non-conglomerate holding

[23:00]
conglomerate or non-conglomerate holding
company of insurance and you know big
other like heavy industrial businesses
and bnsf and you know the railroad
company a whole lot of other things but
basically started this engine of taking
cash flows and reinvesting them into um
you know long-term compounders
the reason i say that a lot of people
fanboy over is i think a lot of people
read it fanboy over the idea sounds
really sweet oh so cool you know quote
warren buffett all the time on twitter
uh
everybody be greedy when everyone's
fearful like it's the it's all in vogue
to quote it very few people actually go
and do anything about it and go and
build around this general concept and
idea uh you guys did
so
can we just like dive into it a little
bit um
from the get-go did you envision the
structure that it was going to take um
you know and kind of the way that that
created certain advantages from a tax
perspective and from an ability to
reinvest that really uh attractive um
you know kind of compound growth rates
like what was the general

[24:01]
like what was the general
vision for it from the get-go yeah i can
i can start diving into that so you know
the kind of search fund and private
equity road is really well trodden so if
you if you know if you heard of search
funds that's essentially where an mba
goes and raises a bit of money to go try
to acquire a business
and then run it
and essentially the way they're
compensated for doing this looks a lot
like private equity which is
fundamentally a sort of
more or less a carried interest model
i get if i sell it for more than i paid
for it then i get some some of the gain
in my pocket yeah this is where i get
this is worth pausing on sorry sorry
this is worth pausing on because it's
actually a really interesting model that
has proliferated a ton recently this
search fund model it's like it's become
you know you know this you guys know
this i spent the first seven years of my
career in private equity and um several
of our employees left went to business
school and then raised search funds and
it became like you know it used to be

[25:00]
it became like you know it used to be
that people would go to stanford
business school or harvard business
school and then go take a job at
mckinsey or at a private equity fund and
it became the new like in vogue thing to
go do after business school because all
of a sudden you're armed with this
network of really wealthy people or
people that think you're really
impressive that you can convince to give
you what is effectively a blank check
like they commit to
uh investing in whatever business you
find you don't have a business and you
say like okay let's let me go raise a 10
million dollar search fund and you now
have committed 10 million dollars it's
not in your bank account but people have
committed that they're going to fund it
when you find the business now you go
and you know
go through phone books or like the
digital version of phone books and find
a bunch of businesses you know maybe you
find like a
local or regional hvac business uh that
is not optimized for whatever reason you
strike up a deal with the you know the
owner of the business that you're going
to acquire it you call all the people
who have given you the commitment to
give you the funding for the deal you

[26:00]
give you the funding for the deal you
buy the business and then as xavier
alluded to you kind of you know normally
it's in the form of like what's called
promote but you effectively have you
know kind of upside equity that you
didn't have to buy into in this in this
business going forward so if you
eventually sell it you now kind of got
paid both a salary while you were
running it and then also on top of that
you know a big chunk of proceeds if you
expand the equity value of the business
but it's a pretty interesting thing um
for young people to potentially do if
you are coming out of business school or
you do have a network of people that
might be willing to fund you to do
something it's a pretty cool opportunity
and like a way to take a big swing
without having a whole ton of downside
risk since it's not your upfront capital
yeah i know i really think it is and in
some ways we sort of started as a search
fund on steroids in the sense that we
were saying we're not just going to go
buy one business we're going to go buy a
portfolio of businesses but the
structure was very different so
we didn't like the promote structure
because it fundamentally incentivizes

[27:02]
because it fundamentally incentivizes
selling and selling as quickly as you
can
and i've just been on both sides of that
transaction so both
selling a business and buying some
businesses while i've been running
businesses and
i know how much work it takes to
actually prepare a business for sale if
you're going to do it right and you
really run a business differently and
there's no two ways about it you run it
differently if you're going to long term
hold it than if you're going to sell for
maximum proceeds um
and so that uh that sort of didn't
appeal to us and also on the on the
buffett side you had to look at why did
buffett not start a hedge fund or he
actually disbanded an investment
partnership and
and bought berkshire and it's
it's so that he could have
a stock in one company and then the cash
flow could flow up to that company and
he could keep allocating it and so
having an internal capital market means
i don't need all the friction of going
to a pool of investors and pitching them
an idea and saying here's how much you
get and here's how much i get and or if

[28:02]
get and here's how much i get and or if
i need debt going to a bank and saying
okay well to borrow some money so i have
cash flow from business a and cash and
business b needs some investment capital
you can just make that decision and go
and the the increase in efficiency is
enormous right so even if you don't
have the tax advantages which you do
it's it's the ideal structure for
long-term compounding you have
you have the flexibility of decision
making and operation and
and the portfolio effect that if one of
your businesses is suffering that
doesn't mean the whole thing's going to
crumble it just means that that business
may run at zero profit for a while while
the other ones um you know the other
ones keep cranking
um
like what are the high points of the
actual structure of it so if you wanted
to set up something that has
um these features of of the vehicle like
the berkshire hathaway the baby
berkshire that you guys are building it
enduring what are the
the kind of the key features that uh
that it would have

[29:00]
that it would have
so the most key feature is that it has a
parent holding company that's a c
corporation and ideally that c
corporation has very few to no employees
rc corporation has no employees it's um
how we actually even save and i just get
a salary from enduring consulting group
llc which is a subsidiary so you really
try to wall off the the battleship at
the top and the only thing the
battleship at the top does is have
capital go in and capital go out so if
we need capital to buy businesses then
shareholders buy shares and capital goes
into the holding company if we uh want
to buy a business or invest in one of
the ones we already own the capital goes
out in the holding company
and then the
subsidiaries are a combination of c
corps and llcs
we have a whole menagerie there's
probably 16 of them or so that are
underneath us right now
and the way that sort of breaks down is
if we think a company will eventually
raise external capital or um
or spin out into the public markets on

[30:01]
or spin out into the public markets on
its own uh if we think it has that
potential then we'll set it up as a
c-corp because that's much
more friendly structure to take external
capital
if it's just a small cash flowing
business that we're just going to
reinvest the cash flow then it's uh llc
is a much simpler and lower cost
structure to do that in got it okay so a
couple questions um for either one of
you guys so
c-corp
at the top
um what's the reason for not wanting any
people associated with that like what
why is that is that a qsbs thing because
i know like i want to get into qsps and
understand that for people as well
um it's just risk mitigation right
anytime you have an employee there is
some small chance they could yeah i
could i could slip on an ice patch on my
way to work and have a beef with cave
and sue the company right or there's a
um
there's just small risks that you want
to minimize so for example we don't have
any debt

[31:00]
any debt
that is guaranteed by the parent company
that's very important because then
if business a for some reason has a
catastrophic failure it doesn't take
down
the rest of the ship
so you're sort of limited in your
exposure in each business in in terms of
the money you invested and that's that's
a real buffet ism is don't lose money i
think that's that's one aspect of his
model that is really underestimated is
yeah is is his view of the downside risk
he's actually okay with relatively low
rates of return as long as there's some
uh possibility of growth of the business
he bought
um yeah so he's not thought that that
was i always thought that that was like
a really interesting um
just like experiencing sort of two ends
of the spectrum of investing personally
like you know going from private equity
and honestly like i was at a
value-oriented private equity shop so
going from that to doing early stage
venture stuff it was a really
interesting change because in in you
know in value-oriented private equity it

[32:00]
know in value-oriented private equity it
was like the whole thing you're
basically like you're underwriting
credit almost where you can't lose money
and if you manage to just not lose money
on deals like if your bad deals are a
0.7 moic like you get back some of your
money you like claw your way to a you
know shitty .05 outcome or something but
you don't just get you know washed it's
pretty hard to have a bad fund if you do
that over and over again if you're like
you know buying reasonable businesses
because ultimately you have a few that
do 5x or 7. like something goes really
well and it clicks and it goes your way
and if you can just avoid those like
complete washout deals the fun turns out
pretty well and that's like more the
buffett model versus venture where it's
like yeah i'm gonna get washed out on
nine out of ten and if the one is a
thousand x who cares and i feel totally
fine about the whole fund yeah i think i
think buffett talks a lot about the
hardest part about his job is sitting on
his hands and doing nothing
and the reason most people fail is
because humans are naturally impatient

[33:01]
because humans are naturally impatient
we want to be doing something we can't
sit still in a room so a good
opportunity might come at us and we know
it's not the best one but we jump at it
right and that's when things can fall
apart for your fund so a big part of our
job and something that xavier and i talk
a lot about is
there's thousands or millions of great
opportunities out there especially in
this segment of the market where we
participate in which is really the smbs
and if a deal isn't a perfect fit if it
doesn't seem like an obvious growth
opportunity or worst case scenario as
you said we get our money back then we
just pass you know we're happy to spend
a few months doing our diligence
understanding in business and if it
doesn't check the boxes
even despite all that effort and maybe
costs we're happy to just wait you know
we have our little capital engine going
so no matter what we have cash flow that
we can pull on at a later date
what are some
buffet-isms that

[34:01]
buffet-isms that
are sacred to you all like you know you
maybe it's like uh
a few of them that you're just like wow
this is how we're running enduring and
what are some buffetisms that you're
like wow he is totally
wrong on that
and that's a great question um that is a
great question
all right i'll shoot um
so i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm terrible at
quoting things so but he has he has this
notion of management by abdication
that
you um you basically that as long as you
have the right ceo and they're
compensated properly based on the
company's success the best thing you can
do is probably leave them alone
and so i mean buffett took this to
incredible extremes where
he would not even ask for financial
reports from companies for sometimes you
know years at a time if he trusted the
ceo let alone like a monthly board call
or quarterly board call
he'd just find the right guy
and you know sort of let them loose they

[35:01]
and you know sort of let them loose they
wouldn't standardize anything there's
literally still 40 people in the
berkshire head office and most of them
do the tax return and
it's amazing
and so
you know they run it like a small
business i mean it's like
you know warren and charlie and like the
two ted's and like a few other guys like
deciding okay we'll put 400 million into
snowflake okay we'll buy this 20 billion
dollar company you know they'll make
these monumental decisions with an
awfully small team
um
and so i think that it's amazing like
despite having
had that really clear message from him
we almost immediately went oh it'd be
nice to have a recruiter on our team
let's hire a recruiter and then
sure enough what happens she was a
perfectly good recruiter but then the
ceos start losing agency and they're
like oh well it's a during ventures job
to recruit my talent so i'm not going to
worry about that i'm just going to
interview whoever they bring me and the
second people start losing agency they

[36:00]
second people start losing agency they
don't have full responsibility for the
outcome of their business which is
actually the the most fulfilling work as
a ceo and like also the thing that makes
the model scalable
and so i think it's also why buffett can
be in industries he doesn't understand
at all
because uh you know he doesn't know how
to make airplane parts but he knows what
a good airplane parts making company
looks like and he knows what a ceo does
when they're running it competently um
and so sometimes people will try to say
oh well warren buffett owns this company
and they have a sexual harassment suit
or something like that you know
berkshire hathaway has a bad culture and
like berkshire hathaway doesn't have a
culture it's an owner of these companies
and it doesn't try to impose its culture
on on the individual organizations
that's really driven by the by the ceos
um
so i think that's that's something
really sacred and then i'll say one
thing i think we could do better if we
do it right
which is uh federating capital
allocation and so
uh buffett has a view that basically

[37:02]
uh buffett has a view that basically
it's his job deck allocate capital and
nobody else's
and i think there's a world where you
can train your management teams to also
be buyers of businesses in their sector
and
to
smartly allocate capital and it for and
and step into it so at first they
propose allocations of capital and we
evaluate those and push back and then
eventually
as we get five or ten years on i would
love to be able to just give
certain chunks of capital to managers
and say okay your job is to grow with
this to make one or two acquisitions
within your sector or invested in your
in your current operation whichever
whichever way you think you can grow the
best i mean one of the things that they
have to
that like i personally just feel they
need more pushback on because i like i'm
similar to you guys right like i've
always worshipped a lot of these quotes
and i have a ton that i love but like
their stance on
crypto and web 3 and bitcoin um and i
say day because i'm i'm grouping charlie

[38:00]
say day because i'm i'm grouping charlie
munger into this um
i just think is i just think it's kind
of silly like charlie munger has the
quote of you know you never allow
yourself to have an opinion on something
when you don't know the other side's
argument better than they do and i just
like you can say that that's great
there's no way they have dug into this i
don't think or understand it as well um
as the like true you know patrons of
that industry and yet they are extremely
vocal about their distaste for it and
that's like i i get it but i feel like
you're talking out of both sides of your
mouth um when you when you do something
like that like it it seems like what
would be logically consistent with their
perspective on on uh you know having an
opinion and earning an opinion would be
just not saying anything about bitcoin
and crypto and just saying like look we
don't get it we don't agree with it
we're not investing in it but like you
know calling it rat poison squared over
and over and over again and saying that
it's like you know for criminals and
degenerates and like
it's just maybe it's part of their
shtick and it's kind of the whole like
they're folksy and that's their thing

[39:00]
they're folksy and that's their thing
and you know they're eating coca-cola
you know they're like talking about
bitcoin and crypto being the worst thing
for human society while like drinking
coca-cola and you know eating candy on
stage um
i just like that whole thing it would be
the one area for me where i would just
kind of say like i get it if it's part
of their shtick but i just don't agree
with it
yeah they're definitely
creatures of their era every great
company has a great
narrative and the berkshire narrative is
so strong
around productive assets
buying wonderful businesses
uh
never bet against america like they've
got like these sayings that are so
iconic
and
i'm a crypto
guy
so obviously when i hear like icons like
charlie and buffett saying like
bitcoin is rap poison squared like a
tear slowly goes down my
face
but at the same time

[40:01]
but at the same time
if you ask them about gold
non-productive asset they're not buying
gold they did buy a gold mine though
well that's a product which is a
productive yeah
yeah
that's so i'm not surprised that they
latched on to it it's also i mean like
if you look at other things if you if
you're a believer in crypto and web3 and
you believe that you know it is like a
new paradigm for the internet or the new
age of the internet um
you know
warren and charlie have missed uh real
tech trends right like the the time when
they bought apple how long they passed
on amazon for like they have not been
historically very good at you know
predicting mega trends within tech um
and so maybe it's just you know circle
of confidence right like to go back to
one of their things maybe it's just out
of their wheelhouse and they can you
know have their narrative and their
shtick and the you know focusiness which
everyone loves and it's very endearing
um and it's just not worth paying
attention to like they're gonna keep

[41:00]
attention to like they're gonna keep
kind of saying their thing about it one
of the ones i absolutely love which i
think relates sieva to one thing you
were saying earlier is like
warren buffett's quote about like when
you find yourself at the bottom of a
hole the first thing you need to do is
just stop digging um i think about that
so often for my own life and myself
because
uh to your point earlier
like when i find myself in a bad
situation
whether it's investing or just like
personally you know whatever you screw
something up you're in a bad spot my
first uh instinct is always to create
motion i'm like all right i'm going to
do this do this do this take this action
jump this way do this thing um and
oftentimes you realize that like all of
that movement you're creating is
actually just digging yourself deeper
into whatever you're in and that the
real action that you need to take is
inaction it's literally just stepping
back and doing absolutely nothing for
whatever period of time um and i think
you alluded to it of like sometimes the
best investment decision is to just do
nothing to just say no um and i think

[42:01]
nothing to just say no um and i think
that that is like the mark for me of a
really sophisticated investor is the
ability to literally just do nothing and
you tweeted it i think recently so you
have a um something to the effect of
like you know the best investments are
made at the end of bear markets um not
at the beginning of them and so like
being really patient you know we're in
this time now where it's like oh asset
prices are down do i just start buying
things um how do i kind of go about this
and sometimes the answer is literally
just do nothing just wait like see how
it plays out i'm thinking about it now
with my venture fund
it feels like a great time to have dry
powder but i have no idea how much asset
prices are going to reset and so part of
me is like i kind of just want to pause
for three months and just see like in
three months what is the average seed
valuation gonna be my guess is it's
lower than what it is today
um and so doing nothing actually right
now would really benefit me in terms of
the vintage of the fund and how it's
gonna turn out
um so i i mean that that really
resonates with me more broadly yeah and

[43:01]
resonates with me more broadly yeah and
i think xavier and i you know relative
to maybe a year ago
we're still investing we're still
looking at opportunities but
um we're happy to be patient for another
three to six months to see where kind of
the world lands
where everything resets and then pick up
the pieces and jump back in with both
feet
so what uh what businesses do you guys
buy
and like how do you think like what's
your framework for
for buying businesses
we're we're really looking for
um what we call boring cash flow
businesses um and i don't think you know
they're not boring to everyone they're
really boring because nobody's writing
about them in the news they're not on
the front page of tech crunch you
usually won't hear about them in the
wall street journal
we really want to buy the businesses
that
power america is how i think about it
you know really those small mom-and-pop
shops of
blue oftentimes blue-collar industries

[44:02]
blue oftentimes blue-collar industries
that
um
you know that generate good revenue
incredible cash flow have been going for
20 30 years
um and now
you know maybe they don't their
employees don't want to take over or
they don't have a son or daughter that
wants to take over the business
and enduring ventures is just a perfect
buyer for that type of company
examples might be you know we love
plumbing service businesses
hvac service companies
we own a series of businesses that
provide broadband
to people's homes and offices
so all of these companies that are
largely recession resistant have been
around for a really long time that we
can buy a very reasonable multiple
multiple of cash flow that is
which is sometimes different than sas
which we can talk about but that's
really our sweet spot and it's follow
that playbook and do that over and over
again over a long period of time
xavier do you have anything to add there

[45:02]
xavier do you have anything to add there
yeah the only other thing i would add
color on that is we um we really like to
see some growth angle to the business
so we'd probably rather buy the number
three plumber in a metro rather than the
number one um
especially if we think that the number
one is is vulnerable in some way
and so when you're buying businesses you
you protect your downside by buying it a
little multiple but you really deliver
returns for your investors by by getting
the business on the growth track
especially if it wasn't before and that
usually usually comes with bringing in
new energetic management with with good
ideas
and then how are you actually buying
them so like
you know two of the principles that jump
out to me here um as far as the
advantages of your model it's like the
actual financing structure of how you're
financing the deals um you know to
generate returns and then um the whole
qsbs thing which i want to just like
understand a little bit better so how
are you financing the deals like are you
doing
sba loans are you doing seller financing

[46:01]
sba loans are you doing seller financing
you know kind of what's that like actual
structure of how you're doing these
deals that people can take away to you
know to maybe execute in the future for
themselves
yeah so there's we we've done everything
in kitchen sink so everything from all
equity to seller finance to sba
uh to uh you know sort of we've gotten
close on some mezzanine financing we
haven't actually done one with a
mezzanine lender
but there are folks out there who will
lend say five to ten million dollars
you know they lend to search funds for
example which are sort of classic um you
know uh users of that capital i would
say
if you think about the universe of
businesses you can buy if it's under say
500 000 in profits you ought to figure
out a way to buy it personally as a
listener with an sba loan that's like a
real sweet spot
because you can probably buy that
business for one to two million dollars
and it'll set you for life if you just
run it properly and grow it a bit
um

[47:00]
um
and how does that work so like if
someone wanted to do that if i found a
half a million dollar a year profit you
know local landscaping business that i
wanted to acquire um how would i
actually go about getting an sba loan
for that and what would you know typical
kind of terms like what would i be
signing up for with that sba loan and
like how much cash would have to come
out of pocket just like give me a quick
you know napkin math on it so napkin
math is let's say you pay three times
cash flow which is very achievable some
sectors you'll have to pay more some
sectors you can even pay less but let's
just call it three times um so you're
paying 1.5 million for it
you are taking an sba loan for 80 to 90
percent of that purchase price so
you're coming out of pocket maybe 150 to
300 000
if you don't have that 150 to 300 000
um you can get an investor to come in
and provide most of the capital if
you're if you sort of have no money at
all and no assets at all sometimes the
bank will be cautious just because

[48:01]
bank will be cautious just because
you're you're a very weak uh guarantor
there's no sign you can put in any more
money if things go sideways um but those
deals can still get done
um
and then the sba loan is a 10-year loan
so your
payments on that would be awfully
reasonable let's say 15 dollars a month
just just spitballing
and so
maybe a third of that cash flow goes to
service the debt um and even without
growing the business another third goes
to pay your living expenses and then you
have a third you can sort of reinvest in
in the business
um
now if you can grow that from 500k to a
million in cash flow that millionaire
cash flow is probably worth four or five
times and so you've created two or three
million dollars of equity value right
there in addition to having obviously
really strong monthly cash flow for your
personal use
yeah this is like
the entire model of like the opt out
from the traditional track that i find
so interesting and like great greg and i

[49:01]
so interesting and like great greg and i
have differences of opinion on like the
headaches of potentially running one of
these as an individual um which i think
are very real and people need to
consider because you actually need to go
run this business if you're gonna do
that form of like a one person you know
sba go buy a landscaping business but
it's a pretty neat idea like you know i
had a friend who was working at deloitte
and i don't know he's probably making
150 a year as like a director at
deloitte and doing quite well but it was
like really stressful wasn't getting to
spend time with his family and he
literally went and did this he bought a
bought a local landscaping business and
got an sba loan and now he's probably
making like a million a year he has
employees he's like
you know probably works like 20 hours a
week at this point it was a grind for a
while as he got it off the ground for
sure but it was kind of a cool way that
he just like within a year opted out
from the entire track that he was on
like the partner track at this
consultancy and did it the other thing
which you mentioned that i think is so
cool that people don't fully appreciate
with like an sba loan or with business

[50:00]
with like an sba loan or with business
loans when you acquire a business
it's like
people equate it to like getting a
mortgage when you buy a house
the challenge with that uh with equating
it to that is like when you buy a
mortgage with a house you take sorry
when you buy a house with a mortgage
you're you're taking a loan against your
income and so like your income is what's
kind of providing the collateral that
they're um that they're basing the loan
on um when you buy a business with an
sba loan you're kind of buying the
business with itself because you're
buying you're getting the loan against
the cash flows of the actual company it
has nothing to do with you there might
be a personal guarantee on the back end
in that case but you're able to now
service the debt with the cash flows
from the business and so like
it's a it's a unique hack of american
capitalism that you're able to buy
businesses with loans against the cash
flows of those businesses um it's just
like a very neat thing and then you know
combine that with seller financing which
you can often get in these deals um and
you can often do them with very very
little cash up front um which generates

[51:01]
little cash up front um which generates
just an absurd return on your equity
that's that's exactly right i mean you
you should really underwrite 100 equity
returns when you when you do one of
these um and that should be a very that
should be a base case that's like
growing the business 10 a year
um
so
it's really it's really really juicy um
there's some really good sba lenders out
there some of them are on twitter uh we
have one
uh we use again and again happy to send
a referral if anyone dn wants to dm me
uh for that
um
but uh yeah it's it's a really special i
mean it's an only in america thing i i
don't know the equivalent anywhere else
in the world
okay so that's that one um and then qsbs
you got to hit us with soon to get uh
here on this because um i i just have so
many people like asking me the question
i don't know all the details of it so
like just hit me with uh the the kind of
high points on like what is qsbs and why
does it matter and why is it such an
unbelievable hack for um you know for

[52:01]
unbelievable hack for um you know for
business owners
so if you set up as a c corp and you buy
original shares so you you invest some
money that could be just you register
the business online and you put in 50
to get your shares and then you hold
those shares for five years and you sell
them and there's a few other caveats
consult your cpa or tax advisor on this
but um
essentially you can sell up to 10
million dollars of that stock uh
tax-free
you may pay state capital gains but you
won't pay federal capital gains on it
um
you can even go further you can have
your kids buy some of the stock your
wife buy some of the stock and they each
person um gets a 10 million dollar
exclusion so it's kind of amazing um
and this is up to the first 50 million
dollars in assets on the balance sheet
of the company so all of our original
investors along with me and sieva had
that treatment in the company um
and uh you you do as well as an investor

[53:01]
and uh you you do as well as an investor
i think about the first eight million of
that we raised uh qualified as qsps so
when you do sell if you hold for five
years um that should be a very clean
transaction
25 years is my plan at least
beautiful
for what it's worth um
i mean this is like
again you know america being the home of
um you know of entrepreneurship and and
kind of incentivizing capitalism um it's
an amazing you know people push back
against this kind of stuff because
they're like oh you should be paying
your taxes the flip side of that is this
incentivizes a whole lot of people to go
and build and to go and create jobs and
um you know and build businesses because
you are going to get these advantages
from doing it versus you know working in
a in a salary job so i um i think it's
amazing and it's like a very cool way
that um you know that builders and that
people that are kind of compounding long
term and doing things for the long term
to your point the five plus year thing
so you're not doing you can't do this
with like quick flip you know flip

[54:00]
with like quick flip you know flip
something you know in a year and hope to
get the same tax advantage um it just
incentivizes uh entrepreneurial
long-term thinking
which i just find to be a really awesome
thing no it's a really smart policy and
it's it has suffered some assaults by
some small-minded people so it's
important we we keep fighting for it it
almost got taken out in the in the
buildback better bill which was
uh but it but it survived
huh
um so i know we're running up close to
the end of time and we're gonna have to
do like a follow-up episode on all of
this um because there's just there's too
much to cover in one session what like
maybe from each of you um
it would just be great to like get some
just general um
either general closing thoughts on you
know how listeners can kind of take away
some of the insights from what you guys
are doing to
um you know to go and do this like
things you wish you knew um as it were
uh or
uh give us like one just like
fascinating business or story that

[55:00]
fascinating business or story that
you've seen recently that is um you know
kind of capturing your attention sort of
like uh sieva's scaffolding story that
he shared recently that that that
drummed up a lot of interest on twitter
i love that business too i still think
about it like on a weekly basis um
so
i'll give the advice because i get hit
up a lot on twitter dms where people are
saying hey i want to buy a business like
what should i do
and
i think the number one thing is honestly
having a really honest conversation with
yourself and your spouse about like your
readiness on a scale of one to ten to do
it because it absolutely can be a grind
to run a business and it's it's probably
an intensity that if you've only worked
in an office you haven't fully
experienced because and i've seen i have
seen people um you know where businesses
haven't gone well
really suffer and really grind for years
and years and that's not you know that's
not what you want to see
um but at the same time it's
when you look at the risk return of
going and buying a company and being in

[56:01]
going and buying a company and being in
your own and being on the ownership side
of the table it's it's truly
life-changing not only for you but
potentially for your your children your
grandchildren so the risk reward
trade-off is heavily in reward favor
but if you don't know how if you never
manage people especially if you have
never managed blue collar people if
you've never managed p l
um it could make sense to go work in a
small business and help them build it
and make sure that that feels like what
you want to do before you actually go go
try to buy one i see some folks who are
like 23 saying i'm gonna go go and buy a
landscaping company and it's like man
that could go horribly awry because you
never manage people
so you know that was that was the the
gift that i think sieve and i both had
is that we had we had done every job
that you could do in business before we
went and started buying them and so even
though we might not know something
specific about plumbing we we do know if
a business is working or not by looking
at the financial statements and it's

[57:00]
at the financial statements and it's
it's financial health as well as
culturally and and the team perspective
and
apply some heuristics to that um so i
think that that's that's the advice i
would leave to people but that doesn't
scare you like
you're
you both are have experience in tech
building tech businesses then all of a
sudden you buy this
uh plumbing business and you're in the
plumbing
business um but you can't fix your own
toilet
you know like does that not scare you or
are you that confident that you're gonna
hire the right people to manage it and
you'll be able to troubleshoot it
yeah it's it's a little article of faith
i mean uh better world books was more of
a logistics company than it was a tech
business so with 300 people working in
three warehouses around the globe and
shipping an enormous amount of books
here here and there um so i think like
in just in terms of sort of managing a
blue-collar workforce i probably got a
little more exposure than most folks in
the tech world

[58:00]
the tech world
um but the point is really well taken
and it does it's a little scarier
uh for sure to buy a business you don't
fully understand and i think that's
something we've really gone into is
saying we need to really understand how
this business makes money and where we
would find the kind of people who know
how to run this business we don't need
to be able to run it but we need to be
able to
understand it if something goes wrong
and you know business like scaffolding
you actually can understand a bit more
simply than maybe some you know some
industrial chemicals business where you
know it's really it's really sort of
obscure and you don't know
exactly what could go wrong
um and i think we've seen that in our
acquisitions that the best businesses
we've bought have been at least somewhat
in our circle of competence and in a
weird way local plumbing and hvac is as
much about internet marketing as it is
about um yeah
there is kind of like generalized
knowledge versus specific knowledge in
these businesses too and like you guys
have um incredible generalized knowledge

[59:02]
have um incredible generalized knowledge
and have probably been able to find you
know patterns across all of these that
apply and then it's like how do you
retain the people that have the
specialized knowledge that you really
can't afford to lose to greg's point
like the people that
if you know if they're gone and you you
lose their insights or their um you know
their kind of like uh institutional
knowledge um as a good way to say it
you're gonna be in a lot of trouble and
then making sure you incentivize those
people for the long run absolutely um
steve do you have a do you have a
business uh want to share one of our
businesses we've seen
um yeah i'm happy to and i think you
know adding to some of the comments you
were saying earlier i also get dm quite
a bit on twitter from people that want
to start
holdco's and or holding companies and
the main
focus is
identify your ongoing cash flow source
and that may mean buying a business
right using sba debt to buy something
small that then generates cash flow for

[1:00:01]
small that then generates cash flow for
you so you can buy more businesses
or in the world of the internet you know
that may mean starting your own business
be a content creator
you know create a course or whatever it
is that allows you to build
some ongoing cash flow engine your own
little version of the berkshire textile
mail because once you have that you have
unlimited unlimited opportunities to go
out and buy more businesses and that's
really been our focus at least in the
early days of enduring
um
and then as far as like businesses that
we love you know i'm a i'm a die harder
for the blue collar businesses the
high cash flow generating companies
recently i actually posted a twitter
thread about a scaffolding business
that we looked at in the midwest
we ended up passing on it but i can
share some of the fun dynamics of that
one scaffolding is is an incredibly cool
concept because if you think about it
you're buying a bunch of equipment right

[1:01:01]
you're buying a bunch of equipment right
all the different scaffolding pieces
that you're renting out to general
contractors
but once you buy that equipment which
which can be really expensive so that's
a real barrier to entry which is tough
for new people but great for people that
already have the equipment
um but once you have that equipment
let's say you have 10 million dollars of
scaffolding product you can reuse that
scaffolding equipment year after year
for all of your contractors and you
really don't have to replace it too
often you know of course there's some
maintenance cost there's going to be
some amount of costs where you're buying
the latest and greatest equipment but
your core business is this beautiful
recurring revenue engine and the one we
looked at
in in the midwest was doing about four
million of ebitda
we could have bought it at what wasn't
xavier maybe four times he did that yeah
i think four times four times even uh
yeah
um
and you know what you get paid you just
get up

[1:02:00]
get up
you get you have to get paid to put up
the scaffolding you get paid a day rate
well it's up so any construction delays
just go in your favor and then you get
paid to take down the scaffolding it's
amazing
yeah and i mean just to like the
craziness of buying companies at four
times ebitda like in a world where
everybody was talking about you know
100x uh uh adjusted you know or like you
know arr in um
in the venture world
six months ago or something like buying
a business for four times cash flow you
know ebitda as a proxy for cash flow um
is insane like if you just do the math
on you know i bought it for four times
that uh you know and so it's going to
generate um you know and it generates
its ebitda with no growth uh in an
unlevered world where i didn't use any
debt i bought it with all cash i'm still
generating a 25 return on that and now i
lever that uh you know with some debt
and you're generating you know you
generate like 100 plus return if you if
you leverage effectively potentially in
year one with no growth it's like it's

[1:03:01]
year one with no growth it's like it's
completely insane
um when you uh when you think about the
math of buying businesses at that price
i always thought by the way um seva that
like the best business in the world is
those um uh the like
dumpsters that get dropped at like
construction sites and just sit there um
yeah like at even in like office parks
and at um like apartment buildings
there's just like a dumpster that sits
outside and they come and pick it up
every now and then but it just sits
there and it has to be rented at like a
pretty attractive rate you never have to
maintain those things because they're
just like old dumpsters there's no like
specialized equipment no one's standing
on them like scaffolding um that has to
be an unbelievable business
yeah i mean we love anything where you
can buy it once and just rent it over
and over again i think there's a
franchise that's taken off uh like maybe
one of the fastest growing franchises
right now they're called like junk
crushers i'm totally butching it
butchering it but basically they put
that junk bin in front of your house you

[1:04:02]
that junk bin in front of your house you
put a bunch of stuff in it and the only
difference is that they have a machine
that comes and compresses it in order to
create more space for you so it's much
cheaper than
the previous rendition where like maybe
your chairs alone filled up the jump um
and they're doing incredibly well
they're going super fast and we
certainly have our eye on them
oh that's cool that's a cool business
you know i think the ultimate god of the
cash flow businesses is the smart card
at the airport
every you notice that thing where you
pay six dollars to get an airport cart
yeah i mean what whoever invented that
to me is the all-time genius of cash
flow businesses yeah
that yeah that's probably right actually
i'm actually curious now now that you
mentioned that i want to dig into this
now after like if anyone knows that's
listening any of the mechanics of those
businesses um i would love to learn more
about that one because like i mean it
used to be that there were people it was
like someone would come and you'd have
to pay them and they'd kind of like hawk
you down and you know you'd have to tip
them or whatever it was for helping you
like when i was a kid and that still

[1:05:00]
like when i was a kid and that still
exists in india actually um and then it
became the coin operated uh you know
dolly carts and now it's credit card
like i think you could pay with a credit
card and get one of those um i haven't
used one in years but i wonder what the
actual economics are of those things
yeah they must have a revenue share with
the airport or something but it's it's
it like solves the airport problem
because it makes it easier for people to
load and unload it uh you know you pay
six bucks when you get it and you don't
really care where the person leaves it
because either someone else will take it
for free i think you return it you get
like a quarter or something so there's
like some incentive for people just go
walk around and return them and then
every once in a while someone walks
around the airport at the end of the
night and then picks everything up
and there's no alternative like you just
you have to do it otherwise you're not
getting your bags you know if you have
three screaming kids and you got all
your big bags for your long vacation to
hawaii like you're just paying the six
bucks
you're paying the uh yeah the pre you
know like there's no uh there's no
pricing discipline around that all right

[1:06:00]
pricing discipline around that all right
well guys this was awesome um absolute
blast and i feel like i um i have like a
hundred things that i learned and now a
hundred more things that i need to spend
more time learning um because you've
opened my eyes to a bunch of cool new
stuff so thank you both so much for uh
for joining where can people find you i
know you guys are both sharing a lot on
twitter um i believe it's at xavier
helgeson um and we'll put in the show
notes the spelling of of your guys names
because neither one of you has a
particularly easy last name and at sieva
kaczynski um both
highly recommend following because um
sharing some of the most interesting
tactical insights that i've seen on
twitter and and what i think of is like
real earned insights um from things that
you're doing actively on here so um
super super thankful for for both of you
coming on yeah my biggest takeaway is
thinking about the plumbing business as
an internet marketing business like if
you start thinking about all these
services businesses as really just like

[1:07:00]
services businesses as really just like
internet like 95 percent internet
marketing 5
like
sort of old-school
utility then that really changes your
mindset on these things
and then you can just go one by one and
look at all these different cash cow
industries
and see how you can play a role so
thanks for that and uh that's a great
takeaway greg because i think you you
guys all know nick huber um the uh
sweaty startup on twitter but he had a
thing a while back that was like
um
the best way to find business
opportunities is to go to all of the
like local businesses um in the niche
that you're trying to operate in and
look for the ones that still have a fax
number listed on their website or like
don't have a website or the website's
not optimized for mobile and you'll
immediately identify opportunities
because you'll be if you're thinking
about you know opportunities to improve
it and you know create more tech
enablement um clearly anyone that still
has a fax number on their on their page
or or at their business is is not ready
for uh for what the future looks like

[1:08:00]
for uh for what the future looks like
that's the truth i always like that
honestly you can even scribe you can
even sell leads you can start out
internet marketing just sell leads to
local plumbing companies and once you
have the engine cranking then you can
eventually go buy one it's a really
interesting strategy that i've seen
before
and often that's the best way to start
because you actually learn you know you
learn the players that way
you learn the economics that way so yeah
folks listening like
get in the leads business
and it's a fantastic business and a
great way to learn
we should do an episode on that greg we
should do an episode on the leads
business there's a i think there's a lot
to dig into there that'd be super
interesting yeah i've got some people
there awesome all right guys well thank
you so much super appreciate it um look
forward to everyone that's listening
following you guys and and learning more
from you guys in the future so thank you
both
thanks guys all right thanks guys
