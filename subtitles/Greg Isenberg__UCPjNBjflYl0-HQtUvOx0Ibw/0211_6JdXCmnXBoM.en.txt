[00:00]
beauty of it you build the audience the
world is your oyster as you know like
once you have the audience it the
product's the easiest thing to do I mean
even if you don't want to create your
own just promote other people's ADHD
apps like but the point is everyone's
trying to go they go right for the
product they're going okay I want to
make an ADHD chair they're forgetting
the most important part and the
opportunity in this space is to create
the brand so when you think of I need
help with ADHD I want to do something
about it I go to Julius and that's the
brand associated with this growing huge
market and you don't see very often a
huge growing Market without a go-to
brand and that's what we're
[Music]
seeing we're we're going straight into
it yep Brian Dean on the podcast I think
this might be the best ever episode of
the 150 episodes or what ever I've done

[01:00]
the 150 episodes or what ever I've done
in this podcast you're literally calling
me from your
couch yeah it's more of an intimate uh
episode we're getting we're just going
right into it it's already the best
episode it's only like 20 seconds in so
all the pressure is off now totally yeah
we wanted to invite you into Brian
Brian's
home yeah that's what we're going for
production meeting we had before is H
what we talked about exactly all right
man
we're getting into it so you
are the trend God that I'm just gonna
I'm just GNA call you that that's what
I'm gonna do okay not gonna argue with
that you might even call yourself the
exploding topics God all right and so I
was hoping that you can come on and you
can share some of the most interesting
Trends topics and ideas and you're a
listener of the Pod so you know what
this audience
wants uh Brian what do you got for us

[02:00]
wants uh Brian what do you got for us
yeah the first idea right off the bat is
one that I would pay for it's a take my
money situation is an AI content
updater so there are a million and one
tools for creating content with AI
there's you know content writing tools
there's uh tools that do outlines there
are tools that rewrite your content
there are tools that'll take your long
form video and chop it up into shorts
but what real Publishers need is help
updating their existing Content Library
so for example with exploding topics we
have maybe like 500 blog posts which is
nothing compared to most Publishers and
even that we have trouble keeping up to
date we have about uh you know one and a
half full-time people constantly
updating this content and they're going
in they're saying okay this stats a
little bit old or this isn't really as
relevant anymore or there's a link
that's broken or there's a source that's

[03:00]
that's broken or there's a source that's
more recent we can use and they're doing
it manually so if there was a a tool
that could go through existing Content
Library find areas that need to be
updated and actually go into your CMS
and update it it would be a
GameChanger what do you think you can
charge for something like that I would
say this would be something you'd want
to go more Enterprise for sure like
starting at a thousand bucks a month
because anyone who has a small con if
you don't publish that much or have a
big Library it's not that valuable
because you can do it manually you can
just use spreadsheets and have a couple
staff members do it that's what we're
doing now but let's say you have 25,000
posts you're like Tom's guide or
something you it's and it's insane to
even think of doing that manually but
you need to to keep the stuff up to date
because it's about technology so I would
say you're starting at like th000 5,000
10,000 you know that big Enterprise
contract level and if you were to start
something like this okay so this is a
great idea I see the need I actually I

[04:03]
great idea I see the need I actually I
would pay pay definitely a few thousand
doar a month for something like
this uh how would you go about like
actually starting this like what do you
do what okay what's next the first thing
I would build it for myself so I'd be my
own case study to start with um and it's
one of the those business ideas are
usually in my opinion the best because
you're you you're using it yourself so
you can see what needs to be added what
doesn't need to be done where does it
mess up where is it good where is it bad
so first thing would definitely be
building a beta that I test out on my
own site or a different property that I
own to get the nuts and bolts out um and
then from there I'd probably do manual
Outreach and just be like you have this
massive Library I'm seeing a bunch of
posts that haven't been updated in three
years we have software that'll just go
in use Ai and give it some the updates
that it
needs what about charging per update
instead of going monthly there's this
monthly subscription fatigue I feel like

[05:02]
monthly subscription fatigue I feel like
a no-brainer offer could be like per
update what do you think yeah I love it
yeah and better expansion Revenue too
because with the tier system it's hard
to get people to move up from the
different tiers you can I mean it's not
possible but there's friction there you
have to lock out a feature or lock out a
number of seats the person has to click
a button they have to then uh you know
decide on the next plan and I don't know
if I really need it or should I just
wait till next month but if you just do
it where you know it's the first 10
updates are free or five updates are
free and then $1 each additional update
per month then that that's actually
probably better and have you seen anyone
doing this no but I haven't looked like
super extensively but I haven't seen it
feel like you would know yeah I kind of
yeah I feel like I would have come
across it because I've had this idea
since I started the exploring topics
blog got big you know with you know we
got like 650,000 visitors a month and

[06:02]
got like 650,000 visitors a month and
I'm thinking how and we're hiring all
these people to update I'm just like how
can we automate this so I have my radar
set to find this and I haven't seen
anything out there for this Brian this
is what I'm talking about this this is
such a good
idea yeah this is a take my money
situation and the best part about it is
that it's a it's a no-brainer offer for
the right customer if you reach out to a
smaller blog and doing $49 a month
you're going to be in a world of pain
with this product but if you go to the
bigger Publishers that have at least and
it's easy to find you're you're
literally your leads are sites that have
more than x number of pages on the site
and assuming those are that's blog
content and you just cold Outreach and
say I not and I noticed you have these
posts that are out of date we just built
something that can update them or if you
want to go crazy here are you know
here's the updated versions that our
software created for you you know let me

[07:00]
software created for you you know let me
know if this is something you you'd like
to automate sh don't tell anyone but
I've got 30 plus startup ideas that
could make you millions and I'm giving
them away for free these aren't just
random guesses they're validated
Concepts from entrepreneurs who built
hundred million plus businesses I've
compil them into one simple
database compiled from hundreds of
conversations
I've had on my podcast but the main
thing is most of these ideas don't need
a single investor some cost nothing to
start I'm pretty much handing you a
cheat sheet the idea bank is your
startup
shortcut just click below to get
access your next cash flowing business
is waiting for you I like it I like it
so dude this is just I like it there's
nothing more to say yeah I have

[08:00]
nothing more to say yeah I have
literally nothing more to say do you
want my next idea I guess that's the as
a host I thought you would just like ask
but no I'll just I'm gonna I'm gonna
make it weird I'm just gonna try to make
it as weird as possible all right great
so my second one is definitely not indie
hacker business this would require some
cash so I don't know if that's against
the rules Greg uh it depends how much
cash how we I think you like this idea
though hold on just tell me how much
cash are we
talking uh in the million
probably so no you know Millions is wait
wait no Millions is in one to two
million or yes get started
proceed so do you know Factor
75 no I do not they're are like a meal
service that there are these like
pre-prepared meals that you buy they
sponsor a bunch of YouTube channels and
you basically say okay I'm vegan or I'm
keto and they deliver let's say seven
meals a week and you warm them up and

[09:02]
meals a week and you warm them up and
they're ready to go and they deliver
them to your door these are huge right
now this meal service but the problem is
they're the meals are like not the
highest quality they're about 10 bucks a
pop 11 bucks a pop my idea and something
else I would pay for is like an Uber
black of meal delivery where we're
talking $50 to to start and it's Chef
prepared meals Super G May and it's
essentially like what you get with a
private Chef without needing to have a
private Chef come to your house because
my buddy has a private chef and I go to
his house and she makes these amazing
meals and I'm always like oh I should
hire her but then I'm like I'm gonna
have someone come into my house and cook
in my kitchen and I'm playing fortnite
with my friends it's
weird but why would I do that and I
don't want to order a meal that's like
10 bucks their margins you know how much
does it cost them to make they're using
like the lowest quality ingredients
possible I'll pay 50 because it's what I

[10:00]
possible I'll pay 50 because it's what I
would pay for a nice meal out for a chef
prepared meal it's not made to order
like that's the thing about Factor 75
but you can tailor it to your dietary
restrictions gluten-free or what have
you so for me that would be another take
my money
situation I was uh I had a hot dog the
other day in C in Quebec and the hot dog
it was like I don't know 79 cents
Canadian which is like 40 I don't know
45 cents us and I'm like halfway through
it and and I'm like wait wait wait a
second if I'm paying 48 cents for this
they're paying 10 to 15 to 20 cents for
this I probably shouldn't be putting
this in my
body and I feel like that's kind of e
even these you know these meal planning
services like even if they say it's dope
for you and I just I don't buy it at 10

[11:00]
for you and I just I don't buy it at 10
yeah the same that's what I'm saying so
I would pay 50 even if it was the same
meal I'm a sucker I just don't want to
think you're getting like I don't want
to think I'm eating something that cost
them a buck to make yeah um I might as
well get a Hungry Man meal for that so
why not get a nice so it would be
highend and it would come at like you
know with Uber Eats it's like some guy
gives it to you in a paper bag here you
go this would be presented almost like
an Apple product you open it up and it
would be like beautifully presented it
would be this whole like culinary
experience at home because even during
Co I remember a lot of really nice
Michelin star restaurants started doing
Uber Eats because they were closed and
they were figuring out ways to do this
so it's not totally unprecedented to pay
this much for essentially a delivery
meal but you have to order from Uber
Eats this would replace those sort of
prepared meals that come and you put
them in the fridge and then warm them up
when you want but they're going to be
like 50 to 75 bucks a pop and it's going
to be like lobster and free range
chicken chicken and grass-fed beef and

[12:01]
chicken chicken and grass-fed beef and
and stuff like that and so you warm it
up yourself right you put it like in the
oven yeah or the microwave or microwave
but no you wouldn't want a microwave no
no and oh for this thing no no dude no
this would what what do you what are you
come on you're not a barbarian Brian
you're right I am I guess because I
thought of that I must
be so I mean I don't know if you need
one1 to2 million doll to start this to
start this idea
yeah maybe not I just usually it's more
than you think so I usually go up so
what whatever number first pops into my
head I usually double it um so that's
where I came up with that that number I
thought it cost like
500k so probably double that because of
all the stuff you know that doesn't come
to your to your
head I mean to test this idea isn't
going to take $1 to $2 million if you
want you could do it yourself I mean you
could do it in your house I invested in
the company
that went out of business that did that

[13:01]
that went out of business that did that
here in uh in Lisbon where I spend most
of my time they started a atome Uber
Eats basically home-cooked Uber Eats and
they partnered with different homecooked
chefs and they would make a meal for you
on demand at their house instead of at a
restaurant and they would ship it to you
so I have some experience in this world
and I know that the the challenge with
that business is the delivery on demand
element where you need need to make it
now someone sends an order you need to
be like at the ready ready to go and if
you're not a restaurant or a ghost
kitchen it doesn't make sense that's why
I like these prepared meals because you
can do them at a massive scale and just
ship them out all right I like it I
don't you know we have a we have a thing
on this pod do I sip this idea or do I
spit this idea I don't like it sip is I
like I I sip the test of it but I I
don't know at scale if I love this idea
like operating this in like 50 ities to
me seems like a mess but I do think that

[14:02]
me seems like a mess but I do think that
maybe this is just a business where it's
in one or two cities and it's not crazy
to do a few million bucks per city is it
no if you just New York San Francisco
Yeah Austin a couple of those Tech
cities where people will have have you
know more money than cents like me who
will just pay 50 bucks for a meal that
someone made that's you know you're
picturing them in a white like with
white gloves making this thing yeah
suckers the sucker Market really yeah um
that they'll pay for it because I'm at
the point where I like cooking but I'm a
little bit like I don't want to have to
cook every night and the the challenge
is Uber Eats is like a mixed bag I don't
really enjoy the whole experience of
like ordering waiting for it so these
meals sound like a great thing but again
10 bucks it's not as bad as the hot dog
but it's the same idea and there's no
don't look at me like that Brian I saw
you look down on me I'm not not Jud you
are judging I see I see you okay if it

[15:00]
are judging I see I see you okay if it
was like a dollar man come on but anyway
the idea is that you the reason that I
like it is that in most markets there's
an option for a higher tier whether it's
cars software gyms there's usually a
market for this higher end version of
that thing but I haven't seen it in this
in this
space yeah I also if I was doing this I
think the trend Around clean eating
I'm sure you're seeing a lot of that
like everything's clean people are just
using the word clean it's like clean is
the new healthy you know in the 80s and
90s people used to say oh that's healthy
now people say oh that's clean yeah um
so I think if you ride on that Trend
like clean meals I think that could be
really interesting and I also think
handwritten notes or just stories you
know people especially suckers suckers
love stories they do they can't get
enough of them but you're right I can

[16:00]
enough of them but you're right I can
imagine opening it and you get a little
note from the chef like I hope you enjoy
it doesn't have to be for every meal CU
you're setting these in bulk right like
a week or seven 10 20 30 meals at a time
so one note from the chef that says hey
uh I hope you enjoyed these meals we
made for you this week Greg you know
Chef Greg I think that would go a long
way for getting those suckers to share
on social media I have you ever seen
Lost in Translation the movie a great
movie Gray movie Incredible movie highly
recommend so that movie they're in the
Park Hyatt in
Tokyo so I was there
recently and I'm having
breakfast and as I'm sitting down for my
my first breakfast when my first
breakfast in
Japan uh the chef comes over and he puts
down a plate of uh mateline
cookies um these like French cookies

[17:00]
cookies um these like French cookies
that he talks about that his mom used to
make and now he makes them and he comes
from Paris and the whole story and I'm
like melting I'm quite literally
melting uh and and then I pick up one of
the cookies and of course it's like
perfectly hot temperature and he was
like that's the way my mom used to like
it that story like productizing that in
this there you go that you know huge
margin in in that yeah for sure man yeah
that company that I invested here was
called Mama food they did that and it
definitely helped add that element of
personal touch but it's just
logistically was difficult but yeah they
did that they would have in your like
when you ordered from instead of going
by restaurant you go by Chef so you go
for like Chef number one oh this lady
she's from Bangladesh and this is her
meal she made back in the day or her mom
made for her so it had that little bit
of story um element to it you have
another idea yeah yeah so the the other
idea I have if I don't know if you'll

[18:00]
idea I have if I don't know if you'll
like this one how many ideas do you have
you said come to with some half-baked
ideas two to three I think I I've I have
to check my notes I have my notes uh
written down I wrote a bunch down so the
other one I have is based on a lot of
trend data we're seeing we're seeing a
bunch of Trends in the ADHD space
especially when it comes to products so
more and more people are getting
diagnosed and self- diagnosing
themselves with ADHD and there's a lot
of products around it now like for
example some trends that we're seeing in
that space include ADHD timers ADHD
watches ADHD chairs ADHD coaches H ADHD
apps um and this is basically a booming
Market that people aren't really talking
about that much so for me the
opportunity isn't necessarily in these
individual SKS these individual products
it's in no one's creating a the brand
for ADHD so anyone that creates that

[19:02]
for ADHD so anyone that creates that
community that brand around
ADHD then you can the world is your
oyster when it comes to selling these
products you can sell your own you can
sell affiliate products you can be you
promote other people stuff but I haven't
seen that out there my wife recently got
diagnosed with
ADHD and it's it's it's interesting
because a lot of people who are like
influencers in this space are saying
saying you can use it as a superpower
actually it can be an advantage for you
and I feel like the first brand that
comes out and positions ADHD as that is
like we help you take this thing that
could be looked at as as a disadvantage
and it's actually something you can use
to your advantage we'll show you how and
we have a community of people that will
help you do it I here's how I would name
a product like that
so I get migraines and I used to get
embarrassed about getting migraines cuz
like I'd be doing something and then all
of a sudden like my vision would get

[20:00]
of a sudden like my vision would get
blurry and it really sucked um and I
would get this
migraine and then I went to see a
neurologist and he told me
that this is when I was young he he was
like you know he started off the
conversation by saying you know you know
who else had migraines and I was like no
who who he was like julus
Caesar and Julius Caesar did a lot of
big things granted I think he probably
killed a lot of people um because he was
like a general and stuff like that but I
mean he he was running Rome you know
like he he he he was able to live a
successful life whatever that meant uh
at that time I think that with
ADHD how do you find someone like
that um so okay so if I was creating a
migraine brand I would call it Caesars
or
Julius for ADHD who is someone like that
that that people look up to and then

[21:01]
that that people look up to and then
just call it that yeah that's a good
idea that's a good way to do it yeah
that's a good branding the person would
have to be you know someone that's not a
likeness that's copyrighted or trademark
so it' have to be back in the day like
that yeah exactly okay so I buy the
thesis but what it's not clear to me is
what the actual product is but it could
be that's the beauty of it you build the
audience the world is your oyster you
know you don't you can worry about the
product later it can be a suite of
products it can be start with an app and
then be fidget toys and then be a chair
like once you have the audience it the
product's the easiest thing to do I mean
even if you don't want to create your
own just promote other people's ADHD
apps like but the point is everyone's
trying to go they go right for the
product they're going okay I want to
make an ADHD chair they're forgetting
the most important part and the
opportunity in this space is to create
the brand so when you think of I need
help with ADHD I want to do something

[22:00]
help with ADHD I want to do something
about it I go to Julius and that's the
brand that's associated with this
growing huge market and you don't see
very often a huge growing Market without
a go-to brand and that's what we're
seeing quick ad break let me tell you
about a business I invested in it's
called boring marketing.com so a few
years ago I met this group of people
that were some of the best SEO experts
in the world they were behind getting
some of the biggest companies found on
Google and the secret sauce is they've
got a set of technology and AI that
could help you outrank your competition
so for my own businesses I wanted that I
didn't want to have to rely on Mark
Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on
ads to drive customers to my businesses
I wanted to rank high in Google that's
why I like SEO and that's why I use
boring marketing.com and that's why I
invested in it they're so confident in
their approach that they offer a 30-day
Sprint with 100% money back guarantee

[23:02]
Sprint with 100% money back guarantee
who does that nowadays so check it out
highly recommend boring marketing.com
who else like who do you look up to in
terms of other brands that have done
something similar that they're that
they're just amazing at building
audience in building brand well in
meditation like for example I don't know
if you know Dan Harris from
10% he built a huge meditation brand
where they were you know meditation was
seen as like a woo woo thing that you
did in your garden cross-legged and he
was a newscaster who had panic attacks
and he used um he wrote a book called
10% happier about his journey from being
a skeptic about meditation to uh someone
that practiced it every day and then he
created an App around that and they have
a whole community and a brand so he was
able to take that and turn that into a a
brand for a specific Niche within
meditation that is this like skeptical
uh group
so that's one that comes to mind has

[24:01]
so that's one that comes to mind has
built completely from scratch in a
growing space um that's one how about
you do you have any Greg that you can
think of the one that comes top of mind
is a friend of mine and friend in the
Pod her name is Natalie Ellis she
started it started off as like basically
a meme page called girl boss I think it
was called um and she was
sharing memes and quotes and stories
around female entrepreneurship women L
businesses uh and it grew to 6.4 or
something million followers on Instagram
big you know and once she had that she
was like okay what are the things that I
could sell templates uh a
membership uh you know events uh now she
has one of the top podcast one of the
top business podcasts so um she went
from a meme page to millionaire
basically quite quickly

[25:01]
basically quite quickly
and uh it started with the brand yeah
yeah I mean there's so I mean some
businesses start with a product and they
do well that way there's no right or
wrong way but for me there okay well
what's the right way I
guess I mean my take
is I mean I was joking a little bit but
my take is it's way easier
to sign up up with an Instagram account
than it is
to you know build a d Toc product and
figure out logistics and and
Manufacturing and all that sort of thing
so I think that if you're creating a
minimal viable product I always think
about it as like the minimal VI product
is the Social
account yeah for sure I'm I'm with you
100 per. especially because in this
particular
area the the crowded area is the product
area so if you were to create another

[26:00]
area so if you were to create another
ADHD chair you're one of like a hundred
of those but and you can get knocked off
really easily on Amazon if you're a
brand then you don't need to worry about
knockoffs because you'll say we have the
best ADHD chair or we have the best ADHD
planner and next thing you know people
are buying it I like it you want to give
us one last Brian idea I need to uh
check my notes on that oh yeah this is
another good I think you might sip this
one as the kids say Greg
so this is another back to
B2B a Content repurposing service so
this is another scratch my own itch
thing so if you work in uh content
marketing SEO for bigger Brands they
always even smaller Brands they have
content that's just sitting around
collecting dust that was published once
it's an email newsletter it's a video it
was a webinar it's an article
it's a a tweet and they never repurpose

[27:02]
it's a a tweet and they never repurpose
that content and for me that's the
greatest opportunity with content
marketing right now is repurposing
rather than creating original stuff from
scratch because it's cheaper and it has
a proven track record already so in my
case for example with exploring topics
we have all this blog content and we're
starting to repurpose it into videos on
the on a YouTube channel that we started
so it's so much easier to create those
videos because we already have the
building blocks of the article we don't
have to think and say oh what should we
make a video about oh what should it you
know what should we start with we go
okay here are the biggest marketing
Trends we have a blog post about
marketing trends that was updated last
week let's turn that into a video or the
reverse let's take the video and turn it
into a a bunch of shorts and an article
and an email newsletter and a webinar or
whatever so for me that's another take
my money if someone emailed me and said
hey you have all this content let's get
some more value out of it yeah so Mega
you know me too well oh I think uh yeah

[28:01]
you know me too well oh I think uh yeah
what I'm seeing is there's a bunch of AI
tools that are promising that it's like
give us your content and we'll spit out
other formats of it and I just don't
think that the AI tools are probably
100% there yet um so I do think that oh
so that's one end of the spectrum on the
other end of the spectrum is humans
creating new content which is like well
I don't want new content I've got all
this great stuff so I agree I think that
there's there's some something in
between that is a big opportunity and I
think the way to sell it is you do a
cold reach out and you're like hey you
wrote this post in 2005 I've turned it
into this uh do you like it yes you know
and if and then you have to prove
yourself on the cold DM basically yeah
but I think like you said it's kind of
an easy self for it's again it's kind of
like the updating idea in the
there's a small Market that will 100%

[29:00]
there's a small Market that will 100%
get it and most people won't and that's
fine because the market that get it that
will get it is huge and they have money
and they're willing and you're basically
saying you know you're selling a dollar
for a dime basically you're saying you
have all this content you give me this
money as a service and then we'll just
get you more Roi from that content you
felt obviously you felt good enough to
create it once so why not just
distribute it eight times in eight
different formats and we'll do that for
you so for me it's an easy sell easy
everything the hard part is of delivery
like you s like you said Greg where it's
not something AI can do because it does
require some Ingenuity in terms of
what's the best way to turn this video
into a blog post to turn this um you
know blog post into a video however
whichever direction you're going in
because what a lot of people do is
they'll say oh I want to get more out of
my video so I'll get a transcript of the
video and I'll publish as a blog post
they never do well because you need
someone to turn turn that into you can
take that content turn into a blog post

[30:00]
take that content turn into a blog post
but you need to filter it through the
lens of like writing it as if it was a
blog post for the first time but even
that is so much faster than writing from
scratch so for me that that's the IDE
another idea that I would happily be
shelling out money for how how big is
this idea how big could this
get um I would say it Max like if you
created a huge agency out of it like
eight figures like 10 million cool all
right all right there you have it those
are my ideas those are really good ideas
oh thanks man I spent some time on it I
really want I wanted to come prepare I
appreciate it it shows thank you for
inviting us into your
home uh on your couch it's it's it's
