people I just sent you a link Alex Mason
I just sent you a
link come up on just send me a DM on
Instagram with your startup idea again
could be super Half Baked

[06:03]
Jason I'm bringing you I just sent you
the
link and it's crazy because people have
been uh there's been people have taken
these live stream ideas and are like
building businesses like straight up
businesses like the someone is going to
listen to this live stream today and
take one of these ideas um and and and
maybe if they don't take the exact IDE
it'll Inspire them to uh to do something
and and you know maybe take that idea
but build it for a new Niche Cody will
probably be coming on later Cody
Schneider will be probably coming
on all right boom we got our first
guest uh first guest of the day
Mason are you ready to come on stage I

[07:00]
Mason are you ready to come on stage I
see you there boom Oh I'm ready oh yeah
beer me are you kidding me yeah it's
it's the wave okay so should I just
should I kind of explain what it is get
into it what's on your mind okay so me
and my buddy we're creating a hoodie
right now we have 200 hoodies our first
bull quarters on the way but it's
essentially a hoodie it says Beery
period embroidered on the chest and then
right here has a cup holder that
convenient conveniently places your beer
so then if you're at a party if you're
at a bar there's two things one is you
can put it there so then you can keep
your hands free play games talk with
people and it doesn't get moved or or
bumped with but also there's kind of a
safety aspect of it as well for
specifically women they can keep the
drink on their chest so there's no risk
of it getting uh spiked or anything
because it's right there with you um me
and my co-founders so far we've gotten
60 pre-orders we've gotten funding from
our school for the business

[08:00]
our school for the business
um and we're really just looking out
ways to kind of make it a reality now uh
do you have a website uh no we're
actually this week and he's driving up
to SF I'm here for an internship and
we're going to build it today uh but we
have an Instagram shop. beerme um it's
got some funny little Instagram reels
we're kind of trying to take
the we're kind of taking inspiration
from liquid death for an unserious just
funny marketing that tries to get people
to laugh um because that's kind of what
the product is in itself
um but yeah building the building the
website this weekend okay wait I'm gonna
sh I'm G to share my screen real quick
just give people a little visual of
shop. beer me so walk me through what
should I what should I press over here
uh press the one with the old
[Music]
guy still [ __ ] got
it that was so good I think we got to
watch that again

[09:00]
watch that again
[Music]
still [ __ ] got
it who is that by the way that's uh my
co-founder's grandpa okay I just I I
just wanted to make sure that no
grandpas were hurt no Grandpa's were
hurt I love it so good okay
so um you want feedback on your idea
yeah absolutely okay so I don't know if
you know how this works here basically
we do these live streams
and uh people either sip the idea which
means they like it or they spit the idea
which means yeah like it so much so on
YouTube in the comment section I just
want to hear from you do you guys sip or
spit this idea just write in the
comments on YouTube sip or spit this
idea before I give my feedback on is
this a viable business do I think this
you know could go somewhere shouldn't
Mason you know be putting his his his
brain somewhere else or do we think this

[10:00]
brain somewhere else or do we think this
is a viable
business and while while people comment
on YouTube either SI sip or spit like
what's your goal with this yeah it's a
good question I think the main goal um
is we really want to sell it we think
this could be something you could sell
to like a bar stool Sports um something
like that really scale it so our our
main strategy that we're we're taking is
we're I go to the University of Oregon
in Eugene so the the hoodie that the the
grand Pol was wearing was in our ducks
colorway we really just want to focus on
college students um as well as like dads
so release the campus collection
colorways for every school if we could
get a hoodie um in every major school
that's kind of where we're going um and
yeah I think the long-term plan is to
try to sell it um to to a more
established company for a payout and
then kind of take that to go into
something that's a little bit more long
term so get a quad basically is your
goal you want you want you know Dave por
to be knocking on your door and handing

[11:01]
to be knocking on your door and handing
you a $10 million check for something
like this pretty much so when I was
earlier in my career 18 19 20 21 22 it
was all about how do I build something
and sell something
Acquired and what I realized is there's
typically only seven companies and three
people at those companies
that matter in order for you to sell the
company so what are they so you know the
three people are generally CEO Chief
product officer sometimes it's like a
head of product or product manager so
your job Mason if you do this idea or
not is to get to know that I call it the
law of 21 seven time three who are the
seven companies make a list this weekend
you'll make a list bar stool ex you know
all those people times three people CEO
Chief product officer maybe product
manager and your job is to get to know
these 21 people it's to like fly out get

[12:01]
these 21 people it's to like fly out get
to know them be in their inbox become
their friends so that when you're ready
to sell your
business you just send them a text and
it's like Dave you know I've been doing
this for three years you know we've done
some affiliate deals together how do we
uh how do we actually sell this thing so
that's just that's for anyone listening
if you if you're building something to
sell do that law of 21 but I think I I
got to be real with you this is a spit
idea for me okay and and it's a spit
because there it it you know it's a
physical
product and I think there's just so much
opportunity right now in digital
products right now that you know you're
making your life harder I think
that it's one of those ideas that could
go
viral but I don't know like you know you
you know what is the life cycle of that
product and how and how do you sell
multiple products you're going to need

[13:00]
multiple products you're going to need
multiple SKS to make this like a
multi-million dollar a year
business um so if I were you I would you
know I wouldn't be doing this I'm
thinking more of like how do I create a
cash flow business and maybe do this on
the side like maybe this is like kind of
a side thing that you can do that is
kind of like a slow burner that you know
eventually you sell but I think that if
I'm you you know I'm thinking about how
am I creating cash flowing internet
startups you're young you're probably
good with a video camera I'm creating
video you know it seems like you are and
like you get how to make things go viral
but it's you know are you you know
should you be spending your time on
something else okay I appreciate that
can I kind of give you some some
perspective uh yeah because I know I
know you're you're all about the the AI
and the digital um the digital space so
my kind of thought process as well is
yes as the world moves more and more
digital there's going to be a lot more
products digitalized and a lot of

[14:00]
products digitalized and a lot of
experiences digitalized but at the end
of the day us as humans are still in
this physical world and so I feel like a
lot of physical products and a lot of
physical experiences are going to be
kind of overlooked and then that there's
going to be a period of time where
people kind of need something to bring
them back you know take off the Apple
Vision Pro and put on the beer me hoodie
and go drink some beer with their
friends um so that's kind of like
because I I totally agree with you it's
going digital and then as far as the
repeat purchases that's something we've
been thinking about a lot
um and I agree with you it's probably
going to have to be multiple products
like a trucker hat or something like
that but that's also where we want to
you know we want someone to buy it for
themselves with like their school
colorway but then also oh I want to buy
one for my dad for Father's Day um I
want to buy one for my grandpa because
gramp still got it um and that can kind
of be the way to try to get repeat uh
purchases from One
customer so I I want to be clear so I
spit the idea in its current form yeah

[15:01]
spit the idea in its current form yeah
but I sip the
idea if it's multiple products multiple
SKS maybe and maybe some you know IRL
Community event stuff right like in
order to access you know this party you
need the beer beer me hoodie right and I
think that you're right like the TR what
are the trends the trends are people
want more IRL experiences they want more
Community I also like how you're doing I
called an anti-trend so the trend right
now is getting sober but the fact that
you're just like no no this is called
beer me it's like the complete opposite
yeah I feel like every trend has an
equal anti-trend so writing that
anti-trend I think is really big I just
think that what gets me from spit to to
sitp what gets me from not liking this
idea to liking this idea is having a
multiple product approach holding
company approach um and doing things
that are a bit less uh harder on the

[16:00]
that are a bit less uh harder on the
logistics side merchandising side
marketing side and doing things that are
just yeah a bit easier and cash flowing
so that's my that's my feedback to you
Mason okay give it up give it up for uh
for Mason appreciate and Gramps yeah
then uh I love I love a Guinness so I'm
a little jealous of you right now so
enjoy that well you'll have to get
something what's in your
fridge actually nothing right now I'm
still recovering from last night so uh
going to go get bottom list M mosta soon
so as expected Mason you know as
expected all right later dude all right
thank you Mason we are going to bring on
our next person uh for those of you are
new are coming on here if you want to
get on stage you're gonna have to DM me
on Instagram with your pitch and the
best pitches I will bring up you can
bring on a startup idea or you can just
tell me what business you're you're
you're working on and I'll give you some
feedback all right next we're going to
bring up S

[17:00]
bring up S
how's it going you are on
mute hold on Greg can You See Me Now
Greg oh yeah absolutely you made my
weekend already it's uh I'm happy to to
be live where are you calling in from
I'm in nji Tennessee oh beautiful all
right have you been to nji before I
haven't but I've been to Knoxville
before Oh okay it's uh three hours away
exactly what uh what idea do you have to
share with
1558 of our closest friends in total
okay so uh the idea is called rant on me
like r a n t o n m e more like um it's
more like a listening service or it's
what I'm envisioning is like a platform
for you know to support people who wants
to like freely Express their thoughts
and emotion you know basically we
connect assuming I want to rant is more

[18:02]
connect assuming I want to rant is more
like rage room do you know rage room no
I'm going to pull it up actually right
now so people could see so it's called
rage room rage room yeah rage room is
where you just want to like you just reg
rooms are it's one of those new ideas
that came during uh covid you know
people just want to Splash things they
just want to smash things you know so we
are we have specialized rooms where
people we go in and uh you know they
will just smash
things Americans are using room amazing
feeling of release ever but is actually
doing it a healthy way to get rid of
anger for 50 bucks the owner of
Houston's Tantrums will give folks 15
minutes to release their inner demons
surprisingly the biggest users teachers
and stay-at-home moms like Joy bone
who's a

[19:00]
who's a
regular so more like rage room but it's
going to be uh online you know assuming
you want to you are very angry you don't
you are very upset with someone you can
you can like uh sign up for our service
I'll just listen to you you just rage
you you just rant on me and I'll just
list in I might not say anything some
people just want people that will just
rant they just want to rant you know um
it's uh it's not like we are not going
to be like uh
therapists uh we are non- therap we
offer non- therapeutic uh support you
know you can just go on our website and
you know uh book a time and somebody you
just start ranting on on someone that is
just the idea I've not started just
thinking about it cool so basically
here's the idea
PE people especially Americans are

[20:01]
PE people especially Americans are
angry and they're it's been validated
by uh the fact that these rage rooms are
popping up and I think also road rage
has gotten worse and worse over the last
few years yes so your idea is okay this
thing is being validated already uh in
the physical world how can I build
something in the digital world where
someone basically is you you envisioning
like a phone call like hey you know Sam
let me tell you about how sad I am that
my girlfriend left me or whatever yes
exactly okay and I just listen and not
say anything well not saying
anything um I could it depends on what
you want some people just want some they
just want to talk and you just want
someone to listen to them why some they
just want you to to talk and you know
just encourage them but I don't know how

[21:02]
just encourage them but I don't know how
to like expand the idea and how would
you charge for
it so uh the pricing model I'm Enis
envisioning is you pay EG $50 I won't be
the only listener like I'll just so on
the on what I'm envisioning is on the
website there will be or if you want to
be
a you can you can sign up and we just
match a listener and a
runer
so I I actually surprisingly love this
idea like I surprisingly sip this idea I
think that there would need to be some
interaction between the listener and the
angry person yes because if it's just
silence I here's what I think I'd call
it I'd call it you're totally right.com

[22:00]
it I'd call it you're totally right.com
you are totally right.com okay I'll pin
it and I'll get it it's like you call
them and it's like oh my God you're not
going to believe you know not going to
believe what my wife did yesterday and
I'm so upset and I can't believe she did
that and then on the other end you're
here you're totally right you know I
there's so many examples of you know
tell me more about how how your wife
that you know is
is is is annoying you know uh we have a
rule here by the way we have a rule here
that we don't take the domains of the
people when we give domain ideas we
don't take we don't we don't take those
domains yesterday we gave like two or
three really great domain ideas and it
was like up by someone else in in in one
sec oh so so this is Sam's idea this is
Sam's idea um thank you yeah the house
rules Sam gets 24 hours to purchase but
yeah the idea here is I mean obviously

[23:02]
yeah the idea here is I mean obviously
you start with human beings on on the
end and then you can eventually use
agents AI agents to uh answer answer
these people um I think that you know
this is kind of similar to in some ways
beer me the the previous person because
you know beer me is one of those things
like you know could go viral on Tik Tok
um and I could see this with the right
domain the right positioning is going to
go viral
and I think that you know you're trying
to make the world a better place right
Sam you're trying to you're trying to
let you're trying to let the raage out
in a more sustainable way exactly
exactly so I think this is a this is a
big idea this is a sip for me in the
comments if you're on YouTube is this a
sip do you like this idea or is this a
spit do you not like this idea I think
this is really smart I also like ideas
that start with human beings a as
fulfillment and then you can move to AI
assisted human beings okay number two

[24:02]
assisted human beings okay number two
and then number three eventually agents
so you got number one human number two
AI assisted humans number three agent so
um I think this is a great idea to get
you know could go viral the name needs
to be right you're getting a lot of sips
in the comments on YouTube so uh for
some reasons I'm not I cannot see those
sips in the comment I can't see uh are
you on YouTube yes I'm on YouTube I
don't know I'm seeing it I'm seeing sip
sip sip MJ Allen Christopher Strang Cass
oh J mix uh you're getting you're
getting nothing but sips so oh okay so
congrats and uh Brian
lry so what if we do this if uh I'm I'm
I'm a big follower of yours just so you
know what if Greg is going to be our
first customer or client
well if you know anything about me I'm a

[25:01]
well if you know anything about me I'm a
very calm chill human being you know oh
sure a lot of people listen to my
podcast the startup ideas podcast on 1.5
sometimes
2x people have told me hey speak faster
speak faster speak with more energy
speak with more energy I'm just this is
who I am you know I'm literally in the
mountains in the middle of C you know
Northern Quebec here there's not anyone
from from 95 acres in this you know in
this area so I'm I'm happy I'm chill um
and so I'm not the the the the person
but I do think that I do I do know a few
people who are kind of or are those
angry people who who who do get
frustrated really quickly and I'll be
the first person to take that and I
think what you what you can do and make
to make it viral is you can gift an
angry session to
someone oh okay right it's like oh you
need a you you know you know
people say like you need a chill

[26:01]
people say like you need a chill
pill like what's your version of a chill
pill like that's what this should be the
name should be like oh I need to take a
XYZ and that's your prompt for this
weekend that's what you need to come up
with um you come up with like a verb for
this okay okay I'll do that I I'll work
on that I appreciate you I just pinned
you're totally right.com thank you so
much amazing all right Sam appreciate
you coming up yeah you're
wa all right I'm going to bring up uh a
next guy and I could see people uh like
backstage and I don't know if they know
I could see them but I think this guy
was just like smoking cigarettes just
backstage he was and I I think
that we're just gonna we're gonna bring
up the guy who's in his room smoking
cigarettes I don't know if it'll be good
I don't know if it'll be a sip or a spit
but we're gonna we're going to give him
a shot
um and he's here Jason the founder of

[27:02]
um and he's here Jason the founder of
really
good you're on
mute you just G have to unmute
yourself yeah I didn't realize you could
see but I was smoking a cigarette before
well I'm glad you were just smoking a
cigarette not doing anything weird so
you know yeah it's better that way I
guess exactly so what's on your mind
today thanks for coming up um so I've
been building this company for about
four months now it's called really
good and it comes from I was uh I was in
tech for like 10 years working at early
stage startups and I got tired of it um
working for other people primarily um
and so I left didn't have a plan started
and the first way to get out of it was
service providing because I was I'd
already done that so it was the easiest
way to start um you know being My Own
Boss
and over the course of about a year and

[28:01]
and over the course of about a year and
a half I started noticing other people
that wanted to do the same thing so I
started helping them do that and then I
kind of started serving my thought at
first was actually to build some sort of
you know just like you have a talent
agency for musicians or um artists to do
that same thing for professionals and
just to help them build themselves up uh
for a lot of reasons that wasn't the
best strategy to go about with because I
I think taking the percentage from uh
normal people just it was weird to
them and so I it ended up shifting into
this where I realized basically okay if
I want to help them I have to help the
companies that are looking for service
providers this is like purely
Professional Services not you know don't
think like plumbers or and don't think
SAS software um but the idea is to help
is basically that so if you're going to
help these people you really have to
help companies find the right person for
them and thought is that the way to do
that is data is this

[29:01]
that is data is this
live it's live yeah I mean when I say
it's live there's a landing page where
you can sign up and make a request that
goes to email like it's all what's it
very early I use the product right now
let's put it like that no one uses the
product except for me what's what's a
URL uh really good.
proo we're gon I'll share my screen so
people can see it
cool so yeah so basically what we do is
we collect data on different service
providers agencies can I say something I
was
like when you were pitching it I did not
think it was going to look this nice I
don't know if other people in the
comments feel the same way apprciate
that but I'm like now I'm I I went from
really unimpressed to impress really
quickly and I'm like wow this is
actually looks really cool what was okay
so I'm curious what made you go from
unimpress what was the unimpressed in

[30:00]
unimpress what was the unimpressed in
the beginning I felt like you were
saying a lot of words but not
enough I felt like it was a lot of words
we had someone came on
yesterday and he was like we're like
what's your idea he goes it's med school
in a weekend we teach you med school in
a weekend and that was like
it yeah I could see why that's more
powerful yeah um what's your version of
that my version of that
is I mean that's a good question
getting you the best service prider
provider on the planet for your needs
using
data I think
that this is going to work this becomes
a sip if you don't use the word if you
unpack what service provider is yeah we
put that little thing on top we bu for
that exact reason we find the best
agency or freelancer but we don't want
to do just agencies and we don't want to
do just Freelancers because
ultimately the right solution for people
might be for some sometimes it's an
agency and sometimes it's a freelancer

[31:00]
agency and sometimes it's a freelancer
it really depends on your needs it
depends on your budget it depends on
what you're looking for you know
sometimes it might be best to work with
by the way actually we have one of your
um one of your holding company uh like I
think you have a brand one that just
pivoted the name design
scientist yeah so yes oh so it was brand
something right it was brand kitchen or
something that's one of ours too so
something one of them design one I I
don't remember which signed up also um I
don't know how that happened but so we
have about a thousand service providers
that have signed up and the way it works
is that we get 15% of the first six
months which we thought was like a good
mix of being fair while still making
money off of uh
recommendations and unlike a Fiverr or
an upwork where you're one you have to
do a lot of work two finding people is
really hard and three you're stuck with
the talent that they have you know

[32:00]
the talent that they have you know
Fiverr Talent isn't that great it's not
the best um upwork Talent there might
there's amazing people by the way in all
these places but it's really hard to
find them talk talk to me more about the
data like what is it you know when I
read this I'm like okay Power by data
but what does that act yeah if you
scroll down you can actually see the
three parameters we look at so it's
quality fit and trust trust to be honest
we don't do a really good job of yet we
started that was the first starting
point was basically to say hey Greg you
know Bob Bob worked with this branding
agency and liked them you should
probably check them out obviously if you
make a branding request um Quality is
reviews feedback retained clients so we
look at that as also a strong sign of
someone who has kept a client for a long
time
and
um the last is trust is fit fit is the
one we're best at right now which is
basically have they worked in your
industry with companies similar to you
with your budget your specific needs
location etc

[33:02]
location etc
etc cool so we're going to do like a
live landing page roast over here and I
think I think this is first of all I
love this idea around you're just
matchmaking all you have to do
is uh what do you have to do you have to
figure
out uh high quality recommendations
around agencies we'll start with oh
agencies and Freelancers and then you
just have to I mean it's going to be
easy to to to sign up some of these
folks why because everyone's looking for
more business like hey if I can get you
for 20% more business would you sign up
like
probably
so and then you need to find growth
channels how do you how do you so that's
the hardest part right now I mean that's
actually my background so that's what
I'm good at I haven't I've been actually
working too much on the product because
I'm doing it right now primarily by

[34:01]
I'm doing it right now primarily by
myself and so building building a data
product is just really hard even with
the AI tools they have today you know
you can build your own like I can build
my own scrapers today something I
couldn't have done two years ago and I
can start indexing the web by myself but
it's not I'm not good at it right and
so and that's actually really important
because if you think about how we make
money there's requests number of
requests but more important than that
honestly is the number of those
recommendations that we make that
actually get taken and yes there's a way
you know there you're going to convert a
percentage even by just making you know
solid
recommendations but when you have good
signals that make them see oh wow this
is perfect for me you're going to
convert more and you're GNA get
customers to come back which I think is
really important you're going to get
them to recommend it because they had a
good experience so like if you think
about how the buiness business works
it's like requests then percentage of

[35:00]
it's like requests then percentage of
conversion to actually starting but
almost more important than that
percentage is the percentage later of
clients that are happy with who they
work with how many lead magnets have you
built so this is only up this site is up
for less than a month um zero I've been
doing it for four months so it's so not
none um right now we get all of our
leads from friends of mine who work in
different companies and from communities
and from a couple of Partnerships
primarily with like VCS so like you know
if VC platform teams like the value
creation teams they have like a bunch of
portfolio companies that come to them
for certain requests for like provider
recommendations we just do that for them
since we know more than they do here's
how I grow this thing and I I do really
I think this is a huge idea my friend
Julian Shapiro also has a a similar
product have you seen it I think it's
called pineapple
pineapple list yeah yeah I wanted to get

[36:01]
pineapple list yeah yeah I wanted to get
the so the way I look at companies like
that we've started to onboard Talent
networks and agency networks as well and
we just drive growth for
them like we would never so basically if
we would work with pineapple is the way
would work is any agency that hasn't
signed up with them we would basically
use them to Source
Supply and if we we would never be able
to poach we would have we have a
contract that doesn't let lets us makes
it impossible for us to poach companies
so if we don't have a relationship with
that agency already any agency who's in
their Network we would it would always
be theirs and if ever we drove a lead to
them they would get paid for it so you
can see both screens right next to each
other yeah so I want people on the on
the YouTube chat to tell me which one
which which value proposition is more
clear on the left or the
right and I can't see what you're saying
but while people are are putting that
left or right I think that when I look
at something like this it's just so

[37:01]
at something like this it's just so
clear what they do pineapple tells you
who the best agencies are no one has the
data we do we've interviewed thousands
of Founders to learn which agency to
rely on we match you with the best in
growth design and
content and then they have a great quote
obviously from Ryan Hoover who's super
credible oh there's me on
it that's
funny um
so I think that
there's a there's room for multiple
pineapple lists and there's there's
there's a whole there's a hundred
matching
startups oh Cody Cody's coming in we
hold on Cody Schneider I'm gonna I'm
gonna bring you on give me one
second boom all right we're gonna bring
Cody on it's gonna get fun so
um I just think

[38:01]
um I just think
that the opportunity is niching
pineapple list even more down it's like
we're the best matching for SAS
businesses like you were kind of afraid
about agencies and Freelancers those
words you're like well we're not really
you know you know we're not just
agencies we're also agencies and
Freelancers it's okay to start with
agencies and
then move from there right your goal is
how do I get a million AR to start
you know and then from there you can you
can adjust so I would start thinking
about how do I create pineapple list for
SAS businesses you know crypto companies
AI companies um e-commerce all that
stuff and create different landing pages
for those particular you have a lot of
right now these days there are probably
there's probably a talent Network for
every Niche so there there's three for
e-commerce there's two for healthcare
there's it's endless you know if you
think about website building you know

[39:00]
think about website building you know
webflow has a Marketplace framer has a
Marketplace Wix has a Marketplace they
all have this um for us I think it's
actually it's less about the meth well
they have it but you have to trust Wix
and you have to trust you know yeah but
I think for us I think it's more about
the growth channels than it is about the
product marketing um I mean obviously
the product marketing has to improve
it's like a month in but it's really
about where you get the recommendation
from and who ends up getting recommended
that gives it the trust like we get
plenty of requests the problem isn't
getting the request it's converting it
um why is that I don't know so you're
you're you're getting tons of requests
you're getting tons of not tons not tons
but you know it's at the point it's it's
like we're we're solid in that and
there's a lot of ways to continue
honestly this month has been slow
because it's starting to be summer and I
think businesses are starting to slow
down a little bit but um that's what I'm
feeling but
uh sourcing request isn't as much as a

[40:01]
uh sourcing request isn't as much as a
challenge Cody what's good
2412 of our closest friends no [ __ ] live
right now live dude what in the actual
hell okay help sweet I got I have like
30 minutes I gotta leave but by the way
if you're on Twitter get off Twitter and
go on to YouTube because that's where
the comments are so it's like I don't
think there's are there comments on
Twitter I don't think so on live oh
you're streaming Twitter right now okay
dude I'm I'm I'm catching up here we go
yeah yeah slowing my RO if you're on
Twitter get off Twitter go to
youtube.com Greg Eisenberg you'll see
the live stream and that way you can
comment so like if I don't know I'll
just continue if that's cool so like
what we've been starting to do is
basically trying to figure out I mean
the biggest problem with the business is
honestly cash flow because we our cash
flow is delayed basically if you think
about it like it takes
so much time to complete a request then

[41:01]
so much time to complete a request then
they meet the company then they actually
it takes time for them to start working
with them to negotiate with them and
close and start and then by the time
that company's getting paid we still
have net 30 afterwards so we're getting
it we're getting paid we have to wait
like we only started getting paid last
month for a request made like the first
request we had made which was in
February so it like takes a while and so
I don't know if you know the company
vendor VR
um but they do some they do this for SAS
kind of so one of our thoughts was to
start
basically uh what they do differently is
they charge b a b like b n b ndr v like
vendor just with no o um and what they
do what they said is basically we're not
going to become Affiliates which is kind
of what we are for agencies or Talent
networks that's what we serve as they
Ser they basically say to companies
we're just going to save you money we're

[42:00]
we're just going to save you money we're
going to do the negotiations on contract
and pricing for you with SAS companies
because we have tons of data and you
don't want to do the work anyway so one
of our thoughts is to start offering
take a rake off of the money that they
save you is that their business
model um I don't know how they charge
anymore they used to charge like a SAS
fee of like 10K a month by the way like
a lot totally because they they can save
you right if you're going to Enterprise
they can save you on stripe alone they
can save you enough
Toody you know when you go on a website
and you're like wow this company has
raised Venture Capital Yep this is the
vibe I'm getting from this so what's
actually cool about them is they started
as a business and then they were already
profitable and went into y combinator
then and then it just blew up 150
million series B Greg yeah I know it
just it oozes
a16z th% they all just use the same

[43:00]
agency what's your company it's really
good I think I saw it on the stream but
yeah cool great high level what is it so
we connect we match companies to the
best service providers for that
forign accounting to what's producing
80% of your Revenue right
now those what type of deal yeah um it's
so varied pick a job title who's the
who's the who's the one like I love toy
but we started off with our partners
being
BCS and they have their portfolio
companies have random requests yeah one
time it'll be recruiting and another and
we're not going to be able to work with
VCS for example if we only focus on one
area is the logistic of that the
challenge scaling that because it's too
variable um no it's actually not so hard
I know it sounds ridiculous like every
time we do a new domain it's a little
bit hard that first time but then it's
already set for the next time so like

[44:00]
already set for the next time so like
for example we had one company come in
that was an e-commerce company that
needed SEO help then another eCommerce
company needed SEO help and we had
already done that work for them and it
was really yeah yeah yeah but I'm saying
like you know there's enough Ecom
companies where you could go make this a
ton million ER our business right in
like 12 months so I guess it's like what
is the inbound that you're getting like
from I gu I'm coming in late so the grow
side I'm I'm I I I I didn't get the
context before so I'm I'm going blind so
I
apologize yeah so the hard part for me
about about like going Niche with it is
one that it's it's you're going like
right now we're kind of going into a
blue ocean without being Niche and with
all of the niches there are already
there's no shortage of talent networks
our concept is to sort of be on top of
those as an aggregator like I don't want
to be the expert in figuring out the
best supply for each of these areas I
want to partner with pineapple list I
want to partner with the talent networks
in e-commerce and I want to onboard
their Supply and service a growth
channel for them get that totally I I
guess where where I'm at is like deal

[45:01]
guess where where I'm at is like deal
with fivr for example um they have a
normal affiliate deal we just adjusted
it a little bit so we get 20% of anyone
we recommend on Fiverr so if I if I
recommend someone on Fiverr I get 20%
off theoretically by the way I could go
to companies tomorrow and say just work
just use do your fivr through us and
we'll get your discount
yeah what you know what do you what
would you do if you were the CMO of of
this business I mean it sounds like VC's
already have this so I'd go find every
company that's written a check for
e-commerce as an example and I'd cold
email every VC and be like cool this is
how we like turn this company from zero
to you know whatever the revenues are
and they raised the check 12 months
later right and just like just send them
case studies and what you know whatever
that that product offering is um it's
great blue ocean right we can always do
everything but like if cash flow is the
challenge which is always the problem
with early stage uh like agency work
it's like building some type of it's a
it's way easier to communicate hey like

[46:00]
it's way easier to communicate hey like
we specialize in this and then what's
going to happen is then you're going to
get referrals on the backside right but
like trying to communicate we do
everything yeah is is is basically
saying like we do nothing right it's
very hard with with limited resources to
do that communication like from a
positioning standpoint so I always try
to okay we do this specific thing and
then there can always be upsells and you
know cross sells on the back side of
that or like referrals come in and we do
you know you just say yes to anything
that comes on the on the on the uh you
know the inbound side but I mean again
this just from my experience that's
that's the way that I see this you know
if you're trying to figure out the cash
flow mechanism of this like it's gonna
be way easier to be like cool any
company that's ra hard part about I'll
give you an example so like one of our
Partnerships that we're talking to is is
actually YouTube so I live in Israel in
Tel Aviv yeah and there's a YouTube
Israel like well YouTube in general
they'll pay companies they'll pay for
companies videos so that they can start
advertising on YouTube because create
like the hardest thing for them is to

[47:00]
like the hardest thing for them is to
get companies to create a good enough
video that can go on YouTube and work on
YouTube yep so they'll pay for that so
that companies will start spending more
on YouTube so we've actually been
talking to them about basically they
don't they have a spread sheet that they
to to like that they never
update and that's how they pick the
agencies for different companies like
they they don't even use that they just
kind of think okay maybe this guy maybe
that guy and yeah I mean list I with all
this it's like I mean it sounds like you
have a ton of options it's it's so like
I guess what where's the disconnect on
the cash flow side is what I'm trying to
figure out um yes so the disconnect on
cash flow is just that it comes late
because of the referrals it's just such
a late
process I need right now I don't not
worried about it but like I'd like to
make for money up front like I'd like to
charge someone right I want to make
money today not in three months in
general yeah I I totally I mean that's
why I'm saying like a product SI service
where it's like yo we zero to one like
e-commerce sites right and we do this in

[48:01]
e-commerce sites right and we do this in
a 90day Sprint and like you only focus
on Venture back companies and the cost
of that whatever we'll say it's 50 Grand
you get 25k upfront day one second half
of that happens after the Sprint ends
like that's how you're going to get cash
flows immediately when it's that product
high you're saying basically tell them
you tell them you buy credit with us for
working with any agency yeah like I mean
so I own I own a product I service like
business right it's like we build
newsletters for podcasts that's like the
thing you know the offering that we do
um and like so we grow like our promise
is like yo we grow list by 5,000 Subs a
month right like that's that's like our
our what we what we what we bring they
pay me up front for that like I just
have a money back guarantee right it's
like yo if we don't do this and like
it's not success we'll just we'll give
you the cash back at the end of that
period right at the end of the 30-day
period um but like I'm I'm you know I'm
getting that payment up front and then
just showing the case studies with this
and I can do that because it's like a
very specific thing I'm offering right
when you're doing agency work in my
experience where it's like you're

[49:01]
experience where it's like you're
billing On The Backs side of it that's
when it's like okay cool like we just
did 30 days of work my bill went out you
know on the first of that next month and
then I have like net 60 to get that cash
in like you know it's 90 days before I
see a check so in the in the early days
what I always try to do is like how
what's a product High service that I can
offer that will create a cash flow
engine so that I can then have that like
you know the the flexibility for that
when you know if I'm getting net 60
payments later on because again I can to
go like all these clients we could go
sell them any type of podcasting service
after that right but I we abstracted
away the most valuable thing and I don't
know what that is for you but again
using the e-commerce example maybe it's
like you know we do e-commerce SEO at
scale we we'll build like 10,000 you
know uh like programmatic SE landing
pages so it's worth noting we don't do
any of the work yeah yeah we know that
he's saying okay yeah just to make yeah
yeah you might not want to actually do
any of the work and maybe you find a
small shop that actually does the work
and then you split the revenue with them

[50:00]
and then you split the revenue with them
right so you you have an offering that
you sell some Sprint for some amount of
you know or some work for some amount of
some for some cost and maybe you don't
get 100% of the revenue you get 40% of
the revenue but what Cody is suggesting
is that you do that because that helps
your cash issue and then you're making
money on the back end eventually right
um and I want to say agencies start like
this too right like it's like it's like
you know we do Google ads oh can you do
Facebook ads yes oh can you do you know
and it's just like it keeps going deeper
and deeper with this but like having
that Flagship product offering is what
you get like that's that's way easier to
find a foothold within you know the
business Community I ask you a question
on that do you think that's something
where I that the main site has to do
that or like you could create really
good do Google ads you
know gooogle ads and focus on that and
have that focus on that and do 100% 100%
I mean I think Greg's like or like compy

[51:00]
I mean I think Greg's like or like compy
you he owns boring right which is like
this whole kind of I don't even know
what you call it it's a hold Co now but
it's all in the same brand it's like
boring SEO like boring ads like Bor like
you know different front doors right
think about different front doors like
boring marketing so we we built an ads
team an a an AI
assisted tool for ads and then we built
an AI assisted tool for SEO and then we
built agencies around it
but it was really one company that we
just changed the front doors to so if
you go to boring ads.com and you want to
sign up for an ad
agency great it kind of just goes into
the same slack as the boring marketing
one you know what I mean so it's it's
one big family I think for you you can
just think about different front doors
and uh I'm gonna have to we're gonna
have to bring someone else on Harve
you're GNA be next but I want to say one
thing for people building agencies
because you you brought up a really good
point which is seems like
VCS are you know a good channel for you

[52:01]
VCS are you know a good channel for you
and I'll share I I'll share one of our
growth channels that is working and how
we do it with and how we sell to VCS and
it's related to what you do Jason so we
have a business um which is a design and
copy
agency called um design scientist.com
and the majority of the the majority of
the clients actually come from VC so how
do we do it we cold email
VCS and we say hey if you get a few of
your portfolio companies together would
you be would you know would you be down
if we basically did a
roast slash give feedback to all their
different homepages and basically
dissect their funnel and they're all
like yeah it's great because then the
head of platform at these VC fund is
like giving value to their portfolio
CEOs so then we have them in a room we
do a work shop with them and then we try
to sell them afterwards now we have

[53:02]
to sell them afterwards now we have
their email we have
permission once we do that and we get
one of
them then we send everyone else in the
portfolio say hey we work with this
company it's a part of the andri and
Horwitz portfolio as an example and then
they're more likely to convert and then
your cold email strategy just you know
gets a lot more effective so I think
you're on to something by V you know
focusing on VC back
businesses and in general I don't like
building VC back businesses but I like
selling to
them thanks so much take care Jason ni
to meet you man good
luck that guy you know he's he's
passionate about not the energy it's
just the the fraction like again and
I've done the same thing right where you
try to do everything to everyone and
that's the worst thing you can [ __ ]
do when you're being an agency like you
want to do the absolute opposite of that
you want to say no more than you say yes
both to the clients that you pick and

[54:00]
both to the clients that you pick and
also to the things that you like the the
jobs you're saying yes to yeah I mean
that's what I was trying to explain to
him I was like what you're what You'
built is cool but it would be way cooler
if it was really good for e-commerce or
really good for SAS or really good for
you know insert Niche here and then his
response to me was well I don't really
have issues getting customers it's just
the cash conversion cycle isn't good I
yeah I mean that's the biology of the
business then though right like dissect
that so if you need cash now then you
set up the business so it functions so
it gets cash now like that's I don't
know again agency everybody wants to do
agency like it's an you know what's an
agency right is it like him or is it
like [ __ ] 10 people or is it a
hundred people like there's different
everybody measures that differently um
so I yeah
it people are like oh I started an
agency it's like you it's just you doing
20 grand a month Consulting like that's
not an
right like that's like you doing random
jobs or services so yeah uh before we

[55:01]
jobs or services so yeah uh before we
bring on Harvey who's been patiently
waiting thank you Harvey
um what are you drinking are you
drinking anything yeah I was I finished
it already I had a I got this this
Italian soda it was like a grapefruit
Italian soda from Trader Joe D Trader
Joe's is the cheapest groceries right
now I don't know how that happened it's
like the most like you know well-kept
secret I I'm paying less there than I am
at Safeway like what's going on
toally insane man I love it any I must
say I I said that if we got a thousand
people watching this thing and now we
have 3,200 that I would drink some M
juice again you better you better dude I
want I'll go get stuff for next time
we'll do Caesars how about that yeah
that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do a
Caesar I'm gonna go grab
uh I'm gonna go grab a Caesar I'm gonna
be true to my word let's bring on Harvey
to the stage I'm listening Harvey
welcome to the stage uh I'm just having
a Caesar Harvey how's it going oh looks
like you're muted my

[56:01]
man oh looks like you're muted sorry
Harvey okay good now perfect yeah okay
great okay so this is nothing to do with
agency um we've moved across
God okay okay
um okay clamada okay you're in the
Canada I'm I'm in UK I'm in London UK
oh okay about the business right so um
then the dementia manifesto.
comom so the website just went up uh
this week and what it is it's
targeting uh carers of people with
dementias so in the states There's 7
million in the UK there's 1 million 54
million worldwide okay and growing by
the day what's the website Harvey just
so we can drop popping in the chat the
dementia manifo.com cool awesome so what

[57:02]
dementia manifo.com cool awesome so what
I've done that is that I have uh created
two
reports one for the UK market and one
for the US market so people go on and if
it's the UK they go on I get their email
address and then they get the uh uh the
uh report and so what I'm trying to do
um and it's it shows basically that
government uh dementia hasn't been
funded properly it's still not funded by
the government if you compare it to
cancer or diabetes or whatever um that
there's and people it's the carers and
the families who are paying for it and
it's a scandal and no one's doing
anything about it so the idea so I'm I'm
using that to uh going to use that to
create interest and and to build up a
list so it's following your model Greg

[58:02]
list so it's following your model Greg
about creating an audience first and so
and then a and then also I've just also
created through your community of which
I'm a member to um school school uh uh
Community forums so when they download
the report I'm also asking them to go on
and to the uh School
again for the UK and the US and so then
through that as well as the email I'm
going to build up uh email list and then
I can build nurture relationship in
terms of both the politics but also more
importantly
strates resources and help for uh
basically carers and then the idea would
be um in terms of
monetizing eventually would be um three
or fourfold one is these people are

[59:01]
or fourfold one is these people are
already spending money every day on
products to help their loved ones deal
with dementia whether it you know
whether it's uh games or clocks or or
just all sorts of products that are
yesterday was just about to go there
hary I'm about to drop this in the chat
but there's like hundreds of thousands
of keywords for like dementia related
products like coloring books exact
all that stuff yesterday I was in London
I was at a a
dementia exhibitors conference so I'm
sure there is in the states so so
there's so one is to uh recommend and
get affiliate through that that's one
idea the second idea is that um so there
are various universities one of them
being in London University College
London that have produced different
resources and packs with people with not
late stage but early stage to try and um

[1:00:03]
late stage but early stage to try and um
stimulate activities and stuff like that
and my idea is to once I've got a list
and some credibility is to approach the
university the university to try and
license that product so um so and then
sell that product give them a one flat
fee or a percentage or however however
it would work and so that's and there'll
be other universities and other dementia
centers in the states that also offer or
do these type of things so that's
another area the other area is um two
other areas for uh monetizing would be
through the free school Community upsell
them into one where there's more
resources Q&A bring on speakers bring on
different conferences and so you can do
that and then the third the fourth thing
the final thing is once you've got the
list is no one no one is doing if you're

[1:01:03]
list is no one no one is doing if you're
in pain which these people are they're
in guilt they're in pain they're dealing
with very difficult complex uh problems
and here in the UK and also in the
states and you you need access to Psycho
grians and and people who specialize in
this and there's very few of these
people so the idea would be with those
you know the usual 5% at the top who
have money the idea would be to
introduce them to a panel of experts and
then they could I for you know on a
monthly basis they would pay on a group
call or even on a onetoone call they
could then and not giving medical advant
medical medications but I can give we or
I can facilitate a group of experts who
will um uh in terms of whether it's to
do with behaviors or what wandering or
sexual deviance or whatever it is
doesn't really matter whatever their

[1:02:00]
doesn't really matter whatever their
specific their individual specific
painful so there are four or five
different areas on the back end where
there may be the opportunity to uh
monetize this
business super interesting um so my
always go-to question is how do you make
money off of this in the next 24 hours
um because otherwise the business
doesn't have legs like it's like from
day one you figure out a monetization
strategy um it sounds like so this this
the I'm just looking at the website the
the so what you built right now is it
just like a downloadable PDF is that
what yeah just to start to you've got to
find a way to get their email I I could
go in and create a product or whatever
but but you've got to find a way to get
their find out the people who are in
pain build a relationships and then I I
don't today need that money I just as
context texting his background I um have
for 30 years 20 years 30 years I run

[1:03:01]
for 30 years 20 years 30 years I run
what you in the U in the UK we call them
care homes in the States they're called
memory centers so i' I run these and
have owned these centers for donkey for
30 years most of my working life yeah so
I I'm not a doctor but I'm a business
guy and so but I've been dealing with
people who you know and so that's kind
of the context so although I'm adopter
there I can credential eyesee myself
create Authority because I'm dealing
with these people and have done for
years yeah Greg what's your
thoughts um I'm I'm also by the way I
think that question around how do you
make money in 24 hours is it's not it's
it's such a good question and it's it's
really just a good prompt you know what
I mean and and I more asked that because
it's like you know whenever I'm building
anything I'm trying to figure out what's
the path to sustainability as fast as
possible I don't care about the money
right it's like that the the
organization has a longer uh life

[1:04:00]
organization has a longer uh life
expectancy um like you know you're just
on average going to do better if the
faster you can get cash flow coming in
for it um the I mean it sounds like with
the memory Center side you already have
some like credibility within this space
I mean I wonder if this is just like a
PR play where you go on every Health
podcast in the UK and the US and talk
about this I've I've okay that's yeah so
I have I've got a list of 3 or 400
podcasts and influencers and Charities
and all sorts of people in the UK and in
the state in in the states and I my plan
is to over the next um over the next
month get this report out and go on and
like you say as a PR play to get the
word out and build up and try and do
piggyback on their list because I no
list or anything but P piggyback on this
this and that's also the reason for for
doing the report it kind of credential

[1:05:02]
doing the report it kind of credential
eyeses there's a scandle going on yep so
I mean I I think it's probably PR is
going to be the the initial path to
build that list and then you inbound
them into the site um so there's a
database it's called Raonic I just
dropped it in the YouTube chat uh but
it's a podcast contact database I think
it's like two they just raised prices
like 249 a month I've just gone in and
SC you can go and scrape every email out
of there if you want um and uh that will
give you the T typically they find you
whoever uh the production manager is of
the podcast or the show and that is just
a way to like go and do this at scale
email every one of them that I've
published in the last 30 days um you can
actually pull this data from podcast
index it's a uh like for which shows are
actually active and which have like
posted them the mo the most uh episodes
but I think there's an angle there and
then um yeah man I like if you get a
little bit of traction I mean as you
know this you're going to be picked up
in in larger news associations there's

[1:06:01]
in in larger news associations there's
uh Greg what's that company that does
digital PR that's out of the UK I can't
think of the name of it um let me see if
I can find it but they they specialize
in basically like they Bank Bas
basically they make uh like posts for
your website that are all around data
and then they go and they pitch news
agencies that they know will like eat
this because it's a story right um so
like they would basically like write
this article for you with all this
research they like put it into this
digestible format for a journalist and
then they handle like uh like at scale
Outreach the journalists to get this
story to show up and then what happens
is like as soon as a Forbes PS picks it
up then everybody picks it up right and
so then it creates that flywheel what
the name of that yeah yeah I gotta find
them hold on give me one second and Cody
while while you're finding that can you
walk through a little bit okay so let's
say Harvey goes on 20
podcasts and he's got 15 hours of
content how does he repurpose that
content what does that look like because

[1:07:01]
content what does that look like because
I think he wants to build his own
audience th% so how does he do yes so
like what we see is the most effective
way to do this right now is basically go
you go on these shows and then uh get
the recordings do get the video
recordings and you basically take those
video recordings and you turn them into
Clips in the blog post if you have like
a newsletter you can do that as well I'm
like this is actually the company that
I'm building it's called swell Ai and
it's like content repurposing powered by
AI so you upload a video it makes Clips
blog posts like white papers whatever it
is that you're trying LinkedIn post Etc
um but that is then you basically take
that you schedule it out to social media
again company I'm building I'm totally
plugging this right now but we uh so
it's like it'll make clips and then it
you can schedule those out to all the
social channels that you're trying to do
distribution through so this is a way to
kind of build this like engine so it's
like cool I go on these podcasts I make
pillar content I then get the the
recordings from the p the shows that I
go on I plug that into like a you know
software tool like this you could also
do all that manually outside of uh you

[1:08:01]
do all that manually outside of uh you
know what we've built but then you take
that and then it's like okay I'm just
basically telling the same story over
and over again in bite-size formats and
in all the formats that are uh that of
like all the channels that I'm trying to
be present on which again is like for
you it's probably going to be social
like I would look at Instagram Tik Tok
YouTube shorts that's where you're GNA
and maybe even Twitter you can get some
traction there um I feel like I mean
anything that Facebook owns because they
traditionally have a uh uh an older
population that's on the platform that's
what your is probably going to be your
focus so I would probably all of my
investment would be in like Facebook and
Instagram uh Facebook is really pushing
uh for you page content right now which
is like what Instagram reels are it's
basically their version of that um and I
think that you could probably get in
front of that audience with this but uh
yeah and let me find that PR agency Greg
Take the Wheel
I miss that all that camot juice made me
need to go to the bathroom you

[1:09:00]
need to go to the bathroom you
know I just talking about uh do you
think that though that once the list has
been built up that people will
pay I it really depends on I think it's
like what are you selling right um in my
mind like the probably the angle here
because it sounds again like you don't
like the cash flow piece is less
important in the the beginning I if I
was in your shoes I'd probably like do
this report and then I would release a
book a year later or like have a book to
drop six months after this um and then
from that you could probably go and then
the long-term strategy you sell products
like like physical products like some
type of e-commerce play because again
I'm just looking at the keywords that
are that are uh like related to dementia
products and it's like bras for elderly
Elderly with de uh Dem dementia
anti-strip clothing dementia um what is
this uh door lock for dementia dementia
patients um yeah there's a lot of also
technology about tracking people going
wandering 100% I mean maybe it's a

[1:10:00]
wandering 100% I mean maybe it's a
wearable right and it's likea totally
then that's a subscription service
that's built on top of this totally
that's actually probably the better
business right is like but but what
about the idea though of the two other
IDE that I the Affiliates and all that I
understand but then what about the idea
about because they're in pain either the
getting of the licenses from the places
that are already doing the research in
in dementia and be also the panel of
experts giving them access weekly
monthly whatever to uh qualified
people yeah it could be that I think
that it's just I mean you you know
service businesses function right like
you're doing this in a physical sense is
a
logistic it's it's brick some like 24
hours a day brck some M totally totally
and like I mean if I you know if I was
in your shoes I would look at something
that is more
of a repeatable thing that scales
without you know like a lot of human

[1:11:00]
without you know like a lot of human
Talent like a lot of these e-commerce
companies anymore they use right so the
expert the experts thing I agree
is it it goes to your point about issues
around d d du but the idea though of C
maybe them persuading the universities
to get have licenses and then I'm just
selling the licenses and that involves
no it involves no I'm not involveed I'm
not relying on myself or anyone else for
that
matter because if you can sell if if you
can sell those licenses of activity
packs um and also create a continuity
program within that so you're updating
that all the time and sell those
licenses for th either 500 or
$1,000 plus the continuity of $100 a
month for new content then that's you
know a thousand people thousand that's
that's that's a million that's that's

[1:12:00]
that's that's a million that's that's
that's a million quid straight away
without continuity I don't know if
that's I don't know if I'm just going
wishful thinking rather than the
affiliate route I don't know I'm not
sure the short answer to your question
is you know is
there you know do do you think people
are are willing to pay for this The Good
the good news is you're building in a
space that people have disposable income
and they want to they want to spend the
money so that's why I think that if you
could become have the ability
correct and I think that if you
could build a trusted
Source I think that that's step one for
me it's like how do I build and earn as
much trust via building content and
internet audiences going on these
podcasts doing like reaction videos to
people like Peter artia Andrew huberman
with a context of dementia like
stitching together videos and
repurposing that just being like the
dementia

[1:13:01]
dementia
personer that that there's no because
really I've been in this space a long
time and watch it even in the states
there's no one doing that kind of stuff
totally probably just answer the
questions that are like most commonly
asked on social media that's right so
there's aund questions I've been on like
answer the public you know if you're a
son or daughter do you get dementia and
what is there's a hundred questions that
people the taboo questions that no one
will ask but really people really want
to know like here's one like how to get
a POA for a parent with dementia right
like 30 search volume right um I mean
there's 39,000 keywords I'm seeing right
now you could probably write you could
probably oneshot articles write these
with perplexity a AI Pro right now um
I'll drop this in the chat so it's it's
public but perplexity AI Pro uses Opus
currently and it pulls all the
information from whatever's ranking
currently so it'll go and like if a
journal is ranking it'll pull that into

[1:14:00]
journal is ranking it'll pull that into
the context window and then write based
off of that for the article and like for
medical content we're seeing these
articles that we're do writing be
like really really well written to
oneshot it but this could be a way to
like zero to one It kind of quickly um
yeah Greg what's your thoughts on that K
uh Kyle you know has a very Cody
response I don't know if you saw this
lead magnet push to Facebook 55 yeah
100% And with the wearable like that
100% I mean you could probably do it
with the I mean just the yeah I mean it
would be to the kids right who who's the
decision maker typically the decision
maker the there's two decision makers
there's the either the spouse who's in
her 70s or 80s or it's the son and
daughter who's in their 50s and 60s
right those are those are the those are
the decision makers super interesting um
yeah I I mean I would just look at the
demog graphic data like what they were
just suggesting like whatever the
average age for dementia is or the bell

[1:15:00]
average age for dementia is or the bell
curve shows yeah and Target that that
subset it's just going to be Facebook
ads lead magnet exact I mean it could be
Facebook ads to your website that has
the lead magnet which is your report and
then that just turns into like okay cool
then it's the wearable that's a I mean
that's a super easy funnel to build and
then on the I mean the SEO play there
then is go answer every question related
to dementia and then the pr play is uh
we just we dropped it in the CH I found
that company's name and I think somebody
else uh dropped it as well but it's
called search intelligence they're UK
based and basically what they do is like
they could take the report that you have
they'll translate it into like a digital
version and then they go and they'll
pitch you know basically every every
large news agency on this data and like
again with a top something like this
they're 100% going to pick it up like
anything health related they always like
jump on um so I I think that those those
three channels would be an easy way and
then that product that you're selling on
the back in would be an easy way to
build this
so this is awesome I really love what

[1:16:00]
so this is awesome I really love what
you're building and I think there's
something here it's it's I mean there's
no question there's something here and
and it's figuring out it's well I think
it's figuring I think it's figuring out
what is the right product at the right
price and the right roll out but I do
think that
the the audience piece and the content
piece everything else once you've
figured once that's been figured out and
you've built that system and process to
go and build that everything else like
figuring out what the product is like We
can brainstorm five six
ideas yeah so thank you for coming on
and and I also it's been great fun thank
you very much indeed I love what you're
doing my my grandma's early onet so like
yeah anyway it's we all know someone we
all know someone exactly one and two of
us know it's
insane thank you yeah thank you man all
right we have one last one last person
let's do it and uh let's see let's see
what he's like you never know right you

[1:17:01]
what he's like you never know right you
never know what could be I kind of love
it man it feels like Chat Roulette but
like yeah exactly well we we don't know
you know
Alex let's
see hi how you guys doing Cody what's up
man yeah I'm doing the this my girl just
got home from a night shift so I gotta I
gotta help out man I gotta be love it
brother I love it yeah we were we were
at the park the other day with our dogs
and I saw the episode of Cody talking
about him being out at the park and
stuff and I thought that is just like me
um love it man checking in from San
Diego again today I have this I have
this thought in my mind um some numbers
that kind of blew me away about our city
San Diego California there are 30
million unique visitors every uh tourist
uh to the city every single year um and
I know that a bunch of local people are
looking for things to do in the city but
there's not really an authority that you
can go there's a bunch of influencers if

[1:18:01]
can go there's a bunch of influencers if
you just scroll like you said I've
noticed Facebook pushing on Instagram uh
more local things in the in the reals
and in the carousels and stuff like that
and if you just go there's a bunch of
influencer posting content about things
to do but there's nobody that
prepackages that for you and ships it
out to you in an email and says yeah and
things that are going on in real life I
mean we have the weather um you know we
have some of the best like know events
going on U the beaches and stuff like
that 30 million people visit every year
and I I verified it and semrush the the
traffic and the search results for um uh
things to do in San Diego and things to
do in California things like this and
there's at least 40 50 100,000 searches
for that alone there's hundreds of
thousands of searches for hotels to stay
in um from the 30 million people coming
in every single year uh last year we had
our large this year and I think it
brought in like 38 billion or million
billion dollars of of Tourism money but

[1:19:02]
billion dollars of of Tourism money but
I I just what's a good way to monetize
on all this traffic and I I think it's
just been about information about
packaging that information um and
shipping it to the right people who are
interested in doing this whether that's
via a newsletter a Blog How would you
guys go about you know capitalizing on
all this volume of Tourism and local
people who are looking to do stuff in
the
city oh this is so hard um so I I did uh
Consulting for a tourism Association at
one point and like you it is like one of
the most Cutthroat Industries because
it's just like so many people are
competing in it like ranking for things
to do in XYZ city is gonna be one of the
hardest things that you've ever done the
thing that immediately came to my mind
so that there's that trend of what you
said 35 million 11 billion spent in San
Diego in 2019 on tourism related
activities
um but the the other thing that you
could attach that to is the majority of
people are starting their searches on

[1:20:00]
people are starting their searches on
social now rather than going to um a uh
like Google or like someplace like that
to to find what to do um so there's
probably an angle Greg and I actually
talked about this on another pod I
believe or another episode where it was
basically like you become uh The
Authority for like you know there's kind
of two different plays here it's like
you individually are this like you you
go answer like things to do in San Diego
in February like I'm just looking at the
list here like uh things to do alone in
San Diego things to do Solo in San Diego
and you basically make content for every
one of those keywords and put it across
social because people are searching
those things um the other side of it is
you go like the B2B route you go to you
go to you know companies basically and
you're like yo I I'll make these videos
or include you in them or you know
there's some type of payment structure
around that but Greg I'm curious your
thoughts I think the so social here is
where the Arbitrage exists currently you
competing with the website is going to
be like I mean I've been doing this 15

[1:21:01]
be like I mean I've been doing this 15
plus years like that makes me nervous
thinking about that right right yeah
it's a big city too yeah totally
so I gotta be honest I don't love these
types of businesses
um it's I get pitched on it a lot and
I've actually invested in several
businesses that were trying to create
apps that were supposed to be like I
just landed in San Diego what are like
the
coolest right place to go to and they
all end up pivoting to some B2B version
of it because right monetization is so
hard yeah I were you other side of this
go ahead Greg sorry I have another idea
if I were you I would I would pick
something else to do as your main thing
and as your side thing you know if Tik
Tok is the new review just create a
channel where you review things and you
build an audience just very organically
and you drive them to a newsletter and
just let let it just be local Tik Tok

[1:22:00]
just let let it just be local Tik Tok
meets newsletter and Mon and it's just
like a monthly email where it's like a
recap and you can probably automate a
lot of that with AI anyways and then
sell ad space to the San Diego tourism
Association right so right you can
actually Target tourists that are
visiting an visiting an area on Facebook
ads this is something that at least you
I haven't done this in probably 18
months but you can for sure used to be
able to do this quote don't quote me on
it but um you so basically you can be
like anybody that is doesn't live in
that area that's currently in that area
you can Target them right so actively
you could Target Taurus right so the
other way that you could go about this
is like you make an agency that's for
these tourism like you know type
businesses like so for example say
somebody does like paddle boarding in
the sound or some [ __ ] like that right
you go to them and you're like yo we'll
run Facebook ads and do Le gen for you
to the two tours that are visiting this
area or the other side of it like is
later on you have the organic social
side that we're talking about and you do

[1:23:00]
side that we're talking about and you do
the paid social make an ebook and it's
like 20 things to do in San Diego when
you're visiting right something super
dumb and simple and run Facebook ads to
that to the tourists that are there like
you're probably going to get like super
cheap conversions that turns into an
email newsletter and then go to the
tourism Association that's in that in
San Diego um like they have state you
know they have state budget and funding
that they have to allocate on a yearly
basis and you're like yo we know that
all of like I have this list email list
of all these people exactly that have
either traveled here or you know
whatever that ends up being um or they
here currently it's probably you know
coming back but then you can probably do
some type of like yearly deal with them
where you like if we're going to do 12
issues or 24 issues you're going to
sponsor that and then that turns I mean
it's probably a good little like side
business the scale version of this is
then you go to every city in the US and
you you make this exact playbook for you
know every like you do it for every
every major Metro right um and that's
that's the $10 million version of this

[1:24:01]
that's the $10 million version of this
but this the smaller version that I'm
talking about is probably start AR
social organic yeah to
totally initially is what is what I
thought yeah and I I wanted to com
comment on the last person who was on
Harvey and just um if I could give my
thoughts I I worked in healthc care with
people with dementia for like 10 years
and there is so much demand for these
kind of products um the for the and we
all know somebody who has dementia or
Alzheimer's and people are looking for
workbooks coloring books and and things
like digital products that people in
dementia would absolutely buy like my
mom right now has a brother who's
dealing with it and she buys coloring
books at the 99 cent store and just
looks at things for for him to do that
will help him and there's people who are
getting to that age group who are
looking for things to help themselves
with um who are usually retired have
more disposable income and things like
that and I just thought Harvey had such

[1:25:00]
that and I just thought Harvey had such
a nice idea but um thanks for having me
on guys you guys are always aesome love
it
man tourism is super hard it's again
it's I I think it's the building the
media version of that and selling it to
a state that is terrible at allocating
budget like again I've seen deals where
it's like they have I saw this blogger
have like 20,000 Subs on a newsletter
and was getting paid 150 Grand a year to
like just write a newsletter a week like
just dumb dumb [ __ ] right and but the
state was funding it and they don't know
the value of any of this and so anyways
that's just something there for
you yeah yeah now I hear you I'm taking
it all in I'm a sponge thank you guys
for having me on man good luck yeah yeah
have a good one take
care so I think that Alex gets the
nicest guy on the planet award for this
live stream and Harvey gets
probably the big the highest impact
award you know and he's just like lowkey

[1:26:01]
award you know and he's just like lowkey
owns like a bunch of these homes like
Legend the subtext of that conversation
too was like I don't give a [ __ ] about
the money I'm trying to make like social
impact with this I'm I already I already
secured the bag [ __ ] yeah like I've
been doing this for 20 to 30 years 100%
I got and so that was really cool I mean
a lot of it goes on diagnosed too which
is like a huge you know a huge piece of
this um so I yeah I don't know I dude I
I love the the local stuff it's
like I feel like that is the same as
like somebody pitching local news and
I'm like yeah it's a great idea
everybody wants it there's not enough
local news like there's just like not
enough things happening for you to even
make like a Channel about this so yeah
it's like you always he the same ideas
where it's
like uh
recommendations uh local news an app to
find your friends totally totally but
there's always like something in that
though right like there's like a layer

[1:27:01]
though right like there's like a layer
down of that like again like if you went
and you're like hey uh you know I if I
was them I'd go find like every company
that's on Airbnb uh what is it called
like their events thing experiences yeah
I'd find every company there and be like
yo we do Facebook ads to tourism for you
like yeah you know we know how to Target
tourists that are in the area that are
looking for things to do like give us
some type of offer and we'll just run it
on the background get them the idea dude
the product service offer for Airbnb
experiences 100% 100% I mean that that
and then that's replicable I mean you go
and you get you know charge 2K a month
for the small business or or you know
whatever that number is that will make
sense for them it's probably going to be
closer to that 10,000 range just because
that's what I've seen them spend in the
past but um I mean go get a 100 clients
offshore Talent they're running the ads
for it uh like use the same types of
creative over and over again pick the
big cities that people travel to
Nashville Austin San Diego you know any
of these places where they drop in um
they're trying to see what to do uh and
then you probably could like section it

[1:28:00]
then you probably could like section it
down where it's like oh parents with
kids we know like the you know the zoo
or whatever right um so you can actually
like again you can be like oh they're a
tourist and they have kids under the age
of 12 like you know you can Target those
people and basically run ads to them
right um so something else that could
could happen that's interesting you used
to be able to Target on Facebook ads
people who entered an area in the last
24 hours and don't live in that area AKA
tourist it's insane let me uh let me go
see if you can still do this targeting
uh it's been a minute since I've ran it
but I'll do it live while you're we're
in the background are we done we calling
it or what's your what's your we're
calling it we're calling it you've been
grinding man how you been how long you
been here two hours I know an hour and a
half it's easy plus the camat juice that
keeps you going you know yeah it's a
revitalizing you know totally Cody you
have anything to plug before we head out
no man nothing to plug uh I think this
is like startup School in a new way and
it's like very interesting because it's
like just lives thinking also with this

[1:29:01]
like just lives thinking also with this
type of stuff you get you get so many at
bats for business like businesses um and
that to me is like I the thing I'm
obsessed over right now is like how do I
get more looks at the plate so like in
baseball it's like you know you're
trying to see as many pitches as
possible like read Moneyball and it's
like you hit better if you see more
pitches right and that that idea I'm
trying to apply that like more and more
into my life uh so I feel like this is
doing a service to that right it's like
I get I get at bats at the plate like
where I'm seeing other people's pitches
but I don't have any of the the downside
of like I strike out right and so
anyways that that's the only thing I'd
leave with people to think about as they
go forward with this but I think what
you're doing here with this Qui is so
sick cool I appreciate it um yeah man no
real plug for me either except that if
you do like this you probably just want
to subscribe and put notifications on on
YouTube because Twitter's
suppressing links right now
so go to YouTube at Greg Eisenberg and

[1:30:01]
so go to YouTube at Greg Eisenberg and
then totally click
subscribe and uh oh the other the only
other thing that is sorry this is just
like news so I'm I'm dropping it because
it's [ __ ] insane I just tweeted about
this like last night but so my friend
reached out to me he's like IG T Tik Tok
uh and YouTube shorts famous started
porting his content over to LinkedIn and
he did 400,000 views he just texted me
this morning it's at 500,000 now but he
did 400,000 views in the last seven days
on LinkedIn with only 2700 followers on
his account so why is this happening
LinkedIn is ju just starting to roll out
a for you page content uh just like
every other channel so there's going to
be a tab that shows up on everybody's
LinkedIn mobile and it's going to be
just like infinite scroll type content
and if you make good business content on
any of those other platforms you just
Port it to LinkedIn like there's a huge
opport it's is blue ocean right now so
that would be the only other thing i'
throw out for people just that I've seen
on the front
lines 100% I'm I I already got a few

[1:31:03]
lines 100% I'm I I already got a few
post scheduled for next week just to try
it out I love it and it's all about
repurposing right so totally that's why
I like long form is like you can do
something like this for an hour and a
half chop it up into like five or six
clips you
totally that's my company right so like
SW that's what we're doing there's the
plug make pillar content turn it in we
just actually figured out how to make it
so it'll write like so I I take an
episode I'm like list 20 longtail
keyword phrases related to this
transcript writes like perfect titles
and then you match those against like
are there is there keyword volume for it
and then within the app it'll just like
Yeet out [ __ ] 20 different articles
and you can publish them right to your
website I'm like this it's about to get
so crazy with all this I mean you you
already know this but it's it's there's
there's so much like the amount of
content a company's going to be able to
create with like one good marketer is is
it's going to function like a hundred
people are working on the team like
that's where we're headed with this or
we'll just automate it entirely away

[1:32:00]
we'll just automate it entirely away
like with an agent that's just like
running a Playbook so I don't know we'll
see what happens but have you uh have
you seen Mr beasts views.com
no so Mr Beast launched a kind of like
competitive analysis software for
YouTube no way vs.com is that what he is
that what he owns he owns
that and it's really
smart why why what's your take on it
talk to me about it well I think it's
just here's here's my take I think that
Mr Beast tried Beast Berger tried Beast
BS and he's like wow that's a lot harder
than I thought it was gonna be put
together prodct physical product put
together like a crack team of like seven
engineers and he Knows
YouTube
so you know it's it's you know founder

[1:33:00]
so you know it's it's you know founder
product Market fit and now he's just
like you I haven't used the tool and and
I should use it I mean but basically it
allows you to just like check more
information about different YouTube
channels dude are you seeing the traffic
to this thing a a month into this holy
what is it what what do you check for
that I'm just looking at sem rush just
because I had it open
um let me share my screen real quick
yeah uh can we see that yeah cool I mean
this is what launched in I'm guessing
Mark's probably
soft yeah I it's just going vertical
right um I that's going to be huge I
mean honestly what that functions has
too for an influencer is that's almost
like a Media Kit like here's all the
data you want like this is CPM here's
what proves it right um totally I'm
curious to see what pages are doing the
best let me look I also I also think it

[1:34:01]
best let me look I also I also think it
it it puts him at like the center of and
not that he needed it but he's still
like you know he's gonna have the top
YouTube creators using it and then he
could be like oh hey uh NE boys like we
should totally collab on this video
yep yeah I mean I assume I assume that
their tenko on YouTube says social blade
clone like it it is kind of like a
social blade clone they're not there yet
but has anyone have you seen social
blade yes like forever ago yeah that's
what I thought that's why never really
used it
yeah um I mean there's probably an
opportunity then to disrupt that right
and then what social blade went like all
they went to Twitch as well if I
remember I mean there's probably you go
to every place yeah YouTube twitch
Twitter in stagram
analytics and then this is as a
subscription service for I mean this all
this turns into is an influencer
marketing tool that you're going and

[1:35:01]
marketing tool that you're going and
selling agenes access for right and like
marketing associations you know 20 grand
a year do unlimited searches to find all
the influencers in your category that
are getting views that's you know
whatever the the the filters are that
you're trying to do
um dude that's gonna be a huge company
this GNA be a huge company holy holy
[ __ ] look at this look at Social blade
yeah then you could let's
see like just the UI is just so brutal
by look look at this yeah can't even
filter down on it well the thing you
could do too with YouTube um so just
like I was talking about ronic earlier
where you basically like they've created
this database of access all those people
you can do that same thing you can
actually scrape YouTubers email
addresses from the their channels and
then just like that's how we do reach
out for like influencers that we're
working with so hypothetically you know

[1:36:00]
working with so hypothetically you know
he goes and he scrapes all the emails of
all these influencers or whoever their
teams are right and then sells access to
those that's the pay wall gated that
goes that that ends up uh ends up
happening but have you heard of this
stream charts no I haven't me neither
I'm gonna let me share my
screen stream charts is that the oh this
is not
okay stream chart this for live
streaming yeah looks like on ke and
[ __ ] I don't know it's not letting me
get to it
interesting but I I believe you yeah I'm
just seeing it right now uh looking like
twitch YouTube ke just every place that
they're streaming occurring and like who
the tops are that's interesting yeah I
don't know what what do you like why do
you feel like so you think he's just
doing it for like clout or like what's
the angle here because it feels I mean

[1:37:01]
the angle here because it feels I mean
the game play for me for him is like it
feels obvious right like especially with
his demographic of his audience like if
you look at the average age it's like a
15 if I remember right from what I read
so it's just like you know go sell Candy
Crush clones and you'll print probably a
hundred million in the next 18 months I
think he's dipping his toe into software
and this just makes the most sense my
guess is is doing a a a software holding
company and he can build like a bunch of
tools for creators yep that's my guess I
mean or I mean if something you could
probably sell so easily is do a course
clone so like go clone podia or
teachable again another that's another
billion dollar company that he could
spin off of this and then just use his
audience on YouTube to basically sell
that
totally my God this is the future though
right it's like own distribution you put
whatever you want on those rails and
then like overnight you just zero to one
this company and it's sustainable and
then it just like hired the team to
basically run it you move on to the next
one like that is you know this is the

[1:38:01]
one like that is you know this is the
Greg Playbook I didn't realize that he
made a game like if I'm him I'm
acquiring like a mobile app Studio
totally just it's already built already
built y then you just like pump traffic
to it 100% yeah 100% make like I like
what go find whatever the top iPads apps
are like do Acquisitions for all of them
and then I mean again overnight you you
would make the money back in probably 30
days after the deal closed 50 bucks to
cut your hair are you doing it hell yeah
dude I'll get a I'll get a mullet on the
next
call I'm dead serious I'm over it it's
hot we'll just go full gr Brooks for 50
bucks I'll do it for free four whiskies
in hell
yeah you're like Harvey you're like I
don't need the money
why there's point it yeah all right time
next next time we'll get you uh to do a

[1:39:02]
next next time we'll get you uh to do a
live live shave are you gonna who's
gonna cut it yourself no I'll uh I'll
