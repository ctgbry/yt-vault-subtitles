[00:00]
so first off bluecollar startups all the
sweaty startup people are always going
off about how these businesses are the
best businesses to start in reality like
what they never do is show you actually
how to grow them so that's what I want
to talk about today so each of these
things are approachable you can go get
started with these businesses for like
150 bucks at your your Lowe's or Home
Depot or whatever you know your Ace
Hardware is right next to you yeah I I
think it's one of these ideas that's
like very deceptive when you look at it
like you're like oh this is just some
simple dumb lifestyle business but in
reality like the game here is you go and
you make this service business this
sweaty startup or whatever the hell you
want to call it and then you learn these
skill sets on how to Market this type of
business you turn that into an agency
create this cash flow so that then I can
go and I want to buy portions of these
companies in specific geographies so
just thinking about this over 7 to 10
year period of of of climbing this
ladder when you scale this up what this
evolves into is when you own portions of
these companies this can turn into an

[01:00]
these companies this can turn into an
unbelievable whole like portfolio
company that whole thing that I'm
talking about there is just basically
like how you can go from like baby
entrepreneur to okay you're playing at
the pro level with the big dogs
[Music]
right got to stretch it out dude you got
to stretch it out you need you need the
intro music we have to figure out how to
do this I want like sip you know the Sip
theme song playing as you're waiting in
the waiting room but when Cody Schneider
comes on it's like sipping time baby
like exactly exactly I wanted like deep
house techno like techno bunker style
you think you're out of like late 90s
Rave that's what we're going for so
anyway Cody Schneider you're back you're
ready to sit you got a lot of blue
collar ideas and some blue collar I want
to I want to rip on those first cuz it's
driving me crazy everybody always talks

[02:00]
driving me crazy everybody always talks
about how easy it is to start these
businesses and then they never actually
show you how to do this and it's
actually so easy so anyways I want to go
there and then we can dive into there's
a bunch of random stuff on that list
that we got but it's going to level up
from like you know really approachable
stuff into stuff that's you know kind of
even out of my my my range of of
expertise or skill set so far so should
we do it let's do it hell yeah all right
so first off Blue Collar startups all
the sweaty startup people are always
going off about how these businesses are
the best businesses to start in reality
like what they never do is show you
actually how to grow them so that's what
I want to talk about today so the three
I'm going to use as an example is going
to be uh uh going to be window cleaning
it's going to be power washing and it's
going to be lawnmowing and the reason
for this is because you want to do
something that neighbors can physically
see looks different on the structure
next to them because you can use that as
a selling like a leverage point to go
sell the whole neighborhood on that
thing thing so again each of these

[03:01]
thing thing so again each of these
things are approachable you can go get
started with these businesses for like
150 bucks at your Lowe's or Home Depot
or whatever you know your Ace Hardware
is right next to you and then to
actually get customers I want to walk
through the options that are here with
this so if you want to get like
sophisticated with this what it ends up
looking like is you basically optimize a
Google my business profile listing so
with that listing how you actually
optimize that is you basically set up
you're going to need an address of some
type you can do a PO Box the best way is
have some type of physical address you
can just tack it onto another business
so if you have a family member or
something like that that's the best way
to do this and then you what you're
going to then go do is you build
citations for that business so business
citations what these are basically uh
websites that are like business
directory websites if you go to
fiverr.com Just Google you know just
search in Fiverr like business citations
you're G to find a guy you're G to pay
him 30 bucks and he's going to make 300
citations for you the reason we're doing
this is when your business information

[04:02]
this is when your business information
uh Mt whatever you put on Google you
want to use that exact thing that you're
on all the citations when all that
matches Google looks at that as a trust
metric and this is actually how you can
rank within the snack pack which is the
three when you go and you Google
something for anything local Services
what shows up on page one is at the top
of most these pages is it's going to be
three Google Maps listings so how do you
rank with in that Google Maps listing so
you come up as one of those three this
is the way to do that so you build all
these citations Google's going to be
like oh here's all these websites where
it's all matching so there's a trust
that's built into that uh again reviews
are going to be a component of this we
found it to be less and less important
to do reviews what really matters is
that the keyword phrases that you want
to come up for being in the listing you
can just have ai write this go f find
like all the keywords related to
whatever the service that you're
providing so like Window Cleaning Denver
Window clean you know whatever the
service area is all the different
variations and you basically have it
right um a description of that uh of
that business including those keywords

[05:00]
that business including those keywords
and add that to the Google my business
profile listing I've even done this
where I've St I've just keyword stuffed
these listings before like like straight
up listed out 30 different keywords and
got it to rank for that as long as
you're again building these citations
out right um so that's how you can get
inbound leads from the Google Maps side
then the other thing that I would do if
I was running this just on that real
quick yeah so when you say AI I get AI
to write this okay which Ai and how do
you prompt it so I would do something
like chat I would go to chat GPT or
Claude I'm really liking Claude lately
it's just way more human on the outputs
that it's doing you give it the list of
keywords that you're trying to have it
write for and you say hey write me uh a
thwp of a business and you know name
your company whatever that is and
include these keywords in that output
super simple all it's going to do then
is it's just going to write this article
or write this description this business
description that includes all those

[06:00]
description that includes all those
keywords phrases in it but it's going to
feel natural it's going to feel like
it's you know you're not just listing
out the keywords like I said I like
we've done a test although that works
this is going to be a more effective way
to do that um so that that's kind of the
the breakdown of this of how I would go
about and do that and then all of those
keywords you also want to include them
in the uh in the service offering
there's a section within the Google my
business listing where you can like just
list out the services that you offer
those same keywords include those there
and that's going to help on the ranking
side and then images is the other
component of it that we found to be
really important reviews are way lower
than people think it's honestly shocking
um especially in uh like smaller
geographies it really what's matters is
like is this an exact match for whatever
this person is searching and is there
more business information that I can
find off off of off of Google basically
that's supporting that this is an actual
company that does this service that's in
this location and here's you know its
phone number information that type of
thing um and again all of this is like

[07:00]
thing um and again all of this is like
you you know you could use a Google
business phone number um real phone
numbers are more effective is what we
found if you can get you know even a
cell phone and have that be the one that
you're linked up to or use you know one
of these like VoIP softwares that'll
work as well any of those types of tools
but basically that's kind of you know to
take a step back and run down through
this whole thing of how you optimize
these profiles it's you want to find the
keywords that you're trying to show up
for that when you Google them right now
from wherever you are that map pack
shows up on that front page right um
quick ad break let me tell you about a
business I invested in it's called
boring marketing.com so a few years ago
I met this group of people that were
some of the best SEO experts in the
world they were behind getting some of
the biggest companies found on Google
and the secret sauce is they've got a
set of technology and AI that could help
you outrank your competition so for my
own businesses I wanted that I didn't
want have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I

[08:01]
want have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I
didn't want to depend on ads to drive
customers to my businesses I wanted to
rank high in Google that's why I like
SEO and that's why I use boring
marketing.com and that's why I invested
in it they're so confident in their
approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint
with 100% money back guarantee who does
that nowadays so check it out highly
recommend boring marketing.com so if the
answer is yes so it's like you found a
keyword it shows that map pack then
green light that keyword you're going to
include that in the description of the
listing you're going to include that in
the offering it's like this like you
know what you do and the services you
offer section include that there as well
whatever your high highest Target level
keyword is you can also include that in
the listing title there's a little bit
gray area this is not technically like
you're not supposed to do this but it
can help with your ranking um so what I
would suggest is whatever you name this
business name it with that exact keyword
in it so again saying you're doing
window cleaning like try to get it as
close to like Denver Window Cleaning

[09:01]
close to like Denver Window Cleaning
company as possible right um have you
ever seen that uh that Meme and it's
like TI near me it's like this
restaurant named TI near me so that the
reason they're doing that is they're
trying to basically like TI near me is a
huge uh traffic keyword right and so
they're trying to show up for that when
somebody searches it in you know
whatever City that it's in so you're
basically using that same strategy here
and then so that's how you optimize the
listing and you know to use SEO terms
that's on page optimization and then the
off pages and taking that exact data
that you use to fill out that listing
the phone number the address uh the the
business title Etc and you go and you
build all these citations out those
listing citations um so that's kind of
layer one of this the next layer down
from that is then you have to go and get
those citations to actually be seen by
Google so what you can use is you can
use an indexing bot um I'll I'll I'll
share the the link uh that I have for
this one I I'm the one I'm liking right
now is I think it's called like Speedy
indexer it's literally a telegram bot
that's the only way you can get access

[10:01]
that's the only way you can get access
to it um but you give the list of
citations that that person that you just
bought this off Fiverr that they built
and you send it to this bot and it will
go and it will index the it basically
what it does is it drips traffic into
these uh these these pages and the
reason we have to do this is because
these citation websites are massive
right we're talking about like hundreds
of millions of pages sometimes and so
Google doesn't a lot enough crawl budget
to actually go and see the entire
website and so what that we do is we're
basically like sending pings to this
specific URL and this company handles
this for you and it's super cheap I'm
talking like you know a couple cents per
per listing that you're doing like right
like you can this whole thing I'm
talking about you can do for under
probably you know $300 you can get
started with this entire company and so
once you've done that uh it's Google's
going to see them it's GNA the indexing
boock will show you which ones have been
indexed and then it'll do about 50% it's
just hit or miss that's how it is it
doesn't work always right with all these

[11:00]
doesn't work always right with all these
things so then that that uh so say it
gets you know 100 on the first go
whatever that 200 is that left you just
run it again you run it indefinitely
until all of these start to hit um so
that's another component of this if you
do that you're miles ahead of the people
that you're competing against in the
space and then the thing that you can go
further with if you want to is you then
take the Google Maps uh listing and you
can embed that listing and so this is
something that Google prioritizes as
being uh a a like if somebody embeds
that then it's like a good it's
basically a signal that this is like a
good resource right think about when
somebody embeds a YouTube video when
they embed a map Etc the it it's a
signaled off the page that this is a
again another real company so you can
use the service it's called um oh God
what's his name Kevin pbn's if you just
Google it this website called Black Hat
World Is Gonna Come up do not take any
other advice off of Black Hat World and
if this is like the sophisticated level
of this that's a layer down and again
this is like

[12:00]
this is like
I would only go here if you if it's
entirely necessary and you're trying to
compete in like a very competitive
market most of the time I was wondering
what you're going to say about that yes
so with all that said um what you can do
is you basically can embed the Google
Maps listing on this pbn network so what
a pbn network is is it's called a plot
private blog Network and a private blog
Network imagine it's like thousands of
blogs that this company owns that all
internally link back to each other and
all basically like kind of juicing
themselves up so this be used to be a
way that you could like rank you know
things previously this was years ago now
how people use them is they use them as
like a tier two or a tier three link so
what this means is uh they're basically
you you build your backlink and then you
build links from other sites to the back
link that you built so that it gets seen
this is another way to see get those
those sites indexed um if you're trying
to not do the Speedy index spot but
again that works so effectively you
don't need to do that but to get back to
this so then you embed that uh uh that

[13:04]
this so then you embed that uh uh that
Google Maps Lis thing and then include
the business information there as well
and you can again get these for like you
know I think 50 cents to get these these
P these published and basically these
these uh pbn articles made that includes
this embedded in the WordPress site and
that's another way for you to get these
and but I mean I've seen case studies
and Shout Out Jackie uh Jackie chow or
Jew I can't remember is last name or how
to pronounce it correctly so I'm totally
butchering that but he's just done
unreal case studies on this type of
stuff um and a lot of what I just talked
about are methods that he's basically
like kind of pioneered or shown out in
public and then we've used it on
companies that we've uh that you know I
work my brother's in the medical space
we do a bunch of stuff with like you
know local business type of deal and
this is the things that we've seen be
effective and it's really just ripping
off of a lot of what he's doing already
so um but yeah man that whole Playbook
is like you just gamed Google Maps and
you now have or organic inbound leads
and the results from this type of work

[14:00]
and the results from this type of work
like we've seen it in like a week and a
half go from Like It's Not In That Snack
Pack to it's in that snack pack when you
do this type of work it's like I mean I
couldn't get that to happen in SEO if I
tried right you know the time Horizons
on traditional SEO to rank on the front
page is like at least three months plus
like even if the site uh is like has
some Authority and has some U uh uh you
know it's that company has existed in
that Community for a long time but this
is a way to really quickly go and do
that so yeah and
go ahead yeah and once you once you do
that and you've done it like you can
point to success you can do it for other
companies too right that's exactly where
I'm leading with all this so like the
the the game here is you go and you make
this service business the sweaty startup
or whatever the hell you want to call it
and then you learn these skill sets on
how to Market this type of business you
turn that into an agency and then you go
and you cold email every you know Window
Cleaning company in the US hey they're
like hey Window Cleaning company like I

[15:01]
like hey Window Cleaning company like I
know how to grow and get leads like
let's do a part you know I want to do
marketing for you here's some sat like
set flat fee here's all the things that
we're going to do you could even do it
on a performance basis there's all these
different models to do that um but
before we jump in kind of to the next
phase there's two other things I want to
talk about just things that we've seen
work and I think could be really
effective for these businesses so the
other one is uh direct mail so you can
use this company called lob.com and what
lob.com will do is like you build a
flyer it's a it's going to be an 11 uh
by8 flyer um in uh you do it in canva I
think that's the dimensions don't quote
me on that but basically build that out
on canva you can upload that into lob
and then you can upload a list of
addresses that you trying to send this
direct mail out to and what the
addresses you can go and uh if you just
search like addresses and XYZ zip code
find the find the richest ZIP codes in
your area and that's where you want to

[16:00]
your area and that's where you want to
send these two and offer that service to
right um so there's a direct mail play
here and then the other thing that you
can also uh do is uh I mean straight up
just like putting flyers on doors is
going to be like another piece of this
just like old school classic and I'm
talking from like you're starting out
from zero and you're trying to figure
out like how do I get this to make me a
100K a year and be my own boss this is
the this is all the things that I would
layer on together and again this isn't a
super uh heavy lift to do all of this
this is all like very accessible and and
you know most people could do this so um
but anyways so you got this company it's
established now and you're like all
right I know how to do this marketing
none of these other people know how to
do these marketing but they have
businesses that are 15 years old 20
years old that are in this space so now
you go out and you say hey we do digital
marketing for these people you basically
make an agency a digital agency and you
do some type of service fee that's how I
would do it because it would be a cash
I'm just trying to create cash flow and
the reason for that will come up in a
second so I'm trying to create this cash

[17:00]
second so I'm trying to create this cash
flow so that then I can go and I want to
buy portions of these companies in
specific geographies say you go and you
be like hey I want to buy 20% of your
company and we're g to handle all of
your marketing for you so you spend this
upfront cost and you use the cash flow
from your agency and you use the cash
flow you know from your window cleaning
company that you built initially so you
just thinking about this over whatever
sevene period 7 to 10 year period of of
of climbing this ladder well this
evolves into is when you own portions of
these companies and you have all these
geographies that you're servicing and
say you have owned 20% of a you know a
window cleaning company or an hvat
company or whatever this ends up being
this can turn into an unbelievable hold
like portfolio company like Holdings
company an example of somebody that's
done this his name is James zly he's
this guy out of the UK absolute gangster
like just a legend he's like a
degenerate Gambler too so I love him he
like bets on horse racing and owns
horses and breeds them it's so sick like
that is the dream literally my dream is

[18:01]
that is the dream literally my dream is
that so anyway um he he's done this
where he basically goes in he buys a
portions of these companies and over a
three-year period I mean they can
basically double or triple these these
things right so when you think about
from an investment standpoint like he
has the same Playbook he's running over
and over again it's the same skill sets
it's the same team members he doesn't
have to change any of that all he's
doing is he's just running those same
plays in these different places and
that's how I mean he he's an SEO guy
he's an
guy a legit OG like classic yeah totally
but I mean he's worth like 100 million
allegedly from a portfolio standpoint
the only thing I would do differently
here would be
I I probably wouldn't buy 20% of these
businesses with cash like I would just
earn that Equity kind of seller financed
and be like yeah I'm not going to charge
you for all these Services I'm you know
but I'm going to I'm going to do these
things for you and like maybe put some
cash down but you know I think that's a

[19:02]
cash down but you know I think that's a
way to do it totally and there's so many
different ways that you can handle it
the biggest problem is getting the cash
flow so that you have the leverage and
the skill set so you have that leverage
and that's like what that whole thing
that I'm talking about there is just
basically like how you can go from like
baby entrepreneur to okay you're playing
at the pro level with the big dogs right
and that again it's like you could that
that whole model that we just talked
about that's a three to five year Sprint
that if you really wanted to and you
were like ready to grind like you could
do that whole thing what we just
described and the other thing that I
would do and layer on top of this I know
you'll love this is I would film I would
do these services that you can film that
are like satisfying and then you put
those on YouTube and that turns into
another Revenue stream for you long term
right so like have you seen the guys
that like mow like Lawns they like take
like nasty ass Lawns and they like trim
them all up and then they I mean they
get like three million views right same
thing you do with window cleaning you
could do it with uh you could do it with
power washing like there's the massive

[20:00]
power washing like there's the massive
channels out there and so you just
thinking about that layer so that does
two things it's like that turns into a
profit Center for you because you're
going to get adds you know add dollars
off of that but simultaneously you're
gonna also get inbound leads from that
because they're going to show people
that are in that geography like if you
lifts that in the description like
cleaning a you know or mowing a lawn in
you know blah blah blah South Carolina
like it's gonna it's going to show that
to people that are in that geography
it's going to understand that over time
and that's that's kind of the data the
other other layer of this here that we
you can you can play into so is it not
her Alex Herm mozies a little bit
because I mean right he did the only
thing I think that's missing a little
bit from this story is what he did with
uh what's it called gym gym launch gym
launch so he was like yeah I had this
gym and I you know grew it from X to Y
like I think the personal Brand Story is
really like huge with this you have to
be able to
say I'm one of you I did to and I took
it from A to B and then invest in

[21:02]
it from A to B and then invest in
content at that layer 100% 100% I mean
we've talked about this on other
episodes where it's like hey you go and
you uh create YouTube videos showing
people how to do this right like how to
do Google ads for window cleaning or
whatever right or how to do Facebook ads
for window cleaning or how to even just
we what we just talked about on Google
Maps like how to rank your window
cleaning business for Google mape what's
naturally going to happen people are
going to watch this they're going to be
like oh my God I don't have time for
this like can I just hire this kid boom
that turns into your first customer but
again using yourself as the case study
is always the most effective way to do
this right it's like we did this for my
company that I owned and here's the
results we can do this for your company
that you own and like we the idea is we
can basically expect results that are
similar it's super simple idea right um
but it looks very I I think it's one of
these ideas that's like very deceptive
when you look at it like you're like oh
this is just some simple dumb lifestyle
business but in reality like when you
scale this up and you look at the path

[22:00]
scale this up and you look at the path
of like where people and and and horos
is doing this exact same right thing
right he's like cool I built these like
he's now at that level where he's
investing in other companies like his
investment in school is an ex perfect
example of this where it's like he's
like oh well I leveled up to these to
these layers and now I'm at this you
know Pro level which is where I buy
portions of these other companies and
then I use my platform that I built to
basically go and promote this right I
mean it's the same it's the same thing
you're doing it's the same thing I'm
doing it's the same Playbook but in then
totally different
category I like it I like it how big of
an opportunity is this I mean just to
use James as an example like I again if
if he owns for my from what I've seen he
owns about 150 different companies
equity in 150 different company I think
he he goes after specific categories and
then he uh you know for each G major
geography or each major metro area he
Partners or buys a percentage of some
company and he always goes with some
Scrappy upstart you know some dude
that's in his late that's got two kids
that's like there to grind right he's

[23:02]
that's like there to grind right he's
like cool I'm gonna like help we're
going to help you double triple your
business over the next two to three
years and I mean I think this is 100%
aund hundred million dollar company
especially when you look at like what
are I mean these companies sell for a
lot of money especially if they have uh
a foothold within an area right if that
an hbac company's been in an area for 20
years right like there's Equity there's
just name brand equity in that over time
so when you go and you try to sell that
to PE or whatever or you just go and you
do a bundle right there's probably a
version of that as well where you sell
the percentages of each of these
companies uh that that you have that you
have in your Holdings company that or
that hold that that Holdings company
owns So before we move to the next idea
I don't know if you saw this but Cody
Sanchez bought a piece
of uh resi Brands I didn't see this no
way yeah yeah so resi Brands is like you
know I think it's the fastest growing
painting comp painting franchise company
in theed unit States insane they also

[24:00]
in theed unit States insane they also
own pinks which is just killer pinks is
what you were talking about a little bit
Austin Austin yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah so they're like visual like it
looks like these guys dude I have
friends that wear to streetwear like I
mean exactly right yeah it's like 80s it
kind of looks like an 80s like porno '
80s is
backing look at the top Billboard right
now and it's all synth every song is
leading with syn it's synth or it's folk
that's the only thing that's happening
right now or Kendrick that's the outlier
the only outlier in that whole list but
anyway sorry I didn't mean to cut you
off but I it's related I mean it totally
related I think so so basically the idea
is they took uh window cleaning but they
they wear these like I don't know it's
like 80s porn mustache guys cleaning it
and it's so Tik Tok friendly so Cody you
see him in a calendar yeah so Cody say I
would buy a calendar
100% Cody uh Sanchez ended up buying a

[25:03]
100% Cody uh Sanchez ended up buying a
big piece of the business what do you
think about that I think it's brilliant
um I think the only thing that I would
be against with this type of stuff is
like I love when influencers buy
companies that they have some type of
distribution Advantage with so when they
have an Arbitrage that nobody else has
access to and maybe she does have that
and we don't know about it like again I
I have no idea but um her audience of
like entrepreneurs doesn't feel totally
aligned unless she goes and she's like
yo I'm going to franchise this thing and
then I just use my audience as the way
to basically spin up you know we take
the the we take the business I mean and
that's honestly probably the angle that
I would go at this room like if I was in
that position is okay we got 30
different locations right now like how
do we turn that into 300 locations in
the next three years and then that's
when you go and you approach traditional
PE and I mean you just have an
absolutely massive exit right um that's
probably the bridge like they just take
the same marketing and they're just
trying get like a ton of top of funnel
inbound of people that want to start you

[26:01]
inbound of people that want to start you
know business in a box companies and
this feels like a business in a box
company but I I would say this like if
you ever see a brand that people are
repping that the product is unrelated
like the clothing is unrelated to the
brand that's when you know that that
company is absolutely like going to rip
in whatever category it's in when you
when you you can't you can't fabricate
that it only happens like organically
and you it only happens when you're
doing something cool and original that
like really people that are on the front
of that that adoption curve are like oh
yo like this is this is something I like
again I have a friend who's uh he's in
the podcasting space and like this is
how I know about this and like he reps
the merch like to your point right like
just wearing it out because that this
it's the stylization on it is insane
right and th that when you think about
that and and you see any company that
that's naturally happening immediately
go okay that's that's like a business
that you want to try try to buy into
they're doing something right you don't

[27:00]
they're doing something right you don't
you don't even have to know what it is
it's just a signal that this is this is
a good thing 100% all right what else
you got cool um have you heard of uh the
uh buy it for life
subreddit tell tell me about it okay so
I stumbled on this thing and basically
what it is is there's this group of
people that want to buy products that
they're tired of consumerism and they
want to buy products that are like the
highest quality they can you know at you
know doesn't really matter the price I
want this thing to last for forever and
so massive subreddit insanely fast how
it's growing like if you look at the
data um and all that people do is they
basically are like hey I'm trying to get
like the best jacket for x or like these
types of boots right like Doc Martins
that are actually good quality what is
the brand that I should go after and
look for and this subreddit is just
dedicated to that so it's all it is is
people basically like question and
answering what is the best of XYZ
category like I was just look how I

[28:00]
category like I was just look how I
stumbled on it it's I was looking for
the best blender right CU I was like I
bought so many blenders over my life I
mean I'm I'm I can't take it anymore
like I want one like what is it what is
it gonna take to give me one so they
suggested uh it was basically this like
industrial blender and I was like oh my
God this is like you read the reviews on
this and they're like yo I've had this
for 80 years right like I got I just got
to pass down you know my my mom just
passed it down to me type of thing and
so I think there's this whole subset of
people and what's interesting is all
these people look like they have money
because the products are not small price
taxs right we're talking about like you
know $800 P like pairs of boots right
like that type of deal and you know I
mean this blender was like two grand
right but I think there's an angle here
and I actually don't know what this
company looks like and that's what I
want to throw out and you know to you
and like like have you kind of we can uh
we can rally off of it but um I I think
there's an angle where you do like a
imagine like a William Sonoma bu for
Life stumble upon crossover so you just

[29:01]
Life stumble upon crossover so you just
like are swiping through this and you're
like discovering all of these products
that are like the highest Echelon of
their category that they're in so I
think that's an angle of this and I
think you could probably pair that with
like a deal monitor for these brands
that are considered buy it for life
Brands right so you go and you scrape
that subreddit you find all of the buy
it for life Brands and then you
basically I I know there's these
websites that exist uh I I don't have a
lot of experience in this so you know
bear with me for my ignorance but you
can basically set up monitors for these
types of products so that whenever deals
come on the market for you know ex it's
really just probably like Google Trends
is how a lot of this is happening but
whenever or not Google Trends uh Google
like notifications or Google news or how
you can set up like a listener and then
anytime that you see a price drop then
that site it goes up on there you
basically scrape it just probably an
affiliate play that's there and there's
probably a subscription on top of it
because these people want to buy these
Goods but they're looking for oh it's
30% off like these boots I've been
looking for 30% off let me go buy that
so anyways I'll throw the mic to you I'm

[30:00]
so anyways I'll throw the mic to you I'm
curious your thoughts I mean this is
this isn't just any subreddit this this
is probably one of the fastest growing
subreddits I think it has 2.3 million
members so this is this is just like a
macro Trend around people are just tired
of buying things that break totally so I
love the macro Trend you know what does
it look like I don't know I think that
there's probably like it would be really
cool if there was you know if I bought
you know I almost like a Costco
membership but for buy it for life it's
like $100 a year I get access to these
amazing products all these products and
if one of these products breaks we will
you know not only buy you know lifetime
guarantee but we'll we'll give 20 of
them to you know if it's a sweater we'll
give 20 sweaters to you know uh
people who you know need sweaters you

[31:01]
people who you know need sweaters you
know and if it's a blender we'll send 20
you know 20 blenders to U you know soup
kitchen that sort of thing totally
totally so there's some type of like uh
you know Community or some type of I
don't know social cause that's tied into
it dude I think that's brilliant I mean
it is probably just taking the Costco
model right and then you just turn into
like you're just a Marketplace
distributor and I I mean let's just do
the math real quick right so say you had
10,000 people that were subed to this
it's 100 $ a year and so you're coming
out what is that a million um so you're
coming out at a million in in uh in
revenues uh then you go and you
negotiate relationships you probably
have to get it at a way larger scale uh
probably be like a 100,000 but again if
there's 2.2 million people that are a
part of this just imagine getting 10% of
those people on this list so you're
coming in at 220,000 people so you get
220,000 people they're paying you a 100
a year uh so that's going to be 22
million um no 200 20 million is that
right I think so no public math yeah 220

[32:02]
right I think so no public math yeah 220
million and at that point you go to
these companies and you negotiate buys
based on that right you just have like a
narly division that that focuses on this
but I to zoom out to the macr trend
thing like I think this is something
that people are getting obsessed with
like how do I buy a knife that will last
me for 20 years like how do I buy you
know everything in my home like I I I'm
so tired of things breaking like even
when it's considered decent quality and
the first two years of its existence and
I it's funny because the the next
company that I'm going to pitch you is
basically this it's it's related to this
it's in the same vein but an entirely
different category but I like this I
like your idea of the membership thing I
think that this is actually the way that
this would be the most profitable and
you just pass on the savings to the
people how you actually make money is
based off the memberships so can I pitch
you uh pit you an idea real quick that I
have before this call so I've been into
this going to sound like dumbb but I've
been into reading recently

[33:00]
been into reading recently
reading hell yeah yeah hell yeah I can't
read so it's you know whenever I hear
that from somebody I'm always very I I I
I look fondly at it there you go so I've
been enjoying books and uh I've I've
been like whenever I hear someone
recommend a book that you know maybe on
a podcast or YouTube video I always
write it down instantly actually I just
instantly buy it
and after point I I finished all those
books so I would say let's say I'm a big
Cody Schneider fan which I am by the way
I would I would go to chat gbt and I say
you know here's Cody Schneider this is
who he is here's his link to his Twitter
what are the five mustre books that Cody
Schneider would recommend to me I'm
looking I'm looking to get better at XYZ
topic SEO organic marketing whatever so
I think that there's an opportunity to
basically create uh I guess it's like a

[34:01]
basically create uh I guess it's like a
newsletter and it's like books that XYZ
influencer would recommend and it's I
don't know if it's weekly or monthly but
call let's just say it's probably a book
club what if it's that where it's like
you pay a subscription and then you're
going and basically CU like I I want
this like you tell me like what are the
top most influential books for this
person that's in my category like right
we do business for a living like I want
to know every book that every business
person has ever referenced and
influenced their career and like I want
to read that book right because that's
that's the idea behind this um I I mean
I book clubs are already happening it's
just a Different Twist on it so I 100%
there's something in this yeah but I
think with book clubs what you know what
a book club I don't think it's a book
club sorry I mean like a like you get
like a box you know just like those
snack pack boxes like I just want like
cool like four books show up month you
know day one of the month and it's like
this month we're highlighting you know
XYZ person the reason we're highlighting

[35:00]
XYZ person the reason we're highlighting
them is because they did ABC they're
experts at you know one two and three
and these are the books that they said
were most influential within their
career and then boom you know you have
that those physical copies right there
you don't have to think about it and
it's like I mean you could probably do
it in like different categories too like
oh I want to do art history or you know
I'm obsessed with so stupid but with
like Roman history right now I'm just
like binging this podcast from like it's
the history of Rome it's the best
podcast dude it's just this dude like
you can tell just passion project
obsessed with it he's just reading off
the facts then he's like yeah and that
guy was a [ __ ]
idiot it's iconic but anyway um like I'm
just imagining like that that's
something that I think when I when I
don't have to think about it but I get
the the educational drip that I'm
looking for I think that's valuable to
anybody right that's like competing at
at a high level they want to know
everything about everybody they're
competing against or has competed in the
same category before them yeah and I
also think that if if it's uh influencer

[36:00]
also think that if if it's uh influencer
based or Creator based you just Target
people that you know if it's for me
let's say yeah people who follow me on
on X just 100% get those people I'm sure
you can get those emails for like pretty
cheap and then and then just send them
like I think there you know businesses
have levels so like level one of this is
just the free email with like Greg
Eisenberg would recommend these two
books this month and here's some key
insights for from those books and then
Le you know the next level is join the
book club to your point Y and it's like
you don't even have to you know for $99
a month we'll just send it to you right
away and then next level is maybe a
membership that you know uh you know
synchronous events and digital stuff
that's the business 100% no I think it's
brilliant I again it's just I'm like you
where it's like I as soon as I hear a
book that somebody mentions I just like

[37:00]
book that somebody mentions I just like
yeah I mean that could be a feature of
this too right is like you go and you
scrape everything of that they've ever
been on or talked on and like cool what
is the things that they've mentioned
based off these transcripts because like
they people I feel like every interview
that I besides this one that I go on
it's like what books would you recommend
or like what are you listening to like
that type of [ __ ] and I mean just
extract that out of there you know just
do R over the top of it even if you
haven't explicitly recommended the book
you can infer based on all the stuff
that you've talked about all the people
that you've talked about all the super
interesting all that stuff you like it I
love that yeah I green light I think
that that's another one it's super
simple too it's just you can use off the
off the the Shelf Tech and I think the
distribution is exactly what you said
like choose these figures that are
already in public like hberman or
whatever right it could be anybody any
of these any anybody that's in any
category so and then you're also making
affiliate on Amazon what is exactly
let's see yeah how much uh% I think is

[38:02]
let's see yeah how much uh% I think is
for books yeah I mean M just great I
mean it's it's an
unreal so and again I think there's
layers of it too right it's like build
big list people typically people who
read have a higher income level that's
the trend shocking um so then you have
an audience and
the so you have the audience so you sell
ad space on that you have the Affiliates
of the books sorry on the I'm still on
the big Insight that you gave that
people who have who read have a higher
uh income level dude it's so stupid but
so real it's it's crazy actually uh
there there's like a direct correlation
in relationship to this rather than
listening to things like they often
people that don't listen to things and
who read more have more money to spend
it's their filter it's so weird it's
it's you the economic data around it is
actually wild so but
um all right to move on yes uh dumb

[39:02]
um all right to move on yes uh dumb
appliances all right so I have a
dishwasher and it takes me seven button
clicks to make it go and it every time I
do it I hate doing the dishes because of
it I despise doing the dishes because of
it and I think this is a larger Trend
and the data shows this as well like
again go to Reddit and look for people
being like what's the dumbest dishwasher
that I can find what's the dumbest
Wasing machine that I can find what's
the dumbest fridge that I can find and
again I think this is a push back from
it's a part of that larger trend of
people just want things that last they
want things that they can fix and they
can work on and I think there's an
opportunity I would literally just call
it dumb appliances and your whole thing
is like we don't connect to the internet
we don't like it just works it's like
maybe four buttons to that's the whole
thing of of the whatever the minimum
amount is to to get the thing to
function it does that right and I think
there's a huge opportunity and I think I
would just sell it like that like we

[40:01]
would just sell it like that like we
built the dumbest dishwasher like you
plug it in and it runs like that's it
right like and that's the angle that you
go from you talk about Simplicity you
talk about it lasting for a long time
you buy it for life type of deal and I
think there's an opportunity to build a
brand uh in that space and then I mean I
think the larger Trend here is like do
you see that story where like some dude
was like mining Bitcoin off of the
fridge like the CP like off of the the
the processor that was was in his fridge
like they like hacked his fridge and was
like mining Bitcoin off it he's like I
couldn't figure out why my bandwidth on
my network was so high like he's like I
there's no way we're using you know
whatever it was some insane amount of
data and then they found that this was
the reason and I think everybody's like
I don't need this to be connected to the
internet I don't want to chat with my
fridge my fridge to tell me what to do
like the last thing people want is for a
robot to tell them what to do like think
about when your seat belt alarm goes off
like you hate your car when it does that
to you right now scale that up to your
fridge telling you oh you need milk or

[41:01]
fridge telling you oh you need milk or
whatever or scale that up to AI when
it's like you can't ask that question
like that's not all right like people
are going to get pissed you want to know
how to Red Pill people tell them that
they can't research the thing or learn
about the thing that they're trying to
learn so anyways to take a step back I
think there's an opportunity for dumb
appliances just in every category within
within the home I love it I want to show
you a quick tweet I saw today uh shilman
note my parents have had the same washer
and dryer for almost my entire life they
bought them used in 1989 35 years
without issue I've had to replace our
washer twice in the nine years that I've
had it they really don't make them like
they used to and it's these like boxy I
guess General Electric it looks like or
mayag and then Nikita said Nikita beer
you can still buy them new it'll cost
you two times the price of the most
expensive LG but they're totally worth
it 100% And I think that's the larger
Trend that's happening right is like
especially the the anybody that has

[42:01]
especially the the anybody that has
basically disposable income they're
trying to they're thinking about these
things and they just want that quality
level at the highest level that they can
get it if you can be the source for that
in any form you're going to get that
customer loyalty and then again you can
just move throughout the house like
start with one just everybody that you
talk to has had this experience with a
washing machine like the Samsung like it
doesn't dry [ __ ] because the sensor's
off of like when it's dry right and so
I'm having to dry having to time dry it
over and over again but it auto turns
itself off because it's saying that it's
dry but it's not it's damp I put my hand
in and it's damp I think for a lot of
people that's that's a huge frustration
and so if you come to that and you solve
that problem like there's a massive
Market that you can go after and I think
it could be very cool like calling it
dumb Appliance or stupid appliances or
you know there's some name that's like
in there that would uh tap into that
frustration that anger that people
people have with these okay before you
go into your next idea I want to I want
to give a a dumb a dumb idea based on

[43:02]
to give a a dumb a dumb idea based on
this so I saw a a Tik Tok of like some
like 19 maybe 1980 Something Honda Civic
that had like never been
drived and it it sold for like a ton of
money because it had like 10 miles on it
or something and honestly I was looking
at I was looking at it and I was like
this is the most beautiful car I've ever
seen so I think one of
the one of the the D you know dumb
appliance company ideas is you create a
new car company no
screens
analog all knobs th% you call it you
call it knobs or something 100% yeah
100% have you seen the light phone this
is this larger Trend that's happening
where like people are like yo I don't
want all the sophistication like I want
the minimum that gets the job done like
all of the there it feels like bloat so
much bloat has happened and I really I
think what this is in response to is the
inflation and what's going on like

[44:01]
inflation and what's going on like
always what this does is there's a
contraction that naturally occurs after
like a growth period And I think that
this is the response like this is where
people are coming from with it where
they're like you I just want if my phone
just did GPS I could text I could call I
could do notes and maybe I can read on
it like I don't want anything else like
I don't want I don't want Instagram I
don't want it tracking me God knows
what's happening with Tik Tok and so I
think that again like to exactly to your
point like a dumb car like a knobs car
right and you just make it so you can
work on it I mean we have this uh we
have this 1980 Chevy square body it's
just like baby blue it's a four-cylinder
and the thing is just like it's the
easiest engine that you could ever work
on right and that thing like if it
breaks we can just fix it just at home
like you don't there's no there's like
there's no computers in it there's none
of that right and I think that there's
this segment of people that are growing
that want that that want these types of
these types of products they're pushing
back against uh uh you know the what's

[45:00]
back against uh uh you know the what's
happening from a modern like just just
the technology that's being built into
this that feels like fluff it doesn't
feel like it's adding value to what the
goal is of people trying to accomplish
with this tool right it's like I just
want my clothes washed like I don't
that's it right like I just want my car
to get me from A to B and I think
there's this whole subset of people and
again I think a lot of the times they
have money so that's why you could sell
and make these kind of Boutique brands
in these spaces so yeah and I think it's
people want to go from point A to point
B but it's also people want these
devices to be sacred so if everything
has a screen on it you're just
constantly being overwhelmed and
distracted so the idea that you can hop
into a
1987 whatever Honda Civic and but it's
pristine and there's not and there's no
knobs you know you don't need Google
Maps you're just like you're going for
like a Sunday drive you know what I mean
like there's there isn't there isn't a
hundred you know Serious XM radio
stations right like there's you only put
in like one channel and it's Jazz yes

[46:00]
in like one channel and it's Jazz yes
you know totally that's it totally
totally you're like intentionally
limiting yourself and like through that
finding like you know peace or whatever
or whatever that that thing is that
we're all searching for and never can
find
so um I I have a question for you how
much would you pay a year to not ever
see
marketing um you're asking the wrong guy
because I'm probably like you like I was
watching only see marketing that you
like uh if you had some way to filter
and I'm saying like a hypothetical I
don't know how you'd actually do this a
year yeah yeah I would go in that I'd go
up to 20 probably of just only seeing to
to choose when I see marketing and the
marketing is filtered for what I really
love I would I would 100% I would pay
money not to see it yeah I think that
that that is a part of the screen thing
we're talking about I'm even thinking
about this like how do I have as few of
screens everywhere like in my space
because it's so much time is spent on it
now and again we work in this digital
space right so like that's why like it's

[47:00]
space right so like that's why like it's
a it's a it's a tool that we can use but
like you can find yourself just so often
being just sucked into this thing and it
happens with every device now so cool
next one next one let's rock let's do it
all right um so print on demand mockup
business right so print on demand for
the people that are uninitiated is
basically they have all these products
and you sell them and then they
manufacture and ship them started out in
the apparel space that's the only reason
I know about it because I spent a lot of
time here in another life and what you
basically could do is like build
thousands of different variations of
Graphics out you could put them on all
these different skews of t-shirts
sweatshirts you know anything and then
this company basically when you sell it
uh you on you know through your website
or whatever they manufacture it and then
they ship it out but it looks like it's
coming from you it's it basically
functions as kind of like a 3pl as well
so the opportunity here so the the print
on demand uh Market side is about 6.8
billion um so it's growing at a like I

[48:00]
billion um so it's growing at a like I
think it's like 18% compounding
year-over-year so growing super quickly
which is crazy when you think about it
the opportunity I think right now for
somebody is uh go and you basically make
mockups of the print on demand products
and people are already doing this
traditionally like a photographer they
would go and they'd shoot you know these
super
aesthetic like basically of whatever of
whatever skew that that they're trying
to sell right and there's all these it
that are the most popular you can
literally go to you know printify or any
of these print on demand sites and sort
by most popular you'll see which of the
items sell most often right so here's
the angle though in the AI AG if I go
and I prompt mid Journey make me an
image you know blah blah blah aesthetic
here's the setting the whole thing but
make them wearing a Gildan 2000 shirt
which is a
skew it's going to know what that is
we've done this because it trained
itself off of all these images that say

[49:00]
itself off of all these images that say
Gildan 2000 in it right so it
understands what that is so there's this
opportunity here I think to basically go
and just like we were talking with the
Cricut idea same strategy Target people
with a print on demand interest you make
them where it's like a a drop pack of
like you know here's a 100 or you know
50 different mockups of the Gildan 2000
shirt but you have every variation and
you can go and find these keywords if
you just do Gildan mockup
right you're going to find all these
variations on like semrush or
ahr um and from that I think you could
build out the same type of company it's
just like an unlimited subscription they
get access to these constantly you're
constantly updating it and just running
it and then as new skews drop or
whatever you just go and you refresh
that and then as the Aesthetics change
you go and you refresh that Etc and
probably the angle that I would think
about this with is like go to something
like Etsy or any of these like you know
these print on demand shops you can find
them all over find which the which are
the bestselling products and the
aesthetic that that product has

[50:00]
aesthetic that that product has
currently right so maybe it's like boho
or whatever right drop that into an AI
and you be like defined how this image
looks it lists out okay here's the
aesthetic whatever and then you're like
okay cool I'm going to go generate all
these mockups now the layer up from this
is then you build a mockup generator so
you have all these images of Gildan
2000s that are in a boho style and
you're like cool like I just built this
graphic that I want to be that to have
go on top of that and you basically have
it where it's like you know you you
you've designated this space where it's
like we're going to you know put that
that image on it it does the overlay so
it looks like it's actually on the shirt
like the whole thing and then you bulk
generate you know we'll say 10 different
variations so it's basically a mockup
generator that is a part of that as well
and I I think that that this is again
another million dollar a year company if
not10 million dollar a year just based
on the market size and how much sales
how much is happening in this space so
can't believe you just gave that one for
free dude I this is all these things I

[51:01]
free dude I this is all these things I
wish I had time to build right like I
sit here and I just like when I can't
sleep and I'm in pure insomnia this is
the things I think about I was just
thinking about the the Epic gardening
and like what I would do this is what I
was thinking about this morning when I
was like laying in bed it's like oh like
I was him this is how I would do this
and it was like it' just be a
programmatic SEO play and then I you
know naturally that's what I spent
portion of this morning looking at is
like all the angles to basically go and
build out just like a massive website to
increase their
volume real quick on that real quick on
that so he's a he's a big YouTuber I
think he might has must have a million
subscribers at this point and I believe
he is name Kevin I think it's Kevin
right Kevin yeah yeah Kevin I think he
started selling seeds different you know
right so rare seeds yeah what would you
do you know T you know what's your
advice to Kevin the only reason I say
this is because someone else might be
like oh I'll I'll go and do that yeah so
I would look at like seeds there's

[52:00]
I would look at like seeds there's
thousands of them right which means
there's millions of keyword variations
for all those different seeds so what's
great when you have a e-commerce website
that has a ton of SKS that you're
selling you can basically mix and match
like all of the different uh products
that you're selling this is how
marketplaces actually work right like if
you look at an Etsy or Amazon they have
millions of landing pages that are
dynamically created based off of the
keywords that they're seeing people
search for within the platform that
they're ranking for on Google Etc so
with AI now you can basically do this
and you can build out these massive
sites when you're just a small like
company right this is actually a
business that my co-founder and I Max
were thinking about building at one
point we ended up going with swell and
that's like you know what we're shipping
on currently but there's this
opportunity to basically approach
Shopify stores that have massive amounts
of listings and you're like yo like
you've got 10,000 SKS uh we're going to
programmatically dynamically spin up a
million different landing pages I'm
going to go and I'm going to do
autoindexing using Google's indexing API
for every key that you have you can do
200 uh calls a day you can have 20

[53:00]
200 uh calls a day you can have 20
different uh accounts or 20 different
projects on a Google Cloud account so uh
right there that's what that's 4,000
submissions a day that you can do to ask
for crawl budget and this can all be
done I mean we built this whole thing
out and we got somebody to pay us like
three grand to do this and then again we
just ended up going in a different
direction just because we saw more
Market poll but with all that said the
the the angle here is you basically take
the same product but you can mix them up
in all these different ways and build
all these landing pages and a lot of the
times what ends up happening is it's the
same products it's the same bestselling
products for XYZ seeds right um we'll
say like daffodils or whatever there's
you know Carnation any any of these
different variations but there's all of
these longtail keywords that are being
searched for that and if you build
landing pages for this like I've seen
this on websites that I've worked on
where it's like we ship 10,000 landing
pages and you know 14 days after
publishing these like just publishing
them like not even doing any indexing we
were accounting for almost 30% % of the
organic traffic that was happening on
the site on a daily basis right so

[54:00]
the site on a daily basis right so
increased it by 30% in 14 days and also
increased the uh organic click volume by
about 10% in 30 or in 14 days and so
that's you know his company great
example of this and you basically just
build out this like massive site and you
turn it into a Marketplace and honestly
what I would probably then do soon as
you have all that search volume you have
all that domain trust Etc then you open
it up as a Marketplace a gardening
marketplace where vendors can come on
and you B basically like charge a
listing fee it's just a classic
Marketplace play and you take a
percentage of whatever the sales are
that they're doing but I think that's
that's the you know if I was in his
shoes like that is what I would do and
that's the path I would follow and again
this is Peak manic insomnia so how I
like you this is exactly how I love
you but anyway hell yeah illiterate and
manic as hell you know it man that's the
only way I know how to live
just gas down I have two modes it's
either it's either I'm like laying flat

[55:01]
either it's either I'm like laying flat
and not doing anything or I'm going as
fast as I can and that's that's how I
like cities that's how I like my life
it's like either the biggest city you've
ever been in or like in the middle of
the woods like you know it's it's it's
just both sides of the the the Spectrum
it's the only place I know how to live
so cool all right um next one Ai and
grants again one of these is stumbled
ACR
upon just looking at uh uh data and so
grants the industry uh Grant management
software the market size is 2.5 billion
insane had no idea this is just like
writing grants and submitting them and
seeing if you got the money back right
um so I looked at the search volume in
relationship so AI Grant finder search
volume for it AI grant writer search
volume for it's not a ton but it's like
growing quickly and I think people are
just realizing this is possible so I
think there's a market to punch in
through here so what this looks like
this is totally a software play an anow

[56:01]
this is totally a software play an anow
software play I'm imagining what it ends
up being is like it's an all-in-one
solution where it's like you put in the
type of your you know information about
your company and then access to all of
the grant you know basically aggregation
websites and then what the AI does is it
goes and it rank Stacks the grant
opportunities against each other based
off of your information it finds the
ones that are most likely for you to get
money off of and you can like Factor
okay what's the size Etc and then you
basically build a writer then in on top
of that so it has your company's
information and then it has what the
grant is asking for you know whatever it
is you need to provide to like from a
proposal standpoint and the AI is
bridging that Gap to create uh you know
to basically get this money for you uh
and I know this space is massive so this
is how most uh most HUD housing is
actually built so a builder will go and
they'll basically write for grant money
so they can get this building you know
basically subsidized for free and and
then 20 years after uh the building has
existed they then own that outright

[57:01]
existed they then own that outright
right but the you know the government
just built this thing that they're
renting for is because they have to hit
these um affordable housing uh uh like
minimums for my understanding again this
isn't where I spend a lot of time this
isn't the space that I'm deeply in but I
had a friend that worked at one of these
companies she was just like this is all
she did was like basically manage a team
that wrote grants for this this Builder
right so anyway
yeah so this idea would actually rip it
especially in in countries that are less
like more socialist than the United
States so% I did a quick uh perplexity
search um I'm here in Canada for the
summer and um like just for students the
Canadian government gives $3.2 billion
do a year uh for Grants and then you
have film and art and you know what I'm
talking about so it's just and no one
not no one but most people don't want to
actually go through the work in filling
a grand so this idea makes makes a lot

[58:03]
a grand so this idea makes makes a lot
of sense to me totally and the
distribution play here is just copy
Jenny AI look at their playbook and
basically that's the distribution
mechanism it's the same thing right do
influencer type stuff uh that levels up
into SEO uh and I mean I've seeing this
more and more and I'm curious your
thoughts on this where I'm seeing
software companies more and more
basically do Partnerships with the
largest influencers in a space that are
currently uh basically shilling some
type of software that's in their
category and then they're like yo we're
going to give you an equity share
whatever five 5% or something and uh
you're you have to you know you're going
to do x amount of posts or whatever just
of course they'll promote this thing
like right at this moment right they're
only getting whatever that percentage
fee is from uh whatever the affiliate
commission and they're like oh if I can
own this company it's a way more
valuable asset right I'm already
promoting this other software that I'm
an affiliate on how do I create this
partnership with it but that's an idea
in itself by way you just you look at
what creators and celebrities are are

[59:00]
what creators and celebrities are are
Shilling naturally Y and you can start
with software and then you just approach
them and be like hey I see your chilling
cap cut um I'm gonna go create a cap cut
competitor for you exactly exactly 100%
I think it's that's the new future is I
think what's going to happen and I think
it's changing what the [ __ ] like where
is Venture going to fit into that like
you're telling me that like I'm going to
write you a check and then you're going
to give 5% of this company away to this
influencer like I think that traditional
VC is going to look at that and be like
what do you mean that's what we're doing
like absolutely not but what that does I
think the leverage has changed within
all of this right like now if you want
to be an excellent VC like you have to
have distribution like it's more
important than ever I'm working with
this uh VC company or this this firm uh
right now we're growing their podcast
email news letter right because they're
like yo we're realizing like this is how
you want to be competitive like we have
to have distribution like we have to
create inbound of the best Founders in
the world right and it's to your I think
you said this on a a different show that

[1:00:01]
you said this on a a different show that
we were that we we recorded but like
people think a16z is a venture company
it's like no they're a media company
that does venture right it's the
opposite it's the way other way around
and I I challenge every person that's
listening to this to think about this
now you're no longer a company that
makes media you're a media company that
makes product right you're no longer a
product company that makes media you're
a media company that makes product and I
think that that is the thing that's
happening and as soon as people realize
that and adopt this that's how they're
creating a Competitive Edge for
themselves when whatever and this works
most effectively in industries that are
not software that are you know the the
grimy like old school dirt under the
fingernails types of businesses why do
you think Paul Graham built Hacker News
100% because he wanted every person that
would be his inbound Target right and he
and they curated it in the beginning
from my understanding like the things
that would go to page like you know top
position it was only the stuff that they
found interesting which naturally over
time attracts the people that they want

[1:01:00]
time attracts the people that they want
to basically write checks to right we
have time for one last idea cool all
right this one is a huge one um and I
don't really
know I again stumbled on this data and I
just find it interesting so it's a
larger Trend that's happening but so
nobody a lot of people don't know this
but I I studed economics in college this
is actually what I'm really interested
in is like big data Trend analysis I
always joke like I'm a practicing econ
IST which is they don't
exist that's called being you know an
entrepreneur doing business um which
again they don't exist uh
so what's happening right now is that
basically all of the states are having
to write these documents for solar uh
wind farms like which geographies in in
the states are the best places to
basically put wind and and like to do
renewable
energy in that in that geography States
so if you go and you search you know
Washington best place for solar wind

[1:02:00]
Washington best place for solar wind
farm Washington or best place for solar
wind farm Oregon all of these public
documents exist documenting okay here's
the here's the places where the wind's
consistent here's the uh energy that can
produce per acre of land that exists
there Etc so I think there's this
opportunity I saw this and immediately
I'm just like okay Gold Mine this is
basically signaling where everybody's
going to build these things and I'm
still working out the numbers I'll
probably actually publish you know all
everything that we're we're because
again this is I find this interesting
this is what I do in free time with all
the free time I have um but the I think
the angle here there's a couple
different angles is basically like some
of these areas like you can get an acre
of land like I we just found one where
it was like $140 right for an acre of
land and that acre of land when you put
wind on it it's in one of these
geographies that they're saying it's
like a high uh a high it's like an
energy dense area for wind and that acre
of land can produce like 1,400 a year

[1:03:00]
of land can produce like 1,400 a year
when you rent out the space when you put
one of these turbines on it you can I
the the payback on this [ __ ] is insane
Greg okay so an acre of land again
imagine it cost you we'll say $1,000
right you can get these turbines uh for
uh for every uh and I'm probably G to
mess up this information so people
correct us but it's going to be close
but um for every megawatt of energy like
turbine that you produce you can get
them for about a million three so you're
into this thing for 1.4 right and you
need about an acre to an acre and a half
per megawatt for my understanding what
that turns into is that uh when you sell
the energy that that turbine can produce
again this is just based off of like
quick Google search stuff we're going to
do like a probably a deeper document on
this whole thing but when you look at
the energy that that can produce it's in
the range of $600,000 per year when
you're selling it on the open market I
don't know what the margins are on any
of this but that's like the amount of
energy that a single turbine can produce
is that number so that means that's true

[1:04:01]
is that number so that means that's true
right that your payback period on this
investment is 2.4 years right I'm over
here and I'm looking at this and I'm
thinking holy [ __ ] [ __ ] like this is
going to be an absolute Gold Rush right
like we think about what happened in you
know Wildcat oil days like it's the same
thing they're defining these areas that
are going to be high value and like this
was happening during that same period
where you had basically geologists were
going and looking at these areas and
saying hey this area is like strong
likelihood oil right like how did Getty
you know make all of his money he used
the data that the geologists were using
and that's like the angle that and so I
think there's a bunch of different plays
here I think there's like an angle where
it's like you build a website that's
aggregating all of these areas they're
like it's specific zip codes a lot of
the times so anytime land like grow you
know just land like raw land comes up in
those areas um it comes up on that site
you're basically SC in all of that
you're aggregating it and you have some
type of email notification I think
that's the software play that's probably

[1:05:00]
that's the software play that's probably
in here I think the other play is you go
and you you know you build basically a
fund go and you buy up these locations
and I mean right now the government's
subsidizing these commercial you know
Pro uh projects like it's like 30%
basically tax credits that you get back
on this [ __ ] so you're telling me I can
you can buy a turbine for it's one you
know whatever 1.3 but you're getting it
for 800k I mean [ __ ] that's a [ __ ]
that's a that's a residential home right
now like that's insane and so the crazy
part about this too is like again if
that payback period is right and please
somebody that knows way more about this
like send me the send us the information
and the data because like I'm you know
obsessed with this right now and I want
to know and again we're going to do all
this research but this is this is like
just the last week of stuff that I've
collected so that payback period is 2.4
years the average lifespan of one of
these turbines is 30 years right so that
means that 20 whatever 27 out of the 30
years that this thing is is exists it's
making you money basically it's printing
600k a year again just using what the

[1:06:01]
600k a year again just using what the
market uh is is paying for that again
there's a margin in there somewhere I'm
just using that that we'll talk to say
that's topl line revenue so if you have
a you have a hundred of these things
right that are running on a on a wind
farm like that I mean you just do the
math right like that's 60 million sorry
yeah that's 60 million yeah like scale
it up to a thousand that's 600 million
scale that up to 10,000 like gets insane
very quickly right and we're not talking
about like massive things and the
government is investing in this there's
Tailwinds behind it the data is public I
think this is like this is a massive
thing that's way above my pay scale but
something that's very interesting that
I'm looking at like you know that's a
40-year Time Horizon type of
deal yeah I I like it the not enough
people are talking about the tax
benefits from it uh there's uh there's a
guy by by the name of aner nagpal he
started carry.com he didn't talk
specifically about when
um but he did talk about solar and I
didn't know if like I don't know if you

[1:07:00]
didn't know if like I don't know if you
know this but there's like
crazy tax benefits if you invest in a
commercial solar project I had no idea
yeah upfront federal tax credit there's
depreciation that offsets federal and
state and you get the income stream from
the project so for example he tweeted
this he was like if you invest a million
dollars in a solo project you get 40%
tax credit up up front so it's l
literally
$400,000 against your tax bill that's
number one then you get to depreciate
the asset with time God so that's a
essentially a he calls it a phantom loss
that you deduct against your taxes so
these projects can be fully depreciated
minus half the tax credit over five
years uh and then you get the income
stream so you know he he he says you
know if you get 5% for 20 years that's
50k a year so he says let's put it all
together for a million doll investment
you get $400,000 tax credit upfront
$800,000 in federal depreciation

[1:08:00]
$800,000 in federal depreciation
$800,000 in state depreciation and then
50,000 a year for 20 years and then I
almost did so I didn't believe it
honestly so I texted like one of the an
entrepreneur who Who develops tons of
these projects he's he's in the space
yeah he's in the space so I was like
there's I just
said I just texted I sent him the link
to that do send a bag I was like cuz I
was I was Su I was sus you know so I was
like what have I been doing not
investing in solar my whole life and
then he said lots of challenges making
for work for W2 employees but if you're
not it's amazing for business owners and
high net worth folks god um lots of
brain damage learning the tax code and
finding dilc in deals but yes it's great
and a great invest investment I mean
that's probably a company they spin out
though right it's like you spin out this
investment arm and also the tax code arm
that's service clients that are
investing in this and they're paying you
a percentage and you have some you know

[1:09:01]
a percentage and you have some you know
whatever some type of fee that's built I
so something I found fascinating is that
last year in 2023 there was 10x the
amount of investment in Wind than there
was in solar interesting even though
solar is cheaper why is that per no idea
but this is just what's happening I
think it's like I so my uh my
girlfriend's from the semiconduction
spase and she's Material Science
engineer she did a bunch of [ __ ]
neuromorphic stuff basically way smarter
than me right she can read and so the
what she said is that the upkeep on
these solar panels is the challenge
because there's breakage that occurs
naturally right it's like a [ __ ]
piece of glass so like hail happens or
you got to clean them off and those
types of things just like a lot of
moving parts that are existing within a
single unit and so when you scale that
up it gets you know you have a lot of
nodes that can go wrong basically now in
contrast when you look like a turbine
it's like yo it's just a spinning big
spinning thing right the challenge is
the manufacturing of them and the
transport like that's the issue I mean I
don't know if you've ever been on a

[1:10:00]
don't know if you've ever been on a
remote Highway and you know whole
section is cut off because one of the
wind blades is taking up both lanes and
you know like that that's something that
is happening right and so I think that
they're figuring this out and the costs
are coming down with this but it's
already cheaper than natural gas and
natural gas it looks like can't go
cheaper so what's going to naturally
happen in the market and solar's still
getting cheaper that's the crazier part
with this like it looks like wind is
kind of that its like you know threshold
of of of decreasing costs but solar
looks like it's can go like further down
um so this transition is going to happen
right like the market is already solving
for that like it's going to be cheaper
than ever before to produce energy
through these materials uh or sorry
through these these uh through wind and
solar now it's just a matter of time
it's just like how can you basically
ride this larger wave that's happening
and again to to your point I don't I
don't even think you have to build these
things just writing checks into this
right like you go and you build these
other businesses and but I mean it's no
brainer right totally the what you just

[1:11:00]
brainer right totally the what you just
laid out it's like of course I'm going
like it's going to win we all know
business right like the thing that we're
using currently and there's something
that's cheaper okay yes right also the
thing that I found super interesting is
like a lot of the states that you
wouldn't think that would be investing
in these Renewables actually are Texas
is the leader right now they're
producing the most renewable energy in
the US and like historically I mean that
is where Oil comes from right like the
oil like you all of the old families
there are all oil families right but
they're investing in this and they're
just looking at I mean it's just it it
just comes down to Dollars and cents
right this is cheaper to do this than it
was also these I think it's very
interesting when you now start to think
about this as the a resource a natural
resource that this uh like traditionally
natural resources when you look at them
it's like you know does it have Timber
does it have mining does it have these
these you know does have water rights
Etc uh and this is now an added natural
resource suddenly these states are
becoming more valuable like they're
natural resources that they have like
you just invented two new categories
like do you get a lot of sun oh do you

[1:12:00]
like do you get a lot of sun oh do you
have a lot of land cool like you just
solar form right like so when you look
at like Northern Nevada as an example
like that's an asset that now suddenly
exists right and again you have an area
where it's like constant wind that's
humming right and access to a grid okay
that's a solar farm and so you have this
natural resource that now has come into
an existence and so I think what enry
whenever this happens or has happened
historically like you see generational
wealth come into existence so yeah
that's that's that's my uh that's my
that's my Spiel the monologue is done
it's beautiful you that the whole thing
was you know I have a tear coming slowly
down my face you're you're an angel
you're the violin somewhere back exactly
somewhere back there if you've if you've
made it this far in the
episode the only the only way we know to
create more episodes is if you subscribe
on YouTube like on YouTube comment on
YouTube we read the comments and uh you
know go check Cody out he's uh a

[1:13:00]
know go check Cody out he's uh a
phenomenal Twitter account Google him
the you stuff will
come it should and on YouTube not if I
don't come up I'm doing it wrong I'm
doing my job wrong and I'm very bad at
that's true but we'll include some links
uh in in the YouTube description anyways
thanks again Cody you're a g love G
thanks for hosting man I always always
enjoy it you always make me think about
it in a different way it's like so
valuable to me so my pleasure I'll see
you later later man later homie
