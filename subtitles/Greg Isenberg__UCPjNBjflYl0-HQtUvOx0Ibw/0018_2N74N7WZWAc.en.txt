another idea that i've been um growing
and hopefully i'll find some founder
that's tackling this and
wants help but is
the idea of us
you know as consumers filling out
a profile for ourselves all of our likes
and dislikes and everything
and proactively opting to share that
with every brand and restaurant and
hotel and airline that we ever come in
contact with because everyone in the
hospitality sector wants to know more
about us and there's a lot of
information that we want everyone to
know about us or at least like the
subset of brands and experiences that we
patronize as consumers and so why isn't
there like a a brand for that you know
where you fill out your preferences you
know i don't like shampoo bottles in my
hotel room so i don't want to waste
plastic every time i stay in a hotel put
that in there and then boom every time
i'm at any participating hotel they have
my profile they don't waste the money on
the shampoo i'm not pissed about it and
everyone wins
this is so
so okay so

[01:01]
so okay so
well for like i might want to go do this
this is brilliant so basically like you
have a central
hub whatever call it uh belsky yeah and
um you log in and it collects up front a
bunch of information about you on all of
your different preferences food
hospitality all of these different
things and then
hospitality industry whatever it is
travel industry
hotels restaurants everything start in a
given city they all pay to then access
this hub it's all it's an api thing you
know we would make an api that interacts
with all their databases for all their
customers right and they just do and
it's hugely valuable for them because
then the first time i go to
joe's bar and grill on the corner they
create the best experience for me they
already know exactly the five things
that i'm gonna want they know the exact
drink i always have a woodford on the
rocks when i come in they already have
it ready for me it's like that amazing
restaurant experience you get when
you've been somewhere a hundred times
and they know you're the usual and they
give you the thing and they know exactly

[02:01]
give you the thing and they know exactly
what you like and they know it's your
birthday and they know you know to give
you a rose because it's your wife's you
know anniversary that week like they do
all that and isn't it funny that like
every brand out there is trying to suck
data out of us that we don't necessarily
want to have shared and i'm suggesting
like let's make a company that gets all
the data we do want shared
