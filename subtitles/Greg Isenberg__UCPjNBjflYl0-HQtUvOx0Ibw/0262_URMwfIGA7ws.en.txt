[00:03]
what a year 2024 is done 2025
incoming and today what are we going to
do today we're going to talk about my
big wins my big losses how much I've
grown on social a wealth breakdown
including all the different stocks and
equities I own some business updates
like how my business is doing um
productivity unlocks that I've had any
insights and learnings we're breaking it
down in this video um and the truth
is I don't know where this video is
going to go I don't know where this pot
is going to go I didn't come super
prepared I just wanted to I wanted it to
be like a conversation that I'm having
with a friend I've got a few ideas on
what we can talk about and it's just

[01:00]
what we can talk about and it's just
going to be me and
you having a conversation about my 2024
year in review and my hope is that by
listening to this uh you will get some
ideas about your year and you it'll get
your creative juices flowing
[Music]
so I'd like to start off by talking
about my big wins so I actually haven't
announced this anywhere but me and my
wife had a
baby yes we had a baby uh she's seven
weeks old um and uh it's it's just
completely changed my perception about
about everything I know all parents say
this um but I'm still processing what
what it all means um but I can tell you
that it's uh it's just yeah it's one of

[02:03]
that it's uh it's just yeah it's one of
the most beautiful things if not the
most beautiful things uh that has
happened in my life um and uh yeah just
having like a a miniu kind of in the
world that you get to
teach um is is so cool um yeah had a
baby looking
for looking for um all the the baby
advice that you can possibly give um um
and and excited to to to join this
adventure so um that was number one uh
the second thing is uh I started working
out consistently I started actually
lifting
consistently and the amount of mental
Clarity that I've gotten from that has
been amazing I've also gained weight um
like I've gained a lot of muscle muscle
weight I think like 15 20 lb something
like that um so I'm bigger which is kind

[03:01]
like that um so I'm bigger which is kind
of weird because when I look in the
mirror I'm like I feel I look more Broad
and and and some honestly I don't even
know if I like the the look um but the
mental
Clarity uh is is unmatched so
um highly recommend highly recommend
lifting and how I got into it I guess is
I got a personal trainer so I got a
personal trainer uh three times a week
you know I have to show up I'm there um
and you know I might reduce my uh my
personal trainer like maybe to once a
week
um now that like I'm in the flow um but
yeah definitely definitely
[Music]
enjoy enjoy just the benefits of of
lifting I actually can't believe it took
me until like 35 to do it
consistently um and then you know the

[04:00]
consistently um and then you know the
last biggest win is I launch I basically
grew this podcast into a serious
platform um actually I'm gonna give one
more uh big one after this but I I I
grew this PL podcast into Year's
platform you know last year going into
2024 there was a very small group of
people who listened to this podcast uh I
switched the name from where it happens
to the startup ideas podcast I really
started focusing on giving away
everything I could uh in terms of value
um I really just wanted people to take
the ideas from the podcast and implement
it and see what happens it was kind of
like a in a lot of ways like a a social
experiment and people took these ideas
they learned you know growth tactics on
how to grow their businesses they took a
lot of the startup ideas and actually
just go went and built in built them and
uh it was a success and and people just
started talking about the Pod and and
and it's

[05:00]
and it's
it's probably one of my biggest wins of
the
year and the last biggest win is I hit a
financial net worth number that has
always been in my head that I thought
that I would never get to but I hit it
and I don't really want to say the
number um that's not the point but I I I
did hit it um and I'll talk more at the
end of like why I hit it um but
basically there was a uh
company that I had stock in and it um
there was liquidity you know I had a
liquidity event um and uh and that was a
good feeling um okay big losses and
lessons
obviously you know not everything is
Rosy um I think one of the biggest ones
is I felt that throughout 2024 I wasn't
working on the most important thing um
for for example I'm one of those people

[06:02]
for for example I'm one of those people
you know a lot of people tell me this
that I'm really like quick on text and
I'm quick on Twitter and I'm quick I'm
quick to answer people um and I don't
think that's a very good thing um I I
find myself you know I could get
distracted by someone sends me a text
message and be like what do you think of
this or um you know some I I just find I
get distracted a little bit too much
um and I and I it's not like I'm
distracted in the sense that I'm going
to go and play fortnite um distracted it
means that some other business text
comes in and then I end up or email
comes in and I end up uh I just end up
in a rabbit hole and all of a sudden
like two hours uh goes by and I'm I'm
I'm just really unable to to get back to
where I I was thinking so you know I'm
I'm spending more time on do not disturb

[07:00]
I'm spending more time on do not disturb
mode
um I I really I really think that it's
it's like the only way to get work done
I'm spending more time with pen and
paper uh I'm starting to write things
down more uh I'm spending more I'm
spending less time in like more hardcore
productivity software uh stuff so less
time in in in places like notion where I
get distracted and more time in places
like Apple notes where I feel more
focused so that that has been a loss
just because I I haven't been able to
get to the goals I've wanting to get to
um just because I've been getting
sidetracked throughout the year quick
break in the Pod to tell you a little
bit about startup Empire so startup
Empire is my private membership where
it's a bunch of people like me like you
who want to build out their startup
ideas now they're looking for content to
help accelerate that they're looking for
for potential co-founders they're

[08:01]
for potential co-founders they're
looking for uh tutorials from people
like me to come in and tell them how do
you do email marketing how do you build
an audience how do you go viral on
Twitter all these different things
that's exactly what startup Empire is
and it's for people who want to start a
startup but are looking for ideas or
it's for people who have a startup but
just they're not seeing the traction uh
that they need so you can check out the
link to Startup empire.co in the
description uh another big loss has been
I put too much trust trust in
2024 uh in certain teammates um without
checks and balances so I'm one of those
people that um you know I look at uh you
know I hear people like Andrew Wilkinson
you know friend of the Pod talking about
how he hires CEOs and he builds these
businesses and he has complete trust you
know and a lot of trust with these
people or you know Warren Buffett talks
a lot a lot of a lot similar to that too

[09:02]
a lot a lot of a lot similar to that too
where uh you know he trusts management
to do the right thing
um I feel like it's trust management or
or trust teammates um but with checks
and balances there needs to be checks
and balances and I didn't include enough
checks and balances in 2024 and I had to
pay the
price uh this is going to sound like
really dumb and I'll admit that this
happened but we had a someone on our
finance team
that was just like putting in not the
right numbers like the numbers were
Incorrect and there
were this was a costly mistake you know
hundreds of thousands of dollars type
mistake
um and it's going to be okay like we're
going to S you know it's fine but like
we figured it out um but um this is a
person who we hired remotely who was

[10:01]
person who we hired remotely who was
literally working a second job she
wasn't doing it
maliciously um but um you need to have
these checks and balances especially in
a remote work environment you need to
have checks and balances big lesson
learn there um and then I'd say the
another big lesson or key learning I
should say is that this year was a less
profitable year than in
uh
2023 and that's okay I mean it's it's a
on one hand like we you know we did a
year in review and like oh my God you
know we made less money this year you
know we pride ourselves in building cash
flowing businesses and
um and that you know we the the reality
is we were less profitable this year um
but it's okay because we are reinvesting
our businesses we investing more of our
cash into uh technology and I'll talk
more about uh that later

[11:03]
more about uh that later
um but
um you know it is a loss like real you
know the truth is it's a loss like we
should be at least 15 to 20% more
profitable every single year uh from a
free cash flow perspective we weren't uh
next year uh we'll do better I could you
know I'm telling myself well you know
we're just reinvesting more of the money
into technology that's true but I think
we can do that while also maintaining
profitability so so right before I
recorded
this I went on Twitter X and
asked recording a year and review
podcast what question do you want me to
answer nothing off
limit so let's let's actually answer off
the cuff some of the questions that you
all
have and uh what's wrck

[12:00]
have and uh what's wrck
Ora or says what are you least happy
about in your current
life I would say I still I'm I've gotten
much better at sleep but I find I still
like wake up a c you know times at night
and I wish I had more deep sleep and I'm
still trying to figure out how to
optimize it I know that sounds like so
trivial but like sleep matters so much
um to me and like I'm you know it sets
the tone for your whole day so having
just like crushing sleep is what I'm
least happy about Eric says what are the
stupidest things you're doing right now
stupidest things I'm doing right now
honestly is probably not just like going
harder um going doubling down um this is
such a good time to be building
businesses I feel like I have so many
unfair
advantages I feel like I'm going fast
but

[13:00]
but
I if I'm being honest with myself I
think I could be going
faster what's the one best idea to have
to grow your business next
year um invest in
technology um just build software around
each of our businesses if you were to
focus on just one thing what would it
be
uh hiring great CEOs and finding
Partners to incubate businesses is with
and is that two things it's it's
basically like finding Partners like I I
the one thing I want to focus on is
finding business partners and and
business partners that I want to work
with not just for one year four years
like for the rest of my my freaking
life what was your primary leverage for
expanding your personal brand this year
by Cody probably X is is the leverage
you know I think I don't know I think
I'm I think that's what you're trying to
ask right

[14:01]
um I used X to to create the flywheel
for everything else around my personal
brand how did that growth impact sales
and revenue I would say without my
personal
brand sales and revenue would be like
40% less so you know millions and
millions of dollars a
year yeah it's actually
crazy many many millions of dollars a
year
um for obvious re Joe Devon for OB says
for obvious reasons no one wants to talk
publicly about hidden techniques to win
at the social media game from Pain
engagement to astroturfing and
engagement pods it's gotten harder to
reach critical mass what percentage of
large accounts got there using these
techniques honestly like I don't even
know what Astro turfing is the
engagement pod stuff I feel like

[15:00]
engagement pod stuff I feel like
it it it's definitely happening but it's
not the it's not the number one reason
why someone
grows um I I don't like this mentality
to be honest
um like yes it's hard to grow
but it's
also I don't even know I honestly I
think it's probably on X specifically
it's probably easier to grow to 100 th Z
to 100,000 followers today
than it was last year at this time um
and that's because the for you page of X
highlights more smaller accounts so just
like for honestly like forget about paid
engagement astr turfing whatever that is
and engagement pods and just like create
really great content that people need in
a format that they want to accept it and
do a lot of and be a reply guy like
reply a lot to people build
relationships um and just like forget

[16:00]
relationships um and just like forget
about just forget about these
things uh what single thing is having
the biggest impact on your Biz
um building media around our
businesses um what's your best return on
investment item like physical item I
mean
MacBook
right given the volume of ideas you've
generated come across process year how
did you keep yourself
focused um I should have been more
focused but uh you know every day the
three things that you know I write down
the three things that I need to get done
today what are the three most important
things how many hours do I I work on
average in 2024 hot take 40 hours a week
you can get a lot of stuff done in 40
hours per
week I don't I honestly
there 99%

[17:03]
there 99%
of my entire career has spent working 40
hours a week of course there's been
times where I work 70 hours a week and
there's some deadline to hit but I think
you can get a ton done in 40 hours per
week she got to be very constrained and
focused
um what is everyone in your industry
completely wrong about right now that
GPT rappers aren't real
businesses did anyone take business
ideas and run with it people are always
taking business ideas from this podcast
and running with it it's absolutely
amazing those are some uh some
interesting some of the interesting
questions uh from from the
Tweet okay let's talk about platform
growth uh
YouTube uh at the end of 2023 I was I
was at 11,000 YouTube subscribers today
we're sitting at at 146,000 subscribers

[18:01]
we're sitting at at 146,000 subscribers
so that's a absolutely insane grow
trajectory I can't I actually cannot
believe it and uh you know the the
Insight here is I talked a little bit
about in the beginning it's just like
knowing who your audience is uh and
really just you know leaning into it I
think another smart thing that we did
was we
um we we got really good at titles and
thumbnails um and I think that helped um
and and the way we did it is we reached
out to people um who are the best in the
game you know like we reached out to uh
you know the people who did you know you
know the guy who did titles and
thumbnails for Mr Beast and was like
would you give us 15 minutes of your
time and you'd be surprised like either
you can you know ask these people to
like you know what do you give give
feedback or just like pay for their time
be like hey how much is 15 minutes going
to cost to give you to give us um a

[19:01]
to cost to give you to give us um a
little bit
of uh Direction on where on where we can
go and and a lot of these people I mean
you can even like here's a hack like go
to and I'm not affiliated with these
people but go to like intro. Co and like
see like what are popular YouTubers on
there and and and just be like there are
YouTubers there that have millions of
subscribers that you can just be like
hey I'll give you $250 or whatever they
cost for for 15 minutes and tell me
everything you need to know about tit I
need to know about titles and
thumbnails so YouTube big lesson there
focus on the
niche um and uh titles and thumbnails
make a big
difference uh X um I Grew From 361,000
followers to 420,000 followers so about
59,000 followers there a lot of people
here know me from from X um

[20:03]
here know me from from X um
I I you know I think you know most of my
followers came from a few tweets um
that's just the reality of of X today
either your your tweets go ballistic or
they go absolutely nowhere um but I
still think it's a a great place to to
gain followers in the business Niche
um and uh you know I my strategy there
is is the same you know I've talked
about it before I have a notes file with
um just key observations I make through
the week on Fridays I'll go through it
I'll make it more into actual tweets
some of them are bad I'll discard those
um and then I'll post the ones that I'm
ready um and I I tried to I Tred to make
my social platforms like a bit more
aligned like I'm I don't want YouTube to
to be the only YouTube and the Pod to be
the only place where I talk about
startup ideas so I started on X to just

[21:01]
startup ideas so I started on X to just
be like okay here's some free startup
ideas you can take and it started to
work um and I think I started to become
known more in 2024 as a guy who gives
startup ideas so that was a huge win on
on the XF front um so not only did I
grow but I think I also kind of changed
positioning and perception there
LinkedIn I went from 82,000 to 149,000
followers that's literally with doing
like no zero work it's just uh you know
copying and pasting my ex tweets and
posting some of them on LinkedIn um
podcast uh again big year for the
podcast uh on audio and Spotify which by
the way you know a lot of people listen
on video definitely go and listen on
audio and SP on Spotify Spotify and
apple if you're you know if if if you
prefer to just like go for Bo and listen
I know I I I I enjoy that too it went

[22:02]
I know I I I I enjoy that too it went
from 360,000 downloads in
2023 to 575,000 downloads so I think it
it it grew but not nearly as much as
YouTube so I'm still trying to figure
out audio I'm still trying to figure it
out and uh I also have like a bunch of
bad reviews on audio like some some mean
reviews so I don't like that that um
I don't I don't know why I have some
mean reviews there but uh you know in
2025 I'd love to get more podcast
downloads um and I'd love to get less
mean reviews and more nice reviews uh my
newsletter went from
72,000 uh Subs to about 120,000 Subs so
huge huge growth there and I finally
cracked the nut with the newsletter uh
so created a bit of a flywheel with you

[23:00]
so created a bit of a flywheel with you
know people I post on X some like free
startup related content then there's a
call to action to go and listen to the
podcast or watch the podcast on YouTube
um and then people watch the podcast on
YouTube mostly um and then there's a
call to action with a lead magnet that
says like hey if you want more of this
stuff go and download XYZ guide so I in
24 I started creating guides that were
lead magnets so uh the that flywheel
worked um and it really started taking
off towards the end of
2024 um I wouldn't be surprised if this
time next year uh the newsletter exceeds
200,000 subscribers I think that's
relatively conservative and and totally
possible quick ad break let me tell you
about a business I invested in it's
called boring marketing.com so a few

[24:00]
called boring marketing.com so a few
years ago I met this group of people
that were some of the best SEO experts
in the world they were behind getting
some of the biggest companies found on
Google and the secret sauce is they've
got a set of technology and AI that
could help you outrank your competition
so for my own businesses I wanted that I
didn't want to have to rely on Mark
Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on
ads to drive customers to my businesses
I wanted to rank high in Google that's
why I like SEO and that's why I use
boring marketing.com and that's why I
invested in it they're so confident in
their approach that they offer a 30-day
Sprint with 100% money back guarantee
who does that nowadays so check it out
highly recommend boring marketing.com
okay we're going to go into the next
section uh it's the wealth breakdown
section I'm going to tell you about some
of the stocks I own stuff like that so
this year my n worth has gone up 38%

[25:01]
this year my n worth has gone up 38%
year-over-year so it
was
probably might have been my biggest yeah
it's my biggest year ever and I you know
a big reason for that as I mentioned is
there was an investment that I made um
years ago that that that you know I I
got liquidity in um and uh also the
stock market ripped like the stock
market absolutely ripped so those the
two reasons uh my net worth in terms of
breakdown it's 75% in stocks 16% in
private Equity um 7% in real estate and
2% in crypto uh so I'll just tell you
some of the stocks that I own this is
not Financial advice do your own
research I'm just sharing if in case
it's just interesting to people
so uh 10% of uh my net worth is in
Berkshire uh Berkshire hathway and and

[26:03]
Berkshire uh Berkshire hathway and and
and the reason there really is you know
I'm doing such high more high-risk Tech
stuff I'm just like what's something
that's like extremely boring um and
that's why it's such a large percentage
of my portfolio uh same is is true with
spy 10% of my
portfolio uh spy is the S&P uh index S&P
500 Index um
Apple 8% Amazon
7% uh Microsoft 6% wcld 5% which is a
ETF for the cloud computing index in my
last year 2023 year interview I talked
about my thesis on this um and it panned
out um if you would have listened to
that
video and uh in that episode and
actually bought wld you would have done
really well
um the thesis at the time was and it's

[27:02]
um the thesis at the time was and it's
so similar thesis is that if you're a
cloud company um you're very
well uh situated to be an AI company so
the thesis was that cloud companies were
going to become AI companies uh which
turned out to be true um in a in a lot
of sense so you know that that's wld
Google 5% I actually trimmed some Google
uh towards the end of 23 shouldn't have
done that I was worried about
um they're losing their search uh you
know advantage and of course I I do
think that they will like they had they
had a monopoly on search so uh and it is
their big money maker but at the same
time like they have so many different
business units now it's such a
conglomerate wh MO is really really
crushing it right now that's part of
that's a part of Google
they've got Android they've got YouTube

[28:00]
they've got Android they've got YouTube
Google Cloud uh again you know that's
that's a part of my thesis and Google
cloud is absolutely on a tear
um so I'm feeling good about Google and
it trades at like 27 times PE or
something like that so I don't think
it's super overpriced uh ping Square
holding is uh bill amman's fund uh he
owns uh uh he actually owns Google he
owns Chipotle you know my thesis there
is basically he's like kind of like a
mini uh Warren Buffett um so I wanted to
place a bet there uh and and see what
happens
[Music]
um yeah and just you
know yeah just yeah place a bet
there uh iwm which is the an index of
the Russell 2000 you know if you look at

[29:03]
the Russell 2000 you know if you look at
the the growth of S&P 500 versus Russell
2000 which is I think it's small cap
stocks under1 billion the S&P 500 has
absolutely destroyed the ADM iwm the
Russell 2000 just pulling it
up you know the just you know for
example year to date the iwm is up
11% where
the
S&P is up
26%
so I actually think that small caps are
going to be they've just been not in
favor but I actually think they will at
some point come back in favor so that's
why I placed the 5% bet in iwm
constellation software consolation
software is another part of like you
know I invested 5% into a you know Bill
amman's

[30:00]
amman's
uh persing Square which kind of operates
similar to Berkshire and constellation
software also operates similar to
Berkshire uh they own vertical SAS
businesses um a bunch of them and you
know it's a 3% allocation there Mark
Leonard is the founder he's like he kind
of looks like uh Rick Rubin he's like a
Canadian Rick Rubin like doesn't do
interviews uh he's like we'll put up a
chart of like how well constellation has
done over like the last 20 years it's
like absolutely insane like gone
up uh let's
see I mean it's up 24,000
per uh all time it's just absolutely
crazy absolutely crazy um so he's a good
steart of capital and uh we'll see you
know give that's a bet other stocks at
8% % fixed income and cash at 3% uh the

[31:01]
8% % fixed income and cash at 3% uh the
pr the private Equity is um is is mostly
in funds and and startup Investments
real estate um I I actually bought a I
bought a new uh apartment for for our
growing family so that's a part there
and crypto uh 2% and that's mostly
Bitcoin um I guess this is a bit of a
loss like I trim my like I rebalance my
portfolio um I'm not one of those people
that is like glued to my phone to see
like what you know house how how my
portfolio is doing at any given time I
think that's a huge distraction but you
know every month or every three months
I'll look into it um and and rebalance
so I was rebalancing crypto as it was
going up huge loss there right um I was
selling Bitcoin you know when it was at
60,000 and 70,000 and 880,000
um but uh that's the way I roll that's

[32:02]
um but uh that's the way I roll that's
the way I roll I keep it I keep it
pretty disciplined I think that a crypto
allocation of 2% is you know is healthy
and also in my private Equity uh
Investments uh you know call it another
two or 3% is in crypto funds there as
well so for all for all the crypto heads
who are like I can't believe you're so
low investment in crypto I think I
probably have a you know five %
allocation in total um which I don't
think is
crazy so that's uh my weth breakdown uh
2024 um and I don't really think I'll
make huge differences in
2025 uh you know maybe just add to those
positions as I get more more
information okay business
updates um lay checkout agency which is
our
uh design agency that builds new

[33:02]
uh design agency that builds new
products uh for for the biggest brands
in the world from you know Shopify to
Nike to Dropbox um had a great year it
had an absolutely great year and I think
we really hit our stride especially as
you know we've we've designed some of
the the biggest AI products um because
people were coming to us and and you
know years ago literally and saying hey
like you know we're Dropbox and you know
we're Cloud you know we're we're looking
for a new AI product that we want to
build a new AI product so we would build
it for them we would design it for them
we would help them to think through a
lot of these things so
um I would say there that um you know it
was a good year like the less in there I
think is uh especially with agencies in
general is like you do need a niche down
I I feel like we found you know our two
niches in 2024 which is uh building new

[34:03]
niches in 2024 which is uh building new
products I call them community- based
products so what is a community based
product it's like we'll we'll basically
go into your community and and build
them a website an app a new product um
that really speaks to that community
that drives revenue and drives word of
mouth and then just AI interfaces like
we've become known as AI interface you
know an AI interface agency and we are
just booked up we are so so booked up um
we'll probably
do
more uh partnering with some of the big
AI companies and and just basically take
some cash and some Equity as a part of
those deals so we did a little bit of
that in
2024 and we'll continue to do that in
2025 and what's really cool about that
is you the cost you know are covered and
then you basically just get upside in

[35:01]
then you basically just get upside in
these you know really really uh fast
growing uh businesses they're not even
startups at this
point and uh and then you just build
that portfolio and and
and I'm very excited about that I don't
think a lot of people I don't think a
lot of people are are doing you know
equity for for services and and we're
very specific on you know there's only a
few in the world that we'll do it with
and they need to be multi-billion dollar
companies but uh I expect to do more of
that okay oh and by the way L lay
checkout agency we actually kind of like
rebranded to LCA um I don't know if it
was a good thing
honestly I don't know if we should have
just kept it late checkout agency or
just call it LCA we did like a whole
rebranding thing effort you know uh it's
definitely fun to Rebrand
um but like did we need to do it does l

[36:01]
um but like did we need to do it does l
checkout agency is that a better name uh
but I'm you know I'm starting to get
used to LCA but I do notice that people
still call us late checkout or late
checkout agency so um I don't
know that's a that's a question mark
That's me being real with you this is me
having that friendto friend
conversation uh who knows there but uh
okay next business update is boring so
boring marketing the end of
2023 we had started to scale it it's
doing millions of dollars a year of
Revenue AI assisted SEO um and it
continues to do that continues to scale
um we're starting to use a lot more
agents and we're not even starting to
use the the the implementation of boring
marketing.com as a lot more agents and a
lot more AI a lot more proprietary
technology uh that uh that we built okay

[37:03]
technology uh that uh that we built okay
so what you know what you're going to
get from Austin 2025 is just more tools
that you can use on your own so you
won't need to
um you won't need to sign up to the
service to
actually to to get the the the the
amazing result of of boring
marketing.com because we we you know
that's was one of the key insights I
guess for 2024 some people have their
own SEO teams or have their own
marketing teams and are just like I just
want to implement myself and it's like
okay great so we're building a we're
unbundling a lot of the product so uh in
early
2025 uh you'll see some some cool stuff
there um we also launch boring ads.com
so boring ads.com
uh
is is crushing it absolutely crushing it
and it's the same idea which is like AI

[38:01]
and it's the same idea which is like AI
assisted um for you know creative and
the best possible ads um because the
reality is um you know a lot meta and a
lot of you know the the the platforms
like they do a good good enough job at
actually managing it but it's like how
do you actually create how do you
actually analyze you know the the best
industry and competitive ads to find
winning creative strategies fast and I
think
um it's just starting to it's really
really starting to pay off and work we
spent a hundred million in ad spend um
we've scaled you know billion dollar
brands in
2024 um this is going to be a Killer
Business uh it already is a killer
business but I wouldn't be surprised if
boring ads uh becomes bigger than boring
marketing and
uh and you'll see the same sort of
approach which is is you know we start
with you know we start with Consulting

[39:00]
with you know we start with Consulting
to figure out the problem then we build
technology to optimize our workflows to
be ahead of everyone else um then we uh
yeah we basically SE we sell that into
our Consulting clients they start
getting really good results Word of
Mouth goes like crazy I mean the word of
mouth of like I'm boring marketing and
boring ads the word of mouth is
absolutely insane like uh I got a note
uh in our slack yesterday that we have
76 booked meetings in the next couple
weeks um just for boring marketing and
I'm sure boring ads probably has more so
uh it feels really good not to have a a
lead problem and just like it feels
really good to have customers have great
experiences and just tell other people
so I think what will happen with boring
ads is again same sort of thing with
boring marketing is we'll unbundle some
of these ad tools that people will be
able to use themselves so so we're ready
doing that stay tuned

[40:01]
doing that stay tuned
um and uh and what's happened is now we
have boring ads boring marketing is now
under a new company called boring
holding so it's essentially we incubated
a holding company
so it's pretty meta we have lay checkout
which is a holding company that owns LCA
owns boring Holdings uh so that's an
interesting thing that's happened here
24 okay business updates and you
probably need a robot you probably need
a robot was a newsletter was a
newsletter that 60,000 people signed up
to to get information about Ai and how
to use it to become a better solo
preneur better an
entrepreneur
and we shut it
down so we shut it down well we shut
down yeah we shut down you probably need
a robot and as is and turned it

[41:02]
a robot and as is and turned it
into uh a bit you know added it to a
business that we already had running
called startup
Empire now what is startup Empire a lot
of you already know what startup Empire
is it's uh a membership that uh people
sign up to who want to accelerate their
ideas who want to build businesses uh
there's a ton of contents there tools
there Community there there um in some
ways it's almost like the deao
membership for this podcast um and you
know there's like million plus dollars a
year in savings and discounts for tools
you get a free school
membership uh which is worth $99 a month
uh and people pay $149 a month to be a
part of
it and it's really designed to like
essentially break even um but for us
like the lay checkout team to
basically you know hire from there buy

[42:01]
basically you know hire from there buy
companies invest companies stay
connected um
and what we basically realized is like
we we like the startup Empire monthly
email was so similar to that you
probably need a robot monthly email it's
like why are we dividing and con
conquering and you know how do you
simplify that uh in a way that you know
just makes sense so we just basically
said okay we're going to we're going to
bring that email into startup Empire um
we're already doing so much of the same
stuff which is like people in startup
Empire are interested in using Ai and
agents to build their
businesses um let's let's bring it in
there so it was a win for the startup
Empire Community um and uh because now
of a sudden they got more content um and
they're getting better emails uh we and
uh and it was a win for like lay
checkout in the sense that dude every

[43:01]
checkout in the sense that dude every
time you add a new company it's just
like another trial that you have to
manage so if we can simplify things
that's something we we really want to
do
[Music]
um
so that is what happened with you
probably need a
robot did it fail I mean it failed as is
um but like
is it succeeding in some form yes like
startup Empire like people are getting
tons of value out of it and uh it's it's
nice to see a live
on design scientist.com
so that is a design
subscription um that people pay monthly
for and they get you know on demand
decks on demand social assets that you
know that sort of thing
um that business did you

[44:01]
um that business did you
know oh I think around 1.3 million in
Revenue um so it has
some staying power like people like the
product but uh that is being evolved
into something else I'm not ready to
talk about what that is going to be um
but uh there's some product Market fit
there um but you know I I think it could
be a lot bigger and uh in the current
setup you know current setup I don't I
don't see it I don't see it getting to
10 million
um and uh and it's like one of those
things where it's like you have to ask
yourself if this gets to $10
million like do I want to be in that
business like do I want to have a
thousand you know eight eight it's not a
thousand clients do I want to have 200
clients I'm managing and the answer is
absolutely not not so um it's a it's a

[45:00]
absolutely not not so um it's a it's a
helpful exercise for people to basically
ask yourself you know if this scales do
I want to be in that business oh if not
what is the business that I want to be
in and that's what that's the current
exercise that we're doing with design
scientists we actually have an offsite
uh Gen 6 to 9th where we're going to be
talking with all the part with all the
partners of L checkout what we're going
to be doing with it um so stay tuned
um so that's the business update um of
of all the businesses and uh overall
super happy with how things are going I
mean these are cash flow they're they're
cash flowing businesses every single day
spinning off cash great teams teams
happy um we don't have like a lead
problem which is really good um it's
just about fine-tuning optimizing and
scaling these businesses to being
businesses that have more Enterprise

[46:00]
businesses that have more Enterprise
Value um less Services driven more AI
driven um working with more cool
companies um and uh and and and looking
to acquire and partner with interesting
entrepreneurs um that's something that
you know boring for example came out of
a 50%
acquisition uh that we made in December
2022 we want to do more of these things
we want to find entrepreneurs to partner
with and build build businesses with um
want to do more of that uh in
2025 uh and uh I I didn't really mention
it but we're also incubating a bunch of
new products um I talked about offer
button.com which is kind of like a
little widget um to help you sell your
your company uh and there's things like
that that we're incubating so we we have
like a little dedicated team that's
incubating a bunch of different products
using AI coding uh using a agents um and

[47:04]
using AI coding uh using a agents um and
it's one of those things where you you
know you put you throw stuff against the
wall and you see what works and you
evolve them into in into something that
you're excited about and that's like
that's what it is that's that's like the
the big learning from running a holding
company is is that is like you you you
throw a lot against the wall you make it
cash flowing uh you evolve it uh into
something that excites you you simplify
wherever you can you know last year
going 2023 going to 2024 I said my main
mission is to
build uh skyscrapers not strip
malls which which what I mean by that is
instead of having like a hundred little
companies how do we have only a few
companies and build it up higher and
higher and that's kind of what we're
doing we're trying to simplify as much
as possible and we're kind of asking
ourselves the hard question questions
around are we excited about these
businesses and if not how do we evolve

[48:01]
businesses and if not how do we evolve
them into something that really gets us
stoed okay moving on to the next section
productivity gains and
productivity uh unlocks 2024 what what's
things I've changed one is uh I started
sipping on yerba
mate okay I got to be honest this is
this is coffee but y mate I try to drink
in the
afternoons um I drink a brand called
Amanda tradition I think it's Amanda
traditional I could include the links in
in the
description and uh I
just I find I sleep better because I'm
not like drinking coffee in the
afternoon um I I get the energy kick
from it it's more sustained um the way I
drink it is over ice with a little bit
of Honey because it's a bit bitter
um can also use maple syrup syrup Shad

[49:00]
um can also use maple syrup syrup Shad
out
Canada and uh and I've been enjoying it
so highly recommend your bam mate number
two uh I started using Apple notes way
more so from 2023 into 2024 I was using
notion for everything our whole business
is run on notion um you know our team
likes it this is not a I'm not hating on
notion but for me I just it's too comp
complicated and Apple notes is like the
bare minimum of what I need and I just
find them extremely more productive with
Apple notes it simplified my thinking
process um so highly recommend just like
simplifying your productivity stack if
you can uh the last thing
is I used I I use an app called
things on my phone and on
on desktop it's a to-do list app it's
just like the most beautiful to-do list

[50:01]
just like the most beautiful to-do list
app I've been able to find um and I've H
honestly have had things since
11 but I haven't really been using it um
I've used more complicated to-do list
apps and in again like you're hear
you're hearing it again it's like
simplification things it's just it's
it's very focused it's a really pretty
app and uh it's been really helpful in
terms of productivity gains for for
24 okay uh another
another kind of another section new
insights and
learnings um I wanted to share a couple
of these with you so there's something I
called the the Friday afternoon test um
I didn't make it up a friend of mine
told me about it uh he basically is a c
CEO of a few hundred million doll uh uh

[51:00]
CEO of a few hundred million doll uh uh
company um and he says he only makes big
decisions on Friday afternoon he says it
feels right when you're tired and ready
for the he says if it feels right when
you're tired and ready for the weekend
it's probably right thought that was
really interesting um
so a lot of the time you make these big
decisions when you're in the moment and
you're really stoked you've got a lot of
coffee in you and you're like this is
amazing let's let's go
um take a second don't make don't make
any impulsive decisions let it like sit
for a bit and when you're tired and
ready uh for the weekend let's say it's
a Friday
afternoon how are you feeling about it
you know are you still really excited
about it are you are you more excited
about it are you less excited about it
um and maybe it doesn't need to be
Friday afternoon for some people some
people could be 6 pm on a Wednesday
right you're like trying to get through

[52:00]
right you're like trying to get through
it but I think the point is have have
that you know weekly reminder Friday
afternoon Wednesday night whatever it is
for
you um and uh and ask yourself you know
is this the big decisions I need to make
this you know this month maybe it's not
a weekly meeting maybe it's a Once once
a month these are the big decisions I
need to make
um am I excited about it
and the same found founder actually gave
me another you know Insight in learning
uh he calls it the day Zero Integrity
test um so he gives he gives someone a
small task with unclear instructions and
then he you know he a he basically sees
if they ask any questions or they just
guess and he tells which what what's
cool about that is it tells you
everything about their future Behavior
so this is for or like when you're
interview you know interviewing someone
or it's their first week on the job uh

[53:01]
or it's their first week on the job uh
just give a small CL task with unclear
instructions and you'll learn a lot
about how someone
works and
uh I guess my last kind of insight and
this is going to be obvious to people
but
like I don't know if I can sleep with
all this like AI agent stuff that's
going on you know
like my insight here is
there's a ton of opportunity right now
and
um some of the biggest opportunities are
are in the kind of the most boring
spaces um so I'm just I'm trying to
strike while the Iron's hot um I think
the iron's going to be hot for at least
2025 maybe even
2026 um but it's a really really
exciting time to be building um and uh
