[00:00]
people ask me all the time Greg if you
were to start a business which one would
you start if you're just trying to get
to 10 to 20K a month and I usually say
start with an email-based business so
start with building a newsletter there
are platforms like
beehive that make it a lot easier to go
from Z to 100,000 subs and then start
monetizing at 10 15 20 30k a month
so I brought on Tyler dank The
Mastermind behind beehive the guy who
was at morning Brew who helped them get
to 3.5 million Subs $75 million
acquisition and basically dumped all his
knowledge into building a platform
called beehive and he just gives us the
sauce around how to actually go and
build an email-based newsletter how we
can actually do it what are the tricks
of the

[01:00]
of the
trade uh and uh he drops a lot of
knowledge this is a master class for
anyone who wants to go and build an
email newsletter or an email-based
business and I hope you enjoy this
[Music]
episode I've been waiting to do this
podcast for such a long long time
because I think that everyone should
start an email newsletter so had to have
Tyler co-founder of beehive to show us
how he went from zero to almost 100,000
subscribers we go almost 100 100 sounds
better but I can't lie because we have
the screen share up and I'm at 90,000
but we'll be at 100 soon exactly
and what I want to do in in this episode
Tyler and tell me if we can do it

[02:00]
Tyler and tell me if we can do it
is if you could tell everyone the sauce
for how to actually go and do this how
to actually grow the list what type you
know how to think about content how to
create a
website how to think about sponsorships
I want people by the end of this episode
to basically know how to actually do
this that they can actually go and sign
up for a beehive and start making
progress do you think we can do this
not only do I think we can do it I would
love to do it because I get so many DMS
every day being like yo how do I grow my
newsletter faster and I've written an
article about like how I got to 10,000
within a few months but a full Deep dive
using all of our features capabilities
Etc with the case study of it worked for
me 0 to 90k in like 14 months um I will
show everything so it'll be doing me a
huge favor as well and if and if you get
a you know before we hop in but if you

[03:00]
a you know before we hop in but if you
are able to build a newsletter of let's
say 90,000 what sort of Revenue on a
monthly basis could you make from from a
newsletter like that yeah I'll give the
well two things one before everyone says
well yes you are the CEO of the company
that's why you've grown so fast
everything that I am going to show in
this video like you can do just as well
as I can like I don't have any Secret
Sauce outside of the fact that I know
which features are coming and how to use
them but we also publicize to use
everything so there's no like
proprietary advantage that I have and
then to answer your question directly
with the caveat again that I have a
full-time job this is not like my main
Revenue stream as a side project I put
five hours a week into between 20 and
$30,000 a
month it's actually a joke and and it's
it's a joke because people
think oh it's just a newsletter you know
but I mean it pays the bills right yeah
it literally pays the bills so um where

[04:03]
it literally pays the bills so um where
do you think makes sense to start yeah I
think we're where we can start is
probably just top of funnel which is
like the website itself because that is
where I drive people to um so let me
jump in here little maybe not everyone
is fully aware but beehive also has like
a full website builder that you can
build your own like fully customizable
website right so the big desk energ is
the name of my newsletter it is a
Windows 98 theme so like it
intentionally kind of looks shitty like
that is the purpose um but you can see
like here's my subscribe page where I
drive a ton of traffic to um so here I
got to got to fix the zoom a so this is
the subscribe page I have an archive
page which is all of my stories the
point here is you can create and spin up
different pages you can jump in here I
can change the it to be I don't know

[05:01]
can change the it to be I don't know
obnoxiously large I can add a subtitle
underneath I can make the subtitle green
and then I can make all of this gray so
thing I'm flexing here more is like this
is a full website builder top of funnel
where I drive traffic too you can make
it your own you can build custom web
pages you can D you can build lead
magnets which we'll get to um but full
website
builder um with that there's a few
things you can do because we're focusing
on acquisition so one thing we actually
launched this past week is this email
capture feature so you can drop a popup
that you can customize when and how and
on what pages you want to have this on
and customize it per page so this is
like one potential email acquisition
strategy and you can drop it per page um
you can even have like logic where if
it's traffic from Facebook or Twitter
it's a different type of popup with
different type of language um so that is
like one thing kind of just show showing

[06:00]
like one thing kind of just show showing
a new feature what I actually think is
Sor interrup free to interrupt interrupt
me at any time I'm just going to start
ripping so what you're showing me
basically is how do you build the most
trap because what you know how are you
what's going to happen is you're going
to be creating content on places like X
and Instagram and Tik Tok over here
you're going to be bringing them to this
website and your goal is to get you know
15 to 20% of people to land on this and
actually put in their email what you're
showing me is interesting for two
reasons one is I mean I've never seen a
website that looks like
this uh like from for a newsletter yeah
let me just pull up like looks I was in
the website builder but like here's a
nice like Safari this is like my live
website um again top of funnel where I
drive traffic and this is for my
newsletter so I guess the other thing
that we'll probably highlight is you
don't need to send an email newsletter
then copy and paste it into WordPress or

[07:01]
then copy and paste it into WordPress or
web flow to like hosted in two different
places when I publish my newsletter it
is also here's the web version of my
most recent newsletter um and we'll get
to what that is in a moment but yes this
is this is my newsletter so it's
simultaneously an email article or a web
article and an email newsletter that's
all published SEO optimize in the same
location that's cool because you know I
um I'll be real with you Tyler I I have
like a bunch of different products I use
like I'll use you know I have a substack
over here and a kit over here and a
framer over here and a web flow over
here and it's it's just a lot of things
to
manage so this is interesting because
it's just like it's all in one place so
okay so the other thing I was going to
mention is you don't realize is how how
actually having those popups like
that'll get your conversion rate from
you know 10% to 12 % you know and having

[08:00]
you know 10% to 12 % you know and having
these little you know Death By A
Thousand Cuts in terms of like getting
people onto your email list is going to
make a difference yeah and I don't want
to over index on like the popup we like
launched that three days ago so I was
excited to show this like new popup
feature that you can have per web page
per traffic Source um but that is not
the secret sauce it's just throwing
pop-ups and annoying every web visitor
it's a part of and that that's how also
I think like while we're at the top of
the podcast a important thing to note is
there is no Silver Bullet from going
from Z to 990,000 in a year it is a
compounding of like eight to 10
different things which will walk through
that all add you know 100 subscribers a
week here 100 subscribers a week here
100 subscribers a week here you build
the base you have referrals you have
other things working in compound and
together you start to grow by 15 to
2,000 Subs per week but there's not like
a single feature um Everyone likes like
the quick and easy like Silver Bullet
that typically doesn't exist so an

[09:01]
that typically doesn't exist so an
important
caveat so yeah this is a great place to
start this is top of funnel as you said
you don't need eight different accounts
for your website and your automations
and your newsletter like beehive does
all of that which is more than just oh
you don't need to log into four
different things it also for data which
gets important down funnel as well like
we attract where subscribers and
visitors come from whether it's X or
LinkedIn or whatever we have all the you
M parameters and then you can track them
for like what they do on your website
down to what links they're clicking in
your email and as you get more
sophisticated as a publisher or
entrepreneur just understanding how the
data fits together and being able to
pull out analysis of who your readers
and customers actually are is
increasingly important and we can get to
there in a bit um the next thing I was
going to show is per subscribe form not
only can you like customize you can see
here like the width the height the
colors the text like you can just like
Chang the the text of everything what I

[10:02]
Chang the the text of everything what I
actually think is the most coolest for
acquisition is up here we have two
different things we have the signup flow
and you can create a custom signup flow
I'll show you what that looks like in
practice but it's essentially like after
someone puts in their email where do
they go and there's like interstital
Steps From a recommendation model of
recommending other newsletters there's a
survey which I'll show you where I
collect data about the new subscriber
and then there's like a final
destination thank you page that they
land on which is kind of like
introducing who I am and what big desk
energy is you can create actually
multiple different signup flows and each
different uh subscribe form and popup
can send you down a different signup
flow so if you had a specific sign up
flow for acquisition on Twitter versus
LinkedIn you can do that um and then to
piggyback that we also you can sync an
automation flow um to each signup form
as well and so we'll get into
automations in a second and automation
is like an automated journey of email
EMS and other steps it can be a simple

[11:01]
EMS and other steps it can be a simple
welcome email or it can be a 15st step
journey of emails with logic and
updating different parameters but
basically where people come in and which
page they land on you can send them to a
different automation um we'll show the
back end of what I how I set this up but
right now I have them going to my
default signup flow and my welcome
series Automation and again you do that
per page so you can have it all be the
same but like my signup page and which
we'll get to in a bit my lead magnet
Pages actually have like an entirely
different
Automation and why should people care
about automations like why does that
matter yeah for a few things um let me
I'll jump over here the we're we're
getting ahead that's fine the welcome
series why someone should care about an
automation so here's what my welcome
automation looks like it's like 10 steps
first is like what most people are used

[12:00]
first is like what most people are used
to receiving which is as soon as you
sign up for a newsletter like what is
this newsletter tell me more about it
here's like my welcome email that
explains exactly what big desk energy is
but you're also you have someone's
attention who just converted and you are
top of mind for them it's a perfect
place to push them or incentivize them
to take an action so I'm kind of
introducing them to the newsletter the
playlist asking them to follow the
playlist and then I actually asked them
to refer someone else so we'll get to
referral program in a bit as well but I
actually make the ask in my immediate um
welcome email because they've already
made the decision like this looks
interesting to me I'm going to sign up
for it while I have their attention can
I be like is there anyone else who you
think would be interested this in this
as well and I'll actually reward you and
incentivize you to refer a friend um so
that's a bit of like the referral
program which we'll get to but this is
like one step of this like automated
Journey that I've set up as part of like
my welcome series but I'm sure I mean
you do a welcome series as well I'm sure

[13:00]
you do a welcome series as well I'm sure
there's like plenty of different reasons
why you would want to send an automated
email as soon as someone gives you their
email yeah I mean the
most I think it's it's two things one is
you want to build instant trust so by
the way you putting a a Spotify playlist
is brilliant because like to me i' I've
never seen that before and I wasn't
going to bring it up but we might as
well Flex the uh the playlist while
you're talking ex yeah we might as well
so I think uh it keeps it keeps you top
of mind it also increases trust and it
also just humanizes the person behind
the the newsletter so I think that's
really smart the second thing is if
you're selling
something so let's just say I'm a you
know I'm tweeting a few times a week I'm
trying to build this newsletter I'm
trying to get to a couple thousand Subs
a week I could just you know in my
welcome series it could say you know if
you want to buy one-on-one time with me
here's my intro. co link you know intro.

[14:00]
here's my intro. co link you know intro.
Eisenberg or whatever or um you know
here's a here's a course or here's a SAS
product I've built or just it's an
opportunity to um to increase LTV and
we'll talk about I think we we we'll
talk about that later when we talk about
what are ways to buy subscribers and how
how can we think about uh CAC versus
LTV um but that you know that's why I
think dialing in your welcome series
makes a lot of sense and like you're
looking at it from like the Tactical
what can I do in my ecosystem whether
it's drive conversion or get people
deeper into my funnel I'm just like an
idiot who is doing this as a side
project and so like my like work
playlist which is Big desk energy which
is also where I built the newsletter off
of is like a fun unassuming thing to
push people to and like probably what I
think will get the most traffic out of
this entire video is not my newsletter
but my playlist which you should check
out so let me pull up so I can like turn

[15:01]
out so let me pull up so I can like turn
this into like practice right so here is
my website I drive someone to my website
they sign up we have some security
measures and I don't know if this is
going to work on the first time cool so
this is like what I consider the
Subscribe flow so thanks for subscribing
here are you see sponsored the top four
and then there's a few others three
underneath that are not sponsored which
I'll get into the sponsored ones are
using our Boost network which is how I
passively make money um so for example
Confluence VC if you and so I'm like the
new subscriber in this situation I
toggle this on this looks like
interesting like morning Brew but with
VC stuff so if I'm a new subscriber to
Big desk energy these are my
recommendations someone comes and
toggles on Confluence that also signs
them up for that newsletter Confluence
pays me directly $2 or3 per lead and so
if someone also is interested in study
hall sampler and private lobby that's $6

[16:02]
hall sampler and private lobby that's $6
I just earn like me as in Big desk
energy earn because someone was also
interested in these recommendations and
those are sponsored via our Boost
network and then below the fold you see
CFO Secrets World Builders whatever
these are not sponsored these are like
my genuine recommendations of people and
friends that I follow that I recommend
um because I'm not going to make money
off my own demo I I won't do that um but
that is like step one of like and that
is the Boost network which we'll get
further into but also how a lot of these
newsletters are earning thousands of
dollars per week passively they're
driving new subscribers which is good
for them in their newsletter along the
way one in five people opt in to like a
additional subscription that pays them
two three four dollar per lead um and
then this person's happy because they
are growing without having to get that
subscriber themselves so total Network
effects there this is the first step the
second step of this like this is the
Subscribe flow that I was talking about

[17:01]
Subscribe flow that I was talking about
was this survey and so I collect first
name birthday some people get pissed off
I I care less about that I just want to
know the year more or less so I can have
like basic you know demographic data
what best describes you founder
freelancer student employee primary
skill set engineering design Finance
product so this is my way of this is I
actually think one of the most
underrated steps of the entire thing
when you have a newsletter and you write
about Sports and you have 20,000 people
you know that you have 20,000 people who
like genuinely like sports in one way or
another but you have no idea are they
80% female do they prefer the NBA over
the MLB like you have no real data about
who your audience is which can dictate
one how you monetize and two what
content to create if you know that 80%
of the people who sign up for your
newsletter prefer the NBA and you're
only covering MLS and MLB like it's a
huge missed opportunity on your part so
collecting data about your subscri
subscribers again when they're most

[18:00]
subscribers again when they're most
likely to give you data at the beginning
because you've already converted them
and they are engaged um this is like the
biggest step I think most newsletter
operators Overlook and this is built
natively within beehive as well and so
I'll skip over that and then the final
step is like just like this like welcome
page so it's kind of an extension of the
automation the welcome email but this is
again assuming that not everyone is
going to open my welcome email here's
information thanking them from signing
up I drop three of my most popular
stories and then tell people to
subscribe to the playlist and then you
like drop them to my website can carry
on with your day but the Subscribe flow
that I kind of was talking about over
here that is what that was and you can
customize that Any Which Way cater to
what your main objectives are couple
quick thoughts I think grabbing the
birthday information is really smart
could
you is it possible to send an email on

[19:00]
you is it possible to send an email on
their
birthday so there's something I do
that's actually pretty interesting is
the last thing that I collect is like
what is your goal for the next 12 months
and I have their subscribe date saved
obviously when they signed up so 12
months later I send everyone like this
was your goal 12 months ago did you hit
it and I get I get a crazy amount of
responses of people being like actually
I crushed it or like totally way too
ambitious but this is really cool that
you did that um so that's like a few
things that I do um which you can see in
this so here let me let me jump around
so that was like the Subscribe flow
again big thing one of the bigger
features that we built is you can
customize subscribe flows and
automations for your acquisition source
and per page um this is like the actual
automation so the welcome email I
already showed I wait one day and then
so there's a true false branch which you
can customize however you want basically
I was checking here did they submit that
survey as you saw when I went through
the Subscribe flow like I just canceled
like I didn't submit any information and

[20:01]
like I didn't submit any information and
like a lot of people do just like skip
over it what I typically do here is if
they did not submit that survey I
actually send a follow-up email so on
the left you can see the preview it says
hey it looks like you recently signed up
but it looks like you skipped over the
survey um if you can complete this 30
second survey it can help me help you
potential job opportunities founder
fundraise deal flow IRL meetups and so
much more so I'm basically putting the
value on them of like if you give me
this information it's five questions
takes 20 seconds I know more about you
so I can cater like events and offerings
to better serve you and you might be
wondering how well does that work works
really well I have 22,000 responses to
this survey out of 990,000 subscribers
so about a 30% conversion rate of people
who sign up for my newsletter do end up
completing this survey um
and you can

[21:01]
and you can
see again one thing that I want to
emphasize with VI is like it is like an
all-in-one solution you can do
everything so you don't need to use
MailChimp or type form to create these
forms and then use an API to send it
back to like your database this is like
our survey Builder so first name
birthday what best describes you your
primary skill set number one thing you
want to accomplish in the next 12 months
so I created this natively within
beehive you can add like drop down
multiple Choice like a bunch of
different questions and here's like the
22,000 responses that I've received why
that is important so this is actually
the one thing I'll show that is not
within beehive is like my Media Kit of
like how I monetize so we'll eventually
get the paid acquisition I'm not just
like burning money to grow this
newsletter like I have an income stream
outside of like my salary which is the
newsletter and it's primarily via
sponsorship I sell ads to my newsletter
a few different ways one using bi but
prior to the new feature we launched but

[22:00]
prior to the new feature we launched but
here's like what I'm selling I know the
GE geography of my readers based on the
data that the provides for like location
I know the age because I collect it on
signup I know the gender because I
collect it and then primary role and
primary skill set again like it it's
intentionally looks like a shitty 1998
UI but like this is the information I
collect so when I try to sell
advertisements to other companies I can
say 60% of my readers identify as a
Founder 20% are employees most are in
marketing and product so like I have a
good sense of who my audience is which
makes it easier to sell ads for my
newsletter any thoughts or should we
should we keep on rolling I mean I'm
just I'm just there's a there's a tiar
going down my face because I I I have
140,000 subs and I haven't done this and
now I just feel sad um but I feel sad on
one hand but now I feel happy on the
other end cuz you know now I I'll I'll
go and do this I think um it it makes it

[23:03]
go and do this I think um it it makes it
it's very intuitive that that that you
would want to survey people um the other
thing I really like about it is do you
remember or have you ever read the book
by I think it was near Al hooked yep
yeah huge fan yeah I think one of the
one of the things in the framework of
how do you build products that people
are hooked is
investment and I think the mistake a lot
of people make is
you know when they're building
newsletters is there's no real
investment you know um because people
subscribe to a newsletter and they
passively consume it one of the reasons
why I think your clickthrough rate is so
high your open rate is so high is
because people are investing once they
do the survey to commit to Big Des
energy in some some way so I think that
for what you know for the person
listening
like think about how you how you want

[24:00]
like think about how you how you want
people to invest in this
newsletter and there's like I think a
lot of subtle psychological things that
build up to it like when you land on my
welcome page I'm not upselling you to an
expensive course or like shoving a bunch
of down your throat it's like
actually just follow my my playlist that
I think you might enjoy so like I'm kind
of trying to build some sort of rep with
the new reader of like very unassuming
like just like I'm just a tech guy
building a platform that I will
publicize which is the whole thesis of
the newsletter it's me like building in
public um here's some content I think
you'll like and then so when you go to
your email and it's like hey you forgot
to submit this survey and I'm also
framing it in the way of it benefits
them which it does I use this data not
just to sell ads but understand like
what who am I even writing to and like
what type of content would resonate more
with these types of people the fact that
it's 60% Founders per the survey like
all of my content is very like founder
startup Focus for that reason and that's
kind of like the only thing I can really
right about but um it's like

[25:01]
right about but um it's like
reinforcing so then because I started to
of funnel with the website and kind of
showed the Subscribe flow there's like a
few different parts that I can break
down a bit more so we have a
recommendation Network these are the
three uh newsletters that I organically
recommend you can see over 15,000
subscribers I've driven to their
newsletters and you can just jump in and
browse every other newsletter within the
bive EOS system to recommend so I could
typee in product for
example and it will take a half a second
to load and then you have like all these
different product newsletters that you
can see like the description name and I
can add them to my
recommendations inversely I have
probably a hundred or so not all of them
have driven a ton of subscribers and
they are not categorized or organized in
any way but some of them have driven
like a couple hundred if you enough but
these are all of the newsletters it's

[26:00]
these are all of the newsletters it's
like 201 Subs right she is in her
subscribe flow she is organically
promoting big desk energy as a
newsletter and she has driven me 200
subscribers here's 95 down here here's
90 down here so you can kind of see like
the network effects at play and this is
like very passive um but the more you
promote your newslet and we internally
are working on ways to like build these
like hubs of people so they can connect
more easily
but again not a silver bullet but I
probably grow by a couple hundred
subscribers per week from this
collection of um maybe 100 150 other
newsletters in the ecosystem
recommending big desk energy as one of
the newsletters that they recommend um
so basically what you're saying is every
single week you're getting a few hundred
free subscribers that are high quality
basically um that you know if you value

[27:00]
basically um that you know if you value
a subscriber at two to three bucks or
something like that you're getting you
know four to $600 a week of value by
just
existing just existing and this is and
we have like a network and you could see
like the search feature so people who
search startups or Tech or business like
I come up and then I'm obviously pretty
vocal in socials but what we are
building internally is like the the
everyday person who lives in in Nebraska
who wants to connect with other people
who write similar topics like how do we
make it easier for them to build those
hubs so they all recommend each other
because like it gets tiresome to
recommend like more than three four
people like I think most probably
average only recommend two to three or
it's just like a poor experience for the
reader but in aggregate over time like
this has built up over 14 months of me
publishing on the platform I probably
have 150 to 200 newsletters recommending
my newsletter which is like as you said
a few hundred free sub every single week

[28:00]
a few hundred free sub every single week
so that is one way to grow and like
again this is like the the network
effects that take time like this is like
it's almost like the thing about
investing it's like time in Market beats
like timing the market it's like this is
14 months of me publishing and like
building a name for myself on the
platform doesn't happen over overnight
and this isn't like a silver bullet but
it's a free hundred Subs if you wanted
to accelerate what I'm actually one of
the features I am most proud of I showed
in the Subscribe flow the sponsored post
so this is Boost this is like the
growing boost dashboard um so you can
see I put like a good amount of money
but again like because I am earning
Revenue through
advertisements um like it pays for
itself so let me actually show like the
other side of this first if I wanted to
monetize passively via boost I come in
here you can see I've earned like a few
thousand on Boost you can explore offers
so the Boost Marketplace you
I I promise I'm not intentionally first

[29:00]
I I promise I'm not intentionally first
there I don't know why that happened um
but here are different Publishers who
are willing to they have a paid budget
to grow on the Beehive ecosystem so if
you look down here at breaker they have
between 25 and 100,000 subscribers
they've posted frequently 14 hours ago
English here's like the majority of
their demographic they're mostly us
Australia and the UK and they are
willing to pay you $2 per subscriber to
promote breaker and the promote part is
what what I showed earlier which is
after you subscribe to a newsletter like
three things pop up here are the three
recom here are the three newsletters
that I recommend um if breaker is one of
them and you send them a new subscriber
you earn $2 passively here's status $2
$2 for finance W um but you can search
and filter so like let's go highest
payout paid Street performance is paying
$4 per subscriber um um we have actually
quite a few that are paying $4 per

[30:01]
quite a few that are paying $4 per
subscriber and you know not every
newsletter is created equally like maybe
there are subscribers more valuable
because they push people into a funnel
that sells a course or they have a more
Niche audience um and they can earn more
per subscriber um I think I offer about
$22.50 per subscriber but this is like a
network and so what I'm showing boost is
like a little complicated because it is
a two-sided Marketplace within a
platform but there is a side of people
who are looking to monetize and there's
a side of people who are looking to grow
and it's not mutually exclusive but what
I'm looking at here is the D Toc
newsletter right so let me go or let me
go here if I want to earn $4 per
subscriber I can apply to paid Street
performance I think I'd be a great
partner I don't know how that is any
tips on I'm sure a bunch of
people uh are applying to let's say pay
performance like how do you like what do
you write so that you actually get them
to accept it so one probably something

[31:01]
to accept it so one probably something
better than I just typed in in 5 seconds
on the spot right like I think if
especially for the higher paid per
subscriber you definitely want to
specify why you actually are a good fit
you can also so here there's also
Geographic restrictions So Paid Street
performance you can see here you're
they're you're only getting paid for
subscribers that you send who are in the
US and you can see here is US and Canada
so on the gross side if you know that
like a subscriber in Europe is less
valuable to you you can actually just
set your Geographic filter to be only us
and like you're only actually ever
paying for us Subs if they send you subs
from South America Africa Europe you'll
receive them you just don't pay for them
and that's like made clear so yes answer
your question a better description but
here I'll show you the flip side of this
right so let me go
to
[Music]
um well first here I'll show you this is
is my like dashboard so here's everyone

[32:01]
is my like dashboard so here's everyone
that I am paying to promote big desk
energy um you can see how much money
I've spent over here this this evolving
AI insights has sent me 5,200
subscribers you can see the open rate
38% and the acceptance rate is like of
all the subscribers that they sent me
how many were like
accepted we do a few steps of like
verification so like if you send just
like shitty subscribers who never open
never click anything like that you
actually don't pay for them so it's kind
of like running a Facebook ad where you
only actually pay Facebook if that
becomes a customer so if they send you
unengaged subscribers who do not open
your emails at all like you actually
don't pay for them so it's like a
risk-free growth strategy in a way um
nothing is perfect um but we have a
bunch of different models in place to
make sure so I have like I don't know
dozens of Publishers promoting me um and
you can see here here like you can pause
them at any time

[33:00]
them at any time
so this one right here was only giving
me a 20% open rate that was below my
threshold so I just like cut it off like
you can monitor the stats and metrics
you used to have to do that manually we
actually added this feature called autop
pause which basically does that for you
so I've set the threshold to 30% open
rate and so as soon as any of these
newsletters sends me more than a 100
subscribers it'll check frequently is
the average open rate Above This
threshold and if it dips below it it
just cuts it off so you can see here
autop Paws means that they were sending
me they they sent me at one point like
5,000 subscribers The Open rate was only
20% so rather than me having to manually
carve out time out of my week to like
assess and review these it automatically
turns off the worst performing channels
so like this is a full like growth
marketer on steroids just like
constantly working for
you um and then I'll just show you the
application thing so as you can see
I have 155 applications so what you saw

[34:01]
I have 155 applications so what you saw
me do five minutes ago was me applying
to that one newsletter that's paying $4
per lead so I have 150 applications used
to be a total pain in the ass to man
manage one we also have Auto accept
rules but you can add filter so you can
be like the language I only care about
Publishers who are in English majority
is United
States and we can add what Canada in
there number of posts they sent at least
five post so it's not just like new
senders who are
trash engagement so this is their open
rate so let's do average good or
excellent um and then boost quality is
the other thing right so this whole
ecosystem is called boost and we have
like a scoring mechanism to say like
these newsletters send higher quality
subscribers and these newsletters so
boost quality you can do like excellent
good
average um and then with that it should
filter down so here's 28 that qualify
that are that sent more than five posts
that are English in the US Canada whose

[35:00]
that are English in the US Canada whose
engagement is above a 10 to 25% open
rate um boost quality good excellent um
and you can see here and I can like kind
of pick out whichever one you know Tech
finds whoops Tech finds new publisher
slower growth 10 to 25% open rate
excellent boost quality 99% in the US
like I can just go ahead and accept them
by me just hitting accept now every time
that someone signs up for their
newsletter big desk energy now pops up
as like hey you should also subscribe to
that so I I in like one click just added
like a new acquisition source for me to
grow faster gr these are not free I'm
paying $2.50 per lead but I only pay if
they actually open and engage with my
emails yeah and if you you're happy to
pay $2.50 if you make on average $4 for
example right like if you end up I and I
think that's what I want PE people to to
internalize is is that once you are able
to build a machine it's kind of like a

[36:01]
to build a machine it's kind of like a
vending machine where you're able to put
in if you know if you can put in $2.50
and $4 comes
out you're not saying you're basically
saying how much money can I stuff in
this vending machine um in a in a
scalable way right you want to make sure
that you know you're managing all all
all of the stuff and you don't want to
grow too quickly I think that's a
mistake I'm sure you've seen examples
people growing too quickly um and then
their C goes up and and stuff like that
so um but I do think that this is what's
interesting about this whole whole
business and building a business on top
of beehive is is thinking about it
almost like a vending
machine yeah I mean it's it's crazy to
think about like if you know that you
can make money on the back end I put two
to $3,000 of like budget into this like
growth machine every month and I have
155 Publishers who want to promote me
which means when when they go out and

[37:01]
which means when when they go out and
publish on Twitter and Linkedin about
their newsletter every person that they
get in their funnel is then shown like
oh I also recommend big desk energy and
I'm happy to pay $2.50 per lead that
they send me and meanwhile I'm able to
through the dashboards on beehive vet
see the open rate unsubscribe rate
acceptance rate and at any time that a
publisher or newsletter is sending me
lower quality subscribers I can cut them
off at any point and even automate that
process um so it's like an entire growth
Engine with all of like the data and
dashboards that you need and it's just
built on these Network effects and what
I think is like a pretty intuitive UI um
but this is definitely like the most
complicated part of the entire app
because it's like a full two-sided
marketplace network within the platform
that is shown on everyone's individual
website so there's like funnels on
funnels but we do our best just to show
the different types of dashboards and
data to make it as transparent as
possible even down to the fact that
everyone who applies to my newsletter I

[38:00]
everyone who applies to my newsletter I
can see the size growth engagement and
quality um so it's like full transparent
Marketplace so one of we we we've hinted
a few times at lead magnets I think you
actually are the king of lead magnets
your your Tweet threads into sign up for
this that's also my newsletter to get X
is like superb so I guess also do you do
you could probably do it better than I
can do you want to explain what a lead
magnet you know my insight there is
my insight
is on X specifically there was a time
when you can get you can post a tweet
and then your second tweet could be
could be uh if you like this post sign
up to my newsletter and for two three
years that worked like a charm but
things changed um
and the way to get news you know one of
the ways that I've noticed has been
really helpful to get newsletters

[39:00]
really helpful to get newsletters
subscribers is to say okay how can you
package up
value um and that's related to a piece
of com you know a tweet an Instagram
post
whatever and give that away and people
who get that value also get subscribed
to the newsletter that to me in
is one of the best channels for for
growing any
newsletter do you want to explain to the
audience what a lead magnet is it's true
a it's
uh this is a smart audience but it is
worth worth defining a lead magnet is
um it's
a digital
asset um or could be a physical asset
it's an asset that people sign up to
that's related to your main offer so for
example um you know I have a I have a

[40:02]
example um you know I have a I have a
lead magnet that is here's the 30 plus
uh of my favorite startup ideas from the
startup ideas
podcast and people sign up
to that that um that lead magnet and
then in the future I I might send them
an email that says hey I see that you're
the VP product of Facebook we have LCA
that does zero to1 product design for
Google let's say and then I and then we
sell them on that service so it's
basically a way to um and by the way I
wish I had done a survey we actually
have to I I go through it manually like
like a chump like like a peasant I know
like a chump and I know people are
listening to this and expecting more of
me but um yeah I go I go through it like
a
chump and and then reach to and and
that's that's a lead
magnet yeah so great great setup for one

[41:03]
magnet yeah so great great setup for one
they're super effective right I think
you would agree I think you're amazing
at them like lead magnets work extremely
well um so I'll give you an example of
like what I set up as a lead magnet is
like the next leg of the stool of growth
that I work on top of so going back to
our website builder like I said you can
create a custom page for anything um so
this is a totally like custom the zoom
is pretty aggressive so I apologize for
that but again you can build a web page
for whatever I use the Beehive website
builder to create a lead magnet um what
that actually looks like in practice
while you were talking I pulled this up
so here's like a tweet that I put out
this is it's actually I'm pretty proud
of this this was a one of our earlier C
Decks that I created with like very
shitty Graphics right and so I totally
coincidentally did stumble across this
on my computer one day that I have
haven't seen in like two years so I
tweeted holy stumbled across the

[42:01]
tweeted holy stumbled across the
deck I used in 2022 to raise our seed
extension so we raised 2.6 million and
then I realized we didn't raise enough
money so I had to raise more money this
is like the deck I made to like
communicate we needed more money um so
we raised 1.6 million off of this deck
and so I link out to it you can view and
download here so one it's interesting
got 143 likes almost 100,000 views it's
not Greg Eisenberg numbers but it's
decent and so people click through and
here is like the lead magnet I got their
attention top of funnel I posted on
Twitter I also posted it on LinkedIn and
I drive people to this page and it
basically explains the exact same thing
right six months after launching we had
5,000 signups 13 and a half Mr $45
million Cent or 45 million email sent
this is the deck I use to raise money
put in your email here um I also link to
it up here in the resources why that is
cool is like again go back to what I
showed earlier on this subscribe form

[43:00]
showed earlier on this subscribe form
the signup flow is different it's a
different signup flow because I don't
want to shove like recommendations and
boost and down their throat it's
like they came in expecting a lead
magnet so I have a different I'm pretty
sure the signup flow just takes them to
a different landing page that says like
thank you for signing up check your
email you'll have like the seed deck and
then the automation right here is the
seed plus deck lead magnet and so I go
all the way back to jumping around
pretty quickly let's go to automations I
I basically created an automation right
here beehive seed plus deck and it's a
very simple automation someone puts in
their email into that page and I send
them a download also shout out behive
has native downloads so you can just
like download the file directly from the
email itself um but this is like full
funnel what a lead magnet is top of
funnel Twitter LinkedIn I'm like yo this
is super cool here's a c deck anyone
who's interested it's also important to
call out people who are interested in
seeing my C deck are like the IP of

[44:00]
seeing my C deck are like the IP of
people that I want to sign up for my
newsletter right like I'm not just doing
like clickbait things that are like the
NBA is top 10 of all time like sign up
here and I'll send you like my opinions
like that's not the type of audience I'm
looking for I want people who actually
nerd out on like these like investing
decks so I tweet about it they go to my
page that I built native on bei's
website I set up the sign up form to
have a custom automation that sends this
email with an embedded download link
where they click it and they download
the C deck directly to their computer
and then meanwhile the the Assumption
there is like while doing that they also
signed up for my newsletter so I just am
Distributing valuable content and
getting email
subscribers you know what you can do
here uh you could you know once you get
to this point of oh I'm adding 500 a
th000 people a week from this lead
magnet you can go and go to reach out to
VC firms like andreon or or Sequoia and
be like hey do you want to sponsor this

[45:01]
be like hey do you want to sponsor this
because your ICP is also people who are
trying to make better decks right and
you could say for $10,000 a month for
$5,000 a month you know I'll include you
uh you know in this in this uh in this
Automation and then you can also take
some of that money and go
buy more uh subscribers to that lead
magnet yeah 100% right like if I know my
funnel and I know and and I don't have
that large of an audience but if I had a
large enough an audience I'm like hey if
I post this top of funnel thing I'm
going to drive thousands of signups to
it and Andre is interested in getting in
front of those people as well I'm like
hey pay me $10,000 for that I can then
put $10,000 into like paid spend on
Twitter to boost this post get more
people to click through each Andre is
happy because they're getting whatever
their I like they want eyeballs or
Founders clicking through seeing their
logo and whatever I'm happy because I'm
getting subscribers for free that's like
paid for by Andre um so yeah there's a

[46:02]
paid for by Andre um so yeah there's a
lot of like clever ways to continue to
like skin the cat I guess in terms of
ways to boost growth um last two things
I'll show quickly is the referral
program so I built the referral program
back at morning brew that worked
extremely well it led to over a million
subscribers for morning Brew today it's
I think admittedly Works a bit less but
the thinking is everything we I've
talked to talked about to date has has
been how do we get more people in the
funnel the referral program is these
people are already in your funnel like
they are reading your newsletter how and
they like your content they're opening
it how do you get them to then share
with their mom their brother their
co-worker whatever and there's different
ways to do it we have a native referral
program that we built into the platform
you can see I have like you know
approaching a thousand referrals to my
newsletter so it's like you know one to
2% of My overall subscriptions but it's
like free I didn't do a single thing for
it and like the rewards that I offer are
also free so this is me setting up a

[47:01]
also free so this is me setting up a
reward I offer our series B deck it's a
little bit more sensitive so you have to
refer someone to get it um and one
referral and I just have this like silly
image of me that's at the bottom of the
newsletter that I stole from like Mr
Beast I think but basically you refer
one person your coworker the person
sitting next to you and I'll send you an
automated email where you can download
our series spe deck which we raised $33
million for um and then I have another
thing at three pears you get a promo
code to get $10 off merch off of our
store um shout out the store real quick
um kind of cool swag Don't Kill the
Messenger good good t-shirt um again so
but to take a step back neither of these
cost me anything the seed deck like I
already created it's a PDF I send it via
an email like I think morning Brew
popularized sending t-shirts and hats
and swag and mugs which like costs money
and there's fulfillment and what people
don't know about the referral program at
morning bus we had tons of college
interns managing that because people hit

[48:02]
interns managing that because people hit
rewards and then they don't receive
things and it's like loss in USPS and
it's a total pain in the ass to deal
with like physical stuff so my referral
program is a PDF at one which cost a
zero and then it is my Drop Shipping
Store that I use fourth wall shout out
fourth wall I don't own any of this
inventory and I'm actually giving the
reward is $10 off so like I'm like net
net even on it it cost me zero to send
that swag um so that is the referral
program and then you can see and you can
drop this into the newsletter natively
so again the the value of just like
everything allinone integrated like
there's something which I'll show in a
second when you're creating your
newsletter where you could just do back
slash referral program and it will show
this at the bottom of the newsletter
which is it gives the reader a unique
referral code that they can track how
many people they've referred and a
unique like here's your referral
pipeline so you can see like how it's
working and you can like edit how that
looks um so again like super

[49:03]
looks um so again like super
customizable you add digital Goods you
add physical Goods we have like the
Fulfillment where you can actually track
who is actually receiving these
different rewards and it's all like
trackable easy done for you one click
add it to your newsletter so I say that
because everything to date has been top
of funnel getting more subscribers into
my ecosystem this is me just turning
super fans into a growth Channel via
incentives
right and these people these people are
getting
um they're getting the automation too
right so they're getting an email like
what happens if I refer
someone what
happens yeah so when you get an Al so
that's the other thing I I kind of just
skipped over but part of the referral
program setup is like when you say that
here is the reward that you get at one
the second step to
this here's like what you actually

[50:00]
this here's like what you actually
receive so directly in beehive you set
the reward so step one was what is the
reward and at what Milestone which I set
to be one step two is like what's the
email that people receive when they hit
that reward and if it is like a physical
good you might send like a link to
collect like their address so you can
send them something if you're like
manually shipping things because mine is
a digital reward which you can set here
um it's simply the embedded download
link to download my series B deck and
like that's automated right like me as
the operator I'm not like once a week
going through to see who has a referral
and who do I need to send something to
it's like totally
automated um and and so that and real
quick on best practices for the referral
program you've got you know almost
100,000 Subs I noticed you have two
rewards if you're going from zero to
100,000 how you know how many how many
Rewards should you do how do you think
about
that yeah so if you simple is better I

[51:02]
that yeah so if you simple is better I
think anything with rewards you're like
kind of trying to teach a new Behavior
which is I think most people who have
been reading newsletters for a bit
whether it's the skim or morning Brew or
others are kind of familiar about how a
referral program works but you're
basically trying to take someone who
just read your content and move them to
action by copy and pasting a link and
sending it to their friends or
colleagues or whoever so there is like a
learned behavior and the more that you
have to explain like oh we have these 12
different rewards at these different
tiers it gets like very confusing so I
actually stole the one referral thing
from milk Road milk Road they did so
milk Road's like a crypto newsletter
they went from zero to 250,000
subscribers extremely quickly and one of
their secret weapons were that they
talked to 13 crypto experts they said
here's the crypto predictions by the
experts for the year 2023 and it was a
PDF that you could download only if you
had one referral and so I think some
people get greedy and they're like oh I
have super fans like let's make the

[52:01]
have super fans like let's make the
Milestone 10 referrals 10 referrals
requires a lot of work and like it's a
lot like it only counts as a referral if
they actually opt in so you have like
they have to do something the people
you're sending it to and milk Road was
like what's the highest leverage thing
that we know someone would take the bare
minimum amount of effort which is copy
and pasting a link to one other person
and I think milk Road grew by 25 to
30,000 referrals just with that one
Milestone so so I ever since seeing that
as a case study I've been a huge
believer of like get a free digital
product to someone for one referral
because that also teaches them how to
use the referral program and if once
they see how easy it is if you have
something else enticing at two or three
it's like that much easier to convert
them and then you can see see here we
have like physical Goods we don't do the
physical shipping but like we handle
reward Milestones differently if you are
sending physical we have promo code you
can upload 100 onetime use promo codes
to a store and it'll keep track to make
sure that a recipient only receives a

[53:01]
sure that a recipient only receives a
unique code once um so you can't like
share promo codes and then digital is
like a file URL whatever um so that Tak
here here's a crazy
idea um couldn't you do like go let's
say like does does beehive have
a a affiliate
program yes so a great one a great one
actually 50% if you drive anyone to
beehive by the way so if anyone's
listening and wants to join our partner
program it is extremely extremely
competitive 50% you
said we've had someone who has recommend
an Enterprise user that paid $50,000
like all they did was say hey like
you're not happy with the email platform
you're using you should use beehive they
sent one email they made $25,000 UPF
front we pay 50% of anyone you drive to
us it's it's very silly and then we also
have the Beehive beat each Club so each
quarter the top affiliate we send to

[54:00]
quarter the top affiliate we send to
Maui the Bahamas or Aruba um so we have
like a whole a whole network the partner
program is amazing so if anyone's
listening and it's like great at
affiliate sales I guarantee we pay more
than anyone and we'll do the heavy
lifting but that's my my quick plug
there carry on so you can go to a
platform like beehive and and negotiate
a or even sign up and get like a a promo
code and say like the you know the
average promo code is 25% give me 35%
and then you can make it as a
referral uh
carrot
that that is basically like I'll give
you 50% you know 40% off beehive if you
refer three people they're literally
referring people to your newsletter
you're getting subscribers and then
paid uh because you're referring to the
software yeah it's next level growth
marketing but yeah that What the deeper
you I actually kind of think that

[55:00]
you I actually kind of think that
affiliate marketers are like the
greatest marketers cuz they find every
bit of Arbitrage to be able to figure
out like what you just did there was
like four Birds one stone right you're
growing your newsletter faster you're
making a margin on an existing partner
program they're making money they
probably like you more for even just
like associating getting them paid in
the first place there's like four layers
of Genius in what you just said and
someone should definitely do that cool
all right I had to point that out there
no there's a lot of opportunity there
okay so one of the last ones I'll show
is just like email collection on content
um so here's like a sample of my
newsletter I'll quickly quickly Flex the
editor um beautiful text editor you can
go in here um again it it usually looks
like pure white screen mine is like
super styled because of the 9s theme and
then you we also just launched this
where you can
customize the style like directly in the
newsletter build a bunch of different
stuff you can change the typography

[56:02]
stuff you can change the typography
whatever what whatever super
customizable no code needed that's the
plug um down here is like my referral
section that I've created so like this
is what shows in the newsletter so this
is just a continuation of the referral
thing now that I have all these people
in my funnel every newsletter that I
send has this referral section at the
bottom and I can
show um Granite I just made this look
terrible so ignore this style but you
can masquerade as like this person I
scroll down um so what this reader sees
is this here is their unique referral
link so they can go and say hey Mom sign
up for my newsletter goes to the landing
page it has his unique code in the URL
so any if this person and I'm his mom in
this situation signs up like he gets
credit he gets the series B deck and
then he can also just track his progress
right um so this person actually funny
enough already has a referral so here's
like their personal referral page he has

[57:02]
like their personal referral page he has
a referral it shows that he's unlock
this Milestone and he's two away from
getting $10 off so this is just like the
continuation like I kind of showed you
how to set up the referral program this
is like what readers say um and like for
security purposes kind of block out the
email I can't believe I picked someone
who actually had a referral um but yes
this this is how the referral program
works for them this is all handled
totally native again within bive like
you don't have to set this up you add
the rewards we do the rest um and then
so the last thing I wanted to show is
like kind of the simplest but one of the
most
effective is when you go to You're
Building your post this is like my
newsletter web poost that I'm sending
out um Advanced email capture so we have
three options none just means like when
you publish assuming you publish both
email and to the web like people online
can find your URL and click on it popup
means that there's like a popup that can
style like as you're scrolling down the
page like 40% down the page a popup

[58:00]
page like 40% down the page a popup
shows up asking them to sign up to their
newsletter they can dismiss that popup
like it's up to them gated is the most
aggressive it just means like you cannot
read this content unless you're a
subscriber and so I do every I think I
signed up so won't work but all of my
posts are gated so what that means in
practice is if I land on my website and
I want to click how to build in
public it won't work now because I
signed up earlier but here let me
do little Firefox action we're uh we're
rolling with the punches
here where where's Firefox I didn't know
I didn't know you were a Firefox guy I'm
not but when when you have to test a
bunch of things it's because this is
actually a case study of it working well
right like it NOS that I signed up
earlier so it's not email gating so
actually shout out us for doing it
correctly so let's say I'm a a new
visitor I am interested how to build in
public I click on this as I scroll down
it says right here subscribe to read
this post and so I wish I prepared with

[59:03]
this post and so I wish I prepared with
the Tweet but basically what I'll do is
I publish my newsletters every Tuesday
on Monday night like I already know what
I'm going to write about so I hype it up
and I'm like yo I'm writing about this
tomorrow be the first to find it in your
inbox sign up to my newsletter here and
it's just like a subscribe form
typically just to the subscribe page I
publish my newsletter on Tuesday and
then I say I just shared all of the
secrets of how beehive builds in public
and like what it's done for me click
here to read so like very not like click
baity but anyone who's again in my ICP
who's curious about building in public
in startups is like that sounds
interesting I'll click on that so I post
on LinkedIn post on Instagram post on
Twitter they land on Miss page which is
the web version of my newsletter they
scroll down now they're like email gated
right and so like I've already done the
hard part of like I have their attention
they clearly are interested in building
in public in startups they just have to
put in their email it'll sign them up to
my newsletter and then they will be able
to read the rest of the content um but

[1:00:00]
to read the rest of the content um but
like the email gate is like the simplest
and easy thing to do it's just like a
drop down setting on every post and I
have it like set by default um but if
you're good at and which you are as well
just like again it's kind of like the
lead magnet but just top of funnel get
someone's attention sell them on what
value you can provide them um and then
send them to a page where they have to
put in their email yeah it's kind of B
it's kind of like the the the newsletter
send or the post is the lead
magnet yeah exactly and then if you're
sending weekly or daily it's just like
constant Conta you you've already done
the hard part of I've already written
the 1500 words to build this post I've
already published it now I just want to
attract other people who may not have
receive it because they're not a
subscriber Yet to Come click on this
page um and put in their email so it's
like a constant lead magnet that you
don't have to think about because you've
already done the hard part and then so
that's kind of like I guess we'll pause
there like that is my in a nutshell I
say nutshell but I think we've been
recording for an hour the how I have

[1:01:00]
recording for an hour the how I have
grown from zero to 100,000 more or less
in 14 months the the last kicker that
I'll hit on is monetization because like
that is like kind of like what makes the
wheels go right like I can't just like
continue to dump money into this
newsletter if I'm not making money back
so on my website I have this advertise
tab this is a brand new feature that we
launched last week but this is like my
sponsorship storefront and and so this
is publicly available I publish it I
promote it in my newsletter and then
obviously on my website up here in like
the the navbar um but it shows the stats
of my newsletter and this is targeted
for advertisers so I showed the Media
Kit earlier if you want to sponsor my
newsletter you can as an Advertiser if
you are um uh late checkout and you want
to get in front of 90,000 startup
Founders and employees you can book
right here and this is like all fully
integrated within beehive so as a
publisher I'm receiving inbound

[1:02:01]
publisher I'm receiving inbound
opportunities from advertisers who are
booking ad placements it's integrated on
my ad calendar um so I haven't shown
that but we have like a calendar which
kind of shows all the posts that I've
published and allows me so I only post
on Tuesdays but allows me to also say
like I post every Tuesday so I open up
available inventory for advertisers to
book right here right primary
sponsorship the 22nd wide open 29th wide
open the 6th of May wide open so
advertisers can come in they see that
there's available spots they can book it
for $7,000 I get notifications so
beehive has like a built-in notification
thing um you know late checkout once to
sponsor your newsletter you have a
pending booking for $7,000 on April 22nd
I can go through the process collect
assets from you approve invoice get paid
directly and everything goes directly
into like the Beehive wallet which is
um basically just like a bank account of
money that you've made through beehive

[1:03:00]
money that you've made through beehive
um so that is like that's the
do-it-yourself version of the ad network
of like I'm still doing the hard part of
driving traffic to my sponsorship page
to get advertisers to book the other
thing that beehive does is the ad
Network quick question on that does does
beehive take a cut of the sponsorship
Revenue like is there no so we do we
there's other companies in the space
that help you find bookings and if they
do the invoicing in placement they'll
take 5 to 10% of every sponsorship which
like totally misaligned incentives of
like why would I want a book when I can
just send an invoice myself we do a $10
flat rate transaction fee but everything
is fully integrated so you pay $10 to do
the booking but you make all of the the
money from the invoicing yourself and
then the the advantage to doing it
within our ecosystem is you'll receive
notifications of like hey you have an
upcoming place so like don't forget to
put in your newsletter you can do back
slash ads in the editor and it'll

[1:04:01]
slash ads in the editor and it'll
actually pull up the assets that you've
created and you can oneclick add it to
the newsletter and then like reporting
is fully automated as well so for like
the cost of $10 it like puts you fully
into our ecosystem where everything is
kind of done for you versus you having
to do the copy yourself for you having
to do like the inventory management and
the invoicing and the reporting so it's
like a total
simplification um bad timing on my part
part of the the other thing I was going
to say two things one paid subscriptions
I don't have a paid product but through
beehive you can run a paid subscription
where you charge your readers 5 10 $20 a
month or annual we also have one-time
payments we don't take a cut of
subscription revenue and we have the
dashboards and data free trials
discounts everything built in so you can
build like a full subscription product
if you wanted to monetize via content or
community so that's one way to make
money on the platform boost is the other
way to make money on the platform which
is the passive thing that we showed
earlier and then last ads on paid

[1:05:01]
earlier and then last ads on paid
subscriptions are people making money
doing paid subscriptions
like that work a lot yeah yeah yeah yeah
so not me this dashboard is not very
intuitive because I don't have a paid
subscription but we have like dozens and
dozens of users who are making north of
$100,000 a year via paid subscriptions
um we have journalists like Oliver Darcy
who's like making a push for like a
million dollar in Revenue through paid
subscriptions in his first year um we
have dozens of other like real estate
politics news content creators who are
like making you know5 to $10 doar per
reader and making tens if not hundreds
of thousands of dollars per month so
paid subscriptions is like a huge
Revenue stream and it doesn't have to be
all content so like you can build a paid
tier that is like a community upsell and
because beehive is open source in the
sense that we have like I guess open
sources is Inc correct open with like
apis and web hooks you can say as soon
and we have automation set up where as

[1:06:01]
and we have automation set up where as
soon as someone upgrades from free the
paid add them to your slack Community
add them to your Discord Channel and so
you can upsell like an additional piece
of content and an exclusive community
and it's all automated directly with
apis and web hooks through our
automations and so you can like upsell
them on more than just content so yeah
people are making a ton of money on paid
subscriptions and we are one of if not
the only platform in the space that
doesn't take a cut of subscription
Revenue so there's like the 2% fee for
stripe which is like just the cost of
doing business on the internet but like
if you charge $10 a month you make $10
minus the stripe fees we don't take any
cut boost is the second way we already
showed boost which is the passive
Revenue when people sign up for your
newsletter you push them to other people
those subs those newsletters pay you and
then ads is like the third leg of the
stool where you can go direct and so big
desk energy sells direct sponsorship
ship via the sponsorship storefront um
that I just showed off a minute ago or

[1:07:00]
that I just showed off a minute ago or
we have an ad network with Netflix Nike
Roku um HubSpot Etc where basically we
are constantly provisioning ads to
Publishers who are the best fit saying
Nike wants to sponsor your newsletter
they're paying $3 per click you see the
different copy you can choose the copy
that you like the most the day that you
want to run it you add it to your
newsletter in one click and then you get
paid 3 weeks later uh you never had to
speak to a single person at Nike and you
have like a premium Nike sponsorship at
your newsletter paying $34 per click um
that times like the 100 placements or
the 100 campaigns that we have now so
like I'd say we are very flexible and
like my stance as like the founder is I
don't care how you make money I just
want our users to be able to grow as
fast as possible and make as much money
and whether it is subscriptions or boost
or ads and whether we give you ads or
you sell them yourself as long as you
are making money on the platform I'm
happy and I feel like I'm doing my job
we're not going to have enough time to

[1:08:00]
we're not going to have enough time to
cover this but if people want comment
for a whole episode around startup ideas
related
to a newsletter based
business but one thing we didn't really
cover today is how do you know if your
idea for you know building a newsletter
is a good idea right like you
intuitively you know you came from
morning Brew and you had some intuition
that big death energy there was I mean I
guess it's just your personal story um
and what's going through your mind so
maybe there isn't too much to think
about it but I'm just curious how should
people think
about uh their idea for starting a
beehive
newsletter yeah I think It ultimately
depends on what your end goal is right
so even though this video was like an
hour and 50 minutes of like high packed
how to grow as fast as possible like a
growth marketer and make as much money
as you Poss possibly can through Boost
and ads and I think that's kind of like
the perception and Market of what

[1:09:00]
the perception and Market of what
beehive has been built for CU like we
did build these tools from my experience
at morning Brew which like the name of
the game for me at morning Brew was
let's grow as quickly as we possibly can
and beehive is basically my brain
through that experience put into a
platform built for that so like this is
like the highflying growth view of what
this can be but like I don't do big desk
energy to make money it's like not
really a business for me get more
benefit out of being able to send an
email to 90,000 people every Tuesday
about how we're building the company
about my philosophies around startups
and business and growth and monetization
and work life balance and like all of
these different things that I and topics
that I write about and I get more
benefit like I've hosted three founder
masterminds in Costa Rica with like 25
amazing Founders that are now like my
boy is like very close friends and
relationships who are all building like
multi-million dollar companies
and they all came from reading the
newsletter total strangers before that

[1:10:00]
newsletter total strangers before that
so like I'm doing this more for
Community thought leadership and the
value I get out of publicizing the
journey the money is like a nice to have
that pays the bills and I know how to
like pull the levers to to make that
happen so I say that with like some
people want to see a newsletter as a
channel to make a lot of money like I
kind of explained and you can monetize
via subscriptions and ads and boost and
grow super fast like that's great some
people are going to use as top of funnel
for community and courses some people
like you it's like you have an agency
you have other businesses and properties
and you being a thought leader and
someone that people go out of their way
to read and trust is better for your
portfolio of businesses and just like
life Endeavors so I think it's important
to start with like what you're trying to
get out of the newsletter because
there's all different shapes and sizes
of what you can leverage it
for I want to share my screen for a
second yeah I can I've been sharing for
way too long so it's all it's all you
so I met I I'll tell you a little story

[1:11:00]
so I met I I'll tell you a little story
before I share my screen actually so
there's a friend of mine and someone I
used to work with
she um she started a newsletter and
wrote like a couple
newsletters and I thought that they were
amazing and that they would really help
her um build a brand for herself have
this asset get have a be a creative
outlet and really transform her life but
she sto she
stopped and I had coffee with her
recently I said why did you stop and she
just said you know life got in the way
and I know it's something I should be
doing but you know I guess I I didn't
have the time or whatever and I said you
know what the greatest thing I've done
has been one of the greatest things I've
done in my career since Co has been
consistently posting and that means on
on X and it means on a newsletter and
stuff like that and I saidif I were you
I would just pick a a you know a weekly
Cadence and just post something and I

[1:12:02]
Cadence and just post something and I
gave the example of Seth Goden Seth
Goden has been writing a daily blog for
the last like 14 years and some days
Seth Goden has an incredible story that
he he does he shares and some days it's
like a TW
line you know post and it's just a
thought that came into his head but he
ships no matter what he made that
commitment to himself so all I told my
friend was I'd want you to make this
commitment and she actually just texted
me um here I'll share my
screen we might have
to might have to blur out some of this
Rafa I don't know what we we blurring
out but she she just sent a message uh
you know Greg you're so right
consistently you have inspired me she
says the consistent newsletter is really
the foundation to unlocking everything
else because it builds trust engagement
and your brand comp communicating your

[1:13:00]
and your brand comp communicating your
essence and what you're really bringing
to the table to share and she goes and I
think this is actually one of the most
important things she said she says it
was helpful to speak into the fear of
not delivering topnotch content if I
write more
often and then she reminded me today she
said thank you so much for the
encouragement I really appreciate I
really appreciate
it I bring this story up because I think
that a lot of people
fear not starting and not being
consistent and I think that I'm not
saying that everyone should write a
newsletter but I still think I think
that everyone should try and commit to
the process because the upside we've
seen today is pretty big and I was just
curious your thoughts on that I want to
end on that note yeah I mean I've said
it I think even in one of my most recent
newsletters writing weekly and sharing
my thoughts online has probably been the
highest leverage thing that I've done in
my entire career it's opened so many

[1:14:00]
my entire career it's opened so many
doors to Angel Investing meeting other
Founders meeting people who are doing
really cool and are either inspired
by my journey or inspire me by bringing
me into their Journey um and it's just
unlocked more doors that I can explain
in like a 30 second unprompted clip but
it it's been like the hard the highest
Roi thing possible um so I think like in
reflecting kind of on like everything we
ran through I think I just gave like the
crash course of like intense growth
marketing and monetization for like a
high growth newsletter and I feel like
that could be overwhelming for like a
ton of people I get a lot of enjoyment
just I got enjoyment when I wrote to a
thousand people for the first month and
like barely anyone responded but like I
felt productive and I got a lot out of
like getting my thoughts out onto paper
so take what you want out of the the
long video like you don't have to do all
15 things that we ran through you could
choose one or two of them you don't even
have to be like a high grow startup that
puts money or a high growth newsletter
that puts money into acquisition you

[1:15:00]
that puts money into acquisition you
should just focus on kind of like what
is your end goal and some are very
entrepreneurial and startups and like
want to build their business build their
pipeline others just enjoy writing and
sharing content um and I think obviously
I'm very bullish on email as a
medium if people want to get started
with beehive how do they do it I think
we're hooking you up with a a nice promo
code too so they can get a discount um
so I guess looking the comments I'm I
think we're going to give Greg and
Greg's
followers a nice 30% off for the first
three months but we're also the most
affordable platform in the market by far
so call should not be an inhibitor to
using the platform and if you've learned
anything from the video you can make a
lot of money fairly quickly and the my I
didn't hit on this but my North Star for
the business is how many people are
actually making more money through our
platform then they're paying us and like
that I think is like the real value of
the platform if you pay us $79 a month
but you're making $500 a month through
the ad Network and boost like that is
Roi positive to our users and our

[1:16:02]
Roi positive to our users and our
ultimate Northstar so a very long-winded
way of answering your question be
hype.com and then use the promo code
that we're going to give Greg to get a
discount beautiful I'll pin that as a
comment in the
YouTube um and uh dude Tyler come back
