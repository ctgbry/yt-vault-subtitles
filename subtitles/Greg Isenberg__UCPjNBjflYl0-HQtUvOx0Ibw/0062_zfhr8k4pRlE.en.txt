[00:00]
i think it's it's going to be work
regardless so just find that the work
that you actually want to spend time on
versus i think if you're young just
chase a bunch of [ __ ] and get in the
reps just like in any sport but then try
to find the the path like for you guys i
think creating content is like so
obvious how good you guys are like you
guys are doing it naturally
[Music]
noah welcome to the show
yeah well it's good to be here guys it's
good to be here noah and i were just
talking before we started recording
before you came on greg about how i had
to bail on this like awesome boat event
that he and appsumo were throwing in new
york and my excuse was that i was
literally having my baby you know during
the like two day window when i like i
think you did that on may 15th like the
kid was my son was born on may 16th like
it was like right the next day but we
were talking about how you know there
are these like trump card excuses of
getting out of things like being
pregnant or like having a baby that you
can basically get out of anything uh and
use it as an excuse and noah said like

[01:01]
use it as an excuse and noah said like
why aren't we just honest about things
and just say like yo i don't want to go
to that
so i don't know what is it greg why why
aren't we just honest as human beings
when we don't want to do things
i think people
don't want to let other people down i
think like making
people generally want to make other
people feel good and like when you let
someone down it doesn't feel good so i
think it's difficult to be honest but
yeah i agree with you i feel like
we should we should all be more honest
i'm trying to be more honest like i
think we uh
like in general when you think about
your calendar like i think this relates
to a lot of things you think about your
calendar and how many like emails in
your inbox you put off replying to just
because you don't want to say no but
really you're just going to say no
you're just delaying it and it's like
someone was just talking to me about
this rich handler is his name he's the
ceo of jeffrey's you know big big
financial institution he was saying like
the reason people don't reply to their

[02:00]
the reason people don't reply to their
emails right away is because they're
delaying the pain of just saying they
don't want to do something and so he's
like i replied right away and i either
say like yes let's do this right now or
no i'm not going to do that
and it's like a much more efficient way
of just getting through the things and i
realized when i thought about it after i
went home when he said it of like yeah
that's totally what my email inbox looks
like the reason i'm not always at inbox
zero is because i have 25 emails sitting
in there that are things where i just
don't want to reply to the person to say
no
do you owe them a reply just hit archive
what do you owe them
yeah i guess that's true step father you
know like
i guess
like i think um
it's just having standard protocols
makes things easier like hey i'm only
focusing on these three things so i'm
not doing extra meetings right now
really really standard makes it easier
it's uh like or i'm phone phobic people
love the phone
yeah like hey i'm just phone phobic like
it's actually a phobia i have
i can't take this this you know
i'm scared i'm scared i

[03:01]
i'm scared i'm scared i
i actually do like the um you know hey
i'm not doing call you know not doing
zoom calls love to do it in real life if
you make it out to new york
um you know type thing because i do just
like i i will meet almost anyone in
person because i just so prefer that um
but man doing zoom calls like my
threshold now is so high relative to
what it was a year ago um
anyway i feel like we're on a long
tangent no but i think the thing you're
calling out is a really great point and
just being honest with yourself and like
how do you get more alignment in your
life
right and the alignment what's
interesting is like when you had a baby
it was easy to be like i really don't
want to do this but you're using the
baby as a nice buffer to that or i'm you
know pregnant or covet or whatever these
types of excuses are covets pretty
they're all legit but i it's like what
if you could do if you could just live
honestly like i have two friends
recently like i don't want to go to
these weddings of my other friend how do
i say no and i was like you say no
but i think it's also helpful if you're
like hey i really want to go i you don't
want to lie to him hey your wedding
sounds promising i just have a lot going
on

[04:01]
on
you can't make it
yeah i do think that like you you
brought it up a couple minutes ago of
like hey these are the three things i'm
focusing on right now so i can't take
this on is a great way of thinking about
it i mean it all ties into like
people feel these inherent like sunk
costs almost um to going and doing
things like oh you know i already i've
always thought about it with like oh i
booked flights i i had this last year
like i booked flights to go to this
wedding and then the wedding was coming
up and i was swamped with other stuff
and i was literally dreading it but in
my mind i was like oh man i paid for the
flights already so i gotta go and the
reality was i was just gonna go make
myself incrementally more miserable by
going to this thing and so then i ended
up bailing because i was like oh it's
actually just a sunk cost i need to
think about this clearly and rationally
and just pass on it um but we have all
these like embedded reasons for doing
things um that i do think if you just
reset yourself you can you can step away
from i think a lot of it is energy
like kind of i think greg was kind of
highlighting it a bit which is just like

[05:00]
highlighting it a bit which is just like
is this increasing your energy and
clarity or is it decreasing and so a lot
of times in my week like i was meeting
with our head of marketing at appsumo
yesterday and i was like who do you i'm
not going to call i'm not going to call
it people but i was like who do you meet
with during the week that you're like
excited about and you're like wow i have
more energy and like i feel productive
and who do you not and there's probably
either the meeting is bad or the person
is bad
and so on my sundays and like when i do
calendaring on fridays and sundays i'm
like what am i really looking forward to
and is
is there stuff that i'm just not looking
forward to and there's probably some
connection that i don't want to do it
and like doing that maybe in all regards
yeah i love that it's like who

dot com slash room to get started today
you know i used to do that with my
calendar this is like this is one of my
favorite frameworks actually i um i
started energy color coding my calendar
in real time after the meetings and it
completely changed i mean this is like
six months ago greg it was actually as a
result of a conversation i had with you
about like how my calendar was too full
um and so i literally would like at the
end of a day go to my calendar and color
code things green when i felt like they
created energy for me um kind of like

[09:00]
created energy for me um kind of like
orange if it was neutral and then red if
it was like um you know i felt drained
after doing it and it forced me to
visually see how many of the things i
was taking on during the week were
draining energy from me and so i
basically just said okay i'm going to
eliminate or delegate all of those and
that was the first step and it was like
okay now my calendar looks all green and
neutral and then the next step was like
what can you kind of trim out of the
neutral and make it mostly green and now
i feel like my calendar is mostly green
and it completely repositioned it just
by like having this visual cue and
signal
dude i love that
i've been trying for the past two years
like a week in review at the end of the
week
so i have like a survey that i give
myself in google forms and you can kind
of see trends
for like was it for me it's really
related to appsumo it's like was i
consistent how was my leadership did i
move the business forward
and then the last thing is like were
there any blockers from this week or
meetings that sucked that i want to
adjust and it really does make most of
the weeks get
subsequently better i feel like feedback
and like regular feedback just in all

[10:01]
and like regular feedback just in all
aspects is how we improve life that's a
pretty cool idea actually just like for
a business so you know you have um
you know you have like a do you wear a
whoop band or like any of the healthy
tracker ring at night when i go to sleep
yes me too so like
the beauty of those things is that it
gives you like a trend line over time
right like you know you can see
what it looks like you know what your
different metrics rem sleep whatever
over over longer periods it becomes
really interesting um
it's kind of a cool idea to like take
something and apply that to you know
your your kind of personal uh
productivity energy etc like what you're
jerry-rigging um you know and like
jangly putting together with a google
form or with a google server and sending
to yourself there's probably a business
to just be built around that like the
personal energy survey or something um
where you create a nice ui ux and
basically overlay it on top of data that
is effectively a google form that you
get every week
dude i love that i i think that's great
here's the idea because you know

[11:00]
here's the idea because you know
sometimes with these things like we get
baseline information and we're like okay
if i go to sleep early it's good if i
don't drink it's good it's like there's
not really that much deltas of change
it's more just like some level baseline
to move forward so i think it's just
like how do you get more consistent
iterations and improvement i think i
think the idea is like have you seen
those emails where at the bottom of the
email it's like hey
yeah
how was this good bad
okay
yeah and so it's basically after the
email after the meeting you get an email
it starts like getting data points was a
good bad whatever and it starts adding
those data points until it knows enough
about you that it's just like hey you
have a meeting coming up in an hour
what's that hell and you like
hate meeting with sahil
or you or you know
so we're gonna go ahead and like cancel
that or
you know you love meeting with sahel
we're gonna when you're going to
schedule it it tells you to cancel it
actually yeah just like don't schedule
this because we already know i actually
think there's something really
interesting to be built like a simple
tool around this because like they all
exist and there's like a massive

[12:00]
exist and there's like a massive
multi-billion dollar industry around
like app tracking stuff on your computer
or on your phone that like tells you
there's something called like rise
productivity i think it's called that's
like a computer app that like yeah
actually i got it on appsumo noah um it
was like one of your deals of the week
um at one point like last year and um it
like tells you you know it gives you all
these metrics and data at the end of
every week of like what apps you spent
your time on where you were productive
where you got drained et cetera but
doing that but for like your personal
energy and um sort of like using it as
like a week in review type template that
gives you data behind all of that and
maybe it's self-reported but it's still
you know actual data that tracks over
time and putting a ui ux on top of it i
feel like it would actually be pretty
productive
kind of like it yeah
let's do it yeah uh so
well i want to come back to that
actually because there's something
interesting to be built there so we will
talk about that but noah you know it's
been super excited to have you on it's

[13:00]
been super excited to have you on it's
it's taken
longer than we should have um to uh to
do this recording so i'm happy that
we're finally getting to do it um and a
handful of stuff that we wanted to just
dive into with you but i thought maybe
we could just set the stage for a little
bit with like
hearing a little bit more about who you
are in your background because i also
just personally feel like i don't know
enough about your background and and um
you know some of what has gotten you to
where you are today and obviously you're
a you know amazing entrepreneur and
you're also an amazing creator and so i
want to dig in to uh dig into a bunch of
that but would love to just hear you
know what has kind of like created your
map of reality um over your life like
where have you kind of come from and and
how did you end up where you are today
dude i have no idea
i was on a date like a year ago and
she's like who are you
i was like what
i was like could i just order my dinner
at chick-fil-a and call it a night like
it was a fancy date man yeah your sports
are the best that's why i'm probably
still single at 40.
i just i just checked my gmail i just

[14:01]
i just i just checked my gmail i just
put your name in my gmail and i think i
slept in your bed
dude awesome
we we should have opened with that yeah
you guys having a sauna party 2016
matt galligan was like hey like my buddy
has his apartment up for rent or
something like that and i think we might
have stayed at your place
dude awesome i love hosting i love like
i'm uh well that's a whole money thing
we can talk about
um they're short of who i am i don't
know man like i'm trying to figure it
out uh i try to follow
you know i try to follow what what
really
like what i'm listening to my body you
could say like what really is calling me
i definitely get distracted with shiny
objects but i think my my career and my
life has been like what feels right
uh and then trying just a [ __ ] ton of
things out and most of them not working
and some of them working and then really
surrounding myself with just like epic
people
i've been very i think some of my talent
is talent i'm just like a talent like
you know those metal detectors for

[15:00]
you know those metal detectors for
pennies and nickels like i kind of like
that a little bit with people um and
professionally yeah uh i was born into
like tech i don't know how my brother
became my brother's a doctor but i was
born like a few miles from apple and i
love tech i love the computer stuff
i love like all this internet stuff i
love the app stuff i love the crypto
stuff i just think it's it's really
interesting how it's evolving society
and then appsumo you know professionally
was
a culmination of just a lot of rejection
uh a lot of soul searching a lot of like
experiments
and then finally in trying a lot of
companies out to finally figuring out
how do i work with people i really like
where i don't feel so insecure
working on something i really like was
promoting things and talking about these
things
um
you know and being able to live the kind
of lifestyle i want and so that that's
coming together and creating content
i've been doing blogging for a long time
uh more hardcore lately on youtube for
the past little about two and a half
years specifically around like
you know
starting a business
making money

[16:00]
making money
overcoming fear
so you you were born and raised in
silicon
yeah valley
yeah my and i was kind which was i feel
very lucky because my dad is a sales guy
he was like from israel he didn't know
english he just started selling things
and then my stepfather's an engineer so
it's just really cool to
to get that mix of personalities and
then i was i was just it's all luck it's
all i was very mostly lucky
um to be born there and then all of my
friends are in silicon valley are just
like extreme high achievers like my
lowest friend
is like a senior engineer at fitbit
like that's the worst off person i know
and like not bragging i'm just like i
was lucky to be born with that type of
you know uh expectations i think
something about success is people like
it's a network it's not where it's not
network it's who are who's around you
and what's their ambition levels
and i just had really high ambition
people around me and it's really
inspiring and there's a balance of that
of you have to figure out your own
ambition like do i want this or am i
just competitive or comparative but that

[17:00]
just competitive or comparative but that
was inspiring to be like oh cool there's
a lot of things i can do out there so do
you feel like i mean you mentioned the
ambition point i've never really thought
about it much but do you feel like
you're kind everyone always uses that
phrase of like you know you're the
average of the five people you spend
your most time with do you feel like
that's about ambition that like you're
really the average of their ambition
level like if you're around a bunch of
people and you come up around a bunch of
people who have tremendous ambition
it's hard not to have that same level of
ambition and you know and spend time
with them
i think it you know i think it sets the
bar of what what things could be like if
you don't know what x if you don't know
what excellent food tastes like like how
do you know what excellence looks like
so i had a chance to be like hey i
worked around zuckerberg i worked around
you know mark pincus and like you know
peter thiel and like the elite
and they're elite for a reason because
they're they're excellent and then
i think there's also some just internal
motivation like i'm just naturally
moving i'm naturally active and that's

[18:01]
moving i'm naturally active and that's
that's a little bit just i was born with
i think people want to imitate like the
people that
generally speaking like
you know if you're
i think you know that's why okay i was
reading a study late
late late a few nights ago about how
people who
have friends who are
overweight generally
eat more than the average person
um
and and and then they become overweight
and i think it's
it speaks to this point which is like
you probably grew up with a lot of
people who
were exceptional or tried to be
exceptional
and because of that like
you know
it might it might just
you know it might have been in you but
it also might have just been
yeah yeah manifestation yeah
manifestation yeah yeah i do think
parallel oh sorry the real example of
that is like i'm in a text group called
like single guys in austin
and it's like all these guys it's like
my three other best friends and it's

[19:00]
my three other best friends and it's
always like dude i'm out of this date
look at this check this out like you
know it's a safe space for for a single
gentleman
but then one day i'm like dude if i'm
just surrounded by these bozos
talking about hooking up all the time
like of course that's why i'm single
you know and it's not that necessary
being single is a bad thing but it's
just like if you're around a bunch of
healthy people to greg's point and like
you'll probably be more healthy
and um i think people are probably
aren't as intentional as i i'm not a
brag i think i'm very intentional who i
surround myself with
and
besides these bozo single guys who i
love i'm around a lot of very like
intentional people not just in making
money it's not only about that it's just
like an integrity and follow-through
character
um and just like they inspire me in
different capacities and i have there's
it's honestly kind of like amazing it's
probably the best parts of my life
it's it's sort of um
it's interesting like i have a few
thoughts on this so one is that these
kind of things cut both ways um you know
like i often think about uh
i have friends who

[20:01]
i have friends who
don't make a lot of money totally fine
you know they're successful but don't
make a lot of money and yet they they
roll in a circle of people who do make a
lot of money and who spend a lot of
money and those friends of mine um that
role in that circle then
are constantly in trouble and stressed
because they basically are like living
at the means of somebody who spends a
lot and who makes a ton of money when
they don't have that and it's like
they've kind of grown accustomed to
living in this way by just like i don't
know
like osmosis or something like that
and it creates a lot of issues for them
as a result um because you do kind of
like naturally blend into your
surroundings
for better or for worse um so i've often
thought that was it was it's just like
an interesting fact of humans that we
tend to just like chameleon into our
surroundings one way or another
yeah
is it can you tell us a little bit about
like the insight with appsumo like what
actually led to
the business creation i mean you

[21:01]
the business creation i mean you
mentioned it as kind of like failure
rejection things that had gone wrong and
led to it but like the actual insight
around what it is um
what was it that sparked that for you
how did you decide to go build it and
you know then i kind of would love to
just hear a little bit more about the
business today
sure
um
i think it was it was a culmination of
all of my failure
package did in one day what was your
failure like you said you know you say
that but like what was the failure i
mean the failure was like intel 14
months facebook nine months mint nine
kickflip ten months which was funded by
naval ravicon and then i did gambit
which did really well and then facebook
sued us and we got banned by another
company
and then it was just like i'm 30 years
old and i'm just like wow i
this is it's not bad i thought i'd be
like super rich and like i don't know i
thought you'd just get money magically
in your bank account
and so it doesn't happen that way or i
thought i'd have a wife that should just
like show up at the house they don't
they don't you have to actually go out
and make it happen

[22:00]
and make it happen
um and so i think all those different
experiences in my life of what i didn't
enjoy and what made me feel good and bad
led to be like all right well i really
want to work with people that i don't
know are humble and i felt facebook in
silicon valley was
just like this level of arrogance i
didn't enjoy being around there's a
little confidence and intelligence but
the arrogance is too much
so i knew i wanted to be with great
people which i didn't really experience
i knew i liked promoting things i think
it's like for all of us there's some
skill we enjoy and we're doing for free
and so just find the thing you want to
do for free and make that your job
there's debates that i just found that
for myself where i'm going to be
promoting things like whether there's
appsumo or not like i'm still doing this
youtube thing i'm still doing my
newsletter at you know okdor.com i'm
doing these things
and so i was like i want to keep
promoting things and then through some
of these businesses i realized like you
talked about this one idea sahil earlier
you said we should help people track uh
their their work stuff
and i think especially now during a
recession this is where a lot of this is
where like some of the best innovations
gonna come out of i'm really excited to
see who's gonna be creative here like
who's gonna win someone's gonna win

[23:00]
who's gonna win someone's gonna win
winning is all subjective but who's
gonna come out and create something
special that they'll enjoy and so
uh i think for me i was like man i like
promoting i don't like doing this
payment stuff
uh i like software and i love deals
and i saw like mac heist
which was around for a br do you guys
remember that yep oh wow i saw matt
kaise and i was like oh that's kind of
cool that like enables you to get people
customers promote cool stuff
i don't have there's not a lot of
pressure
and i to be candid and i think most
people don't quit your day jobs when
you're starting a side hustle and be
clear on your vision be clear on your
fan i like calling it a fantasy like
what if you could live a fantasy like
how cool is that
and my fantasy was like make a few
thousand bucks just doing it
like all these things i had bad partners
all this different stuff it's like just
doing it the way i wanted it wasn't like
the aspiration
and this is something that someone
called out
that i thought was interesting most
aspiration of billionaires or
millionaires or multi-millionaires was
not always that case like mark didn't
start facebook i'm a big billionaire i

[24:01]
start facebook i'm a big billionaire i
was like man let me see if i can meet
some chicks online if we're honest right
i worked for him so i know that stuff
it wasn't like i'm gonna go create this
world eventually it evolved so your
vision evolves but i think being clear
on what you want in your fantasy and
vision was really helpful so for me it
was like can i do this thing and make a
few thousand bucks promoting and getting
basically deals i want on products
and that's more or less how it was for
the first year
and and i think the thing i've got to
highlight for people out there uh for
starting businesses specifically and
that's what i'm known a little bit for
it's kind of twofold one i just picked a
really great industry that's not because
i'm that smart like i'm above average
smart i'm not like excellent i'm like a
b-plus kind of smart
that's what i aim for you know i get
almost the good thing but i don't do all
the work
and i think one thing is like software
just grew so much and i guess i kind of
assumed it would but like what's going
to get even bigger like is youtube going
to get bigger or smaller way bigger
tick-tock bigger twitter probably bigger
so go find the categories that are going
to get bigger so that's one and then i

[25:00]
to get bigger so that's one and then i
think with that secondly i got very
lucky and
i think the other thing is when people
are building these companies like that
tracking thing we talked about
especially during a recession are you
building something a must-have like i
can't live without it like right now go
to your credit card bills
what can you not cut that's a must-have
what can you cut like even employee wise
those are nice to haves unless they're
must-haves and
i think with appsumo there's two two
components which is
everybody wants more customers
in this world we live in you guys want
more listeners so he'll you want more
twitter followers i want more youtube
subscribers like those are just kind of
what we're interested in so i thought if
i can give people customers that's
literally the most important thing i can
do on earth for these people
and then secondly i think we got very
lucky with our business model which was
we don't have to create anything
we don't have to hold any inventory on
anything
and we promote a thing you created
someone else created in some software
creator
we get the money up front and then we
pay them 60 days later and there's a
reason for that like we had to put up
all this money and all this you know
experience and time to get the audience

[26:00]
experience and time to get the audience
and and the community but the model just
was was epic like we don't need a big
office like we can really do a 60-day
cash conversion cycle that way like so
you're like you're getting just
generating cash as you grow but like
negative working capital basically
is it negative or positive so we get the
money up front and then we pay our
partners 60 days later yeah negative
working capital a positive working
capital is like a like a you know
apparel business where you have to pay
your vendors and then you receive money
you know in 30 days and that's a pain in
the ass to grow because you're having to
fund all the inventory growth negative
working capital is the other way where
like they give you the cash and now as
you're growing you have this float of a
bunch of cash that you can be using to
invest in things because you don't have
to pay your partners for 60 days
it's a pretty incredible business model
when you make it work
yeah ours has gotten really lucky i
would say with all those things and i
mean it's a pretty i think find a
business that you just really enjoy
doing like we promote like our job is
literally to find cool software products
get a deal and then tell people about it
and that's how like the money just comes
down and then we give the partners money
the people get a good deal i think more

[27:00]
the people get a good deal i think more
businesses aren't figuring out like
triple win
there's like win lose like you gave me
some money but you're getting screwed
and i think there's like mint was a
perfect example of that it was like free
plus like the plus like these partners
get money
and it was just like a really cool like
everyone's winning there but i think
some businesses it does feel like win
lose
yeah can you talk a little more about
like the first year of appsumo
because i imagine like now it must be
easy you know you have this massive
audience people know appsumo
um
but like the first year i can imagine
which dude
oh my god oh my god
oh dude it gets harder i thought it you
know there's a what's his name jim roth
jim rome quote it's like yeah it doesn't
get it doesn't get uh easier you just
get better
and i like that a lot because it doesn't
get easier just your problems get harder
and you get better at it
um

[28:01]
um
the first to be in look our narratives
of our mind are all liars like our like
how we reminisce some things is total
lies like we just totally change the
history to serve whatever purpose and
whatever moment we're in
um but the way i recall it to the best
of my ability and i looked at revenue of
it recently
and it's been 12 years so our first year
revenue was 300 000.
and that was me truthfully just by
myself i really wanted a business where
i was like i don't want to have a
developer i'll do it myself don't have
support i don't have anybody to [ __ ]
depend on initially now i can't do
without these this team
and it was just like kind of where i
think one of the key things that that
people miss in business in general is
they're not working backwards from their
customer very specifically so with
appsumo i literally just once a month i
didn't do a lot of work i probably
worked about like
10 20 hours a month
i would be like all right i want to
reach y combinator audience what are the
products that i could get deals on that
i know that would get it would get
upvoted on hacker news it was like oh
well let me get those so i got
optimizely i got mixpanel

[29:00]
optimizely i got mixpanel
um then i was like how do i get on
lifehacker that's an audience i want
well i looked up all of life hackers top
uh top reviewed software they've ever
talked about and i got a deal on that
and i emailed them and said hey if i get
deals on this can you promote it and
they're like yeah maybe they did
and so it was a very intentional
approach of uh you know customer first
is how i like to label it and working
backwards in that and i treated it very
casually greg i wasn't very like this is
going to be a big-ass company i was like
i make you know a few thousand bucks
every month or so for not too much work
and i think one thing that people need
to be clear on especially or whatever
you're on your career i lived so cheap
that i didn't have to make a lot of
money i didn't even have like i was
doing consulting for speeddate.com
they were paying me 5 000 bucks a month
and i didn't really do much for them but
they loved me i was like dude that's
awesome
i was like a product manager for them as
a consultant but i had the 5000 i lived
crazy cheap and it gave me the
flexibility to really find stuff i
enjoyed and i did it very comfortably
until
probably around a year in
i hired you know i had a i found a

[30:00]
i hired you know i had a i found a
developer named chad who's still my
business partner and that's an amazing
story
and then andrew chen who's one of my
best friends was like no you got it why
don't you take it seriously and he you
know he tiger bombed me he's like you're
gonna try to be rich and you're gonna
grow this big and i was like dude i'm
just chilling man just let me chill dude
he's like no
make something of your life
and so we switched up the model we went
from bundles to single deals and we went
from single deals to like tremendous
amounts of advertising
and giveaways and different things and
the business went from 300 000 to 3
million the next year
and it was that's not normal and uh and
so the way i think of the first year
greg it was it was enjoyable it was
um i wouldn't say professional in the
sense it was very hobby and i think this
is a very clear difference as a baseball
player and as a professional in sports
or as a professional
in business or a professional in a hobby
is that are you treating it like a hobby
are you training like a professional and
we had a lot of we eventually people
copied us
and we're just very professional
like i worked at these very impressive
companies i have a very
it's not bragging but i have a a

[31:01]
it's not bragging but i have a a
like we got blocked by paypal and then i
literally emailed or texted the vp at
paypal and got unblocked within like 30
minutes
that's just it was just luck because i
have that network from being in silicon
valley and stuff and so i think that
gave us an edge over other people as we
started professionalizing the business
and you know
20 to what you're in 2022
i mean it's [ __ ] hard man
i used to think ceo so i hired the ceo
his name is amy abdullah you should
check him out on twitter
and i had i hired eamon he ran the
company for five years and i basically
just like got
pretty rich during that time period and
i really didn't do do a lot of work
and i was like this is this is very
unsatisfying
getting a lot of money is satisfying i
will not deny that but like not working
is pretty unfulfilling and i just
thought he didn't do [ __ ] all day
i was like this [ __ ] guy dude like he
makes good money i don't want to i can't
say his numbers i'm like this guy's
making all this money and like what does
he do ceo ceo do nothing
he sits around has everybody else do all

[32:01]
he sits around has everybody else do all
this work
and then he quit last year and i was
like oh [ __ ] man i guess i'll try to do
it myself
and it's it's it's not like a boohoo
story for me but it's like oh wow
there's until you're in someone else's
experience and really understanding it
um it was hard to really grasp like how
challenging it is day to day and like
the level of responsibility he had and
so i definitely empathize more with him
and anyone leading a team and being
responsible for jobs and you know
running a business
did you did you raise money or or has it
been bootstrapped it's been bootstrapped
it's so cool to um
you know it ties back to the working
capital point that we were making
earlier but like you know the inherent
feature of the business model you built
is that you're kind of being just funded
by customers along the way so you know
most most venture-backed business models
they're like gross margin negative from
the get-go or you know or you're having
to you know fund a bunch of upfront
technology build out and it's you know
you're you need a tremendous amount of
money up front in order to build that so

[33:00]
money up front in order to build that so
that you can hopefully get to the point
where like you're kind of at the uh you
know the benefit point of like the
marginal cost of zero of the deployment
of the technology but the reality is
then you have to raise a bunch of vc
capital and dilute yourself in order to
get there with your business model
negative working capital you're like you
know pulling in cash and you don't have
to pay for a while you're able to
actually fund all of that growth and all
the growth initiatives with customer
money and so like you don't really need
to raise money uh along the way and you
can maintain that ownership so it's a
pretty cool um it's a cool thing to see
how it actually played out and flowed
that way
yeah i can't say is that i'm not smart
about it i think more with raising money
we never really had a good use for it
because we did have capital we were
profitable from day one and i think more
businesses can be i don't think we're
unique in that i think people get uh
deceived
i think the other thing that's
interesting is the advantage we have
we've talked about going public like you
know our revenues are in eight you know
very high eight figures
and um
i don't know i just don't want to be at
the mercy of other people i like being

[34:00]
the mercy of other people i like being
at the mercy of our customers like if
they like us and we like them and we try
to do our best they buy and give us
money and we can live our lives and
hopefully they benefit the partners we
promote get a bunch of money for us from
other stuff
um i like the idea that and not having
it is good to have adult supervision
like we have a board
um
they can't fire me
which is you know good and bad
but i think having a board of advisors
in general like i'm seeing one of them
tomorrow because i'm having a bunch of
issues
is uh is critical as in the personal
life is i have a council of wise men is
what i call it uh but also in your
professional life
yeah it's um
it's interesting i mean you bring that
up right now like you know not everyone
needs to raise money and there's a lot
of businesses that could be profitable
from the get-go i just think that
there's been this i mean it's probably
just a relic of the fact that we've been
in this raging 10-year bull market where
like money was free and you could go
raise at a billion dollars after a year
of existing and you know i think in
general people have created this

[35:01]
general people have created this
storyline that they're going to follow
as entrepreneurs and it's like here's
what i'm supposed to do quote unquote
and what i'm supposed to do as an
ambitious founder is i'm supposed to
start this business i'm supposed to
raise money from andreessen horowitz at
this valuation
and then i'm supposed to be a unicorn by
a year from now and get my forbes
article written about me uh you know
then i'm supposed to go public and it's
like okay but take a step back zoom out
and as you said i mean and greg would
definitely agree with this it's like why
do you actually want to do that is that
going to make you happy are you going to
be incrementally happier from going and
running a public company and like in
your case what does that entail running
a public company it's like now i have to
get on quarterly uh you know earnings
calls with a bunch of analysts and have
a bunch of people grilling me and have
news articles written about me every
time i do something you know there's
just a bunch of headaches that come with
the traditional path that everyone
thinks they're supposed to follow and so
i think like one of the great things
that hopefully comes out of this you
know bear market if we're in it is that
people actually reassess and take a much
more first principles approach to

[36:01]
more first principles approach to
thinking about what they really want to
do when it comes to building companies
yeah yeah i would encourage anyone just
to get started
like especially if you have a day job
like you know
i was talking with a buddy of mine named
sam from financial samurai and it was
like if you have a day job number one
kiss your boss's ass a lot right now
a lot it's a good time to kiss ass it's
a [ __ ] great time to build your
network because
you know when people are looking to cut
costs they're like well who who's who's
who's showing up
or who's calling it in right and the
people showing up generally we'll have a
higher chance and then also build the
network right there as well
uh for those
times
i think we're going to see a lot of
profitable products
being created right now just because all
that vc money is drying up
and
you know i think it's just gonna
we're gonna see uh over the next 18
months just some
profitable businesses come out like

[37:01]
profitable businesses come out like
you remember groupon like groupon was
like a 30 billion dollar company at its
peak like that came out of
the gray financial crisis
and i think we're gonna
we're gonna see a lot of businesses kind
of like appsumo where
people are gonna want deals on one side
and companies are going to want
customers on the other side
and entrepreneurs are not going to want
to raise money
not because it's impossible to raise
money but just because it's like
difficult and and annoying right now to
raise money
i felt like
is that true though because sometimes
i'm like if you're good looking you're
always going to get hit on
like i would say i was on a date a few
days ago and she's like i have 6
thousand guys to choose from
and i was like i'm one in six thousand
she's like you are one of the last ones
it's like that's fine
but it's you know i think if you have if
you're an air table or a you know figma

[38:00]
you're an air table or a you know figma
or a notion
and there and you're you have a model
that works
i i still think you can raise like
stupid easy
uh i think the challenge and you know i
think that's what you're saying so is
like if it's like uh yeah we're gonna
have to do a lot of stuff and there's a
lot of uncertainty it's gonna probably
be a lot more challenging experience
when you're doing zero to one like
pre-seed seed that's where it's going to
be more difficult to raise but yeah once
you have product market fit and you have
something that's working like
there's always money
yeah it's a flight to quality at that
point too i mean it's like all the same
money is going to pour at the ones that
are working and doing well um you hit on
i i do want to greg i want to talk
google chrome extensions um for sure but
before i do that there were like three
frameworks that noah hit on in the
context of um in the context of his
business building that i thought were
awesome to reiterate for
for any entrepreneurs or builders
listening one was
to go like just think about what
industry is going to be growing a ton in
the years ahead and like that is a great

[39:00]
the years ahead and like that is a great
place to go and build if you know that
like you know for you software was going
to be much bigger and you can go and
build in front of that trend that's a
great place to start um the whole like
must-haves versus nice to haves
framework that you dropped i thought was
really interesting i've always thought
of it as like um painkillers versus
vitamins is the way i always like
thinking about that where you're just
like vitamins are nice to have they
might make you feel okay and good
painkillers like you need to position if
you're going to be selling well you need
to position what you're selling as a
painkiller because people are way more
willing to pay and they if you make it
feel urgent and then that final one was
triple win businesses which i loved like
try to create a business model that is a
win-win-win where you have like the
companies winning customers are waiting
the partners are winning in it and when
you can do that uh you know it becomes
much more effective and it's a much
easier sell from the early days of it so
a bunch of stuff that you hit on that i
thought was just um that was just gold
uh greg can i pass it over to you to
kick off this um little bit of ideation
around the google chrome extensions
because i absolutely loved uh loved the

[40:01]
because i absolutely loved uh loved the
writing you did on that
so
i invested in a company in 2012
called vid iq
and
the founders this guy named rob sandy he
raised like a million dollars from
mark cuban and gary vaynerchuk and all
these guys to go build
uh the hootsuite but for youtube or the
buddy media for youtube so a platform
that gives you analytics on on youtube
he did like the pure silicon valley
approach
like he got like an awesome office he
hired like all these like well-known
people he was burning money like crazy
he was down to his last dollars
this is like 2014 2015.
and
he basically got rid of everyone except
a few people he went remote when remote
wasn't a thing
and
basically was surfing every day living
in santa cruz kind of like to your point

[41:00]
in santa cruz kind of like to your point
noah like almost like the first year of
your business he was just kind of like
what can i create
that generate some revenue and that
would be fun to create
he ends up taking vidiq
and turning it into a chrome extension
that when you're on youtube you go on
youtube and let's say i'm
you know at the
you know let's say you're on our our
channel right the where it happens
channel which by the way you should
subscribe we have like a crazy low
amount of subscribers on it so go
subscribe we got to get on noah's we got
to get on noah's level man
and
you're there it'll say you know when
you're on this video let's say it'll say
the vid iq score is 92 the average
um
you know views per hour is 2.1 um you
know here's the ratio of likes here's
like the engagement it basically gives
you deeper analytics
for people who are interested in getting
a leg up on uh

[42:01]
a leg up on uh
on other creators and then he started he
so he created that for free and then he
started charging for it
today fast forward to today
you know
he's doing millions of dollars of
revenue a year his team is like 50
people
um
the chrome extension has two plus
million users it's now no longer just
youtube uh they're on tick tock too and
it's also a web app
and it's an incredible story of a
business that like you know
pivoted
did their own thing passionate guy
and use chrome chrome extensions as a
great way to get an initial group of
users and then just
charge for it
so that inspired me to write a tweet
thread
um
around chrome extension extensions which
i'll just pull up really quickly here
i basically said people sleep on google
chrome extensions but it's secretly a
gold mine grammarly loom metamask and

[43:02]
gold mine grammarly loom metamask and
honey are companies that started as
chrome extensions and created billions
of value
and then here's why it works people
barely uninstall extensions the barrier
to install is low
extensions are quote unquote always on
so people are daily active users of it
and then people pay for many of them
so noah and sahil i want to get your
perspective as to what do you think
about
chrome extensions as a place to be
building
i love it
um i texted you as soon as i saw this
because i um
so i invested in this bit it was the
first time i'd ever really encountered
chrome extensions and this is kind of
embarrassing but like i had just never
really used google chrome um and so i
was like completely unfamiliar with the
chrome ecosystem and then i started
using it and
basically had gotten approached right
around that time by this founder who was
building a chrome extension that allowed
you to
um
split payments across multiple credit

[44:00]
split payments across multiple credit
cards so like you know how you know if
you go to a store and you're buying like
a big purchase you know like a laundry
machine or a fridge or whatever you can
like take two credit cards and be like
hey split it across these two and
they'll do it for you like at walmart or
sears or wherever you were um you can't
do that online incidentally like it
literally didn't exist um you can go and
you put in one credit card you have to
spend it and that's challenging for big
purchases it also presents an issue
where like you know if you want to
manage your credit you don't want to
over extend within one credit card and
then also you might want to optimize
across points and rewards across
different credit cards and so this guy
invented this chrome extension that
basically creates a kind of an instant
card that splits it however you want
across multiple credit cards and i had
no understanding of like chrome
extensions or how he was going to go to
market with it anyway now fast forward
like three months after initial launch
and they're doing you know 10 plus
million of gmb through this thing um
without having a single dollar of
marketing expense yet um have not spent
a dollar it's been all completely
organic and like product like growth of

[45:01]
organic and like product like growth of
people sharing this stuff and so that
was what opened my eyes to the power of
these things of like just how much you
can do with them
especially because they're
cross-internet like you just have it
plugged in you can use it wherever
across the internet now on different
transaction sites for this
honey was the same way i imagined in the
early days so i am i think it's super
interesting there has to be a lot of
cool stuff to be built here
that business is called kashish by the
way k-a-s-h-e-e-s-h
like cash
jeezy well then work on they should work
on their name
[Laughter]
they need to put a little zhu on that
sahil
i i think uh my just two comments and
you know maybe you don't want him i'll
shut the hell up
but i i think you know two observations
here one is i think it's wrong to look
at where necessarily the biggest
size of audiences
and be like i need to build a business
there versus like what's the actual
problem and then what's the best way to
resolve it and i think this is where
people get trapped like a lot of
entrepreneurs are like i need recurring

[46:01]
entrepreneurs are like i need recurring
revenue what's the best way to get
people to give me money every month i'm
like well make something they want to
give you money for every month
but i think that that line of thinking
needs to be reversed generally which is
working backwards from the customer's
problems that they're excited like i
think that's the thing without sooner
was like they were i've tried a lot of
other businesses since then and before
then it was like this person was like
they're like please let me give you
money i was like damn this is cool
and the second thing is that
um i do think google chrome is big
uh i've bought google chrome and i've
ran google chrome business it's called
leo.io
and
things always seem easier or cooler or
bigger than when you when you actually
do it and you're like damn this is hard
and so we tried to monetize it didn't
work we tried to drive ads to it didn't
drive ads from it didn't work the growth
loops wouldn't work that hard and then a
lot of people if you try to buy a google
chrome app are actually pretty premium
priced
but i think you guys are on to something
that there's there's a lot of people
here they're probably actually rich
like wealthy for internet standards

[47:01]
like wealthy for internet standards
because they're on chrome right versus
probably like maybe other browsers or
they're maybe on android i guess android
would be chrome but i think they're
definitely having more money um i i
think what you're seeing so it's also is
interesting is like you could study the
ones that are doing well like rocket
reach i think is a huge one that no one
talks about
um i think there's a lot of these ones
but i would try to work backwards on the
customers and then not assume that this
one thing is going to be easy because it
almost never it sometimes is but we
bought it i spent 25 000 i paid a dollar
for every active user and then two years
later now it's just like collecting dust
and getting emails from people wanting
to monetize it in some scammy way i
agree with you know i think like the
trap
the trap that entrepreneurs make are
like okay
there's a lot of action here in chrome
extension now i need to like build a
chrome extension like rob sandy from vid
iq like when he was surfing in santa
cruz
he was like he was a yout he was he
actually created a youtube competitor
called biddler in 2005

[48:02]
called biddler in 2005
around
when youtube came out in 2005. like he
he was he under like he's og day one
youtube
video creator so
you know to your point around your
earlier point around passion and
you know two things that you basically
have a competitive edge on like he
understood it and then he was like okay
the tool is gonna be on an extension
because it's just way easier for
creators when they're on youtube to have
this extension and use it and it'll be
ten times quicker
um he wasn't he wasn't like oh yeah like
uh i i you know this is a huge
opportunity i need subscription revenue
um
at all
it just came
once yeah i fell in love with it
i think you're calling out the right
thing though which is like what are
industries or categories that are
getting bigger
and then where is it being underserved i
do think sometimes though as an
entrepreneur

[49:01]
entrepreneur
i always think my the other thing is
going to be so much easier than mine i'm
like dude i'll do chrome finally it'll
be so cake
i'm going to get i'm going to finally
get super rich
and then i do it i'm like ah i thought
it was like i read greg's tweets i
thought supposed to be super easy
i think it's it's going to be work
regardless so just find that the work
that you actually want to spend time on
versus i think if you're young just
chase a bunch of [ __ ] and get in the
reps just like in any sport but then try
to find the the path like for you guys i
think creating content is like so
obvious how good you guys are like you
guys are doing it naturally
naturally now after putting it in but
it's kind of like
uh lubricant versus friction
so i try to find the areas that i'm like
i like korean content i like sending
emails like
that's kind of what appsumo does
why do you do all the content like
you've built a massive youtube presence
you do a ton of videos they're great by
the way like you go i see you like
knocking on doors talking to talking to
people oh [ __ ] [ __ ] dude
on the internet a few weeks ago for for
suggesting um but uh yeah no like just

[50:03]
suggesting um but uh yeah no like just
what uh what has um what has led to that
like why are you why are you excited
about creating content probably
insecurities and ego if we're all honest
you know some form of legacy like i hope
people remember me or think i'm like
smart or special
do you think that's a thing
like do you i think anyone will remember
any of us no not at all yeah no one's
even no elon musk that guy's [ __ ]
gone
yeah lame
like not lame in a bad way but like in
like a hundred years maybe remember
maybe and people today's like god here
fine no problem like thanks for building
this cool stuff but i think we're overly
fixated on the reality that like there's
almost none of it like
any like
building i always said about this
colleges like you get a building dude
they're gonna rename that [ __ ] in 50
years if it still exists
sayonora
i think i wrote about this recently like
i just i think it's like
i think it's such a false pursuit i just
think it's like an unfortunate false

[51:01]
think it's like an unfortunate false
pursuit actually the whole idea of
legacy because the reality is in like i
like you said 100 years i was going to
say a thousand like no matter what in a
thousand years you're all forgotten like
we don't even know what half thousand
years ago
yeah like we don't remember [ __ ] like
you know like socrates and like a few
random p you know jesus whatever like
there's a few people out there that we
remember but the is the only guy
that we know from 2000 years ago and
there's still debate if he's true well
we're all jewish here right so like
abraham isaac you know we got we got
some other guys out there
we got some other dudes out there hunter
you had
you're half indian half jew yeah i'm a
hindu
dude i've only i think you're the first
ever i've only heard about you
yeah well i heard about 2000 years ago
you're in the bible yeah yeah like
mostly like when i tell people i'm
jewish most people because they see me
they think i'm sephardic like they think
yeah just because of my brown skin but
yeah no my mom is indian hindu um yeah
my dad's white jewish from the bronx
okay let's ask that i think that's a

[52:00]
okay let's ask that i think that's a
little bit why do i like doing this [ __ ]
because one i like marketing and it's
really a marketing problem
it's like who is the audience i call
them underdogs they're 18 to 35 year old
men
that want to start a side hustle or a
business or solopreneur and they don't
know what to do and they want
inspiration and i make content that
inspires them
uh i do it because i like making the
content i like seeing what goes viral i
like looking at the metrics and then
tweaking it and then i personally i get
a lot of joy engaging in the comments i
really like responding to almost all the
comments myself
um and so there's that i think the
question i was curious though is like
what's with jews
it's always fun when you start with that
what's with g what's with jews and all
of us is that the end of the question no
no no why do we love broadcasting like
all the jews like comedians twitterians
like disproportionately
like there's a lot of jewish people i
don't know there's something interesting
about our culture goes back to the bible
it goes back what happened in the bible
so it goes back i've never read the
bible the golden calf
and
you know the story

[53:00]
you know the story
no go on okay so
i mean this okay so
basically the story is moses was in the
desert with the israelites they flew
they fled from
egypt to go to israel
and in the process of that walk i
believe what happened was
the israelites started worshiping pagan
gods
and
symbols and uh
that's when
moses went up to mount sinai
and got the
ten commandments from god so to speak
and i feel like moses broadcasted
to all those people
at the bottom of mount sinai
to help them sort of
see ba see back judaism and and give
them
the the ten commandments
was that the first tweet would you say

[54:00]
was that the first tweet would you say
the ten commandments he's like here's a
listicle i've gotta i've gotta i've
gotta ten times to improve your life
[Applause]
i mean you know you guys both put out a
lot of content that i think does that
you know
i mean it's it's it's a tried and true
right like uh buzzfeed uh you know
created a billion dollar business around
that um you know just the numbers grab
people you know you get the like um you
know the cl the clear effect of like
hooking people in i mean let's be real
like youtube like every single platform
the people that have built big presents
like you you uh continue to lean into
the things that are grabbing people like
how many youtube videos say like how i
bought eight lamborghinis in for 10
grand in a weekend like that's every
video when you go to it because those
are the things that are hooking people
so it's like human nature in some way
shape or form um you know
these like neatly packaged things i mean
it's the brilliance of the ten
commandments it's like ten commandments
i know like that encompasses my whole
world it's like great marketing

[55:01]
world it's like great marketing
if jews believed in hell all of us are
i'm definitely go i don't know if i'm
going i think i'm doing my best to stay
wherever the hell jews go i the other
thing that's interesting so hell about
that is um i think more people should do
like calling the calling the right word
which is like a pruning like i pruned
really aggressively on all my content
like on instagram i think i followed 20
people because it's just like attractive
people and some watches
i think youtube is like really i watch
poker and squash and then my videos
i don't like i see these other business
guys they drive me crazy i'm like just
block them then
you know on twitter too like i go
through seasons i'm like oh i really
want to get this kind of content and
then i'm like i don't know it's not
certain i think people could be a little
bit more intentional
uh about the the inputs and then just
get over get get like brainwashed with
positive inputs
right like if brainwash would take i
don't i try to get addicted tick tock
it's hard for me i just think it's so
garbage it's a it's a relatively
state-owned corporation that controls
the data of a whole lot of american
teenagers and that is scary what does
that say though that the american
seniors don't give a [ __ ] about it

[56:00]
seniors don't give a [ __ ] about it
they're like i don't care and even
teenagers there's a lot of adults even
myself i put up on tick tock and i'm
like
they can have my garbage videos i think
they're taking out my diarrhea
and uh follow me it's just so abstract
on a micro level it's so abstract it's
like hard to it's one of those things
where it's like for one person it's very
hard to conceptualize what that means
but in the aggregate if it means that
you know in a hot or cold war with china
they could make slight tweaks to the
algorithm that completely influence what
all of our teenagers are seeing and how
they're thinking on a daily basis that's
pretty scary but like for an individual
i don't really know what that means for
me i'm not gonna be skewed by whatever i
see you immediately you know you have an
arrogance around it so
i think it's scary geopolitically i
really do if you're anything like me
