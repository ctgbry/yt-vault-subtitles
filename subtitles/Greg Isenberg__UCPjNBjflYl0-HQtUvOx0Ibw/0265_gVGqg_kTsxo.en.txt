[00:00]
okay everyone 2025 is here and I know you want
to start a new startup know it's on your mind and
I got to be honest sometimes starting a startup
is actually most of the time starting a startup
is pretty daunting you don't really know where to
start and that's why today's episode is all about
10 newsletter business ideas you can start this
weekend how do you start a profitable newsletter
from scratch now I know people are going to listen
to that and be like a newsletter that's not really
a startup it's actually a cheat code it's kind of
like a a hack to get a a loved group of people to
open up your your newsletter literally and
get them to uh you know go you can build a
Marketplace you can build an agency you can build
so much on top of a newsletter that's why it's
such a good place to start and today uh I found
this incredible uh post by Matt McGary and Matt

[01:01]
McGary is he's like a newsletter God you know uh
says he's gotten 15.4 million email subscribers
for clients and he's just got a list of 10 really
amazing newsletter business ideas that you can
start in a weekend and we're going to go through
it together I'm going to give my opinion on each
and every one of them um people are going to steal
these they're going to go do them and they're
going to turn into some big uh multi-million
dollar businesses uh I have no doubt so uh
let's just get right into [Music] it so the first
idea he has is a marketing newsletter for Global
Talent so he says one of the biggest shifts in the
past uh few years has been the rise of overseas
talent for example job boards like online pH and
over overseas recruiting agencies like somewhere

[02:00]
have grown to eight figures as a marketer and a
business owner I notice most oversea marketers
typically aren't as skilled as Western marketers
has nothing to do with language barrier overseas
marketers have great English has to do with
something out of their control budgets so
basically what he's saying is there's new
marketers in the USA with $100,000 a month
budgets right out of school um but marketers in
these places like the Philippines work with less
than 5% of that this creat a skill Gap and that
is the lucrative opportunity for you so what's
the idea the idea is go and create a newsletter
specifically for overseas marketers seeking remote
usab based marketing jobs now when I first read
that I was kind of skeptical and I'll explain
why um in places like India you can get newsletter
subs for 25 cents to 50 cents from Facebook ads um
so if you spend $5,000 a month you're getting
20,000 new Subs every month to me this is low

[03:00]
quality Subs uh what I mean by that is you're
not going to be able to monetize them as well
so I generally uh refrain from uh focusing on on
on niches like that but let's let's give him a
second and let's let's try to understand what he's
trying to do so he says here's the structure for
the newsletter you'll have three sections section
one great remote marketing jobs readers can apply
to section two relevant digital marketing news and
updates section three actionable digital marketing
T tutorials and then he says here's how you can
monetize it um and this is where he was reading
my mind these subscribers are easy to get and will
find your content valuable but they're not the
audience you want to monetize he's 100% right here
if you want to make this a real business you need
to monetize the Western audience who wants to hire
talented marketing overseas for less than us-based

[04:00]
so the four ways that He suggests making money
a job board so making a free job board where
companies can post marketing jobs for overseas
talents um you can charge these companies 300
to $500 for a boost uh which is totally normal
for JW boards where you can feature the job in
your newsletter which Rees reaches 20,000 talented
marketers so job boards uh I love these businesses
they do print um if you get it right um and yeah
companies are just used to paying for it if you
collect number two if you collect subscriber data
at signup work experience job title level company
skills by the way such an important thing to to do
is collecting subscriber data you don't just want
people's emails right so when you're thinking
about building your newsletter whatever it is
think about what is subscriber data that you can
capture that is specific for your Niche so he says
you can send targeted sponsored email blast on
behalf of job advertisers charging anywhere from

[05:03]
1 to 3,000 for recruiting email blast to help
companies generate more qualified candidates
number three you can partner or create your own
overseas recruiting agency uh hard to do hard to
build your own uh overseas recruiting agency a lot
of people a lot of management but partnering is is
really an interesting one right like you saw that
with Nick Huber in somewhere. comom Nick Huber
sweaty startup on Twitter has a lot of traffic a
lot of people a lot of eyeballs and he partnered
with uh it was PR previously called support
Shephard now it's called somewhere where he
was basically like I'm going to generate leads for
you and uh and then you know he he took an equity
stake in that business so looking at partnering
is uh probably a more interesting uh venue to go
after and then number four create a course um
focus on International audience of marketers
I don't think personally that's my least favorite
uh of the options here's how the math works out

[06:06]
okay here's cool this is cool assume a 25 cent CPA
$5,000 a month budget that's 20 new th000 Subs a
month 300 job $300 for a job posting and five jobs
per newsletter that's $1,500 per issue that makes
sense three newsletters sent per week at you know
times four weeks $18,000 a month in Revenue five
recruiting blasts per month uh and you're charging
$2,000 each so that's $10,000 a month of Revenue
so total revenue is about 28,000 per month with an
audience of 20 to 40,000 International marketers
I don't think that's absurd I don't think that's a
crazy uh you know a crazy unattainable uh business
to create and then all of a sudden you're making
28,000 uh per month okay so that's number one

[07:00]
quick break in the Pod to tell you a little
bit about startup Empire so startup Empire
is my private membership where it's a bunch
of people like me like you who want to build
out their startup ideas now they're looking for
content to help accelerate that they're looking
for potential co-founders they're looking for
uh tutorials from people like me to come in and
tell them how do you do email marketing how do you
build an audience how do you go viral on Twitter
all these different things that's exactly what
startup Empire is and it's for people who want
to start a startup but are looking for ideas
or it's for people who have a startup but just
they're not seeing the traction uh that they need
so you can check out the link to Startup empire.co
in the description number two you can create a
platform based newsletter so um you know he uses
the example of mix X Miss XL I'm sure most of you
know mix Excel she I think she got popular on Tik

[08:03]
Tok but she basically made learning about Excel uh
fun and and then she's she's moved on to you know
now she does word and now she does PowerPoint but
she's created a huge uh business out of it so how
can you replicate this um create a list of tools
platforms and programs that are commonly used in
your industry or that you personally love and then
basic create an educational newsletter instructing
people on how to use them better um so the
examples he uses is Ableton for music production
Da Vinci for video editing notion for operations
canva for graphics figma for design clavio for
e-commerce perplexity AI for research you get the
idea pick a tool make it digestible and delightful
to consume that content and just focus on one
particular Niche you're you're doing you know
you know uh perplexity AI for research you're not
doing perplexity AI for everyone and then how can

[09:06]
you monetize it well you can build a course um
that's I that's like probably my you know the
least interesting uh option for me I think that
there's way better ways to monetize I think uh be
an affiliate partner for the platform Affiliates
typically earn 20 to 50% recurring commission
that's insane so not many people know this but a
lot of these software products will pay you 20%
let's say recurring commission um if you send them
if you send them customers right so um that that's
that's huge and it's recurring um I'd probably
try to double down as much on that as possible
and the other thing that's not talked about here
is they potentially buy your business in a year
two three five years um lean into templates
number three um so if you have a newsletter

[10:01]
about mastering HubSpot you create uh a HubSpot
template for subscribers and then you could say
sign up through HubSpot through my affiliate link
and I will give you the template for free uh or if
you already have HubSpot here's a high converting
template that can be yours for $200 um this is
huge these digital assets I'm seeing a lot more
of it uh a lot more people gain into templates the
margins are obviously great um and uh he's giving
away some sauce here I really like that um and
then and then he ends it with there you know there
are entire ecosystems and economies built around
platforms for example if your newsletter is about
Shopify websites you can easily find a SAS tool
that would want to get in front of your readers
absolutely that's that's totally right and now
with AI not only could you find a SAS Tool uh you
can build one right so you can use tools like rep
repet like bolt like VZ like lovable and actually
go and create these tools yourselves um and that's

[11:04]
another Beauty about a newsletter business right
instead of you know you can build software to sell
to to these people okay number three uh this
is actually my my least favorite idea on the
list an un unofficial sports team newsletter I'm
not saying that uh it isn't cool and interesting
and fun to have I just think that um I don't know
maybe maybe it is May it's just not exciting to me
I also think that uh from a revenue perspective
it's it's one of the tougher ones so now that
you're like so stoked about it now that I've
pumped you up on it um but listen someone may like
this so uh he says find a sports team with a big
fan base but not much media coverage this could
be your local team a minor league team a college
team uh don't start with something like the Dallas
Cowboys uh there's already so much content
on them so how do you Source content instead
of writing your own content go to subreddits
and forums and select the best takes on your

[12:04]
local teams link out to these takes or go one step
further DM the person behind them a be uh DM the
person behind it asking them to contribute to your
newsletter and you'd be surprised a lot of these
people would do it uh linking out is probably
the best way to start it removes the time and
effort and content creation and lets you quickly
scale horizontally you could easily create five
unofficial local sports teams newsletters quickly
monetize this through sponsors and creating a paid
Discord or Facebook Community uh to turn this into
a big business and I agree with this you probably
need a dozen newsletter for multiple teams but
it's doable again that's one of the reasons why
I don't like this you have to amalgamate a lot of
these to actually create serious Revenue but it's
an opportunity for someone okay number four uh
local real estate investor newsletter so this uh
there there are there are examples of people
making millions of dollars with real estate uh

[13:04]
newsletters um friend of mine uh used to run a
company called bis now media I think they ended
up selling for about $70 million and that's what
they were doing they were just doing email you
know real estate news uh uh newsletters so uh
just because you know a transaction of of real
estate a real estate transaction is so is so
big there there's a lot of money around it so
what's the idea that Matt has so he says this
this this idea works for cities with 200,000
to a million people um the target audience for
this newsletter is local Real Estate Investors
who are looking to invest in that City and
here's how you can do it step one go to Zillow
or contact local Realtors to discover the best
investment properties once you know what to look
for you can probably Outsource this to a virtual
assistant for $500 a month you can also probably

[14:00]
use AI to automate that number two place 10 to
20 highquality listings in each newsletter and
three enrich the listing by adding potential
mortgage rates forecasting potential Returns
on the investment this added information will make
your newsletter more valuable and interesting to
read newsletter like the newsletters like the
offer sheet and here. Co do this for Airbnb
properties and the offer sheet is huge I think
they have more than 100,000 Subs so how to grow
this okay everyone wants to know use Facebook ads
to build your subscriber list your CPA should be
$2 or less promote your newsletter in local F FB
groups and subreddits just be careful on how you
do this because you don't want to get banned
for Shilling yeah it's harder to do it on on
subreddits um you can the the way to do it is just
you add value in your post and at the end of it uh
you just link out to to to your newsletter you
just say like like for more of this go here uh

[15:01]
and then share pre and post ctas on social media
to tease your content uh your newsletter content
and if you don't know what that means uh a prea uh
just basically means you know an example like this
this is a tweet that Matt did he says my results
from Twitter ads last month and he you know $1.97
CPA 64% open rate want to see how I run Twitter
ads for myself and 10 plus other newsletters my
Twitter ad guide drops tomorrow my newsletter
get it here so it's a pre call to action he's
saying something is you know he's teasing with
a carrot of information and then he's saying
you know tomorrow my newsletter uh you're going
to want to be on the newsletter because I'm not
sharing it here on Twitter and and post is kind
of a similar thing he uses a Justin Welsh tweet
uh who says yesterday 38,000 of my subscribers
learned four lessons from a million dollars in
on online core sales um and then you tease some of
what you know is in the in the post and then you

[16:06]
link it out so that's called a post CTA preas and
post ctas are are just you know some of the best
ways to get people to to from your your social
audience X Instagram Tik Tok and get them on your
newsletter and by the way while you're creating
your newsletter while for any of these ideas you
should be Crea in uh focusing on one Platform One
internet audience maybe it's Tik Tok maybe it's
Instagram maybe it's X depending on what it is uh
and just be focusing and building that audience
while you're spending money on meta and other
places to to get subscribers because eventually
what you want to do is uh you don't want to be
reliant on paying Zuck you know thousands of
dollars a month for on on meta ads so so so the
idea is eventually you your organic will surpass

[17:02]
your paid you know he says send this newsletter
out one time per week to start as you sell more ad
inventory send it to three to five times per week
okay and then he says how to get your first ad
sale because I know a lot of people are would be
are thinking like okay great but how do I actually
sell an ad spot so let's assume you have 1,000 to
5,000 subscribers which by the way isn't a lot I'd
approach a local business charge a flat fee run
it add for them until it gets an agreed amount of
clicks here's what this looks like the sponsor
and you agree to a certain number of clicks at
a specific price I'd aim at 500 clicks at $5 per
charge an upfront flat fee of $2500 you'll need to
run the ad for multiple weeks to get 500 clicks
but that's okay take that $2500 and reinvest it
uh in ad spend to get more subscribers get
more subscribers close new sponsor at that
higher rate so local businesses with high ltvs
that already work with Real Estate Investors are

[18:05]
the best sponsors for this newsletters for example
lawyers accountants Bankers Insurance Brokers Etc
once you have 5 to 10,000 subs and a steady stream
of AD Revenue then you can repeat this newsletter
framework for another nearby City and then you
can scale horizontally by following the same
model in two to five towns in the surrounding
areas so there's more ways you can monetize
of course because you can sell your subscribers a
local in-person real estate investment seminar or
event for $500 to $1,000 per seat uh that that's
happening all the time people doing really well
with that you can also offer premium subscriptions
and put 50% of the properties behind a pay wall
for $1,000 a year so you know if you do the math
you assume a $2 CPA $5,000 a month budget which
is 2500 new Subs a month uh you're adding 20
subscribers per day from organic social so it's

[19:00]
600 new Subs per month basically 3,100 new Subs
a month total now you have a valuable audience of
3,000 local Real Estate Investors you can start
selling ads if you sell three run into run into
500 clicks ads like we talked about before for
$2,500 each month each month that's $7,500 if
2% of a 5,000k a 5,000 person list purchases a
$500 seminar it's $50,000 in sales which doesn't
include the potential sponsorship revenue for
the from the event and you will be able to make
money from sponsorship Revenue if 1% of a 5k
list converts to $1,000 a year premium Subs
subscription that's $50,000 ARR total revenue is
$190,000 with an audience of 5 to 10,000 subs and
plus the economics get better as you scale and
plus you can sell this business on a dime this
is a super sought-after uh audience um and the
reason I'm happy that he put this uh example

[20:08]
here is a lot of people tell me oh I want to start
a newsletter business but I'll only start making
$100,000 a year uh once I hit 100,000 subscribers
no you know five to 10,000 Subs uh and you're
making $190,000 a year okay you still with me you
getting those creative juices flowing you still
sipping all right well let's uh let's keep going
don't you know get you know hope your notepad
is out and you're sort of writing notes okay so
number five newsletter for B2B decision makers so
uh this is this is actually one of my my favorite
uh favorite on the on the list so the beauty of
this type of newsletter is you don't need a huge
so it's even less than the the previous one if you

[21:02]
have 2,000 subscribers and they're all SE execs
you hit a home run sponsors are desperate to get
in front of these decision makers the hardest part
will be acquiring newsletters that fit your ICP
ideal customer profile here's how to start pick a
niche and focus on one industry for example this
could be CEOs at Fortune 500 oil and gas companies
the next step is acquiring subscribers as I said
it's tough but there are three approaches chat
with an executive at a 500 a Fortune 500 company
in your target industry ask about their info diet
and what they want to read about then create for
that person eventually ask them to introduce
you to more people in their Network ask those
people what content they're consuming create
hyper relevant content that Executives of that
Niche want to read do an analysis and summary
of important press releases product launches
Executives hired fired earning reports Etc uh
take all the information they normally consume and

[22:04]
summarize it into a five to 10 minute newsletter
number three share that content on LinkedIn and
X to drive people to your newsletter and number
four advertise in other newsletters that your ICP
is reading uh however these ads may get expensive
or may be expensive as your audience grows you can
do cross promos with these newsletters to grow
for free the next part is uh the next next part
of this is critical to monetizing a newsletter so
you want to create a survey After People subscribe
you can do that with something like beehive survey
forms and you can ask people their job title their
industry their company and their location and
we talked a little about you know getting more
you know data enrichment than just a sub uh
a plan old uh email uh earlier and again this
is coming up again so analyze the results to
determine what percentage of subscribers are
your ICP and what percent uh aren't if you can
say 50% of our subscribers are SE sues execs in

[23:05]
XYZ sector then you have serious leverage when
selling sponsorships so I think this is a really
really great Playbook um and again I like it
because I like high value valuable uh customer
bases I like when people have a lot of disposable
income to spend who are in charge of budgets
um these are beautiful businesses to create um
and then again you can create software on top
of it um and and sell them things you know uh it
doesn't necessarily need these are just you know
it doesn't you you don't need to necessarily sell
by ads events courses stuff like that I actually
tend to think you should be selling software but
you can always start by selling uh ads and events
quick ad break let me tell you about a business I
invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a

[24:02]
few years ago I met this group of people that
were some of the best SEO experts in the world
they were behind getting some of the biggest
companies found on Google and the secret sauce
is they've got a set of technology and AI that
could help you outrank your competition so for
my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to
have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to
depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses
I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like
SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and
that's why I invested in it they're so confident
in their approach that they offer a 30-day
Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does
that nowadays so check it out highly recommend
boring marketing.com okay number six Niche ad
examples for media buyers so media buyers need to
stay current and find uh add creative examples to
get better at their job titles some newsletters
do this like the ad Professor which covers General

[25:04]
ads and inspiration and uh bidy Co but there's
a lack of newsletters dedicated to ad creative
for media companies SAS info products Leen and
many other Industries create a newsletter that's
broken down into three to four sections each SE SE
each section should feature ads from a different
Niche here's how cre create a spread number one
create create a spreadsheet and determine which
niches you want to cover number two Source High
converting ads for each Niche do this by going to
Meta Meta ad library look for ads that have been
live the longest on high spending accounts they're
literally consistent High performers select three
to six ads per Niche add some context to each ad
this can be one to two sentences now how do you
monetize well you want to put 80% of the content
behind a pay wall make canva templates for each
ad that subscribers can download you want to sell

[26:03]
sponsorships to advertisers that want to Target
paid marketers that's obvious and you want to sell
a community or a membership or a course to that
audience so s you know super straightforward on
how to monetize it um I think there's a ton a ton
a ton of opportunity in this one um so yeah that's
number six let's keep on going this week in memes
most newsletters are text based but there are some
great exceptions Charter which was acquired by
Robin Hood which was visuals and infographics
on business finance and Technology smart nonsense
a daily comment explaining nerdy stuff like your
five and the Bay Area times which was started by
Anthony Pompano Pompano uh which is a visual daily
newsletter on business and Tech but no newsletter
explains the news with memes here's how it could
work find a big story that happened that day or
week we find a meme that represents or relates

[27:00]
to the news story and write a witty and concise
summary of the story in 250 words below the meme
trun fan does an incredible job at curating memes
around business and Tech news on Twitter but who's
doing it in a newsletter so this is the idea
create one of these newsletters uh creating one
of these uh newsletters isn't rocking science yeah
so you just want to cover two to four stories per
day one meme for each story 100 to 250 uh word
witty summaries for each you don't need to make
any memes from scratch find them on Reddit Twitter
Memel lord. Tech it's actually meme meme uh mem-
alerts.com and other s sources um I'd recommend
choosing a prosumer niche focus on business Tech
investing or Finance but this can work for
General news too prosumer content has some
has more monetization opportunities yeah so
obviously the more consumer you go uh the

[28:03]
less monetization there is and the more prosumer
you go more B2B you go the the more monetization
goes up what's the big idea around this one so
the big idea is today's newsletters are text
and in 2025 they are going to be more and more
visual um I think that memes is one more visual
way to to like meme images are a great way to
consume information um it's it's tried and true
uh there's also other ways you can do it like
you can do infographics um you can do gifts so
just think there's just a lot of opportunity in
making more visual newsletters so that's kind of
like the idea for me on this one is creating
you know creating more visual newsletters in
a space that uh doesn't doesn't have any visual
newsletters um and and create something that uh it

[29:01]
just feels doesn't feel like work to read because
I think a lot of newsletters now just feels like
a lot of text and and people don't have time for
that okay so number eight industry specific AI
tips and tactics this idea is modeled after write
with AI it's a weekly paid newsletter that trains
how to write with AI uh they send chat GPT and
AI prompt to your inbox every week so it's $200
a year $20 a month um they have $200,000 in ARR
through their paid newsletter subscription so
you can take this concept and apply it to other
categories AI for marketers AI for lawyers you
get the idea so you know the key to creating a
successful newsletter that people pay for off
the bat is creating content that gives them the
results people want cheat codes help your reader
save time and money with AI tools and tactics
okay so I think um what isn't said here is that
um Nicholas Cole and Dicky Bush the the the people
behind right with AI have hundreds of thousands of

[30:07]
followers already so on social so they're able
to take that to generate this $200,000 AR so
the question is with this idea is could if they
didn't have that audience would they be able to
use Facebook ads acquire customers obviously not
at $2 a paid subscriber but maybe you know $20
um that's my question mark with this one so I
believe in the product like I believe that you
know there's a ton of opportunity to create a you
know newsletters where people are learning AI or
new tools or or or basically things that save them
time or money um and and I think that people are
more more willing in 2025 to pay for them than
they than they were in 2015 um but my question
is can you do that without a social audience
uh let me know in the comments so number nine

[31:01]
lessons from leaders or inspirational figures
so this newsletter would feature highlights and
Lessons Learned From inspirational leaders this
type of news newsletter is trickier to monetize
because there's no clear Niche but it's a great
way to grow a broad audience fast uh this content
also translates great to social it translates
great to social because it's the type of stuff
that goes viral specifically uh especially on X
but on other places too if you need some ideas on
leaders to profile there's a lot of great podcasts
that go uh in-depth on similar topics how to take
over the world business breakdowns Founders
podcasts acquired FM um rather than keeping
in-depth profiles on leaders the profile does a
good job doing this I would keep this newsletter
super short two to five minutes max so let's
say your niche as investors and you profile
Warren Buffett create three to sections that look
like this best interview with Warren Buffett best

[32:02]
quote from Warren Buffett best book about Warren
Buffett best piece of advice from waren Buffett
remember readers like predictable formats with
short actionable content this there's like very
little risk to create something like this and
it's it's just going to work right it's going
to work because you're picking backing off The
credibility of say Warren Buffett you can do
Facebook targeting to you know people who like
Warren Buffett um or follow Warren Buffett on
or follow Berkshire hathway on X uh or you
know follow people like Bill akman who are
are students of Warren Buffett on X so there's
a lot of ways uh there's a lot of ways to make
this work I don't see it as high risk um but my
my issue with it is like where do you where do
you take it from there how do you monetize it um
if we were going to use the the example of Warren
Buffett I actually think that's a probably one
of the you know a great place to actually uh to

[33:04]
build a business around because then you can you
know it's a business around investors people who
like value investing um you know you could there's
a lot you can do there um some ideas just like off
the top of off the top of my head um is well one
you can raise a fund uh like a hedge fund and you
could be a mini Warren Buffett and raise from
from people like this um you can do an agency
of like you know how would Warren Buffett run
your company and do Consulting around it um of
course you can sell courses [Music] um make a
few hundred thousand doar a year there uh maybe
make a stock trading app that is just you know all
around Warren Buffett and value investing uh you

[34:02]
know an AI agent that you charge for that looks
at your portfolio and optimizes it like Warren
Buffett these are just off the top of my head um
but I do I do like it because you know people you
know if you are going to do this idea focus on I
would say focus on inspirational leaders that uh
also attract like a prosumer audience okay last
uh last idea is local newsletters number 10 so
traditional media Publications have have shifted
to digital platforms but local news still hasn't
caught up so there's a big opportunity right now
for digestible local newsletters that focus on
what people want positive Community oriented

are like so tired of just looking at the news
and seeing sad things come out of their town
so you can do a things to do this weekend
