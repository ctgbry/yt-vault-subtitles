[00:00]
if me or you were trying to make $10
million this year how would you do it
your idea on pet supplements a pet ag1 I
think is the single best business idea
in the world right now my God I hadn't
heard that but that is the single best
business because I would buy it right
now it's beautiful like if you build a
news a paid newsletter that brings in a
million dollars chances are your margins
are 90 plus% MH yeah we have a paid you
know we call it a membership that is
like part paid newsletter part community
and we charge $100 a month for it dude
we had 20 signups in the last 24 hours
it's wild I don't see anyone on substack
doing this like even the biggest
newsletters the missed opportunity is
realizing that the recurring revenue is
the beginning not the end something
Dicky I've been talking about a lot too
is that spending money is a skill and so
I think part of that growth is
confronting that discomfort where you
have to get used to spending five grand
a month then you got to get used to
spending 10 grand a month then 20 grand
a month you know and if you don't allow
yourself to confront that you're never
going to feel the feeling of spending

[01:00]
going to feel the feeling of spending
more which allows you to then want to go
out and make more which allows you to
get to the next level you know spending
money is a skill there's a lot of money
on how to get rich but not a lot on how
to be rich like the people who make a
lot of money but have a horrible
relationship I think is the worst case
scenario because you just feel this
overwhelming guilt all the time that
you're making a lot but not spending it
and and when you spend more you still
have the same relationship with money
that you had when you were making way
less I think people brag about that it's
like the rich person who drives a Honda
but I look at that I'm like they just
haven't kind of done the work of you
have more security now why don't you
invest in it yeah it's like having a
scarcity mindset while you're surrounded
by abundance I okay so we're live on the
pods we're live I'll just tell everyone
I'll announce to the world there's this
apartment I really want yep goal
apartment a goal apartment I I live in a
two-bedroom pretty big apartment but I
want to move into a four bedroom and for
fun there there's this building next
next to me that has this that has two

[02:01]
next to me that has this that has two
apartments for sale one
is they're giving it away they're giving
it away I think it's one of the most
expensive apartments in Miami and the
other one is less that I looked at but
still quite a
bit okay and I thought it would be fun
you know Saturday afternoon went with my
wife to go check out the spot uhhuh I
checked it out and we like didn't say
anything to each other cuz we were
speechless because like we walked out of
there and we just like envisioned
ourselves there I think everyone
envisions themselves there the Jo I used
to have this joke with with Alyssa we
would go for walks around Beverly Hills
in LA and we'd go on the walk and she'd
be like I could really imagine us living
here and I'm like oh yeah oh yeah you
and every other person ever I approve of
this
one so in my mind I've been trying to
decide is this and I'm curious your
thoughts like am I buy am I buying this

[03:00]
thoughts like am I buy am I buying this
apartment or am I considering buying
this apartment for like maybe it because
it is the nicest building and there's
some status and ego related to that or
am I buying this apartment because I'm
going to have a family one day and I
want to like have the best possible
environment for them and so just how do
you think about when you're making
purchases you know are you doing this
out of ego at of status or are you doing
it for well if if you couldn't tell
anyone that you bought that apartment
would you still buy it I mean yes right
then I guess it's less ego yeah
especially with Apartments you kind of
want to be anonymous with what you
bought I think M want Broad and be like
this is my address look at how sick you
know that's the lot like the last thing
I want someone to do is to pull up my H
like if someone pulls up your house it's
like that person lives there that kind
of looks cool until you realize that
people can do that and then you have a
family do I need do I like I live in a
really sweet place right now it's like
do I need and there's like another unit
in my building that I could buy that's
four bedrooms which is a third of the
price price or quarter of the price it's

[04:01]
price price or quarter of the price it's
like at what point is enough enough I
think what does not matter is the ticket
price on the house it's purely the
monthly cash payment that you're going
to outlay yeah yeah and if yeah I think
a really good qualifier is if you buy it
and that monthly payment causes you
stress yeah is it worth it that's the
thing that's that's the question because
if you can do it and you're like that's
a there go that's a marginal increase
and it like doesn't really stress me out
that much
cuz if you go down the rabbit hole of do
I really need this well does anyone like
aside from basic human needs does anyone
really need do you need to work as hard
as you do do you need to you know so
this is a really good segue with what I
want to talk about and why I came down
to perfect ship why we a nice natural
lead in here live in Miami the
shipyard um what up looking great the
reason I came down is if me me or you

[05:00]
reason I came down is if me me or you
were trying to make $10 million this
year or just someone was trying to make
trying to
do how would you do it do you have any
ideas different Trends you'd look at
niches like I want to spend this time
basically jamming on how we could make
$10 million and that could be within
your business or it could be just
complet you know other ideas that you
have yeah cuz that's the question
building off of what you currently have
or starting from cold zero nothing let's
start with nothing nothing yeah like
completely new business so I I filled
out a couple on your thing your idea on
pet supplements a a pet ag1 I think is
the single best business idea in the
world right now my God I hadn't heard
that but that is the single best
business because I would buy it right
now it's beautiful it takes what ag1 has
done which is an extremely high margin
product that is a complex formula that
you can't recreate there's no proof that
it works or doesn't work so you're
pretty much selling placebo Yep they're

[06:00]
pretty much selling placebo Yep they're
selling vegetables yeah like once you're
on it you're going to say you feel
better to justify the purchase that you
made no one is taking ad1 and be like I
don't feel any different it's like oh I
spent a bunch of money on this I feel
great and then they have such high
margin that they can just have a army of
Affiliates sending out the fact that
they're taking it so it's a genius
marketing funnel should we go build this
cuz I love this idea if you did this for
pets it's even better because there's
even less proof that it works like what
are you going to ask your pet if it's
feeling better from it scen supplement
no
so what so what you're talking about is
I went on my first million I I I pitched
this idea from that pod one of the
largest water manufacturers and water
companies in the world reached out to me
H and said if you can figure out what
the formula is I'll put it in the water
and we can like co-ack it together what
sorry stupid question what does water
have to do with it so it'll be
waterbased so you need like the Water
Production facility and stuff see okay

[07:00]
Production facility and stuff see okay
got it you're basically selling pet
water anyway also he has uh you know
he's in every Whole Foods in in the
world uh he's in you know every uh
Publix every Safeway all these big
grocery chains so if I did it with him I
wouldn't have to do just D Toc I could
also be in store interesting yeah so I
think you know I I I'm definitely
considering it you know but the you know
I think the reason I'm what's the
Counterpoint why wouldn't you I just
digital products are easier to build
Than Physical products um significant
for sure easier but lower upside yeah I
mean this has there are a lot of rich
people who are going to put that on
their credit card start feeding it to
their dog and then never ever once look
at it again that's right because the
risk of stopping to give stopping giving
your pet a supplement is higher risk
than giving stopping yourself cuz like
you could feel it but you won't see that
your dog feels worse I don't know I like
right when you said that cuz I think
already the smartest niche in the world

[08:02]
already the smartest niche in the world
I think what we could talk about are
niches that could build $10 million
businesses pets certainly one of them
because like plants are the new pets and
pets are the new kids yeah I was going
to say it's not even like the health
it's the emotional m i I would seriously
do anything I was I don't know why I had
this thought last night but I was like
if something happened to my dog and they
were like we have to do a life-saving
emergency and it's going to cost
$100,000 and insurance doesn't cover it
I'm pretty sure I would just rip that
immediately and not even think about it
I love my dog like more than anything
else in the world except for my wife you
know what I mean and so all a supplement
is is like the reinforcement of I care
about this part of my family totally you
know I love you it's saying I love you
without saying I love you dude and
there's the marketing it's saying I love
you every morning yeah say I love no
I've been watching a lot of Mad Men I
got Don Draper in my subconscious say I
love you
say I love you give them the gummy this

[09:01]
say I love you give them the gummy this
little this little vegetable gummy I
love you yeah bro whenever you you want
to if you want we got time for a board
meeting next week I'm ready to go like I
heard that and just because I think pets
I think another Niche that's interesting
is just general paid newsletters in any
Niche uhhuh where people are going to
pay for a constant stream of information
that they can't find elsewhere yeah so
not news I don't like there are a lot of
newsletters that have done well with
just the free and sponsorship but I
think the more Niche education that you
can provide on a paid basis and but
still Target the same niches like a
hyper Niche pet paid newsletter of you
have this specific type of dog and
here's the ongoing upkeep of just you
have a palski and that requires a
completely different way of thinking and
managing that dog and everything every
palsky owner in the world would pay for
that because it's so specific okay so
cool like to validate that idea Royal

[10:01]
cool like to validate that idea Royal
Kanan the the dog food company their
whole Innovation was we don't make we're
not going to compete on like price or
product packaging and just dog food in
general literally all they did was just
break out and say on this package this
dog food is for Border Collies whereas
this dog food is for golden retrievers
and there's very little I mean they say
that there is but come on like there's
very little Mar you know marginal
difference between the two so if you
think about that through the lens of
Education most people are like I'm going
to write another Finance newsletter or
I'm going to write another and they just
pick the big broad category but if you
think about it like hyper specific like
I have a border collie mix I would
subscribe to a paid newsletter on how to
take care of my border collie because
Border Collies have different Health
needs than a golden retriever would for
example and what do you think people
would pay for something like that is
that like a $10 mon 10 to 20 yeah 10 to
20 but then the thing is you have a
recurring base of purchasers that are
going to buy other things that you sell
because they're paying you right now

[11:00]
because they're paying you right now
right yep that's what people don't talk
about enough is that when when I bring
up paid newsletters they're just like
well just paid newsletters it's just
like okay I have a, people paying me $10
a month or $20 a month and I'm like to
start you do to start then you can layer
on that's the first purchase not the
last versus a lot of other companies
that when you sell a one-off product
it's the last thing and it aligns
incentives for you to continue to
deliver high quality information cuz
you're going to lose that customer and
then the ability to sell them more
things right I like that little mix and
Nuance of the newsletter being paid is
they're continuing to pay you which
forces you to put out good content
otherwise it just all goes create better
and better things like you're forced to
improve if you want to write a paid
newsletter what framework for new
categories do you have like how what
makes a good category versus an you know
a not good category um we wrote up this
little checklist we create so many
things now I'm like struggling to
remember the specifics but the the big
one is like a it has to be a very

[12:02]
one is like a it has to be a very
tangible asset so a lot of people are
like I'm going to start a paid
newsletter and they think that they can
write about whatever but something
happens when they make it paid that's
not really what's happening a paid
newsletter the way to think about it is
it's a book that never ends so it has to
be a topic that you want to repeat
infinitely the reader wants to consume
infinitely and every issue has to feel
like a tangible object so how do you
make it tangible like R right with AI
news letter every issue is here's a
framework but then here's the chat GPT
prompt so every time I give you a prompt
it feels like I'm giving you a a box
like an object you know so how do you
make every issue a recipe or a you know
some sort of like designed framework or
a prompt or a checklist like it has to
feel like a thing okay I have a uh a
prompt for you
so I have no idea where this is going do
paid newsletters just become paid AI

[13:04]
paid newsletters just become paid AI
agents or paid AI characters like when I
hear you talk about that I'm like okay
what you're saying is basically you know
you're right with AI newsletter I'm like
okay so basically I'm going to subscribe
to this and you're going to teach me
basically how to become a more prolific
writer in real time and I'm going to
basically read your newsletter and then
I'm probably going to open up chat GPT
and then I'm going to read your
newsletter I'm going to open up chat GPT
is the future of education and paid
newsletters more something like there's
the Dicky and and Cole bot basically
that's that you just like Ping and
you're like hey today I want to learn
about how to write copy for you know the
pet Niche and then you kind of have this
conversation yeah that's like that's
what agents are trying to be now you
know that's like the whole point of that
in the store but I think it's really
easy to jump to the conclusion that AI

[14:00]
easy to jump to the conclusion that AI
just replaces you and ai ai is good at
executing instructions but it's not very
good at creating net new things also my
my whole take on is AI good at like
completing tasks AI is basically an
intern yeah a very uneducated it's an
uneducated intern that is sloppy so if
it's not doing what you want uncinated
right your fault if it's not doing it
I'll say that for the camera it's an
uneducated uncinated intern Ai and like
love them for that understand that
that's what you're getting totally but
they're a genius yeah that's a Thing If
you program them right they can do
everything but they're just like yeah
literally what where my brain jumped
with as we were talking about like the
pet Niche and if you had a paid
newsletter the real upside I think comes
in the back end in how you can create as
many different specific paid newsletters
based on the same content so what you

[15:01]
based on the same content so what you
just said clicked in my head of Royal K9
is now marketing their pet food to
different dog niches the only change
they more than likely the only change
they made is on the label with a very
small mix of the product yeah so if you
had some kind of Baseline newsletter
with 500 different paid optins that you
could easily create with AI so that
that's where I think AI plays the
biggest role is you say I need 500
different versions of this one thing
here's how to create one version now go
create 500 mhm right because imagine how
many paid newsletter optin you could
have for how to raise your blank pet
like this kind of dog if you had 500
specific ones you'd have 500 more
potential optins versus just here's how
to raise your dog and that's that is the
modern-day Agora like do you know Agora
publishing say I do but for the okay
it's it's like one of the craziest but
like least well-known companies ever and

[16:01]
like least well-known companies ever and
their whole business model they were I
know because you've told me about it
most people don't know and they it's
like a billion dollar company and their
whole it's just a portfolio of paid
newsletters bundled with different
education products they they essentially
created that model and where everyone's
brain goes is oh okay a bunch of Niche
newsletters like how lucrative can that
be first first of all you're taking for
granted recurring Revenue because
recurring revenue is extremely valuable
and extremely cushy you know and then
second is Agora doesn't have like five
paid newsletters they have like hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds so what you
just described is just the modern day
version of that and you could build that
with far fewer employees far fewer
writers if you hit AI correctly well the
other thing is so going going back to
Agora and their model and why it's
brilliant is and going back to how do
you make 10 million doll in a year like
if you build a news a paid newsletter
that brings in a million dollars in
Revenue like chances are your margins
are 90 plus per. yeah and is it crazy

[17:02]
are 90 plus per. yeah and is it crazy
that that business is worth 10 to 12
times profit I wouldn't say it's crazy
it's not crazy you're you're within a
five or 10x if you wanted to sell it
yeah so but again like that's what's so
and we have yeah we have this
conversation all the time because it's
like hey why would you sell it because
the cash it's throwing off is amazing
and essentially autopilot and B it's not
just that asset it's that now you have
all those people that you can sell other
products to MH so why would you sell
that the only reason you'd sell it is if
you can't get a mortgage to buy this
apartment so here's the thing though
okay a couple interesting things on that
right the idea that we're going to have
paid newsletters as of right now that
are 300K a year between right with a
fiction writing and then write your way
to wealth we want to build that to a
million this year if someone came and
offered us 10x on that I'd probably sell
it at a million for 10 just I think
that's only because of where we are
because of relative to our but if you
were higher up you wouldn't do that so
it is a function but an interesting way

[18:01]
it is a function but an interesting way
to think about this and I've been
chatting with him is like if you look at
building a portfolio of Cashflow
businesses and some of the ones that are
more sustainable than the others like if
you have three paid newsletters that all
generate 300K a year because that's you
know 5,000 people paying you 20 bucks a
month that is so decentralized in terms
of How likely that is to go to zero your
risk it's extremely sustainable as long
as you keep writing it cuz like say you
hired a writer in the quality took a 10%
hit and stopped giving it any attention
the bleedout on that would still be
years and years and years of that cash
flow so if you can match some of your
personal recurring expenses like that
$28,000 like how if you could match your
mortgage that's 30 grand to a paid
newsletter with a th000 people paying
you 30 bucks a month and that was you
had almost pure confidence that that
wasn't going anywhere over the next 10
years you'd buy the house of course I
think right and that's why you know
everyone should have a I think a paid

[19:00]
everyone should have a I think a paid
newsletter or a paid Community to um
which is Sim is similar like we have a
we have a paid you know we call it a
membership paid membership that is like
part paid newsletter part community and
we charge $100 a month for it and like
dude we had 20 signups in the last 24
hours W it's like lifestyle cash flow
matching is an interesting topic
$2,000 a month okay but so to take this
a step further because
it's wild I don't see anyone on substack
doing this like even the biggest
newsletters the missed opportunity is
realizing that the recurring revenue is
the beginning not the end so what you
what happens is you have all these
creators that go I started a pay
newsletter and then they reach success
that you have paid newsletters on sub
substack doing hundreds of thousands or
even millions of dollars a year and then
they don't sell them anything else so
immediately the whole equation looks
different when you go and 10% of the
people who are paying me on a monthly
basis also bought the $20 ebook that I

[20:00]
basis also bought the $20 ebook that I
put together or also bought the $200
course I put together and I don't
understand why more people don't and
then to take that a step further right
then you can take all your paid
newsletters and at the end of the year
you can bundle them into a book right so
now there's another product like the way
I would so the way I would do it and I'm
curious your thoughts is I wouldn't
start by adding like digital assets to
start selling them I would think about
what is the most like .1% experience I
could offer to this group so for example
like with Community Empire our paid
membership and and email would you know
maybe I do something like instead of $99
a month for $500 a month like you can
have you know a a monthly dinner with
someone from our team or like something
for the DI hard fans like what's or
dinner once a year you have dinner with
me yeah you know as long as I think that
experience is also an option but it's
like what are you solving for and being

[21:01]
like what are you solving for and being
careful about your time involvement what
do you what do you want to commit to
time this is what it's taken both of us
a long time to start to internalize this
but time is always the easiest thing to
increase something in the short term tot
like we know we're like oh if we give
away our time we will increase revenue
on literally anything this month right
but then we're screwed like now we're
out of hours now we can't do anything so
a a a middle ground solution something
that we do a lot is
uh an experience bonus would be if you
have a paid newsletter you have a
thousand people on it and then you go
once a quarter I'm going to do a live uh
Workshop but it's paid so it's like 100
bucks 150 bucks hop on zoom and here's
the topic here's what we're going to
drill into that's an easy way of
increasing the LTV but also giving an
experience you can take the recording
you can add the recording to your
archive in the paid newsletter you have
an asset the compounds like that's a
nice little middle ground versus a lot
of people are like buy my premium and
I'll do an hour of coaching with you a
month and then all of a sudden you're

[22:00]
month and then all of a sudden you're
out of hours and you can't build
anything else it's funny I see like a
lot of solo preneurs do that and so like
they tweet about oh I escaped my job and
then it's like and I built this like bu
J yeah I built this new job most making
the exact same except I'm working twice
as hard I'm still selling my time Sol
preneurship is just a high Pang job
which in the beginning is great awesome
like if you're if you're brand new to
making 10 grand a month that's what you
should do totally but that's not going
to get you to to 10 million yeah no I
want to talk about 10 million during
this you know I know I'm with the right
people to talk about it with well
there's only one way to get the
apartment you got to you got to think
bigger you got to think bigger okay so
paid paid newsletters do you have any
specific ideas besides anything in pets
that you know if you weren't doing what
you're doing now you you'd go after um I
think if if we didn't have anything that
we were doing right now
but so say Dicky and I sold everything

[23:00]
but so say Dicky and I sold everything
that we had right now and we were
starting completely over I feel like
because of our personal interests the
next thing we would build would be like
a how to think about Finance as a as a
guy in your mid 20s to pre- 40 yeah cuz
I think that specific window of person
is and not to like exclude others but
it's just that type of person has such
unique challenges and questions and
things at that phase of life I think we
both would get I would start Ain I
someone actually messaged us in our
slack uh that my writing has been like
my writing over the last month has been
extremely personal to me for the most
part it's like what am I learning what
am I thinking about and I want to get
back into doing that more and he asked
if I was going to start a paid
newsletter to talk about these topics
cuz I don't want to go down that like as
much as it's fun to talk on social about
that I think there's something there's
like a stigma to talk about dating or

[24:01]
like a stigma to talk about dating or
Finance or like to you just don't want
people quote tweeting you when you talk
about money on Twitter it's way better
usually doesn't end well it like once
that escapes to NPC Twitter it just
becomes so toxic that you have to put
some kind of pay wall before you talk
about a lot of those things so I don't
know why why do you say that cuz cuz
people can't you can't talk about making
millions of dollars like it's going to
offend people the Aver especially on
Twitter gets extremely offed at the idea
that people have money so you have to
put up some kind of pay wall luckily I
don't think anyone listens to this
podcast that that because if you're
listening to this podcast like you're
you're you have a bias for Action to do
things and to to better yourself but
yeah you're right I I have gotten things
that have gone viral on Twitter and then
I look to see like all these Anonymous
accounts it's like completely it's not
good for you because it it
disincentivizes you to keep writing
about it versus if you write a small
$50 a month paid newsletter to a hyp

[25:00]
$50 a month paid newsletter to a hyp
specific group that engages with every
single thing then there's no point to
run on social about it you just have
this group who's telling their friends
if you can write a paid newsletter where
you're only marketing is people
forwarding it to a friend and saying hey
you got to sign up for this that's a
sweet spot yeah there and it's worth
saying this happens at every level like
if you're jamming with a small business
owner that's doing you know 200k a year
and you walk into the room and you're
like you got to think bigger this is how
get to 10 million a lot of them don't
want to have that conversation they're
like I like where I'm at and I don't
need you know it's like threatening and
then you go to a different room and it's
people with $5 million businesses and
someone's like hey you got to think
bigger to get to 50 not everyone in that
room is wants to have that conversation
so that that friction happens at every
level you know and so that's part of why
it's so difficult to find people to talk
about money with cuz like a lot of it
comes down to what level are you at
where do you want to go with it so you'd
start with a a paid newsletter on that

[26:02]
start with a a paid newsletter on that
topic and then where do you think you
would take it from there uh I mean I
think of all the businesses that we've
built in the past three years we've
learned that the group coaching model is
the fastest to scale mhm probably most
profitable like probably doing another
group coaching program would be lwh
hanging fruit because you can get a
group coaching program to to 510 million
like if you have a good category you can
do that and group coaching meaning like
uh how often do you do it like what what
does that look like well the way PGA for
example is structured is it's like a one
to many it's async curriculum plus we
have team members that specialize in
different things to answer questions so
there's realtime support we'll do like a
weekly Hot Seat that's live so there's
an Asing component there's a live
component there's a community component
so you have all these different things
working to either teach someone hold
them accountable gamify the journey you
know whatever it is um and you can do

[27:00]
know whatever it is um and you can do
that in a lot more categories Than
People realize the other thing I would
do if I were you and I was building this
is I would build a a SAS product along
with it so for for for this audience
like basically mint.com just recently
shut down yeah yeah I saw that that was
really surprising very surprising but
it's it is and it isn't because it is
because it was actually a great product
that was was trying to do too many
things for it was trying to do something
for everyone where I think Niche
personal finance is an interesting idea
like we use co-pilot to manage our stuff
co-pilot for X basically right exactly
is is is the idea so co-pilot for the
people who don't know is basically
mint.com track your net worth track your
credit cards track your personal stuff
um but yeah you it it was it was
everything in the kitchen sink it got to
that point because it was B by into it
MH um not surprisingly like they make
QuickBooks you know obviously the
QuickBooks people aren't going to make
the like most beautiful streamlined
products in in the world you know so

[28:02]
products in in the world you know so
copilot came in a couple two three years
ago and it's just a simpler mobile first
version and I heard they're killing it
um they're probably doing co-pilot yeah
it's only like six bucks a month I think
it I use it I showed you my workflow for
using itct beautiful it started off at I
think a $1.99 a month and then if you 3x
your prices and know and you're still
growing definitely that that's a good
sign yeah so is there an opportunity to
build co-pilot for X um for different
niches that's just kind of an
interesting problem yeah I think that's
the way to think about it you know like
especially with all the new like no code
tools AI tools I think you're going to
get a lot of smart driven individual
people just sitting at their laptop
being like I built the co-pilot for pet
owners of Border Coles yeah did you
listen to the most recent Allin from
this past weekend do you guys listen to
Allin
very very rely I think I listened to

[29:00]
very very rely I think I listened to
like half of it so uh freedberg had
David freedberg worked at Google doing a
bunch of stuff he had this really
interesting idea of SAS being like this
moment in time blip in terms of a viable
business model between software that you
had to download on your computer and
then software that can be written by AI
where now the ability for an individual
to spin up a more specific version of
all the oh sasses that are trying to do
everything for everyone is only going to
decrease right so if you have someone in
house if the most productive Engineers
can become 10 times more productive
using AI code and they're able to build
these products inh house that model goes
away in an interesting like that's an
interesting thread to pull on is how
many SAS platforms Could you actually
better tailor for your individual
experience that aren't that difficult to
build with co-pilot and other AI coding
tools and so I actually just sent a

[30:01]
tools and so I actually just sent a
newsletter this morning speaking to this
the one thing that I speak to about in
the newsletter is also the business
model changes so the way SAS works today
is you pay a monthly fee $66.99 a month
and you get access to the software where
I think things are going is it's going
to be pay per task yeah the CHT or back
to one time purchase I the base camp
guys just launched their slack yeah
slack killer or something like that and
it's just you pay for it once like old
school buy a CD put it in your computer
that's basically where but the reason
why I'm so fascinated with this is
because of the the idea of LTV relative
to just recurring Revenue because I feel
like a lot of times people will create
products that recur and they think if
once someone signs up that recurring
Revenue never goes away but really
there's always some sort of Tipping
Point you know so you're like okay my
average churn I know net net m TV on an
average customer is $215 you know so

[31:01]
average customer is $215 you know so
it's interesting to either have some of
that data or sort of speculate what that
data would be and go okay well if my
average LTV is going to end up being
around 200 why don't I just remove the
recurring option and sell full access
for 300 bucks and capture all that LTV
up front and force a different
purchasing decision totally or even if
you have an idea for co-pilot for X you
can build the landing page build the
mockups and be like
you know post on Twitter hey hey you can
pre-sell it prell it like to fund your
your development I think a lot of more
people are going to do that so many
different rabbit holes you could go down
with that like if you have fewer
Engineers working at every company but
more solo Engineers building things yeah
I want to talk quickly even though it's
like off topic about uh a conversation I
had with someone in M Miami the other
day so he we went for coffee and he was
telling me about uh a particular person
on Twitter that showing these Mr Numbers

[32:00]
on Twitter that showing these Mr Numbers
for a particular business and I happen
to know what the Mr was it a SAS it was
a Services based business I happen to
know the revenue of that and basically
the monthly I I got the updates for that
particular business and it was a person
that was basically posting on Twitter
and saying hey I get you know I got $10
million of Revenue 10 million ARR
divided by 12 Mr
and and he was like really upset about
it because he's like I'm out here I'm
trying I have you know almost a million
dollars AR it took me eight years and I
was like dude don't believe what you
read like don't make a you shouldn't
feel bad logging on to Twitter and
seeing that because it's not even
truthful H yeah most of it isn't it's
not and most numbers are just like if I
see another agency owner put that they
have 50 million in business pipeline by
taking people who fill out a
form like how can you say that you have

[33:00]
form like how can you say that you have
it's just type form that's like saying
if I took every email subscriber I have
and multiplied them if they bought all
my products and said I have 100,000
email subscribers and they all pay me
$100 so I have $10 million in email
pipeline you know what this is like I I
worked at an ad agency right out of
college and we used to have this joke
where you like ad agencies are so
liberal with how they talk about things
it's like walking into Walgreens and
buying toilet paper and being like
Walgreens is a client yeah it's like
like that's literally what people are
doing on Twitter they're like they're
like ah you know Walgreens is a client
it's like really it's like well yeah I
mean their toilet paper's great yeah
they're even worse Walgreens is a
partner yeah i' i' I've partnered with
uh yeah introducing nor America our new
partnership yeah with Walgreens there's
a lot of context stuff like people
taking lifetime revenue and calling that
the revenue of their business so they'll
be like I've done you know 5 million
bucks over the past 5 years and then
you'll see them go on podcast being like
how I built a five million business
that's not a $5 million business that's

[34:00]
that's not a $5 million business that's
a $1 million business that's been around
for 5 years that's right and like all
those little nuances it just makes It's
just sad because then you're all the
people that want to learn are looking at
that and and it's literally like you're
you're giving them a broken version of
the game to start and then they walk in
with all these unrealistic expectations
that's not how any of these businesses
operate and that's why I wanted to bring
it up it's it's for the people listening
who are embarking on the $10 million
journey and might see things on the
internet and people you know quote
unquote sharing in public so they're
taking it as the gospel we should set
some standards that there's just a
collective group of people who go around
policing anyone who doesn't talk in
monthly free cash flow that hits your
bank account monthly net free cash flow
post expenses is the only number that
matters in your business period full
stop and a story so what is 50 million
in business pipeline like okay but we're
actually doing 300K a month at 40%

[35:03]
actually doing 300K a month at 40%
margin so it's 120k a month free cash
flow uhhuh divide divided by three
Partners at plus expenses which means I
make 20 grand a month after tax really
it should be personal monthly after tax
free cash flow and then you could bubble
that up to the business level yes and
every time there should be like a like a
Chrome extension that every time like
every time you see $10 million it's like
it's the Twitter Community notes it's
like doing the math on this business
it's more than likely that this business
own takes $20,000 a month because that
normalizes it for everyone what is the
amount that hit your bank account after
all expenses at the end of every month
that's such if you didn't talk that you
should just get like there should be all
reply Bots be like this is the monthly
free cash flow bot this number is
[ __ ] like imagine that Twitter would
be such a better place that that
actually leads me to another idea
related to this we should build that
coffeezilla
for Tech entrepreneurs yeah seriously

[36:00]
for Tech entrepreneurs yeah seriously
like huge audience opportunity like
people would share that like crazy MH
and you can monetize that that's that's
actually a great Niche YouTube channel
so for people who don't know coffeezilla
YouTuber probably three plus million
subscribers and he exposes scams yeah um
and it's just like a guy with he goes
after cryp crypto most he's gone after
crypto he's gone after like Jake Paul
too or something with his yeah so you
get these like well-known people and he
he's like a journalist about it like he
has Integrity I bet yeah and he he
really uh does a great job so and people
share that right because you know well
number one people like to see other
people fail let's be real well it's like
the business world's TMZ you know
totally that's a better way of
describing it like there was a point
Gawker do you remember Gawker oh yeah
tell tell people what Gawker was for
most people don't remember I mean it was
like a a news publication but they would

[37:02]
like a a news publication but they would
like do hit pieces and they would like
go after people Ryan holiday wrote a
whole book about The Gawker story going
after and right I don't I don't know too
much about Gawker to be honest it was
basically like uh yeah it was like a
gossip column for for business yeah they
shot down after the lawsuit right they
shot down because they went bankrupt
well Peter teal I think oh yeah sued
them if anything the the old like uh
this whole Fiasco that happened with
open Ai and how it was like the coolest
thing to ever happen to anyone who
worked in Silicon Valley cuz they got to
talk about it it was like Keeping Up
with the Kardashians for nerds in San
Francisco like the most important thing
and all they could they'd wake up and
like check the news be like what's Sam
doing now literally myself included I
did that for 48 hours you know that was
an interesting thought experiment I
couldn't sleep I was just thinking about
Sam Alman all night yeah I didn't like
that I don't know that didn't interest
me at all I was like that just seems
weird cool like he's either going to

[38:00]
weird cool like he's either going to
work there or not work there yeah you
know the okay the other one that gets me
is the person who goes I made all this
Revenue only working one hour a day and
I'm like nobody does that you like or or
also the joke of like the morning
routine thing where it's like you look
at all these entrepreneurs they're like
I'm awake at 3:00 a.m. I've had a full
protein breakfast and red light sauna
and I've run 7 Miles by 4:30 a.m. you
know and it's like you're looking at
this and you're like maybe you've done
that one time you know and then and just
like the person who takes the pipeline
and like rounds up they do it one time
and they're like and in theory if I did
do this every day that would be my
morning routine and then they make
people feel bad cuz they're not yeah
it's it's like oh I I woke up and I was
tired this morning like I was about to
tweet this and I didn't but I had it
like drafted I was like I woke up
yesterday and I basically woke up I

[39:00]
yesterday and I basically woke up I
flooded myself with coffee I took a nice
warm shower I woke up at 7:30 a.m. B I
woke up at 7:30 a.m. flooded myself with
like four coffees literally drowned
myself in coffee took a coffee bath yeah
and uh I took a warm long shower not
like a cold bath just a warm long shower
s it was warm I even I busted it even
hot hot hot it's like steam everywhere
can can I give you an upgrade you got to
buy these uh shower Steamers do you have
shower Steamers no is do I need one of
those dude it's like a it's like a bath
bomb for a shower really oh my gosh it
feels like you're in a spa it's amazing
you just unwrap it you throw it at the
bottom the water comes down and smells
like lavender amazing keep buying it do
you know how expensive those are you get
a bag of like 12 of them for like 40
bucks or something I'm like add it to
your shower routine this is something
I'm trying to do more though cuz right
now here's the idea sorry okay what are
they called steam

[40:00]
they called steam
shows shower steamers for your
dog actually though or your dog you know
they need a better bath yes they it's
like a CBD to make them calmer in the
bath you know cuz dogs get stressed out
about it yeah right your dog hates the
bath unless they have bath CBD bomb I
would buy this right now and for cats
right uh-huh and for geres yeah cats
hate water right so if you want to like
make it a l more it's like a dry
cleaner no but honestly
honestly that concept steam showers for
the productive Tech entrepreneur so like
the product the Andrew huberman type guy
oh I mean think about okay how do they
sell tea you go into the the tea aisle
and it's just white label green tea but
one of them says calm and one of them
says energy and one of them says Focus
right you're going to buy the one that
says the word of the thing that you
associate with so you could easily do

[41:02]
associate with so you could easily do
that for any category or any Niche take
the tech entrepreneur and do shower
steamers for raising your first round
and you're stressed out yeah right yeah
huberman's drink is going to if if he
started a drink that was like sparkling
water theanine caffeine everything that
he re everything that he recommends you
take in the morning and it was just
called like you
and it's got nothing else and only
marketed it to that specific type of
person it would crush call it sunrise
and say only people who wake up before
the sun gets up drink this like done do
this and stare at the sun yeah the dicky
Bush I actually think we're seeing the
anti- huberman effect right now so that
was a bit of my tweet that I was going
to right yesterday I was I was going to
I was going to say like at the end of my
here's what I did this morning I I today
I felt like the anti-hu yeah what's the
what's the oh in that you like don't
have a morning optimize this is I put

[42:01]
have a morning optimize this is I put
this in the notes of the doc is like
esoteric Health Twitter is always two
years ahead of like everyone else so
they're they're already on that train of
like anti-optimization now leaning more
into like intuition and things like that
but I don't know you know there's both
sides there's always a trend and there's
always an anti Trend and it feels like
hberman has gotten so big that of course
you're going to have people be like I
don't want to do a cold punch I I like
my hot showers I am sick of how many
more people are in the sauna in cold
plune since it got popular though yeah
specific groups of people why you you
like why does it why does it make you
mad well I like to not talk to anyone
the worst are the people who are in the
sauna now just sparking up a goddamn
podcast conversation it's like oh let's
just start talking to everyone it drives
the last thing I want to do that's why I
say I'm unemployed when anyone asks what
I do in the SAA well you shouldn't say
you're unemployed cuz if you're employed
I have nothing to offer you I have no
conversation I got nothing for you buddy

[43:01]
conversation I got nothing for you buddy
yeah I want to sit here in silence if I
accountant that works yeah accountant is
better if I met an unemployed person in
the sauna I'm like I need at a luxury
gym yeah I need I looking for who are
you got nothing for you buddy that's
like my go you're my you know you're
mysterious you're wearing Lululemon you
know I don't get it something isn't
adding up that's true yeah yeah I hate I
hate that but there's a specific typee
of person that has started to do that
that only comes to the gym now to like
sauna and Cole plune MH and they're just
getting their optimization routine in
and not doing anything else I heard
that's called a professional workout did
you hear the executive workout no steam
room in a weak R shot yeah I used to do
that one in New York every once in a
while a wheatgrass shot yeah Oh I
thought you said a wheat grass shower
shot the executive steam is Frid morning
Friday morning on Wall Street that's a
thing okay okay I want to I want to end
off with uh got this note notes file of
all these ideas I've got about 100 ideas
in in there here amazing I'm going to

[44:01]
in in there here amazing I'm going to
give you a couple and you can tell me if
it's you like them or you don't like
them good reads someone needs to
reinvent good reads yeah I hate that
platform like
it's it's such a great idea like a
social network around books um
essentially and reviews around
books um what's it called a letter box
was recently acquired by tiny and Andrew
wilon M I can see and letter boxes for
for films I can I could see like a
letter box level in terms of design for
good reads I feel like we're due for it
they were acquired by Amazon I think
many years ago I think a a good reads
for podcasts or good reads for your
Twitter feed would be interesting right
what if you could integrate your Twitter
feed with like your liked tweets all
went somewhere and then you could see
and talk to or connect with other people
who also like those same tweets or
listen to those same podcasts
that could be kind of cool yeah that's
interesting it I mean all this sort of
just speaks to the broader Trend which

[45:01]
just speaks to the broader Trend which
is there's just way too much content
like we just can't consume all of it so
you're probably going to see same with
that niching down idea more and more
platforms that are like here's how to
parse just the feed on Twitter versus
here's how to parse just the podcast you
listen to on Spotify versus just the
videos you watch on YouTube you know
just too much too much so what do you
think what do you rate that that idea on
um no sevens no sevens I would use it
I'd use it more I don't like good reads
yeah I never really used good reads I
don't know I know people who use it to
count the number of books they read
that's it like they add the books that
they read to it but I don't know I
wouldn't be excited to work on it but I
would use it I I feel like a
cooler there you go there there's my
summ that's a good answer hly I feel
like a cooler feature is uh isn't in
Amazon Kindle like and I don't I don't
use it but I just know of it where you
can see how many other people have
highlighted the same sections like that

[46:01]
highlighted the same sections like that
to me is a lot cooler um but that's how
you can start that's how I would start
off good reads 2.0 would be probably
that I think readwise is probably
trending in that direction some kind of
consolidation of all the highlights yeah
true cool can I can I give you one of my
business ideas yeah all right so one of
mine is I think that the next Simon and
Schuster or penguin random house or
whatever is going to be one individual
that builds I mean one author but has
like a whole team so the an author is
being treated like a venture back
startup and the team and that author
train an entire model on how that
specific author outlines a certain type
of story how they write it vocabulary
choices like really really in-depth and
then it allows that author and that
style to you then have the ability to
create a book a week or a book a day and
you can just flood an entire subcategory
imagine James Patterson could actually

[47:01]
imagine James Patterson could actually
do this right now James Patterson's like
I want to write Thrillers he already
writes co-writes with other people he's
doing the manual version of it with
another author he does a book a month
okay well if he took the time and built
a model he could write a James Patterson
level book a day yeah and I that's going
to happen it's just a question of who
goes and builds it how long does it take
and you have to have enough of a library
to train the model on you cuz the
problem you see it with now like open AI
that was the whole issue is like you
can't go train your model on other
people's content without those other
people going hey what the hell that's
right so the solution is you have to
have produced enough volume to train the
the model on you and you're the
copyright owner and the problem and why
James Patterson can't do this is because
his publisher owns all his stuff so now
there's a conf so is a publisher going
to build it is he allowed to build it
you know but I'm really fascinated by

[48:00]
you know but I'm really fascinated by
the idea of what does it look like for
an author to create a book a day and
have it actually be 80 90% quality of
what you would produce on your own yeah
I mean the average author does what a
book every three years two three years
yeah if that five years I think it's an
it's interesting and he he was the one
who broke that model and went I want to
do I there were a couple authors before
him but he was really the one that went
I want to do two or three or four books
a year and then now as far as I know
he's one of the only authors that cranks
out consistently a book a month every
month year after year after year he's
doing the manual version because he's
working with other writers yeah my guess
is this also translates pretty well to
music oh same thing's going to happen
same thing yeah yeah I like this idea
it's probably like an 87 87 for you you
said no sevens oh 8.7 okay cool I'll
take it that's fine
you got any good ones siki it's not
something I actually do much it like

[49:00]
something I actually do much it like
brainstorm random business like I don't
have that note I was how my brain work
see I was I wrote something the other
day that I love to learn but I'm not
curious at all where I don't go down
internet rabbit holes about random
things and I felt guilty for that for a
long time like random ideas and going
down and spending like 10 hours on
YouTube I don't like to do I don't know
I think one of us needs to have that
trade yeah I'm like what am I doing
right now and what's the next logical
step I I don't know I felt guilty but
now I'm kind of leaning into it as a
superpower no it's it's great in the
opposite way you know cuz I just don't
care about how the world Works people
are like I'm fascinated by how the world
works I'm like I just care that it works
I don't really care at all about how
right uh last idea before we before we I
love that about you one of us has to so
I'm uh looking to buy some art and I got
a great I got an artist that you should
buy
okay he's on the up and up and I think I
think you could tick The Tick the okay

[50:01]
think you could tick The Tick the okay
we we'll talk about that I'll put you on
to him yeah there doesn't seem to be a
good Marketplace for secondhand curated
art isn't that what Master works or
Master something in what way what do you
mean by that so there's places where I
can buy art that other people have owned
before of course there's artsy which is
like the big platform do you guys know
artsy M it's basically like the Amazon
for or art but they have like pieces in
the tens of millions or millions of
dollars to pieces that are $100 and some
of them are like new pieces and some of
them are someone else you know used so
to speak I think there's probably an
opportunity to do a marketplace with
curated pie pieces meaning it's not as
overloaded with like here's 1 million
pieces here's maybe a subset um and also
the ability to rent pieces I was
actually just thinking that like a
Airbnb I want to rent your Picasso for
the weekend because I'm throwing a party
yeah it' be kind of cool there's a huge

[51:01]
yeah it' be kind of cool there's a huge
level of risk in that obviously but
renting pieces is seems interesting it
also is like genz and Millennials our
attention span is a lot less so it's
like yeah I might enjoy this Picasso for
a weekend but I don't know I hate it
now I think about that a lot with like
the hedonic adaptation of nice things
like renting a nice car you can get 90%
of the benefit
and then then you like if you rent a
really nice car for 3 Days on the fourth
day you start to pick out things about
the car that you don't like and that's
like when you should give it up because
then when you own it fulltime you're
like damn like I went to Germany and
rented a Porsche to drive on the Autobon
and it was sick the first two days and I
remember returning it on the third day
being like [ __ ] kind of cramped in
here like and I remember I was like
that's a perfect time to get rid of that
thing because the second you have any
kind of complaint I think the same thing
goes for like apartments or I don't know
Apartments might be different but cars

[52:00]
Apartments might be different but cars
or art or things like that how can you
get 90% of the upside with just the
initial access and then not make it into
something that owns you in the long term
it's a good point and maybe this is a
narrative I put I'm putting in my head
but after this conversation I feel like
apartments and homes doesn't fit in that
category of you you know you don't I
don't think you get used to a beautiful
home like I feel like or do you I don't
know like you you definitely do you
definitely do so then why would I buy
this apartment be I so my argument
though is because it is the place where
you most likely spend the majority of
your time and so it's sort of like your
bed like of all the things to max out
you should probably max out the thing
that you spend six seven eight hours a
night in every night for your whole life
you know and your home I think is very
similar you spend especially now that we
all work from home and like what why
would you not want to optimize that
whereas a car it's like and and I think

[53:00]
whereas a car it's like and and I think
it all comes back to it what's the
pressure it puts on you relative to the
enjoyment or the you know I think the
solution is have someone that prevents
you from thinking about the house in a
negative way at any time which is
basically if [ __ ] stops working you
actually don't even realize it someone
is there to repair there's like an on
call right because otherwise you're just
like bitching about your $30 million
house and what sucks about it and that's
just a place you want to avoid you don't
want to be there which will happen cuz
like your toilet's going to break and
that's going to be annoying [ __ ]
house you
know yeah dude this has been so that was
pretty solid this is
solid proud of us we got some good juice
going this is I like this it's all it's
all because of the shipyard it's all so
thank you for for inviting me here and
and allowing this we should do this more
we this a standing thing I would love
that I think the first of many I would
love that um where could my audience go
and find out more about what you get
they'll find us find us on Twitter Dicky
Bush or Nicholas Cole 77 yeah start

[54:02]
Bush or Nicholas Cole 77 yeah start
rting online.com they they'll find us
they'll find us yeah I have this a
heuristic that I've kind of been using
is if with all of the things that we
create if you can't find your way to the
thing that's a little bit of a signal
like yeah but we there's also the
counter point we create so many things
that like where should you go that's
true but yeah okay that's that's fair
but also just like just Google it you
know totally I had this I had this
happen the other day uh we had we hiring
like a product designer and I posted
about it and I had said go apply it on
the on the website so some someone some
guy reached out to me and he was like
Hey like I can find like the job the job
like the career section on on the late
checkout website I hate to bring it to
you but that's a signal that's a signal
I and it's like I'm I had to respond I
was like Hey like the best little hack I
found for that is when we're
interviewing someone ask them to send
you the calendar invite for the time you
send them and just like see that they

[55:00]
send them and just like see that they
can [ __ ] check a box of schedule it
at the right time add a zoom link XYZ
it's like the first little micro test of
their General competence yeah another
one that gets me is like we'll tweet
something and then we'll append it and
go and by the way if you want to start
writing check out ship30 with a link to
ship 30.com and then someone will
comment and say what's ship 30 if you
click the link the entire site will tell
you what it is you know and like that
it's such a small or sorry one more cuz
I've been doing all these interviews for
a new hire we're making another one is
you send a cal invite and then I'll send
the person an email and say great chat
with you then let's use the zoom Link in
the description I can't tell you how
many people go sit in the Google meet
link and that to me it's such a small
thing but I'm like that shows me just
that small level of detail that you're
not you know that's the clip
you're fired I find you in the Google
meet it just got a there's someone
waiting in there be like sorry you

[56:00]
waiting in there be like sorry you
failed the first step of this job
application please don't apply again no
seriously there's there's this sorry
real real quick just there's this have
you seen the bear I got to say have you
seen the bear no oh my God amazing show
okay but there's this scene where
they're hiring like a mat D and they're
doing the interview and the girl is like
oh she was great I think we should hire
her and the guy is like there's no way
we're hiring that person she's like why
the interview went so well and he points
to one of the place settings and he had
like turned it so there were three the
right way and one was wrong and he was
like she just sat here the entire time
and did a 45-minute interview and didn't
fix that place setting that would have
driven me nuts no attention to detail
we're not hiring that person and like
that it's the zo it's the zoom thing
it's like you know or someone emails me
they put a h in my name I'm like
immediately I'm like you don't have
attention to detail mhm it's not that
hard totally my name's not Craig it's
Greg yeah I saw a new one for you

Nicholas Cole k l like Cole's the
shopping thing I was like I've seen a
