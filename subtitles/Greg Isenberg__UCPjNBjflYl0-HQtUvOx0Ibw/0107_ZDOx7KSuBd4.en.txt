[Music]
thank you this is a special episode
because it's with my dear friend Peter
schallard and right before this episode
I was thinking about our relationship
and we've had some magical moments just
some magical moments
some crazy stuff has happened
um we've been to Lithuania together we
saw Carl Lagerfeld basically on the
floor uh next to us do you remember that
no what do you remember so in Lithuania

[01:00]
no what do you remember so in Lithuania
he you know we were speaking at a
conference Seth Godin was speaking at a
conference and Carl lagerfed was like
sandwiched in there and he went up on
stage and he basically well number one
he tried to convert everyone to
Catholicism and then the second thing he
did was he was he was like I'm gonna
wait and he just basically like
laid down on the stage while like 10 000
people were watching him the largest
stadium in Central Europe it was the
yeah it was the largest business
conference in Europe like period it was
a it was a massive Sports Arena
um I but but wait I think you're
thinking of Jean-Claude Van Damme oh
that is who I'm that is who I'm talking
about you're right yeah how could I
forget yeah
it's funny yeah the fact that that uh it
was John Claude Van Damme wasn't even
the strangest part of it all but yeah he
lay he told the crowd that the world was
going to end and he and he laid down on
the stage and did breathing exercises
for a while
um totally get that you might
misremember because it feels like a

[02:00]
misremember because it feels like a
dream
yeah so I wanted to bring you on the
show because you're you're the shrink
for entrepreneurs and I feel like I've
got a few stories with you but I feel
like you've got just hundreds thousands
of stories because you're working with a
lot of some of the most well-known
people
um but before we get into that how do
you define what a shrink for
entrepreneur is yeah well thanks for
having me I'm excited to be chatting
um shrink for entrepreneurs is you know
my my background I'm a psychotherapist
by training my I and I am an
entrepreneur sort of my first but is
well I am an entrepreneur when I started
I wasn't my first business was a brick
and mortar therapy practice
um and so what what I did was was kind
of long very long story short build a
specialty I'm working with Founders a
lot of uh a lot of Founders in Tech a
lot of venture-backed Founders helping
them with with psychology with therapy
and then uh as you and I have discussed
you know what I kind of ended up doing
was taking the world's greatest life

[03:02]
was taking the world's greatest life
long MBA program because by working with
these people I got to learn as much from
them as I was helping them with their
psychology so I've been at this for best
part of 14 years now and it's been the
world's greatest MBA that I was paid to
take and so now I get to talk to my
clients not only about psychology but
business strategy as well and and
literally every single entrepreneur I
work with has the same story about what
happened right before they met me which
is oh I went looking for a therapist I
knew I wanted to do you know some
therapy some coaching I knew I wanted to
optimize my thinking and behavior and um
and then they just have this weird
experience of talking to someone who
just completely doesn't get it right
like there's this sort of it's almost
like a civilian attitude of just not
knowing how entrepreneurship works that
you know unfortunately most people who
specialize in therapy they just they
couldn't be further away from the the
coal face of Entrepreneurship and they
just don't get it there's this gulf of
misunderstanding

[04:00]
misunderstanding
um and so yeah it's uh kind of world's
greatest Niche that I that I stumbled
upon um and and okay so walk me through
how you actually help people like me
yeah so
um well first of all I generally meet
people like you the morning after the
darkest night of the Soul so I tend to
think about like any type of therapy is
you tend to reach out and get started
when things are very very bad
um so I meet a lot of people in crisis
there's a lot of uh you know over the
last decade there's been a few VC funds
that will have me on speed dial for when
a Founder that they believe in and they
want to lead a company kind of has one
of those crisis situations where if it
goes badly they might end up not they
might end up not being the right person
to lead the company so I'm usually a
resource that's put in to help the
founder accelerate their personal growth
and development when the company is such
a rocket ship that it's like you know
doubling every couple of months in size
it's a it's the founder is waking up

[05:00]
it's a it's the founder is waking up
every day to a totally new business
because of the scale and the speed at
which it's scaling and
um yeah and there's and and their job as
CEO is changing so rapidly that like you
know it's totally reasonable for anyone
to kind of get some Whiplash from that
so what I help them what I help Founders
do is accelerate the rate of their
development as operators As Leaders
they're interpersonal skills their
ability to do really great investor
relations and I do that by helping them
really iron out their cognitive biases
and blind spots so you know any areas
where a limitation in their thinking is
causing them to not see the truth of
what's going on and this is where this
conversation can get really fractal
right because we could talk about
thousands of different examples
um but a good one for a Founder who's
really winning is like being a being a
foil for their hubris right it's really
easy for people who have quick wins to
get carried away

[06:00]
get carried away
um and start to believe that everything
they touch turns to gold and lose lose
their kind of psychological calibration
to what the actual result is what what's
going on in their business and they
might be winning when they start feeling
that way but they may not notice it when
they stop winning right when the when
when when problems start occurring and
so part of what I do is increase provide
this like radical hit of self-awareness
for entrepreneurs by being somebody that
they're talking to who's like objective
who's outside of the Fishbowl who's
helping them see reality for what it
really is so pretty pretty abstract but
hopefully that makes sense could you
yeah I I wanna I wanna take a few
minutes to selfishly get you to coach me
right now let's do it therapy for Greg
let's go how are you doing Greg how am I
doing right now amazing I'm in
Charleston South Carolina
and I you know running I run a holding
company so I run a bunch of different
startups so that's like a you know a
roller coaster on steroids there's

[07:01]
roller coaster on steroids there's
several roller coasters at once right
several rollers are one so sometimes
it's helpful for me just to like take a
step back and just extract myself from
the situation and like go somewhere like
Charleston and sort of uh rebalance
myself so that's what I'm doing right
now rebalancing and it's been awesome I
feel awesome to answer your question I
feel great nice and uh what is it that
you think you need to focus on when it
comes to your thinking and behavior to
really crush the next 12 months what
what type of Greg do you need to be for
this holding company you've built I
would say the most important decision
that me and many Founders can make is
ignoring the noise it's so easy to chase
shiny objects especially if you're
running a studio and a holding company
because the world is your oyster so what
I'm trying to get better at is you know
we for example yesterday there was the
Apple event the brightest of shiny
objects and there was a listen there was
a lot of really cool stuff that's gonna

[08:01]
a lot of really cool stuff that's gonna
like transform our businesses but at the
same time like do I need to be like
stopping what I'm doing and watching it
and spending the whole day just kind of
you know digesting what's happening like
probably not like you know I probably
can take a Saturday morning catch up on
it in a more Leisure Way and that's
probably more healthy for my well-being
well-being than sort of being really
really oh my God I need to go stop
everything and rethink everything while
it's happening right on yeah so what
you're talking about is a real important
key to mental health
um it's it's a it's a principle of
agency and volition that
um one of the big things that can change
out like relationship to stress
overwhelm our ability to focus isn't
even really about what we do right like
you might watch that keynote start to
finish but it's about being in control
of the choice so that you're the one
with the agency that it's not Tim Cook
deciding that 10 a.m Pacific on a
Tuesday or a Monday or whatever is uh is

[09:02]
Tuesday or a Monday or whatever is uh is
when Greg stops work and focuses on this
it's about you to having like you having
the agency you being the one who's in
the driver's seat because even if you're
tactically getting distracted by the
bright shiny object at least you're
choosing to you've got a thesis about
why not's right to do that right so you
don't need too much therapy you're doing
it right Greg you're very smart staying
in chat staying in charge and deciding
these things is important because you
know the Apple event's like a big one
and it only happens once or twice a year
but I think you know these social media
platforms can be really dangerous for
entrepreneurs because they'll look at
you know they'll look at a tweet that
they're just scrolling on the phone
while they're sitting on the John before
they start working on on a given day and
they'll see something really interesting
that's one of those bright shiny objects
and it can feel like oh this is game
changing information for my industry and
whatever they intended to do that
morning's out the window now because
they're going down this Rabbit Hole of
like learning but the rubber is like and
this is what I kind of want to find out

[10:00]
this is what I kind of want to find out
from you is how what is the rubric for
deciding like I think you're someone who
would have a really in interesting
answer to this because with a holding
company ostensibly you are looking out
for really interesting New Opportunities
right how do you what type of criteria
do you have mentally at that earlier
stage when you find yourself getting
sucked in and getting curious and seeing
the possibilities like are they like
green lights and red lights for you
mentally about like do I lean in do I go
further do I do I look into this thing
because uh if you do that all day then
the stuff that you're the mature
companies that you're that you've got
opportunity to scale are you know going
to Wither on the vine right you can't do
it all so how do you decide a few things
one is or if you're listening to this
and pulling up a coffee cup it's an
empty coffee cup and why is it an empty
coffee cup well number one I love coffee
but number two I only go on Twitter
while I'm drinking coffee I call it the
coffee framework so I drink a coffee in
the morning and a coffee in the
afternoon and while I'm drinking those

[11:02]
afternoon and while I'm drinking those
coffees like I'm allowed to go on
Twitter that's when I do my tweets
that's why if you look at you know most
of my tweets they happen between the
hours of 9 and 10 30 a.m Eastern because
that's when I'm generally having my
first coffee and I allow myself to
basically be like take it all in just go
wild go like it's an all you eat all you
can eat buffet for Twitter in the
morning and in the afternoon when I'm
you know if I'm on the John so just you
know I like I I'm gonna want to pull out
my my Twitter and I just try to refrain
from doing that and it's just about
setting these systems for yourself so
that
um you know I always say don't let push
notifications push you around
um and that's the second thing which is
I don't know why 99.9 of people do not
have Do Not Disturb mode on at all times
like Do Not Disturb mode should be the

[12:00]
like Do Not Disturb mode should be the
default should not be you're getting
buzzed every single time something
happens in the world all notifications
off by default off by default like what
are you doing you know and I try to do
this so I can actually have like the
time and space to like think about okay
like what do I want right now what is
good for my businesses and it takes me
from being on the defense to being on
the offense really quick and this is
something that I've been doing for like
six six and eight months and it's it's
really really like it's literally
transformed my business that's
incredible what so when you do have
something that I'm just turning this
into an interview less of a therapy
session when you do have when you do
have something that you really like when
you have an idea when you have the very
beginnings of something you think you
want to pursue as an entrepreneur how do
you know internally like I'm curious
about your psychology how do you know
internally this is something good that I
should look like that I should explore
versus like you know those very natural
mental dialogues we have where we're

[13:00]
mental dialogues we have where we're
like that's a distraction I've got to
stay away from it so I don't know man I
built like an intuition and you just
gotta trust your gut like there's a
reason why we have our guts you know and
there's a reason why we feel certain
things I'm laughing to myself because I
was chatting with my co-founder her Theo
yesterday and I was like and I quote we
should do X I'm 100 sure it's gonna work
and then he's sitting there like 100
percent like what are you are you on
crack like the 100 how are you sure that
if we're gonna go build that product or
do that thing that it's 100 chance and
sometimes you just gain so much
conviction based on your gut that you
just need to you need to follow your gut
and yeah I would I wish like like in my
20s I followed my gut sometimes but I I
really followed other people's guts I
would be like okay if
um Kevin Rose from dig is building a
video startup I need to build a video
startup or you know Kevin Systrom from

[14:01]
startup or you know Kevin Systrom from
Instagram is starting you know a news
app I should build a news app and now
I'm kind of trying to like ignore as
much as possible and with the hopes that
the stuff that I create becomes way more
uh you know as Seth Godin puts it
remarkable something that you'd make a
remark of I mean this is one of the most
kind of common cognitive biases that can
trip up entrepreneurs who have like got
something and they're running with it
right is that that imitative desire
that's driven by starting to like form a
peer group what a lot of people who are
starting out don't know is that it
actually gets worse the more successful
you become because you start to feel
that you're sort of at the table with
some of these amazing people and so a
lot of entrepreneurs the more traction
they get the more success they they
create they start to pay more and more
attention to what their peers and also
the people who are just a little ahead
of them who might have pretty big
profiles like what those people are
doing and what they're reacting to and

[15:00]
doing and what they're reacting to and
what their insights and their mental
calculus is about like the next big
thing hence Kevin Rose is doing a video
app you've got to do a video app right
like a lot of that that effect actually
becomes harder to resist the more kind
of experience that you get until you get
a level of maturity I think an
intellectual maturity out the other side
of it where you learn to put those
things aside and that's one of the big
things that I'll try to help
entrepreneurs really focus on is this
idea that people like Kevin Rose to use
your example you know other like a level
players doing really interesting stuff
they're reacting like their insights
their strategy that they might be like
building in public right and tweeting
about or whatever that stuff comes from
their reaction to like primary sources
of information so they see things
happening in the world and then they go
and build something because of it and
then they talk about what they're doing
so a lot of entrepreneurs pay attention
to what these people are saying about
what they're doing and they get that
imitative desire and one of the ways

[16:02]
imitative desire and one of the ways
that you can fix this cognitive bias is
by focusing if you are going to consume
information on the primary sources so
that your intuition your instincts are
reacting to the same information that
these people like Kevin Rose are also
reacting to because you're you're more
likely to form a unique point of view if
you're looking at what's happening in
the objective world and thinking what
can I do with that like what could I
build with that rather than looking at
hey what are these people doing right in
how are they reacting to the real world
to reality because there's a you know
there's a Plato's Cave allegory there
right if you're looking if you're just
watching where they where the other
people are moving to you're not seeing
what it is that they're moving toward
right like what their reaction is so
um yeah there's a there's a terrific
opportunity for entrepreneurs who you
know who can figure this out to to trust
their Instinct
um and you know and and that's the path

[17:00]
um and you know and and that's the path
that you're going to take to develop a
unique point of view that's going to be
that's going to build a product that
look at my 6 see it or fail like when
you say you're 100 certain you should
get after something the way I read that
is you're 100 certain that it's going to
be really really interesting right like
it could be a really big win or it could
be like a spectacular learning
experience you're 100 certain of like a
potent outcome exactly and that was
actually Theo's response he started
laughing and because he knows how
ridiculous it is to say something like
that and he was like okay so what you're
really saying is how do we win even
though we lose which I think was a
really interesting way of framing it
what do you what he means by that is
okay crazy founder CEO of guy uh you
know I understand that you're have got a
lot of conviction
um but this feels like a zero to one a
zero or one thing like it's either gonna
really be successful or it's gonna fall
flat how do we make sure that we if it
falls flat that we still learn because

[18:01]
falls flat that we still learn because
in the holding company model in the
product Studio model learning is all
also helpful because you can basically
say like okay I learned this you know
how to do Twitter ads or whatever and I
can apply that to even though we spent
fifty thousand dollars on Twitter ads
and it went nowhere we can actually
apply that to another one of our
business right gotcha yeah yeah that's
an inch we were jamming about just
recently um when we hung out I think
there's been a really big shift that you
know with the holding company you're at
the front of of like needing to the
strategy of getting after getting after
opportunities where there's obviously a
win but then failure is like an actual
of the win like a real concrete win
because I think we're coming out of a
period this is what you and I were
chatting about of like big investing and
technology companies a lot of hype kind
of reached its absolute peak in 2021
where and you know in in that VC model
it's it's like go big go go big or go
bust that like you you want to be

[19:00]
bust that like you you want to be
swinging for the fences a lot of people
with shooting at crazy Big Ideas where
there were 100 percent certain it was
going to win or be an absolute massive
failure right and uh when there's enough
Capital floating around the system you
can like rinse and rip you can you can
you can take those shots but now there's
an opportunity for entrepreneurs to to I
guess like chase after ideas where
there's an opportunity at really big
success but even taking another fork in
the road is like a different type of
success right like trying to build a
really big scalable company but if it
doesn't go so well you accidentally
build like a small cash flowing business
that runs itself
um these types of Dynamics I think we're
going to see more and more of yeah I
think so let's talk about VC versus
non-vc a little more so and it relates
to your whole idea the idea that like
people are sort of following other
people and copying other people what's
that book uh the medic Renee Girard
um yeah yeah I don't know everybody

[20:00]
um yeah yeah I don't know everybody
every every everyone in Silicon Valley
knows the name of that book but I can't
remember it right now yeah I mean the
point of that book is basically that
like people buy things that other people
buy to self-identify and when you think
about Venture Capital that is a business
that is a like it's all about Trends and
it's all about following what other
people are doing so if crypto is hot
people are going to invest in crypto if
now VR is hard hot people are going to
now invest in you know the new Apple
Studio companies built on top of that
Apple reality Pro or whatever they're
calling it so like I don't know like two
weeks ago the metaverse was dead now the
metaverse is back is the metaverse gonna
die you know what I mean so it's like
you're just con VCS are just investing
in companies based on these Trends and
and what it ends up hap what ends up
happening is you just see influx of
companies that look and feel very
similar that are attacking a space and

[21:00]
similar that are attacking a space and
one of those are going to win or a few
of them are going to win and then
they're gonna have outside's return the
problem with that for for entrepreneurs
is you end up following what you know
you end up catering changing your
business to be in one of those spaces so
I just wanted to like that's just an
observation I've had encourage your
thoughts on that and then my other my
question to you is like what percentage
of your the people you work with are
bootstrap versus VC and how do those
like are those similar entrepreneurs do
they have similar challenges can you
talk more about that yeah I I'd say
about maybe third a third maybe 40 of
the clients I work with in general uh a
bootstrap is
um I love them I think that um like
there's some bootstrappers out there
that'll that'll turn you green with him
right like the the types of businesses
they've built the lifestyles that they
enable
um it's a you know it's incredible and
it's a lot you front load the effort
it's a lot harder when you start a

[22:00]
it's a lot harder when you start a
bootstrap company and you're not getting
no one's offering you Awards you're not
getting written up in crime no one knows
you exist right that those early years
are like all grind whereas and I think
this is what is so compelling and what
was so compelling about the last decade
of like crazy Venture Capital like froth
and growth is that yeah like you stop
feeling like a winner as soon as you get
a meeting at like a major fund right
there's all these from a psychological
point of view there's all of these
proxies for Success that are immediately
accessible or short-term accessible
along the path which is like a really
long path to building a successful
business that actually makes money right
that like creates value in the world
that convinces strangers to pay money at
a at a good margin for that value being
created that Journey could be like five
ten years long but when you go down the
VC route you can immediately start
celebrating because you're getting
written up on Forbes 30 under 30 right
like you're at this you're at the
pre-seed stage and you're booking
meetings with really big investors

[23:00]
meetings with really big investors
you're telling your friends you're
you're getting patted on the back for
that let alone like getting to your
actual first round of fundraising where
a lot of like a lot of naive
entrepreneurs feel like they've won they
they pop a bottle right on the night
that they that the funds wire for their
seed stage not understanding that
they're now obligated to a bunch of
investors to work their ass off to build
something that has a spectacularly High
odds of not working out right like they
now have a contractual obligation to
grind really really hard
um and a partner who's done their part
because their part was writing the check
and providing the capital and now it's
all on you and so psychologically you
know we I I talk a lot about this
Dynamic that I call the action result
gap which explains like a lot of uh
human behavior right when there's a gap
between taking an action and getting a
result it becomes difficult for us for
human beings to do those things right
like there's an obesity epidemic the
reason that so many people struggle to
be in really great shape is that to get

[24:01]
be in really great shape is that to get
in really great shape you have to take
the action of like working out eating
salads and the result doesn't really
kick in for like three weeks right if
you like work out every day and eat
salads every day three weeks later
you'll maybe two weeks you'll step on a
scale and be like huh and you'll get a
result and there'll be that like
dopamine serotonin experience of like
wow like this is working I'm getting
sexier this is cool but those two weeks
are really hard for us psychologically
right because of the gap between taking
the action and the result whereas a
donut has no action result Gap you see
it you eat it you take a bite you
immediately have that chemical
experience right your your brain is
bathed in these exciting
neurotransmitters you've got fat you've
got sugar you're enjoying yourself no
action result Gap so it's a very
compelling thing to do this is all an
allegory for Venture Capital right when
you can get high off of booking filling
your calendar with meetings for your
pre-seed company when you close that
precede round right you haven't built a

[25:01]
precede round right you haven't built a
successful company you are not at the
ultimate result but you've lined up all
these literal results these little
proxies for the things that you
ultimately want that's that feel really
emotionally compelling and that's why
people get sucked in at a psychological
level it's highly motivating because
trying to build a successful business to
a billion dollar exit over 10 7 to 10
years is really hard and that's the
biggest action result gap of all but
closing your next round is like in front
of you in the next 30 days right and so
it it gives us these kind of guard rails
neurologically to go focus on to chase
those highs that we ultimately need to
inspire action so bootstrap is a
bootstrap is a monks man they they have
like a lot of mental discipline because
you have to really have a vision you
have to believe you have to be able to
see what is possible and pursue and like
live through this action result Gap
um I think the cool thing about it is
that like on the other side you get

[26:00]
that like on the other side you get
maximum freedom I think most
entrepreneurs have like share a value of
Freedom they they want autonomy and and
bootstrappers are the ones who figure
out that you can have it if you
sacrifice it to begin with right because
you're you know you're severely
constrained when you're starting out
you're you're using your customers to
fund your business you're making promise
like a lot of amazing bootstrappers
started with the model of delivering
services so that they have immediate
cash flow up front and then Building
Products that like creates some scale uh
you know with the margin that they make
and so like you know that Rick that's a
lot of work that's like you have it you
basically have a job for working for
your customers so that you can build a
product and a business that can put you
out of a job one day
um so yeah long journey big action
result Gap but a lot of cool stuff on
the other side if you can handle it and
it's tough because you're like I just
quit my job at Google making three
hundred thousand dollars to go start an

[27:01]
hundred thousand dollars to go start an
agency doing services and now I have
like 20 clients that are you know
emailing me all the time and texting me
all the time and this doesn't feel like
Freedom you know and I get that right
like and you're making less so you have
to be you have to really really believe
in in what you're doing and and be true
to the path and and also like I see a
lot of bootstrappers that like will
leave a company like Google start
bootstrapping and then like three months
later I see like they change their
LinkedIn to like now they work at
Shopify it's like no you have to this
isn't something that you can just try
for 90 days or 60 days and expect a
result this is something that you have
to have a serious time scale like I
don't I don't know if it's five years
but you know at least 12 to 24 months of
like hey I'm gonna go and build this
thing it's going to be bootstrap and I
need to hit this goal of 20K mrr or
whatever it is in order for me to

thank you enjoy the rest of the show
yeah totally and I think that you know I
think every I think every entrepreneur
to some degree is like motivated by
freedom and a lot of uh a lot of people
make the mistake of thinking that the
high autonomy environment of just like
going and raising money getting Venture
funding behind you actually creates that
freedom right that like so this when

[29:02]
freedom right that like so this when
you've got some operating capital in the
bank what most early stage Founders
discover is they have this huge amount
of autonomy there's not like a ton of
supervision or scrutiny right like your
investors if you have them they're not
like micromanaging your time but that's
really dangerous too because you're in
this totally isolated state with a ton
of money that other people's money that
you've got to figure out how to build
something with there's a purity to
bootstrapping where you don't have that
fake kind of Freedom right because you
realize you're like oh man I've just
traded my job with one boss at like
Google aware of for a job with 24 bosses
that I'm deeply accounted to accountable
to and they want things and they want it
to be fast and quality and cheap all at
the same time and they're like blowing
me up about it and I don't get paid to
set meanings anymore
um so it it does feel a lot like that
isn't freedom but it is the you know I
think fundamental principle that
everyone needs to understand is that
nothing of substance or lasting value is

[30:00]
nothing of substance or lasting value is
created without somebody like
experiencing the discomfort of like
putting the work in and making it happen
so yeah it takes a little while to get
to that to get to that place you
mentioned before around you know people
filling up their calendars with VC
meetings and you know raising these
pre-seed rounds and and people thinking
like great like now I've made it I had a
call yesterday with a Founder who's
raised 600 million dollars multi-billion
dollar uh valuation company and he's
trying to figure out what to do like he
here's a like you expect once you have
hit unicorn status and you've got
hundreds of millions in the bank like
you're good and it's like no like you he
if anything he's like even more stressed
trying to figure it out I have a you
have a client with a with a a company
with north of a two billion it's a two
point something billion dollar
evaluation who
um yeah has there's like problems that
exist there they have a liquidity

[31:00]
exist there they have a liquidity
problem I have to be careful about how I
you know frame this to give you like the
light touches while protecting their
privacy but you know the business is is
big and successful but it's not quite
hitting the metrics it needs to to have
a successful IPO and it's too big to buy
right there's no player in that space
and that vertical that can come along
and like acquire it and give the
founders a Payday so guys worth hundreds
of Millions on paper and um you know
like struggles to come up with a down
payment for a house in a major city and
like in in the big cities in North
America it's it's wild he's worth
hundreds of Millions on paper but like
you said on paper like to me like
there's a bunch of Founders that right
now that are worth a lot on paper that
are going to have crazy headwinds like
within the next six to nine months
because they're gonna have to recap
their companies and that the founders
are they're gonna realize wow this
Venture thing this is not as attractive

[32:02]
Venture thing this is not as attractive
as I originally thought because if you
the other thing is for most Founders who
take Venture Capital especially at like
the series BCD and E stage these boards
could fire you at any time so imagine
starting a company raising 600 million
dollars doing this for 12 14 years and
you know recession hits not even like
you know you did your best this is an
outside externality that's happened
recession hits and they're like okay
thanks Peter it was great knowing you
here's like a 12 month severance package
you you know you'll have your stock but
like we're gonna go and recap this
company which basically is another
another way of saying like we're going
to change the ownership structure of
this company
um you know and uh like see you later
like that's a reality it's a tale as old
as time yeah happens all the time versus
you're bootstrapping and it's like you

[33:02]
you're bootstrapping and it's like you
are the captain of your ship yeah I
think uh I think I think a lot of I mean
to sum it up to put a bow on what we've
been talking about I think a lot of
people start out the Journey of of
Entrepreneurship motivated by Freedom
right that's what they ultimately crave
is that autonomy that sense of being the
captain of their fate the master of this
all and then they start thinking about
what's the best way to go about this and
you have to be really really careful if
that's you what types of strategies you
start imitating because if you start
chasing after like proxies artificial
versions of that freedom like the
freedom you think you have when you
raise and see capital or like you know
whatever then you can really quickly end
up in a place where freedom is the last
thing that you feel where you where you
wake up every day you know stressed
obligated with this enormous pressure
upon yourself to you know to go and
perform
um because yeah that's that is what

[34:00]
um because yeah that's that is what
success looks like for a huge number of
and we're talking now about champagne
problems right like about the top one
percent most successful people in that
ecosystem that is what success looks
like and so yeah I think I think I love
that you're kind of banging this drum
out there in the world because I think
bootstrapping will always be hard
because it's like a front loading of the
effort right like you're taking the hits
you're taking the knock to your freedom
at the start where you've got to just
you've got to find a way to sell the
services do the work manage the clients
do unscalable like unsexy things to pay
the bills so that you can like like I
think it's totally feasible to spend
twenty percent of your time in your
first year of Entrepreneurship as a
bootstrapper building the product that's
going to one day liberate all the rest
of your time right like it can really be
you might spend eighty percent of your
time just doing fee for service type
work if you're just starting out that
you know my journey was exactly that
right like I built a therapy practice
trading my time for money and for a long
time it was just a journey of increasing

[35:01]
time it was just a journey of increasing
my prices like if I want if my lifestyle
want if I wanted to have any upward
Mobility I was like guess I gotta charge
more and you know after several years of
doing that and succeeding to the point
that my rust was booked and I had this
great network of entrepreneurs referring
me business and you know that I I looked
around and was like I don't know if I
can keep doing this for the rest of my
life I've got to find something that
scales
um what can I do and that was when I
started just like tinkering and
iterating and playing with ideas and it
was really hard because I would do it
online like Friday afternoon right like
a time that not many people want to go
to therapy and when I when I had some
free time in my schedule that was when I
would build and play an experiment but I
mean for me it was like you know I was
living in New York City I was it's not a
cheap place to live it was like 90 90 95
of my time was FIFA service so that I
could build something that could make
money you know without me being the
central engine in the machine I want you

[36:00]
central engine in the machine I want you
to talk about what you built with commit
action but I also want to let you know
that when you told me about commit
action probably like I don't know 12
years ago or something when when did it
start yeah I mean that would have been
when I was like having the idea that it
became you know like the yeah the very
beginning yeah when you told me the idea
I was like in my mind I was like you are
crazy like why would you do this thing
you know you're at the center of all
these you know big Venture back startups
you know you you know people like goadin
and all these well-known people like why
would you go and create a a service like
this that could max out at 20 million 40
million a year in Revenue that's like
what my in my mind I thought about and
probably in my mind even less than that
in my mind I was like this is a five
million dollar business fast forward to
today I'm like man like you did all the
right things you literally did all the
right things you took a service business
where you were making money you learned

[37:01]
where you were making money you learned
about the problems you productized it
you learned how to scale via profitable
marketing channels you never raised a
dollar you have a good name and it's
been compounding ever since so tell tell
people what it is because I think a lot
of people can learn from your how you
did it and uh and let's go I will I do
have to just clarify though I did raise
some money and I want to shout out uh
human Ventures they uh a VC who actually
understands the hold Co model one of the
most successful companies in their
portfolio they're building in this way
they have a huge stake in ckbg which is
the parent company the holding company
that produces a bunch of spirits
companies and so I came to them with the
idea um like they're building this
really cool business there in a similar
model to the way you are at lake
checkout and um I came to them with the
same idea I was like I want to raise the
first and last round for this company a
little bit of jet fuel and um you know
to their credit they were like up for it

[38:00]
to their credit they were like up for it
they saw the vision and so we did it but
yeah I just I just wanna for all the for
all the we're talking about VC I
want to uh shout out to the people who
get it well the the the side note to
that is someone needs to create a
venture fund that is called last round
Ventures first and last round Ventures
where you take money it's like a
bootstrap business but it's like a
little bit of money to actually like get
you to profitability and that's it like
you don't there's no expectations that
you're gonna raise more you know I
remember when we closed their uh one of
the GPS on this sort of CFO of that
whole coat was like look dude this is a
great idea and if it pays dividends one
day that'll be a win
um and like that's a that's a cool
partner to have yeah so yeah um shout
out to those guys
um what was the question how do we with
commit action and why is it cool yeah
commit action is a so commit action is
the company that I built uh that was out
of my services business and it's uh it's

[39:00]
of my services business and it's uh it's
a productivity company what we do is a
coached weekly planning ritual for
entrepreneurs for creatives for
executives we solve a problem if you're
one of these people you're working in
the knowledge economy your your ability
to succeed is dependent entirely on how
how well you execute on the big bold
ideas that you have and so we're a a
company dedicated to improving the focus
the execution the ultimate personal
effectiveness of entrepreneurs
um and people like that by helping them
combat what we believe is the primary
cause of people's lack of focus right
the big problem in 2023 is not people
not being passionate enough not wanting
it enough lacking access to like how two
guides or whatever we like our cup run
over with that it's out it's the
isolation that entrepreneurs and
creatives and execs often have to build
and execute within that causes problems

[40:01]
and execute within that causes problems
with their focus their productivity that
causes them to self-sabotage and
procrastinate so what commit action is
is a real simple coached weekly planning
ritual where you actually work with
somebody one of our highly trained ninja
productivity coaches to sit down and
plan out the highest leverage use of
your time every single week then you've
got someone on your team right commit
action enables you to hire this Pro
effectively to be your dedicated focus
and focus and accountability guy or girl
who's single singular job is to keep you
focused and in the zone at all times so
we're the only productivity company in
the world that rather than focusing
people on checking off a bunch of
to-do's or project management we just
care about what is the highest leveraged
use of your your time and are you
carving out even just a couple of hours
a week to work on that thing that
picking up the ball and moving it
forward for like whatever's next for you
whatever creates the growth

[41:00]
whatever creates the growth
um so it's a coaching company it's a
weekly planning ritual is ultimately the
the you know what you get and the way it
works is as a subscription you sign up
on a monthly membership and you get a
weekly planning call with a coach every
single week and they stay in touch with
you they build a plan
um for you they set up a bunch of
appointments for you to do deep work
appointments you set with yourself to
show up and work on your biggest
opportunities and they hold you
accountable to that calendar on that set
of appointments by staying in touch and
texting you and what not throughout the
week so yeah it's like having it's like
having a personal trainer but for your
productivity rather than just working
out and from a size perspective could
you share a little bit about like scale
like how many customers or like how big
is the business yeah we've worked with
we've worked with thousands of of
customers we've we've scaled it up to
you know
close to about that five million dollar
Mark at this point so it's kind of funny
because yeah you were right like when

[42:00]
because yeah you were right like when
you thought about that idea I mean I'd
kill to get it to 40 million and I think
we will
um but that's kind of where we're at in
terms of annual revenue and what's
amazing about that is that we make a
profit every single month where you know
we're growing and um there's like a
crazy economic model attached to the
business because we create a ton of
value in the world so the secret to our
if you want to like pop the hood the
secret to our business model is that the
service really works right like if you
want to check out we we get third-party
verified reviews on trustpilot people
describe the experience of having a
personal trainer for productivity is
like life changing the copy is so
exuberant in the testimonials people
just write themselves that we we can't
use them in marketing sometimes because
they're so over the top it's almost
cringe-worthy it's like kind of
frustrating I I'd kill for like a four
star like this was pretty great to just
like make us look human
um make us look normal so it it really
really works and the secret is customer
retention right that we have these

[43:01]
retention right that we have these
clients who start the service and
recognize that it's like a it's like a
mental gym membership it's you know when
you when you're dedicated to Fitness and
you find a trainer who gets you and gets
you results like why do why would you
ever stop then when you're an
entrepreneur you find this this way to
be productive and focused that creates
Roi in your business you know in most
cases is like 10 to 50x uh the the sort
of annual return on investment for what
they might be paying us you just keep
doing it and so we've we've launched the
companies like an alpha pilot and it was
just pure Services right talking about
bootstrapping we had no software
platform we had nothing it was just it
was just pairing people up with coaches
on my team to do this account this
weekly planning ritual we have clients
from the initial Alpha pilot who are
still worth with us today we've had
people who have been with us the best
part of a decade
um and just voting with their wallets
every single month being like this is
something meaningful this is something
that works and so yeah that's what's

[44:01]
that works and so yeah that's what's
been like a big key big Key to Our
Success is just refining you know I've
spent years refining the service
refining the methodology to make it
really effective we uh you know we built
a science Advisory board with the
professor of neuroscience at Harvard
Medical School with the professor of
positive psych at NYU to just get to the
bottom of like what is the evidence what
is the real science what's the
evidence-based way to help entrepreneurs
be more effective and so we just you
know that's the thing about
bootstrapping you kind of have to effort
Max you have to grind absolutely every
aspect of your business so we just had
this idea and then systematically sat
down at the beginning and said how do we
improve the out of every single
part of this every single little
interaction and uh you know ultimately
scaled to you know building engineer and
engineering team team in-house and
building our own software all to create
the ultimate weekly planning ritual for
entrepreneurs how much have you I mean
you how much have you optimized
marketing and marketing channels you

[45:00]
marketing and marketing channels you
know because we've talked a little bit
about optimizing retention and the
product itself but how much of or how
much are you doing like r d essentially
marketing r d in terms of new channels
to to bring customers in a little bit my
as a like as a kind of a bootstrap and
my tendency is always to focus on the
product first and foremost right like
that's that's really what I've been
getting after so I will say like I'm I'm
better at building an accountability
coaching methodology technology Etc than
I am as a marketer like I've got a lot
to learn when it comes to marketing but
we did have some wins I mean we've built
we've built marketing channels that have
like a sub 30 day payback on customer
acquisition cost which is like a super
awesome key to you know to scale so we
you know we figured that out a couple of
years ago which enabled us to run ramp
up we're always looking for new stuff
right now I'm in the very early stages
of experimenting with Organic content
you know it's something that I
tactically decided to ignore for many

[46:01]
tactically decided to ignore for many
many years because I was building you
know I wanted to build something bigger
than me and I had built a sort of a
personal brand not that I was famous on
the internet but I was pretty well known
within certain circles in the
entrepreneurship world so for me commit
action was a journey of like focusing on
product at the expense of I've kind of
let this organic audience building thing
Pass Me By and now I'm putting some more
focus on it now that the commit action
is like up and running and you know
pretty much runs itself at this point
from a day-to-day basis that's I've uh
I've started a little YouTube channel
I'm posting some stuff on Instagram I
think just like you
um yeah just experimenting to see like
you know we've learned a lot over the
last few years about helping
entrepreneurs be really effective and we
have like a ton of um we have a ton of
like information that's really useful I
think like science about you know really
counter-intuitive things about what it
takes to be really focused and really
effective as an entrepreneur and the

[47:01]
effective as an entrepreneur and the
cool thing about selling a real meaty
service right is that we can give away
all of the information for free right
like where I and that's kind of the
journey that I'm on right now is I'm
trying to figure out the right formats
and the right way to just kind of share
our methodology and teach anyone who
wants to pay attention how we do things
that come in action how we turn
entrepreneurs into these execution
powerhouses
um because yeah you can you know the the
secret to it all is you know we have a
lot of techniques we have a lot of
amazing methods but that at the heart of
them is human accountability
um and that's from a science point of
view one of the biggest levers human
beings have to improve their their
behavior their output to become more
focused to become more effective is uh
yeah is figuring out how to use social
psychological engagement like connection
with other humans to keep them focused
where where social primates we're
hardwired to perform at our best when
we're connected to others and that's
what our business is built on yeah the

[48:01]
what our business is built on yeah the
reason why you're gonna win as a organic
content creator is a few fold number one
you're known as the shrink for
entrepreneurs that itself is super
memorable like when you have a memorable
name like that that is it just you're
you're playing on easier mode than hard
mode the second is your point of view on
this stuff uh like productivity and
unlocking growth it's it's a unique
perspective see it's not like you're
remixing other people's stuff you're
basically you know the whole the whole
concept around it being like rooted in
science I think is just a really fresh
take so I think once you're putting out
content like having a fresh take I think
of performs and really really really
gets people excited about you
um and so I'm like yeah I'm excited I
think you're gonna you're gonna crush it
based on those two things which
platforms are you most excited about uh

[49:01]
platforms are you most excited about uh
you mentioned Instagram YouTube like
what do you think is going to work the
best I don't know what's gonna work the
best for me right like that's where I'm
kind of like I'm the most curious right
now is like where does my where do my
sensibilities and like you know what the
algorithms are rewarding right now kind
of overlap like when's the where's the
Venn diagram there I'm extremely I would
say I'm just in general extremely
bullish about YouTube as a platform in
general like I think it's I think it is
insane how the Legacy Media just sleeps
on YouTube in terms of the the size of
the audience there uh there's also been
I gotta like take my hat off to Google
for this there's been an absolute
transformation of YouTube as a social
media platform most people don't really
think of it as a social platform but if
you get into like self-development
self-improve Movement YouTube there is a
bunch of like people anonymously
commenting and interacting in there in
the most wholesome way possible it's
like it's such a good vibe um so it's

[50:00]
like it's such a good vibe um so it's
like I you know I I think we are
watching a generational shift from
television
um to these platforms and I I think
YouTube is I think it's already huge
it's way bigger than most people realize
um and I think it's just I think it's
just getting started it's going to be
bigger and bigger so I'm really excited
about that place about that space as I
think part of the magic of it is that it
rewards effort right like the people who
are succeeding on that platform uh you
know they're they're grinding they're
they're you know they're they're kind of
coming around to the level of production
that like people put into television
shows and um and so I think we're gonna
I'm I'm always interested in competing
in a space where you can win with
quality because I just I like that like
I want to make if I'm gonna make
something I want it to be like top shelf
and so um yeah I I'm excited about that
platform for that reason I think I think
uh I also just wouldn't take a bet
against meta right like I think you know
the stock prices got hammered in the

[51:01]
the stock prices got hammered in the
last few years they've people talk a lot
of but there's some amazingly
talented people there and um you know
Instagram is the de facto first place
most people go to scroll and like waste
their time
um and consume content and there's an
interesting opportunity there too for
sure yeah my take is when you're
starting out you want to build an
audience you really do need to pick one
platform and and really just try to
optimize it as well as you can and it
might be attractive to be like oh I I
already have these shorts I might as
well put them on Instagram or I might as
well put them on Tick Tock but it's like
but now you're thinking about those
other platforms when you should really
be thinking about how do I make how do I
become known on YouTube for the next six
months I'm only going to focus on being
known on YouTube group and I know I'm
gonna miss out on Instagram and Tech
talk and stuff like that but uh yeah
that's my my take uh right right now on
on building building uh audiences good

[52:01]
on building building uh audiences good
advice focus focus focus cool yeah I
probably needed to have that well I feel
like dude you can do it uh commit action
version of it just for like audience
Builders so it's like sign up to you
know commit audience.com and every
single day we're gonna give you like
we're your audience productivity expert
and we're gonna give you uh advice on on
how how your content really is like for
example for me I hate listening to
myself or watching myself on YouTube I
like can't it's like super cringe-worthy
but if I had like an expert just give me
notes and tell me what I did wrong this
week in terms of social media like yeah
I'd pay pay for that monthly oh
interesting there you go Greg throwing
out bootstrap business ideas yeah cool
take it dude take it sleep on it yeah
I'll have a think about it I mean I
definitely think that that owl like
coaches at commit action often find
themselves in that role of like you know
they're there for the to give structure

[53:01]
they're there for the to give structure
and accountability and create that that
that best practice of planning the week
but they often become these like allies
and I mean they get fully embedded on
the client's team and will be reacting
to the stuff they're putting out there
in the world we have a we have so many
clients that they that you know a big
part of why they use the service is to
execute on these like long tail creative
goals where you have to ship stuff every
single day and like you know watch that
audience like you know cumulatively
compoundingly build in the long term so
yeah I think you're right before we head
out what's uh what's the biggest tip you
can give to folks around productivity
biggest tip around productivity is
you're crazy to do it alone right like
like I said we're social primates we're
hardwired to perform at our best
hundreds of millions of years of
evolution have optimized human beings to
be at their best when they're working
together in groups and one of the really
dangerous things for you know
entrepreneurs for creatives for creators
out there in today's world is that we

[54:00]
out there in today's world is that we
are really socially isolated right these
parasocial relationships behind through
the screen they don't do to our monkey
mind to our animal brain what actual
social connection does so the first
basic tip for improving productivity and
focus is to have people in your life who
care who you talk to about your goals
and you talk to about your
implementation intentions if you've got
friends that you're discussing you know
mutually with where and when am I going
to work on my biggest ideas and then
they're checking back in with you you're
simulating what we do like at a
professional level at commit action and
it works that you know the science on it
is like Case Closed overwhelming
evidence just even the anticipation of
social accountability that it might
happen is shown to him improve people's
follow-through on goals by up to a
hundred percent right like there's some
wild studies out there about how this
stuff is effective so I think the
tendency for a lot of people starting
out or working on anything big is like

[55:01]
out or working on anything big is like
taking into the bat cave keep it secret
keep it safe right like just like work
on it work on it until the world is
ready but you've you've got to get some
allies you gotta uh you gotta you gotta
add some accountability because that's
what sharpens the focus that's how human
beings Were Meant to do their best work
and a bonus tip of course is to go hang
out with Jean-Claude Van Damme in
Lithuania and don't listen to anything
he says oh dude I'll never forget
pounding champagne with jcbd at that
scary ass nightclub
haha
deep deep in the heart of ildius
Lithuania that was uh yeah that was to
this day one of the craziest nights of
my entire life shared with uh Mr Greg
Eisenberg we do it we do it we do it for
these Pinch Me moments you know I think
uh that's the fun part about
entrepreneurship is it it it it it puts
you in places you wouldn't think are
possible stop bootstrapping something
one day you wake up and Vilnius

[56:00]
