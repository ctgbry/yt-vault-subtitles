what a 15 year old today can do is
already so impressive and then when
they're building on top of libraries not
to mention no code like you can get that
mvp up much easier and so that's why
i've been pushing and i pushed it on
twitter before this uh interview the
minimum viable community is going to
become
the new standard and you're already
seeing it in pfp projects you're already
seeing it across crypto
um
i think you all are clearly building a
business around this concept that is the
new challenge and and the core reason
for that is everyone is overwhelmed with
options
attention is scarce as a result
and one of the best moats for that is
community and and i know that because i
lived it like read it
for five years between i left in 2010 i
came back in early you know late 14 as
exec chair
had
almost no investment by con and asked in
the product the product didn't improve
for half a decade
barely stayed online okay there's no
business on the planet let alone in tech

business on the planet let alone in tech
that should be allowed to do nothing for
five years five years
and grow every single year that should
not be allowed that breaks every rule
and the reason it broke those rules is
because of community because we got just
enough right
that there was a self-fulfilling little
flywheel of users who just cared about
spending time with other random
anonymous users on the internet in these
communities and it not only kept the
site alive it kept growing and thriving
and and so as i watch everything that
now unfolds under web 3 i'm like i've
seen that i i know this very well like
the thing that drives
all the success for this next wave of
internet is going to start with
community
and and that's a big [ __ ] deal
