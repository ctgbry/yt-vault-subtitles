okay lightning round you live in the
future
give me one to three things that are
your predictions for where we're gonna
be in the future well how future you
define like five years about five years
um
i think everyone in five years will
participate in a dow
they won't know it necessarily i don't
think that branding is is whack um but
they it won't count right user
experience triumphs over everything
so yeah i think it will be pretty
commonplace not maybe not everyone but
like for all intents and purposes it'll
be a pretty
normal thing for people to participate
in dao's um
five years uh
people will
in five years agree with the statement
that a famous vc asked me like 10 years
ago what's something that you believe
that the rest of the world were and uh
and i told them that people will care
more or
do care more and will care more about
their online identity than their offline
one they'll care more about some
pseudonym they made up than their
government name

[01:00]
government name
and so i think in five years that will
be true
and then
give me a play to earn one
oh great one okay in five years no one
90 of people
will not play a game
unless they are being properly valued
for that time
and so the idea if you're messing around
you're on candy crush right now you're
listening to this thing in the
background i caught you
you should be paying attention kev got
caught
and and i caught you because in five
years you will actually value your time
properly and instead of being harvested
for advertisements or being fleeced for
dollars to buy you know stupid hammers
you don't actually own you will be
playing some on chain equivalent game
that will be just as fun but you'll
actually earn value in you will be the
harvester yes yeah instead of the
harvesty yes and you deserve it you
deserve it you've been crushing that

[02:00]
deserve it you've been crushing that
candy for too long
uh for free or you're actually getting
charged for it so it's amazing
