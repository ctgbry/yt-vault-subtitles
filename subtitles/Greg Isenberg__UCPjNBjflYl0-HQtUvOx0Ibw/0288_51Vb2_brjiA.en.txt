what if you can create video games using
AI well now you can grock 3 just came
out Sonic 37 just came out and today's
episode is all about using Technologies
like that to create high quality games
that are going to go viral on social
platforms so today's episode uh step by
step how to do it how to use cursor to
do it we integrate with superbase uh and
I bring on this guy named Alex Finn
who's gone viral uh millions and
millions of Impressions about some of
the games that he has created using Ai
and just a few prompts so enjoy the
[Music]
episode this is a big day we got Alex
Finn on the Pod if you don't know Alex
well he's been going absolutely viral

[01:00]
well he's been going absolutely viral
because he's been using platforms like
grock couple prompts and he's just like
building video games so Alex what are we
going to learn today we are going to
learn how to use AI apps as a way to
growth hack any product you have uh I've
been building AI games like the last
eight months now going really viral on X
which is amazing uh which has led to
good growth for my newsletter which has
led to good growth for my AI app that I
launched um and it's through this whole
new concept of like using AI apps and
content to drive attention to your
product so we're gonna we're going to
build some cool things say on top of
that show you how to grow your business
with it so by the end of this pod what
is like what are some tactical things
that people are going to learn you are
going to learn no matter what your
experience level is when it comes to
code or programming or marketing or
anything how to build really cool micro
apps and how to use those micro apps to
drive newsletter signups to drive app

[02:01]
drive newsletter signups to drive app
purchases to drive more revenue and to
drive more attention to your social
media basically boost everything with
cool new AI strategies and are we are we
building games is that what we're
building yeah so I found just through
experimentation that games seem to be
the most
eye-catching uh hook for people and so
I've been over the last eight or nine
months since cursor came out building
all kinds of different apps and creating
content around whether it's games uh
micro to-do list apps things like that
but every time I put out like kind of a
game like oh I built a Call of Duty
clone or oh I built a grand theft autoc
clone it seems that's what gets the
clicks and so I figured out a way to
kind of insert that into my marketing
funnel for my products and newsletters
uh and drive attention that way I mean
I've I've gotten multiple retweets now
from Elon which has driven tons of
amazing traffic so these are some pretty
cool strategies I I've been testing out
for a while now all right let's get into
it Alex

[03:00]
it Alex
let's do it so the plant let me first
show you an example of what I've done up
to this point I'm going to show you how
to do so let me show my window here uh
so the first time I tested this strategy
is with the game you see here I call
this a Call of Duty clone a top down 2D
call Call of Duty clone uh where you can
control the player in the middle you can
shoot enemies things like that uh and
then when you die it says game over
you're on the leaderboard enter your
initials and so I experimented with this
about eight months ago where I said hey
I built my first video game through
cursor I have no game building
experience uh play the game below
Whoever has the highest score in the
next 24 hours I'm sending you $100 right
and so I put that on my ex I posted it
out uh got a ton of clicks and attention
because you know people are so into AI
content right now and this drove about
500 signups to my newsletter which is
amazing right and the way people really
have been driving clicks to newsletter

[04:00]
have been driving clicks to newsletter
over the last couple years is they build
like a really good thread and then they
have a follow post that says here's my
newsletter sign up for it and that's
kind of been drowned out and everyone's
doing it and it's kind of you know
filtered watered down right and so to
really stand out in the marketplace you
have to do different things you have to
try new things and so I've tried this
new strategy of you know using AI
content things people are really into to
drive signups and drive clicks it's been
working spectacularly well so that's
what I'm going to show you how to do
here today cool let's do it by the way I
do agree with you like you know when I
when I see on X for example like tweet
goes viral and then the second tweet is
like for more of this go and you know
subscribe to my newsletter like that's
not working it's not working anymore no
I I started my newsletter three years
ago I'm up to 30,000 subscribers now and
like it was growing like hot cakes three
years ago when I was doing that strategy
of like write like a thread and then say
hey sign up for more everyone in their
mothers is doing it now my grandma is
signing like writing threads and saying
sign up for my newsletter now like no

[05:01]
sign up for my newsletter now like no
one clicks that anymore so you have to
like stay on the bleeding edge and do
cool new things and I don't see anyone
else doing this I'm sure in three years
everyone's going to be doing this but
this is like a really powerful strategy
I think people trying to stay on the
bleeding edge can do cool you heard it
here first let's let's get into it so
here's the plan I am going to use uh
grock here so we're going to use grock
grock is kind of the newest AI model
everyone's using uh it's super super
powerful it has really amazing tools
that you can use for free right now deep
search and think I'm going to show you
how to use those two to build kind of
your V1 of the game we're going to
integrate it with superbase inside of
cursor so that you have somewhere to
store your emails right uh and then I'll
show you how to launch it live on the
internet so you can post it on your X
and within two hours you'll have uh an
incredibly powerful lead gen for your
newsletter or app or whatever you're
building cool quick break in the Pod to
tell you a little bit about startup

[06:01]
tell you a little bit about startup
Empire so startup Empire is my private
membership where it's a bunch of people
like me like you who want to build out
their startup ideas now they're looking
for content to help accelerate that
they're looking for potential
co-founders they're looking for uh
tutorials from people like me to come in
and tell them how do you do email
marketing how do you build an audience
how do you go viral on Twitter all these
different things that's exactly what
startup Empire is and it's for people
who want to start a startup but are
looking for ideas or it's for people who
have a startup but just they're not
seeing the traction uh that they need so
you can check out the link to Startup
empire.co in the description so as a
quick intro to grock you can go gro.com
uh I believe it's these are completely
free right now but like a limited use
but as long as you have a blue check on
X you get more use out of it you get

[07:01]
X you get more use out of it you get
deep search and you get think which with
Chad GPT this cost $200 you get this
basic I think for free with grock which
is amazing we're going to do deep search
to build the plan for the game so what
deep search is really good at is kind of
scouring the web doing research figuring
out how things work and putting together
a plan and then we're going to use think
which is their reasoning model to
actually execute on the plan and build
the code right so deep search is really
good at doing the research building the
plan think is really good at executing
on the
plan so with that being said uh I got a
prompt here so I don't have to sit here
for 50 minutes and have a bunch of typos
and bore the the audience uh I just
copied and pasted from Apple notes
design a p5js implementation p5js is a
really cool uh gaming JavaScript
framework free to use it has an
excellent website where you can just
test things out really quick uh
implementation of a space shooting game
I feel like people everyone gets space

[08:00]
I feel like people everyone gets space
shooting games right everyone
understands you don't have to have
instructions for a space shooting game
you control the ship and you kill things
um it must be extremely polished and I
want you to build all the Sprites and
assets yourself I don't want to import
any assets so this will make it easier
for us so we don't have to like go on
the web and search for open- Source
pictures of spaceships we'll just have
grock build everything for
us so we'll make sure we have deep
search selected and we'll hit enter okay
question on the p5js implementation just
cuz I've never built a game before um is
that something that you figured out you
know do you have yeah just give me
context
around every game am I building am I
using that like I I I just don't I don't
understand you really can use anything
you want to build games like you can use
uh Peter levels just came out with a
great uh flying uh simulator that he
built with pure vanilla JavaScript right
so you really can build anything with

[09:01]
so you really can build anything with
any framework you want but for like
Stone Cold beginners like me for
instance I like to use built out
Frameworks already and the reason why I
like P5 JJs is you can test the game
quicker than any other framework I've
seen so far uh because they have this
awesome website p5js dorg where you can
just click Start coding you can paste in
your code and hit play and you just
instantly have the game going on your
screen so this is found the best way to
kind of prototype games and then you can
take this and put in cursor and make it
more advanced which we'll do in a second
cool so what's great about grock in both
the Deep research and the thinking uh
grock was unable to finish replying it's
beta it's beta what great about Gro is
it didn't work
here my favorite part about grock is it
just doesn't complete the tasks at all
uh we'll do this again it's and again
it's cool cuz when you if you've used uh

[10:02]
it's cool cuz when you if you've used uh
GPT Pro the the $200 version when you
hit a prompt I can go and like make
lunch and then come back and it's still
running and it's like just painfully
slow grock's amazing because it can do
pretty much anything in like under a
minute uh the speed of grock is
unbelievable for the quality the output
it gives you um and also the The Chain
of Thought it shows you is way more
detailed than GPT as well which is
really cool to look at as it's going
through so it's going through the game
design it's looking at how other game
Shooters on the internet work it's it's
looking through different examples on
p5js on how the code works on there uh
it's looking at how to drawing
techniques for Sprites on uh TS plus.com
don't even know what that is uh just
found interesting results on drawing
spaceship so it's researching how to
draw each Sprite I'm thinking about
making a spaceship a rectangle with a
triangle wings and thrusters in the back
so it's it's really awesome uh to read

[11:01]
so it's it's really awesome uh to read
through this to see how it works you can
see browsing for other example code it
can use and it's basically going to
design this game for us it's designing
like the physics and like where the ship
moves as it's going around it's cool to
see how this
works and at the end of this what it's
going to have uh very very shortly is
the entire design for the app right so
it's going to have how the spaceships
move what the space ship look like with
the enemies uh how the enemies work how
often they shoot how they die how
everything's determined you know
implementing Collision detection
defining the enemy class writing the
pseudo code and then we're going to take
this we're going to put it into the
think mode and it's going to build us
the code uh you know really nicely and
really quickly so they they work really
well together the two grock
modes enhancing the visual effects here
finalizing the it's it's really I love
that at Deep seek if deep seek did

[12:00]
that at Deep seek if deep seek did
anything well it kind of set the tone
for like okay now all the other AI
models have to put the chain of thought
in because this is what people expect
now I really think deep seek had like
huge influence in how all this
works all right so here we go it has the
plan right game overview asset creation
gameplay mechanics how everything works
uh detailed implementation of how it
works the background the bullets
everything so what we're going to do now
is like the colors of all the assets
we're going to switch to think
mode I'm going to pull in my handy uh
prompt over
here paste it in and we're going to say
now create a code block with the entire
correct code please ensure you're making
all your own assets and Sprites and I
don't have to import
any hit enter on that and so now the
think tool which is like I I I visualize
as like the Deep search is my like
senior researcher who's like gathering
information and doing all the scouting

[13:02]
information and doing all the scouting
and then the think is like the executor
it's like the the programmer fore that's
going taking that plan and actually
executing for
you and you can see here it's now going
taking that plan and putting into the
actual code
itself and grock as of recording this is
completely free is that right yes so
there is a free version for grock 3
right now which you do get to test test
out deep search and think uh if you pay
for the premium version of X where you
get the check mark you get significantly
higher usage uh of the app which the app
is I think the best UI of any AI app out
there right now incredibly easy to use I
think it's worth it because then you can
also make money on X and stuff like that
but there is a free version where you
can test this out now which I don't
think any other app like GPT doesn't
allow you to use the search like the
Deep search stuff for uh for free so

[14:00]
Deep search stuff for uh for free so
pretty
cool so we can see here here's the
complete code and what I'll show you
which is why I like p5js so
much is I can just copy paste this and
test it in seconds I don't even need
like an
IDE uh to see what this plays and looks
like and then we can move this into
cursor and actually do uh some of the
cool stuff like implementing the
database implementing the leaderboard
and all
that so let's take
this put in a p5js hit play Boom first
try game over so sometimes you know it's
not the best
uh working wise on the first go but I
mean for a first go we got the bones of
a good game here it also has like the
Hamas triangle like coming down on you
it's like you trying to kill the Hamas
Tri triangle that is listen if you want
to add a little extra motiv
to the game you can certainly imagine

[15:01]
to the game you can certainly imagine
the other spaceships as terrorists
that's totally up to you listen that
might be a good way if you're trying to
make a political statement on X turn
this game into you know where you're
hunting your enemies that might be a
cool way to do this I mean talk about
something that would go
viral so I was actually planning
surprise at the end here I'm going to do
a spoiler on surprise now we're thinking
you're thinking five light years ahead
now you can use this to turn memes and
trending jokes into experience in games
as well I turned uh the Mitch McConnell
meme of him freezing on stage into a
playable game as well where you try to
avoid staircases uh and collect money
and so this went super viral a few days
ago because I took a meme and a joke
that was working really well in the
moment and just turned it into a game
and launched it on my a so a little
spooler what's coming at the end anyway
uh so we got the bones of a game here
right so let's take

[16:00]
right so let's take
this let's take this game we'll copy
this I'll stop let's let's actually do
one more thing okay I want to import
this into cursor how do I set up the
file system to get this to work so like
here's something whenever I put out
these types of tutorials on X as well or
proud videos I immediately get okay how
do I launch this how do I edit this how
do I do this my response is always the
same just ask the AI it'll tell you how
to do it and so if you want to do
something like take your code from grock
put it in a cursor put in whatever code
editor you want just ask how to do it
it'll tell you how to do it so we're
going to do that now I got cursor up
we're going to use Sonet 37 which just
launched this morning which is going to
be sick we'll try that out and we'll
have a cool game
going we're using all the Cool Tools
right now all the hot stuff we are SEO
stuffing the hell out of this video
YouTube's algorithm is going to just be

[17:01]
YouTube's algorithm is going to just be
putting this in front of everyone on
planet Earth after they scan through
what we're
saying okay let's see okay so create a
project directory create the HTML file
and create the Javascript file and Run
the game all right I'm going to switch
over to curse now and we'll start
building this out I'll follow these
instructions
so
share and while you're doing this like
what level of developer would you say
you
are uh I'm going to be honest I am a
advanced developer I've been coding my
whole career I have a computer science
degree um I was a developer right out of
school so I am really experienced in
coding I just launched an AI app I built
my entire self so I know coding really
well um but I will say this I've been
using AI non-stop for a couple years now
you don't need any experience to do this
what I'm showing you here like I'm
showing you from beginning to end
everything you need to do to launch a

[18:00]
everything you need to do to launch a
game and I would argue nothing I've done
so far is very technically sophisticated
or any sort of experiences required you
know AI is that advanced now where like
if there's any gaps in your knowledge
you have you just say hey how do I do
this and it'll fill that gap for you so
I really don't think you need like
Advanced knowledge to do
this
cool that's what we like to hear on this
channel exactly exactly um I got cursor
open so I'm going to over on the side of
my screen I have grock still open I'm
going to follow the instructions I'll
walk you through it uh so first thing
we're going to do is create a directory
so let's create a new
folder um we oh oh actually no we
already got the space game folder so
let's make the HTML file so we'll do new
file and and again all I'm doing is just
following step by step everything grock
is telling me so it says make this
file copy in this code for the

[19:00]
file copy in this code for the
HTML
save uh and then create the JavaScript
file so create a file named sketch. Js
sketch. Js boom uh open sketch. JS and
paste the code
in so let's take our game
code paste this in save
boom and then let us run the game to run
the game open
index.html in a web browser so okay so
I'm going to off my screen here double
click on
index.html and then I will show you my
screen to show you to prove that grock
knows what the hell it's talking about
here so
screen
window boom so here's the game Let's
refresh this as you can see it is
working just as grock
directed okay let's go back in a cursor
not I mean you would Greg you would say

[20:01]
not I mean you would Greg you would say
that this is all technically pretty
simple so far no JavaScript coding
knowledge necessary right yes yes no
I'll be honest with you I was sad to
hear that you're such an advanced person
and then you got to hit me with the end
I have a computer science degree but you
redeemed yourself
when you're showing me this is this is
anyone could do this listen it it does
I'll say this kind of hurt the narrative
uh that I'm trying to tell you here by
saying oh I'm a genius but I will say
that I listen I could Li and say I don't
know what the hell I'm doing here but I
will say this I'm showing you how
there's no I'm not writing any code here
there at no point during this while I
write code so trust me you don't need a
computer science degree to do this all
right cursor we're in cursor no matter I
I swear to God I updated cursor 13
seconds before this podcast started it's
already got an update anyway uh we're in

[21:03]
already got an update anyway uh we're in
cursor uh open up the sidebar you get
your composer if you're watching Greg's
Channel I'm sure you've you know what
the hell cursor is but composer is
basically your AI agent that allows you
to build whatever you want I switch to
agent mode and you love to see it Claude
37 Sonet is in the
dropdown never thought I'd see the day
uh I would assume based on my
experiences you probably don't want to
use the thinking model to do coding uh
you know because i' I've tried 01 and it
was just a pain to use uh you lose a lot
of speed so let's just go with 37 Sonet
here all right if I recall correctly
when I just tried this game there was no
shooting so let's start first by making
the game playable making it fun and then
what we'll do is add in the superas
integration anyone who's new super base
in my opinion it's probably the easiest
for beginners to use database for apps

[22:01]
for beginners to use database for apps
uh I built my app on superbase I never
used like a database before uh super
easy to do I'll show you how to do that
and that's where you're going to store
like high scores and email addresses so
you can put them into your newsletter if
you're building a newsletter or whatever
you want to do add it to your marketing
list for your app whatever you're doing
so with that being said let's go in here
um we are building a space shooter game
but but it doesn't appear the shooting
from the ship is
working can you please check over the
code and see why that is I just talked
to the AI like it's a human being I
don't use any sort of advanced prompting
techniques I I go on X every other post
is like here's 20 meta prompts you can
use to write the most advanced coding I
just talk to the AI like it's a human
being I don't have like any advanced
meta prompting techniques I don't have

[23:01]
meta prompting techniques I don't have
no I just say hey man can you fix this
for me
please um I'll examine the space Sho
identify looking at your code I can see
that the shooting mechanism is
implemented in the draw function this
should create a new bolt when let me
check if there any issues with this
implementation going to be honest I
don't know what that prompt that uh
command does but let's run
it let me check the
file after examining the code I've
identified the problem with the shooting
mechanism the issue is how handles
keyboard input the keyboard down
function and pay five okay let me fix
this by implenting a proper keyboard
event Claude 37's literally like 45
minutes old so I just pray to God it
works well uh and we're not going to get
into like an endless Rat Hole here uh
okay so try running the game now let's
see what is the new key for shooting
meu's Key down wasn't working ready for
detecting the space bar okay so space
bar press perfect let's accept this

[24:01]
bar press perfect let's accept this
let's save
this let me
uh let's share the shooting
screen again no technical experience
right that was pretty not like saying
hey change this line of code do this
just figuring out on its own right I
mean Light technical experience like you
have to know a little bit of like what's
happening but very light and I'll say
this
even if it's light if something confuses
you when it's light you just go into
grock and say hey what the hell is this
guy talking about this AI what does this
mean and it'll just explain it to you
yeah all right let's see here oh we're
shooting it's
working it's working okay downside we're
just randomly dying I don't know why we
just died that made no sense
um
we okay that work I always like to tell
the AI like okay what you did just

[25:00]
the AI like okay what you did just
worked thank you for that because then
it kind of like trains the AI to know
what it did was good because sometimes
the AI does some stupid things and I'll
say no you're an idiot so when it does
good things make sure you also say okay
that worked too so like train it to do
those things again when it works um okay
that worked one more switch back to the
cursor screen yes apologies screen
window it's like how do I know you're
not coding right now you know I want to
make sure this is non-technical I
quickly uh rode an entire space shooting
game during that that during that one
pause okay that worked one more issue it
seems we are randomly dying here's
another thing I really like to do um I
like to use the AI as like kind of a
product manager as well where I'll ask
it a lot of questions on what do you

[26:01]
it a lot of questions on what do you
think the design should be here because
you know when you're building something
on your own you kind of lose perspective
on your audience and what people want
and so a lot of times when I'm making
even small design decisions like I'm
about to do here before I tell the AI
what I want I'm going to ask it what it
thinks I should do so for example right
we're randomly dying in the game and so
in my head I'm thinking okay should we
die when uh the triangles get off the
screen at the bottom or should we die
when they run into us right what is more
fair for the player and so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to say okay
that worked one more issue it seems
we're randomly dying do you think we
should die when the triangles we'll say
the enemy triangles the enemy
triangles run into
us or when they go off the
screen compl
completely and so I actually before I

[27:01]
completely and so I actually before I
make final decisions on any sort of
design I'll Just Bounce It Off the AI
real quick uh like for instance I'm I'm
re-editing the tutorial in my own app uh
and I I I've just gotten feedback from
my audience like that's where people are
falling off like they go in the tutorial
they get really confused and so I've
just been like talking to I where should
this be where should the tutorial be and
it's redid everything for me it's just
way better the AI is just a way better
designer than me so I like asking the AI
first um let's see what it came up with
I'm glad the shooting mechanism is
working now let's address the issue with
the Game ending unexpected looking your
code I can see why you might be
experiencing R random game overs the
current game over condition is triggered
when an enemy reaches the player's
vertical position but it doesn't check
for an actual collision with the player
let me analyze the code listen even if
you're not
technical give it a shot and just like
read the code because it can't hurt to
understand how it works so even if it's

[28:00]
understand how it works so even if it's
super confusing and you don't know what
it means I really think just looking it
over and seeing trying to understand a
little bit of how it works is beneficial
I would never you know the the vibe
coding uh trend is oh you just close
your eyes and
type I agree but let's go somewhere in
the middle where you do look at the code
just to see what it does um the
condition checking if the bottom of the
enemy is below the player's y position
okay so it checks to see if it's below
the Y position then just ends this
doesn't account for horizontal position
meaning an enemy can trigger game over
even if it's not directly hitting the
player let me fix this so it fixes it
checks for player Collision kind of cool
I fixed the issue with random game overs
here's what I changed replace the
vertical only check and has New
Collision
detection except let's test it
out share so we're getting somewhere
we're getting somewhere cool here let's
try our game again

[29:01]
refresh okay that worked okay here we go
I was trying to move with the keys all
right it's working it's
working kind of cool right I mean super
cool dude you buil a game in like a few
minutes it's a few minutes uh we really
didn't need any design skills and I'd
say in the 3 minutes it took us to build
this this is a lot more compelling to a
general audience to get clicks than like
a thread on X and then saying sign up
for my newsletter right like it take I
and I still do it but like that takes
like two hours to
do building this game took three minutes
and I'd argue for a general audience on
X that game we just made and we're going
to make this even cooler is more
compelling to like get a click get
people interested in whatever you're
doing doing and even if it isn't for a

[30:00]
doing doing and even if it isn't for a
click I'd argue this is more compelling
to get like follows and to get like or
engagement so that next time you put out
something that's related to your Niche
or next time you put out something that
like drives to your product they'll be
more likely to see that on their home
feed because they've already clicked on
a couple of the things you built how do
we change the design aesthetic of some
of this
stuff uh what are you thinking what what
uh what would you like to change what's
what's not pleasing you from a design
perspective I mean I I think the the
triangles need to
go that's one triangles need to go okay
let's do this I don't know I just don't
think
like to me it's you're not fighting
against triangles you're fighting
against like asteroids or something like
that you you okay so let's do
this from an artistic perspective I'm
the wot the worst of all time so let's
let's go back to Claude let's have claw
do the design for that so I think the

[31:01]
do the design for that so I think the
enemy ships are horrendously ugly they
don't look like ships and they don't
intimidate me whatsoever can I can I add
one thing to this
prompt I think that it's helpful for you
to give it the goal and I think you
should say
that I want this game to go viral on X
and my Niche
is you know people into AI
products and then I think you should
say what should I change with my with my
ships and what else should I
change I love that I absolutely love
that what should I change at my
ships and what else should I change to
make this more likely to go

[32:03]
make this more likely to go
viral I love that that's great um I
understand you want to make your game
more visually appealing and viral worthy
especially for an AI focused audience on
X let's enhance the ship and add more
viral worthy features to your game I
love that and like one thing you can
think about too like if if virality is
the goal which i' argue this is the goal
right we're not trying to build grand
Auto 6 here we're trying to build a game
that gets clicks and drives people to
your products you know what are other
viral things in the moment we can
Implement like I showed you I made like
a Mitch McConnell simulator a second ago
like thinking about which memes are
going viral what people care about in
your audience and that implementing that
in here is really really powerful
especially for something like cursor
where you can upload images like you can
easily upload like a meme say hey this
is a trend meme right now how do we
implement this meme into the game that's

[33:01]
implement this meme into the game that's
something we could do so you know
especially if you're a business owner I
imagine most people watching this
probably not trying to become
professional game developers they're
probably business owners trying to get
more clicks so what the way you want to
think when building this is like how can
we get more current interesting viral
elements into the
game okay so let's see what we got
here I understand you want to make your
game more visually appealing and viral
worthy especially for an AI focused
audience on X let's enhance the enemy
ships and add some viral okay so here's
a little thing with cursor a little
gotcha um that bothers me when I'm
asking questions to cursor a lot of the
times it just gets over its skis for
instance I just asked hey what are your
ideas for improving this game uh and it
added 501 lines of code uh without even
like conversating with me or like saying
hey here's the ideas I got so I'm going

[34:00]
hey here's the ideas I got so I'm going
to look what they did first and then if
this is just completely abor which I
would guess it is we're going to rewind
and I'm going to show you how we can
improve this prompt to avoid uh cursor
from being as forward as it just was
here let's see what it did I've
completely transformed my space shooter
game to make it more visually appealing
we redesign enemy ships with AI theme
three enemy okay so there's three enemy
types basic listen I'll just say
this if this works what it's telling me
here in one shot I'm going to be the
biggest Claud Sona 3.7 fan in the
history of mankind if I said hey just
make this more viral worthy and it adds
like 20 different types of ships all in
one shot in 500 lines of
code this might be the AGI moment how
about this what's your middle name Tyler
Tyler nope not anymore because if this
works you have to officially change your
middle name from Alex Tyler Finn to
watch How I

[35:00]
watch How I
pronounce Claude Alex Cloe
Finn if this works and this doesn't am I
allowed to curse in this podcast I mean
it's a free world okay if this works and
this doesn't look like horeshit you can
bleep that out if that's too much um you
can make like the title of this video
like working with Alex clo fin on
building game that like you can just
totally destroy my discoverability and
Name by putting that in the middle um we
enhance the players ships so we we added
three enemy ships we enhanced the
players ship we added visual effects
particle effects glowing effects bullet
Trails animated Stars gradient space
back this would be the single greatest
output for an AI prompt I've ever had if
this works scoring system level
progression PowerUp system
system AI themed elements enemy ships of

[36:01]
system AI themed elements enemy ships of
AI brains and ai ai eyes that glow a
game over screen that says AI Invasion
simulation complete boss
enemies satisfying visual feedback
progression system powerups polished UI
and restart
function I've never anticipated the
output for an AI prompt as much as I am
right
now to be honest they don't want this to
work they want this to work but it's
going to work if this works I'm
declaring a AGI
achieved I'm sorry but I am if this
works I mean Elon M said today I think
that Singularity is
near Singularity yeah what he meant by
that
is when this prompt when you press
enter Then Singularity will be
achieved if my computer just Els I I I
just did you press enter I didn't I'm

[37:02]
just did you press enter I didn't I'm
building up this in Greg in Show
Business is what we call building
anticipation right when Michael Jackson
comes up at the halftime show and he
sits there and he stands there at the
crowd for 10 minutes straight without
saying a word this is what we're doing
here so I'm going to hit
refresh and we might discover AGI in one
second all right here we
go so what do we have here we have a
much better looking ship we have enemy
ships with fire Trails the stars are
glimmering there's a score system I'm
only seeing one type of ship though it
said it was going to do three types of
enemy ships maybe we got to get to level
two the missiles do look like
missiles I mean I have Goosebumps right
now I'll just say this well what's that
oh triple shot wow
this oh my now we're going super f i
remember playing games like this like as

[38:00]
remember playing games like this like as
a kid in an arcades like this is
unbelievable different type of different
ships right there that's really
cool I'm sorry Greg I might have to exit
this podcast right now because uh AGI
has been achieved and I need to go like
build apps uh with this
because this
is the most mind this might be the
number one most mind-blowing moment I've
ever had with AI wow and you're a
computer science
grad yeah take it from a guy who uh
coded with C++ in college this
is the most
mindblowing maybe technological
advancement I've ever seen in my life
right by the way you're flexing a little
bit because you're actually really good
at this
game uh no big deal I played Marvel
Rivals for like six hours last night so
I'm kind of good at video games
um I'm can we just spend the next three

[39:02]
um I'm can we just spend the next three
hours just playing all right I'm going
to I'm going to purposely die in a
second just to see what the screen looks
like we got faster Ships Come Oh is
these like the boss ships there the
purple
ones okay let's just die game over F AI
Invasion simulation
complete I feel kind of cringe right now
because like 3 days ago grock 3 came out
and I put out a post on X I was like
holy crap grock 3 is the most amazing
thing I've ever seen in my life and now
I'm going to have to put out a post 3
days later that's like holy crap Claude
Sonic 3.7 is the most amazing thing I've
seen in my life I mean you're saying the
truth the nature of the game I guess the
nature of the that show is
baby uh that I mean I'm not just saying
this to kind of hype it up on a
podcast that was the most unbelievable I
think achievement I've ever seen an AI
build in one shot
what do you think that was unbelievable

[40:00]
what do you think that was unbelievable
that was unbelievable that's honestly
unbelievable like I I I can't believe it
I I cannot believe it it's crazy because
like what does this unlock right think
about what this
unlocks I mean it here's what it unlocks
and here's what I've never seen AI do
before AI up until two hours
ago was very good
at following instructions and what I
mean by that is like I feel like The
Benchmark for AI was here's an
instruction and then our measure of the
success was how well did it follow the
instructions right like if I say build
this does it build that thing but what I
think we just witnessed that I've never
seen an AI do before was it did creative
thinking right I said hey you know the
game's cool but it doesn't feel like
it's viral worthy like here's my Niche
how do we make this viral worthy and it

[41:01]
how do we make this viral worthy and it
on its
own not
only it thought abstractly about what it
my Niche was and what would make things
go viral right it thought abstractly
about it and then it implemented it
without having to be handheld through
every single step right before this
everyone who was in a hey if you're
doing something with curse you're doing
something make sure you break it down in
the micro steps make sure you break it
down step by step by step to make sure
it's accurate I don't think that's the
case anymore I don't think you need to
break it down into micro steps based on
what I just saw I was 100% confident
when I had planned that it was G to be
hot garbage I I was like anytime I've
ever given
Claude the instruction or cursor the
instruction to do something and the
result like result was this what you see
here Plus 501 minus 46 I instantly slam
my desk and go godamn it every time I've
ever used cursor and I've seen this
result right because then I know okay

[42:00]
result right because then I know okay
they messed it
up they did they just they thought
abstractly and implemented a really
abstract creative solution which is
amazing I'm uh I'm blown away I don't
know about you but that was legitimately
and this is like an authentic reaction
I've never tried 37 before that was
legitimately
incredible um so let's do this now I
would I mean is there is there that's
better than any game thought we were
going to make here is there anything you
want to add to that or should we get to
the uh super base part let's get to the
super base
part okay let's do this so we have an
amazing game um we have here's how I
measure virality uh especially on X uh I
I'm personally very focused on X I do
have a YouTube channel but I'm X is my
bread and butter uh my virality
measurement is okay is this Elon retweet
worthy right because that's the home run

[43:00]
worthy right because that's the home run
right that's the Home Run you get you
get an Elon retweet that's getting 10 10
million impressions
right I think the game is retweet worthy
I think when Elon sees the replay of the
game for five seconds and he's busy
working on 40 different companies that's
retweet worthy so check there let's now
Implement kind of the business portion
of this which is high
scores and collecting email addresses
right A lot of people are going to see
this they're going to go wow that's a
really cool game uh I can't believe you
built that all on your own let me play
it they're going to click and now
they're going to give you their email
once they finish the game so all
right that was
incredible really good
work now I
want to
implement
a uh high score a leaderboard we'll call
it leaderboard
uh when users lose they should get an

[44:03]
uh when users lose they should get an
input where they put in their email and
then their score goes on the
leaderboard I want to use superbase for
the back
end first give me the plan and then I'll
approve it
so up to this point in time this was my
way of getting around
AI hallucinating right a lot of time
when I give kind of a more complex
instruction like let's Implement an
entire database it'll mess up and it'll
go on a weird path and we'll just go
down a rabbit hole G be honest Claude 37
I might not need to do this anymore but
we're going to do it anyway um so I
always go give me the plan first and
then I'll approve
so what 37 will do here is thank you for

[45:00]
so what 37 will do here is thank you for
the positive feedback I like that it
thanks me for that um added a leader
it's a little Vibes like that the little
touches like thanking me for saying
those things that uh I feel like makes
AI so much more enjoyable to use um
adding leaderboard superbase integration
is a great way to make your game more
engaging and viral here's my plan for
implementing the future set up superbase
game UI changes uh it's going to add a
leaderboard backend
integration visual design and create a
nice leaderboard design in additional
features add a share to x button to post
scores directly that that's cool that I
just thought of that Implement a weekly
alltime toggle add verification
typically at this point when it starts
giving me advance things like this like
there's no way the AI is about to
implement this but now I actually have
faith and trust that'll do that in one
shot um okay so here's the plan add
superbase create the schema add the
leaderboard implement the submission
logic okay would you like me to

[46:01]
proceed you
beta I don't think I don't think you
need technical knowledge to get to where
we are right now to get this pretty
awesome game I think maybe I'm wrong but
yes let's
Implement man I don't know about you
Greg but I am pumped to play around with
this after build cool stuff uh that was
unbelievable let's implement the
leaderboard with superbase I'll start by
adding the necessary code to your game
first we need to add superbase library
and set up the so again for people who
don't
know uh I will actually show you this
while it is
working let me show my screen
again
window uh this is super base um really
easy free like you don't need to pay for
this really especially if you're
starting beginning and experimenting
with things uh like I had a free I was

[47:00]
with things uh like I had a free I was
using a free version of this with like
thousands of users on an app you you
don't need to pay for anything so I go
superb.com sign up super easy to use you
know a lot of the kind of newer apps and
micro SAS apps people are putting out
there use superbase because it's super
cheap and easy and fast um but as this
is going feel free to sign up superb.com
you can start a new project um and then
we will call this uh space
game and then we can just create the new
project and it's good to go we got to do
a password Here uh let's go with boom
not bad but the password needs to be
harder okay how hard you
Jesus there we go strong enough uh let's
just copy that because there's 0% chance
I remember that paste that into my other
Apple note that if anyone was ever to
hack it'd be game over for me create new

[48:01]
hack it'd be game over for me create new
project um okay so let's go back as
that's
going I'm going to be deleting this API
and project after so do not think about
stealing it people watching this
video uh screen
window let's go back in uh cursor have
you used super base before Greg I have
love super base
it's awesome it's so easy to use uh even
if you've never like used SQL before
super super easy uh great let's
implement the leaderboard okay first you
add the superbase client now let's add
the superbase configuration file to
store our API
Keys okay now let's update the sketch
file to integrate the
leaderboard unbelievable now it's
Creator read me with the instructions
great I've success oh this is cool so
I've never seen Claude do this before um

[49:00]
I've never seen Claude do this before um
usually in my workflow a cursor like
every time I implement or change
something I have to tell the agent okay
can you update like my readme files like
I have a readme file for like every
feature and every component in my app
and I'll go okay go into that component
update the readme with everything you
just changed the fact that I just built
a readme put all the details of the game
in like wow everything it has like how
the game works how to set up in
superbase the
schema uh that is actually really really
really impressive uh didn't even ask to
do that at all it just knows like best
practices for for
programming great I've implemented the
leaderboard function I with the
superbase integr again if this is one
shot holy hell we're AGI achieved um
okay set up superbase integration
enhance the game Flow privacy and
security uh okay so next steps create a
superbase account done
and set up your project following the
instructions in the readme repl replace

[50:01]
instructions in the readme repl replace
the placeholder API keys in the config
so we'll go in
there um let's just accept all I trust
you I trust you Claude uh replace the
placeholder API keys there test the game
and leaderboard functionality deploy the
game to web server we're going to do
GitHub pages to show how to go live here
and share your game on X and watch it go
viral it's cool because it's like
remembering everything we talked about
in the previous conversation it
remembers the goals of the game it
remembers what we're trying to do here
and it's like it didn't have to say
share your game on X and watch it go
viral but that's such a cool like Vibe
touch just to like make the Vibes of the
conversation cooler I love
that the leaderboard adds a competitive
element to your game and should
significantly increase its viral
potential like that's so cool that it
like remembered the goals we gave it
from a few messages go ago it wasn't it
never did that for you before right Greg
no no not and this what's so cool about

[51:00]
no no not and this what's so cool about
this
is it does really feel like you're
working with someone like you know what
I mean like this i' I've I've used this
before and I've kind of felt like okay
I'm kind of like pushing it to get the
result that I want but now it feels like
it's pushing me to get the result we
want you know what I mean it's like it's
this is this is next level amazing
you're right it did feel like before
especially when the app got a little bit
more
advanced it did feel like at times you
were working against the AI a little bit
right like no we got to do this change
this this feels like for the first time
the AI is like as you said pushing me
like we're working together and going
faster with each other which is
amazing so let's pop open the read me
let's see okay created the account did
that create a new project did that once
your Project's created go to the SQL
editor and run the following SQL to
create the leaderboard table all right

[52:01]
create the leaderboard table all right
so I'm going to let's do this I'm just
going to
go actually I'll share the superbase
screen so people at home who are newer
to superbase can kind of see how this
works uh so we're in superbase superbase
is a SQL database and so uh we go in
there's a SQL editor where we can copy
and paste in SQL and it'll do basically
all the setup for us so first we can put
in this command which uh Claude gave us
this creates the leaderboard table where
basically the scores will be stored can
run that boom
success next it uh create an index for
faster
queries let's pop that in run boom add
security so people can't mess with other
people's scores boom add allow anyone to
insert scores okay so allow people to

[53:01]
insert scores okay so allow people to
insert their own scores boom and allow
anyone to read scores so you just this
is all in the uh read me file that
Claude generated and I'm just following
it step by step you don't really need to
know how any of this works you just kind
of follow it and you're good to
go and go to Project settings API to get
your API credentials so we'll go project
settings uh and then we'll go a pi to
get your credentials I'll be deleting
this project after and then so get copy
your project URL and Aon key so project
URL I'm going to switch back over to
cursor so you can see me put this
in okay so copy your project your Aon
key open the superbase config and
replace the placeholders okay so we're
in here superbase
URL paste that in
and then the Aon
key

[54:03]
copy paste that in cool
save um let's see what we got here Run
the game man if this works holy hell uh
most of the game on the web server you
can use GitHub Pages all right so let's
just test it
first um I did notice it doesn't have I
don't think it had the email input
unless
let's just see let's check out the table
oh it does have an email field in the
table
okay all right let's uh let's give this
another shot shall we letter red I swear
if this works
man all right give us a refresh okay now
it's is this full screen now or we just
have a
bug we might just have a bug all right
claude's not perfect even the AI is not
perfect that's fine I forgive Claude oh
oh okay so the game's not working but
the clearly we died in the background

[55:02]
the clearly we died in the background
somewhere uh your score zero enter your
email to save the
score okay we have a small
issue I can't type anything let me just
type in maybe it's just like the inputs
oh a
just please okay so couple things not
working let's debug it let's debug it
good I'm glad this isn't perfect so I
can show people at home how to how to
debug
it back in the cursor okay a couple
issues first I'm not seeing the game
anymore when I run it it's just a blue
screen and nothing
else and then eventually the end game
shows up okay so we're going to fix it
you just tell Claude exactly what's not

[56:01]
you just tell Claude exactly what's not
working what you're experiencing and it
just goes and fixes it I see the issue I
the problem is that we've modified the
canvas setup but there's an issue with
how it's being attached to the Dom let's
fix it
anyway
okay uh pretty simple let's see what we
got here one line of
code now let's fix the super based
client initialization as there might be
an issue with how it's being created
[Music]
I am even though this didn't work I
mean with 35 we would have had 20 of
these issues so far up to this point and
this would have took 10 times longer so
the fact that we've only had one issue
up until this point I find radically
impressive totally I mean I blocked off
six hours for this podcast so it's great
that we'll be able to get it done in
just over an
hour we just freed up time to uh play
around Sonet 37 after this it's
amazing let's update the HTML it's still

[57:02]
amazing let's update the HTML it's still
got the speed of 35 which is really
cool um you know when with 03 you know
when they upgraded to 03 mini and all
that the speed slowed down you know uh
what's cool about this though is it
seems to be just like 35 just better
smarter
faster let's run a quick test to see I
wonder what it's I don't know I'm a I
have a comsi degree I don't know what
this can is but we'll let it do its
thing I don't know what it's testing
there oh you have a compi degree I had
no idea for those kids at home uh just
tuning in I have a computer science
degree which is probably the most
useless degree you can possibly get at
this point in time uh $300,000 down the
drain I to pay for that one but at the
same time uh at least I'm smarter than
everyone so that's a
positive let's make one final fix in
sure a you son of
a let's see what happens when I do
resume maybe they'll just pick up from

[58:01]
resume maybe they'll just pick up from
where it left
off this little came out two hours ago
give it a break I fixed the issue all
right what's it doing
now AGI not achieved what's going on
here I fixed the issues with your game
here's what's
wrong uh don't know what just happened
we're going to test it out let's see
what we get
window AI space invasion
okay okay all right now I'll just die
see what happens
boom okay enter your email can I type
okay so this was the second problem
right I couldn't type for some reason we
fixed the game
issue that's pretty good we oneshot that
so now let's fix the entering an email
issue right pretty simple
share next issue
when uh let's say okay that worked next

[59:01]
when uh let's say okay that worked next
issue uh when the email input screen
pops
up I can't type in an email address into
the input nothing happens when I
type
enter uh let's fix the issue with the
email input field not accepting text
this is likely happen because p5js is
capturing keyboard events and preventing
them from reaching the input field that
makes
sense so the game
code uh for those who know let me give
you a little computer science
explanation here for those at home uh
the game code is intercepting the key
strokes for the game itself so that when
you go to leaderboard screen the game
still like intercepting the keystrokes
because it thinks you're trying to play
the game that's why I can't type in my
email uh also add a fix to ensure p5js
doesn't capture Mouse events when
interacting with the modals pretty smart

[1:00:02]
interacting with the modals pretty smart
so thought ahead and thought other like
edge cases that could be happening which
is cool man I can't wait to play with
this um so we'll get this done we'll get
this fixed then we
will host this on GitHub Pages which I
personally believe is the easiest way to
like go from prototype to live on the
internet uh as fast as other people use
repet uh netify
they're all good they're all great I'm
just I work in GitHub a lot so I just
got used to GitHub
Pages let's also add okay so it's adding
some let's add a fix to ensure the mouse
let's make one more change to ensure the
input field works properly and I've
fixed the
issue all right let's accept this let's
give it a shot hop open the game
refresh okay we're shooting
man I it even put the powerups and I
didn't I didn't tell it to put power ups

[1:01:00]
didn't I didn't tell it to put power ups
in I was like oh you want to go viral
let's do some powerups anyway here we go
uh boom that's
working man if this works submit score
score submitted
successfully oh baby wow all right here
we go
oh there it
is wow all right folks if you're not
build in
something and you're not playing with
these
tools what are you doing what are you
doing stop watching us stop listening to
us like at this point just like turn
this off I mean don't turn it off we
love you you know um we'd love you to
watch it to the end but honestly like
it's a shame that this exists today and
people aren't playing with it like the
people who play with this put it another
way the people that play with this right
now there's like a moment opportunity
there's a window like there's an
Arbitrage here like building apps here

[1:02:01]
Arbitrage here like building apps here
right like um there is an Arbitrage so I
I highly recommend
people go and put some stuff out
there yeah it's uh we're we're in this
incredible moment in time where we have
this brand new technology right that
does these incredibly powerful things
right we just witnessed it build like an
actually incredible lead gen in I don't
know half an hour or
so but at the same
time most people aren't using it to do
these things right and there's going to
eventually come a time in the next year
the next two years where everyone is
doing something like this right you saw
it as we talked about earlier with like
the newsletters on X right three years
ago when I started my newsletter not
many people were doing it so I was able
to get tens of thousands of subscribers
like that but now everyone's doing it so
that strategy doesn't work anymore like
we're in that beginning moment of this
strategy where people who attack it and
use it are going to see unbelievable

[1:03:01]
use it are going to see unbelievable
returns uh and then in three years when
everyone's doing it the returns won't be
there so you need to be looking for
these opportunities where they're really
powerful and not many people are doing
it because as you said that's the
Arbitrage
opportunity it's pretty mind-blowing
that I'm like I'm actively getting
mindblown as we do
this so uh Greg should we show them how
to quickly put it live uh on the
Internet or uh is that the best Next
Step you think here yeah I mean that's I
we need to close the loop on that for
sure that's the number one feedback I
get when I'm putting YouTube videos out
and coding stuff is like I you don't
show it how to put it live fine we'll do
it we'll do it we'll put it
live you know it's also like if you're
watching Greg's podcast like this is
amazing educational content if you're
just watching this and consuming
educational content and then you're not
doing anything with it what's what are
you doing what's the point agreed you
just you got to take action man uh okay

[1:04:03]
just you got to take action man uh okay
this is amazing I'm seriously blown
away last step
here for those who don't know I'm sure
you got a sophisticated audience but for
those who don't know just in case
GitHub basically the only code
repository on the Internet it's where
you store your code it's where you can
run your code from uh anyone who's
anyone they put their their code on
GitHub so good to be familiar with it if
you're starting to do something like
this but last step here I want to host
this on GitHub pages so other people can
play the game how do we do
that bada bing bada boom Claude I'm sure
we'll do this incred this is probably
the easiest step out of all them I'm
fill your happy with the game let's set
up GitHub pages to post your game so
others can play it here's how to do it
so we're going to set up get AIT

[1:05:02]
run now let's create a g ignore to
exclude unnecessary
files now let's add your files to the
git repository run and I'm sure in a
second here it's going to have us go
into GitHub and and set up a
repository create a GitHub repository
and push your code okay so we going to
go to GitHub and I will show the folks
at home how to do this if they're
new uh
screen
window let me actually pop open GitHub
first so we're there okay um here we go
window GitHub all right so we'll create
a new
repository we can call
this space
shooter um space Shooters available
think get public we'll create the repo
something went

[1:06:00]
something went
wrong okay GitHub GitHub doesn't want
to GitHub doesn't want to cooperate me
here let's just try a different game
email space shooter
email I just wanted a different name
there we go okay so we made what did we
call it space shooter email all right
let's
go name your repository leave it as a
public repository do not initialize the
read me create after creating the
reposit get up will show you commands to
push your existing repository you'll
need to run these commands
Okay let's do this I'm going to switch
back my screen so you can see how I do
this in
cursor I'm just following step by step
everything it's having me to do there's
nothing too complex
here let's do this let's open the
terminal let's move this
over let's change this so let's the
correct command I'm going to make it so
it's my username on GitHub which is fin

[1:07:01]
it's my username on GitHub which is fin
a if I remember
correctly uh yes it is SPAC shooter
mail.get thatg and then we're going to
hit enter on this and pray to God that
it works okay so we hit enter let's go
back in
into GitHub and we'll verify it added
our
code there it is it's in our repo all I
did was I followed the instructions we
got the code there and then let's see
what we need to do to host this live uh
enable GitHub Pages after pushing your
code to GitHub go to your repository
click settings on the tab at the top
scroll down to GitHub pages so this is
what we're doing here is we are putting
the code
live um so that it has a link and people

[1:08:00]
live um so that it has a link and people
can go to it and play the game and then
you can then take this link and if
you're on X which listen if you're an
indie hacker if you're an
entrepreneur I in my opinion I think X
and YouTube are the only two places on
planet Earth that have the best uh Indie
hacking communities on the internet I
think if you're an indie hacker you got
to be on both you just have to be on
both um so build and deploy let's see
what it having me do here
uh under Source select main branch so
Source deploy from a branch Branch
main uh under Source like main branch
click
save boom okay
uh create an index file for get get up
paid requires an index. HML file for the
root of your
repository which you already have so
you're all set verify your deployment
after a few minutes your game should be
available at the URL provided by GitHub
Pages you can share the this URL with
others so they can play your game okay
so it is deploying right

[1:09:02]
so it is deploying right
now uh and in just a couple minutes this
should be
live um where do I find the url I think
it
will display it once it's deployed so
what's happening now is it's basically
deploying your sites live here we
go and this is live on the internet
anyone can go on this site right now you
can see at the top there and play the
game and get their uh score on the
leaderboard so there we go you know what
I'm gonna do Greg instead of me going
back instead of me going back and
deleting this super base uh project so
that people don't steal the API key you
just edit out the edit out the part
where you put the API keys in so that we
can keep this up and then the audience
can go in and play this game after if
they're interested in trying out let's
do and then should we do this let's do
this anyone who plays this game after

[1:10:01]
this anyone who plays this game after
you put this live 48 hours later Whoever
has the highest score I'll just venmo
you 50 bucks right so reach out on X DM
whatever send the screenshot to your
scores when you get it Whoever has the
highest score I'll I'll V mow $50 right
add a little competition to it that
should be fun absolutely I like that so
that's games live now you can take this
right
you can go on twitter.com x.com and you
can go hey check out my
game boom and now instead of doing kind
of the standard thing that everyone else
does which is here's a thread on you
know bunch of stuff I copied and pasted
from Wikipedia subscribed to my
newsletter now you like yo I build this
really cool online experience right go
play it and now you get an email a lot
cooler way I think than kind of a thread
so I think this is The Cutting Edge of
how to get emails and all that actually

[1:11:01]
how to get emails and all that actually
the way to the way to do it is you take
a video of yourself playing the game and
the Tweet has the video because the link
is going to suppress the algo then and
then after a few hours as a second tweet
you can include the link so let's let's
now let's get into uh the X ality game
right hook wow I've been or no actually
this has been my favorite hook lately
this is this is wild amazing hook right
keep it simple boom people like wait
what's Wild what the hell is wild I
gotta know what's wild right I just
built a
game I just
built an
insanely fun game
in just three prompts
with Claude Sonet

[1:12:04]
um here's what I'll
do Whoever has the highest score in 48
hours instantly gets 50 bucks
are you posting this uh I'm not going to
post it right now live on here because
I'm gonna I want to make the teaser
video of the game itself yeah um and so
I can put it in that post because little
spoiler for people uh on X uh putting
media into the post boosts it right so
you want to put videos you want to put
images so I'm going to put a video of
the game being played uh and then what
you do is as Greg said you hit the plus
button
right and you just go here and go
link to the game right uh link for the

[1:13:02]
link to the game right uh link for the
game
below screenshot your score and put in
the replies right so boom now we're
getting replies right now we're getting
people to reply with the screenshot of
their scores which which boosts it even
more so you got people boosting it by
watching the video you got people
boosting it by putting in the replies
you got yourself a viral post and the
best part is not only is it going viral
and you're getting followers but you're
now getting tons of emails for your
newsletter as well which is pretty
amazing yeah incredible incredible um
Alex anything else you want to talk
about before we head out couple other
things I try to advance tips and tricks
uh for people out there basically every
AI now including cursor you can upload
images so I tried this before I I did
this a couple days ago um I think
there's something to the strategy I took
the Elon meme the the uh go freak
yourself meme where he's like on the

[1:14:01]
yourself meme where he's like on the
stage at the and he tells the media to
go freaking themselves uh I uploaded
that image to grock and I said turn this
into a game and in one prompt it
actually turned that Meme into a game so
just a way to think about this is like
look for what's trending in the moment
look for what's popular look for what's
getting clicks and AI is so Advanced now
you can do something as simple as take
the image upload it to Ai and say hey
build an exp experence out of this and
do really cool things so I think there
truly is something to
taking uh viral moments in time turning
them into experiences with AI and like
garnering attention that way there's
something truly there and I don't think
a lot of business owners and
entrepreneurs and Indie hackers are
taking advantage of that at the moment I
think that's really the next Frontier of
what you can take advantage of
beautiful Alex thank you so much for
your time you've been extremely generous
um and uh where could people learn about
you support you and and just pay pay it

[1:15:03]
you support you and and just pay pay it
forward three ways uh my ex is what I
focus on the most been working on my ex
forever uh so alexf X to to check out my
Twitter I have a YouTube um I think it's
Alex fin official I'm sure the link will
be down below exactly and then you can
check out my AI content app I built an
app called Creator buddy which launched
a month ago now helps you create content
on X it's super powerful only AI trained
on all your posts on X so it knows all
about you Creator buddy. so those are my
three uh places on the internet all
right well this has been legendary I
appreciate it and uh I'm gonna go code
some
games that's what I'm about to do too by
the way don't forget your middle name is
Cloe by the way I am now Alex Cloe Finn
I did I did like Tyler ATF tobacco
Firearms I thought that was pretty
baller but now I'm ACF so that's fine we

[1:16:00]
baller but now I'm ACF so that's fine we
got AGI so who cares middle names don't
mean anything anymore exactly all right
bye
