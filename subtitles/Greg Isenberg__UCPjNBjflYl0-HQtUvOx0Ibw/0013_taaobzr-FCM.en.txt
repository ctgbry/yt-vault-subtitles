so
gary you've been consistently right at
predicting
you know where things are you know are
going and now you know we've been
following v friends since the beginning
we love the project so much
um what got you into nft communities in
this whole web 3 world
um
basically
an incredible combination of my entire
life right like i'm in my office
obviously i put out a lot of content so
people have seen this like i've been
collecting things my whole life right
sports cards
it's just who i am
um
wine collecting
and i've been
you know at the forefront of consumer
trends and so there's videos of me in
2010 talking about virtual currency and
farmville and
you know um
just a
a brouhaha of events
um
culminating with the explosion of sports
cards again which kept me even closer to

[04:00]
cards again which kept me even closer to
collectibles
covid
allowing for a lot of interesting
behaviors to pop up
natural things that were happening like
roblox and fortnite and nba 2k and
madden skins and i've just been watching
the digital thing
being an early investor in ethereum
and
really just seeing nba top shot and
crypto punks happen and did my 30 40
hours of homework on the current state
of nfts not what i knew about
cryptokitties in 2017
and basically did what i do all the time
whether that was snapchat or tick tock
or musically or
podcasting or to your point i i'm very
fortunate at this point to have a
reputation of being
solid at
having a sense of what's happening and
that's what happened to me i i thought
nfts were going to happen and they've
happened and the way i've learned
learned my whole career is by doing
and so i knew i had to have my own

[05:00]
and so i knew i had to have my own
project i've been working on a toy brand
called workplace warriors for a long
time
um
and that in essence was v friends so
it wasn't hard for me to take these
characters like patient panda and
empathy elephant and turn them into an
nft project instead of
a collectible toys project so
i'm incredibly excited to be at the
forefront of this stuff and
nfts for me are an opportunity for human
beings to create economies
and economies are healthy when you bring
value to the economy and i'm very
good at bringing value to my
constituents and that is my plan with
this project can you i just want to
double down on one thing you said right
there sorry so you said like the 30 to
40 hours of homework you did
what is your process so many people
would benefit from hearing this like
when you get excited about a new idea
you're a very curious person everything
i've always listened to and read about
you is just like your innate curiosity
is very real how do you go do that 30 40
hours of homework like do you have a

[06:00]
hours of homework like do you have a
special way that you go into that rabbit
hole to figure something out yep first
it's the mental commitment right it's
like i'm doing this right like
so it starts with mental commitment
because my time is valuable
um everyone's time is valuable
my time is valuable because of the
opportunities i have other people's time
is valuable because people
perceive their time as valuable so
people don't like wasting time on
something that's a fad
i've always used humility and curiosity
to say an intuition to say okay there's
something here when it's something as
new as nfts i start with youtube
because i don't read well but i listen
well and watch well so it was literally
like nft 101 videos
you know and then i then it was very
heavy twitter search
which led me to realizing people were
very very aggressively active on discord
so then i joined a bunch of discords
and then listened to podcasts read a ton
of twitter

[07:01]
of twitter
hours and hours of twitter conversations
had hypotheses
googled those hypotheses
googled the counterpoint to those
hypotheses
that's important
i'm very careful to not get caught in
the eco chamber i'm almost like a
i'm a boxer i'm a counter puncher right
i want to know the alternative the right
click and save the bad for the
environment the fads like i want to know
every counterpoint
i it's what keeps me from going in on
things it's why i'm not loud about
everything it's why i can be quiet or
talk about the same thing for a year and
a half it means nothing's come along
that
is worthy of my reputational risk to get
loud about
um
so that that's my process
let's talk about uh failure for a second
i know how bullish you are on nfts i'm
you know we're both super bullish how do
how does nfts fail that you know is
there a world where this just doesn't
pan out

[08:00]
pan out
no
but
that's the macro
that says if you asked me this question
in 1996 about the internet
right
calm
of the projects
on the open c top rankings top 200 right
now are incredibly vulnerable against
their valuation
let me say that nice and slow
and by the way for everybody's watching
whether that's 90 or 93 or 99 percent
like right the far majority
of i'm gonna do it right now in real
time i'm going right now to open c
i'll pull it up too yep i'm going to
rankings i'm doing last i'm gonna do all
i'm gonna do
last 30 days
all chains when i look at
you know even the icons like board ape
and crypto punks
like
doodles great project chain runners
super interesting cool cats
kryptos i love gremlin uh cybercons
killing it artifact had their monster

[09:00]
killing it artifact had their monster
dropped the littles has some momentum
right now right um
um swamp first is a cute little one that
i'm pretty hot on
um me bits an iconic one from the crypto
punks comic doing everything right
lately and structurally in my opinion v
friends my own um creature world i've
been on the record of what i think about
danny call
lazy lions a really emphatic community
um every one of the things i just
mentioned vulnerable
so how do you
you know why because they're too
valuable right now
right
but but guess what
in what i just mentioned
there's an ebay and amazon in 1999.
the problem is there's an error over
progress
the arrow of progress is pointing up
and if you go and bet on the space the
macro
it's headed in that direction
does those blockchains that do
affirmation of ownership and contracts

[10:00]
affirmation of ownership and contracts
is here for the rest of everyone's life
right it's here
so what is the right way then for
somebody slowly when people say or nf
power nfts i say stuffed animals stuffed
animals have been here to stay for the
last 200 years
not every stuffed animal company
has turned out well
beanie babies was a fad strawberry
strawberry shortcake my little pony have
been iconic garb cabbage patch kids
iconic in some ways disney stuff other
things you know the wuzzles had a good
year stuffed animals were here to stay
not every stuffed animal toys and
collectibles are here to stay not every
toy and collectible was worth money art
is here to stay sports cards are here to
stay not every sports card nfts are here
to stay for the rest of our lives
the far majority of projects in this
gold rush cannot maintain their value
because the supply of nfts that are
coming into the market is extraordinary
so how do we create

[11:00]
so how do we create
i totally agree with you i think and i
think it's like a great analogy that
you're making to the dot-com burst as an
example pets.com and
the way i think about it is like okay if
i'm a normal person then what i want to
do is i want to invest in the nasdaq
like i just want to invest in the index
of the entire thing because i know that
it's headed that way and it's going to
be amazing and there's a bright future
you mean ethereum
yeah well so that's the question i have
for you right but it is
ethereum yahoo and is going to win the
first seven years of search and is is
solana gonna come is it solana is it
ethereum is it something we don't know
the answer is
you can diversify i'm sitting on e i'm
sitting on other currencies i'm buying a
ton of different nft the reason i went
into nfts more than currency is my
theory is
if ethereum loses i can bridge over my
crypto punks right so
to me the nft asset class
feels in a lot of ways
like an easier bet if you feel like you

[12:00]
like an easier bet if you feel like you
really know which nfts you want to
invest in
but then you kind of need a way to
do that because not everyone has your
specific knowledge base or your ability
to understand all the nuance and go and
learn it there are going to be people my
parents as an example they might want to
participate in this growth so that they
can benefit from it in their retirement
right your parents
will participate leisurely because they
have a son who's going to be like hey
you should buy this one or to your point
they'll buy
bitcoin or ethereum or or maybe in a
year solana or something else
and that's going to be it like like what
people you guys are youngsters what i
learned in 95 6 7 8 9 10 2000 2001 with
wine library was at first everybody told
me nobody would ever buy wine on the
internet
like at all
so that was where we're at now nfts are
stupid right click all that right it's
so funny i have a lot of friends in her
40s and 50s who became their parents

[13:00]
people that don't understand nfts that
make that joke are the same people that
didn't get a cell phone because they
liked their pager
yeah it's easier to hate on nft
on nfts i think than to embrace it for
the vast majority of what you need a
newsletter everyone hated on the iphone
over to blackberry everybody hated on
cell phones over pagers everybody hated
on websites over newspapers like again
you guys are young enough that you
haven't been through enough cycles you
know it you read it i read about home
computers that's how i projected the
internet but like
it's just super clear like people hate
on all big shifts
because they don't understand it
so how do you figure out what you
mentioned your process of learning about
the one once you fit once you kind of
start to have that inkling do you just
surround yourself or talk to the
smartest people you know to figure out
what are they excited about what are
they working on on the weekends so that
you can then go learn about those things

[14:01]
you can then go learn about those things
like how do you actually get that first
spark of curiosity
either a random tweet
comment on my social cold email because
of where i am in my career or to your
point
no question kevin rose one of the
smarter consumer internet people i know
when we were talking about x-men comics
and jordan rookie cards when he said hey
do you know what a crypto do you have a
crypto punk and i said i'm not sure what
that is and he said you remember
cryptokitties i was like of course like
i'd already known about top shot i met
rohan a couple months before top shot
launched i knew nfts were brewing i was
busy it was the holidays last year
last year was still very hardcore covid
so i was trying to navigate my company
um
but as soon as he said that i'm like you
know what i'm gonna dig in a little bit
deeper
and so yes
and what's been really ironic whether
it's dave morin whether you know it's
kevin colleran whether it's msg or
harper reed or you know aaron battalion

[15:00]
harper reed or you know aaron battalion
you know scott belski mike lazarow all
these people that succeeded in web 2
right
that i respected and thought were
thoughtful
miraculously
in january february we're all circling
around like buzzards i'm getting a text
from friends that i haven't talked to in
six months six years
because we've all been a little bit out
of the white hot moment of 2007 to 11 of
web 2.
sure enough even even people that aren't
in it right now that are a little bit
more discreet which is why i'm not going
to mention them
um who really made some serious wins in
web 2. even they reached out in february
march and say they're kind of
demotivated or focused on other things
but even they were like hey what is this
thing
uh
you could see the spidey senses of the
people that really understand when [ __ ]
changes and then a couple of icons again
i won't mention them who really didn't
get it and came back to me in the last

[16:01]
get it and came back to me in the last
six to eight weeks and said [ __ ] and i
remember like being disappointed in them
like oh i lost they lost their edge or
they don't give a [ __ ] or or
one of two things they got soft because
they have too much money or the better
version
they made so much money they're on to
fixing the environment or the political
system they went altruistic right so you
know it's it's really fun to watch
humans evolve but yes keeping
people again when you guys get to my age
you've got that extra generation you're
going to have your whole little crew of
the people you've decided over this
decade are smart are good
and you'll find it fascinating in 20
years when the next thing pops off
you'll be surprised how many of them are
like it's been a renaissance for some of
my good friends of web 2 and we're
enjoying it because it feels like the
old days right you can you can it feels
like web 2 0's beginning when nobody
understood social media and content
that's exactly what's happening with
nfts
did you uh did you follow aaron levy in
real time transitioning from like an

[17:01]
real time transitioning from like an
anti-web 3 guy to like the most pro web
3 guy in the span of like 72 hours you
know aaron was never really we were
never in each other's circle heavy
obviously connected through many
different people but never really we
never really got to chop
so between that and just you know how
much information is being thrown around
and usually i pride myself in seeing
that i miss that but
it makes so much sense right like all of
us have to go through it it's like look
i invested in ethereum and bitcoin in
kind of glanced at cryptokitties i
didn't buy one
you know
you you're you're in what you're in and
you get busy and you get your life
evolves what you're able to capacity do
in your late 20s is different as your
family grows up and
like it you know like
humility and curiosity will cure success
to be good at this i rely on those
things but even for me like there's a
million things going on he can't get to
everything

[18:00]
everything
what i love
in what you just said is the humility
even with his success
to be able to quote unquote evolve in
front of everybody and not fear changing
his mind because i think changing your
mind is a huge strength i actually think
there's a lot of people
right now
that
are in a really tough spot because
they've been very anti-nft
they've had the aha that it's real and
they don't have the humility
to say they were wrong and they're going
to double down on something they don't
believe in and i hope they see this clip
and it makes them feel comfortable to
change their mind
yeah so what you're saying is like
it's okay to change your mind it's
actually a competitive advantage it's a
competitive advantage like i'm never
scared to say i'm wrong i didn't see it
like like i love that
one thing that's funny about me is i do
that all the time one thing that people
would be very confused by hearing
because i don't think people should
spend the time to really pay attention
to me to understand every little nuance

[19:02]
to me to understand every little nuance
i just never get loud when i'm not at a
hundred percent if i'm at 97
i won't make a single comment publicly
about it
until i cross the chasm
that's why you see me get so loud it's
when i get to a hundred
musically tick-tock snapchat uh you know
podcast uh nfts once i get to 100
there's zero data on my mind and i go
pop committed reputation on the line
but
you should see i mean you know you know
how little vr content there is in the
world for me
because i'm still in 97 i i don't have
my hundred percent
so i'm scared to say anything
i don't get interesting you understand
there's so much content of me on the
internet you guys know this plenty of
people don't love my aggressive
communication style and i'm empathetic
to that
if i gave people ammo of being wrong a
lot they would [ __ ] make unlimited
videos of me being wrong there's not

[20:00]
videos of me being wrong there's not
that many you know why because
i don't try to say [ __ ] about things i
don't know
you're not scott galloway
with the uh with the predictions on tech
companies yeah to me that's you know i
love scott too and i'm not i'm not yeah
i love him too actually i think he's
amazing yeah i'm scared to do that i
don't want as a matter of fact one of i
got very lucky there's a very funny
video of me in a suit by the way which
is rare
because i was doing this show the daily
when the ipad came out and they asked me
to do a prediction show and i fought
like hell i didn't even wear this is a
you were about to get a funny very nerdy
garyvee scoop i was supposed to wear a
tuxedo for the new year's episode
which i had because i'd go to weddings
right but i didn't wear it with the hope
that they were going to get upset
because they were very professional
and like let me not do it that's how
much i didn't want to do a prediction
show
because i'm scared to predict

[21:01]
ironically it turned into one of my best
moments because i predicted that
facebook was going to buy instagram and
they did
but
i don't like predicting i don't predict
observe and then i'm emphatic
about my observation when it crosses my
101 percentile belief chasm which is
fairly rare if you look at my content
over the last decade
i'm only talking about seven or ten
things i'm just
not willing to be wrong if i can help it
what do you what do you
what do you observe around brands and
nfts so
i think we went through i think it's
gonna i'm sorry interrupt i think it's
gonna be just like social ninety percent
up front i'm gonna make garbage
ten percent if you remember early brands
on social zappos had a big move on it
that worked for them
there were some other brands that did a
really nice job then you look at brands
that were built from social jim shark i
just joined the board fashion nova

[22:01]
just joined the board fashion nova
another one you know like
casper i mean we can go on and on with a
lot of brands that we're building so
social um
but 90 will be done poorly and 10 will
be done awesome i you know i'm very
proud you're catching me at a funny time
we just launched our we're working for
four months on the budweiser launch that
we had and if you look at you know it
was very strong yesterday because we
really know what we're talking about to
their credit they really let us do the
right thing
and so you know vayner nft with avery at
the helm she's amazing we're gonna do
good work and a lot of other companies
will pop up and do good work build
equity with brands and just like
anything with brands ninety percent will
be atrocious because it's a
transactional short
cheesy tone-deaf not understanding but i
do think you'll see some gems in there
brands have money and leverage access so
they can do some really cool stuff with
their smart contracts
right so when we look at you know the
openc you know it's 2026 and we're
looking at openc last 30-day sales
when we went through that list

[23:00]
when we went through that list
that was mostly web 3 brands do we think
you know it's going to be 50 50 you know
old school brands with web3 brand 7525
any any insight there
um
i think it'll be 10 brands 20 brands i
think you'll see publishers gaming
companies like ip that we right now v
friends board ape cool cats ip getting
established but you're going to see
hello kitty you're going to see the
flintstones so you're going to see some
icons harry potter you're going to see
some new stuff the friends of board ape
is going to feel like icons because
we'll be old by then new [ __ ] will pop
up brands will be there really social
media
you'll see jennifer aniston join late
and get fi right right jay-z jointly and
you'll see charlie demilio and logan
paul build from there and everything in
between
it makes sense the so the hit the couple
like the three
pretty actionable things that i'm taking
away from hearing you talk about this
stuff one is like the importance of skin

[24:00]
stuff one is like the importance of skin
in the game like if you're gonna go
learn something you've got to put some
skin in the game and that is the best
way to learn because suddenly you're
like really invested in it two
it's like the willingness to just
admit you don't [ __ ] know something
and not be afraid to admit that and
continue to own that until you do know
it and for you like you're saying 97 96
for some people that might be like you
know 20 30 just continuing to say i
don't know i don't have an opinion on
this because i haven't earned the right
to have that opinion yet um and then the
third one for me is just like be willing
to change your mind and go search for
those counter punches the way you put it
of the people that just disagree with
you that you're like oh [ __ ] yeah i'm
not actually thinking about that the
right way i was flipped completely
opposite of how i should have been like
those three things to me are really
popping out of what you're saying
i think it's extremely good recap you
know usually i'm pretty long-winded but
i don't have much to add to that i think
that's a the right recap i think
i think i have so much confidence i have

[25:02]
i think i have so much confidence i have
so much conviction and i have so much
energy that what is incredibly difficult
to see unless you're on the inside with
me
is i use humility as my biggest core
driver i'm not scared because i don't
think i'm special
like this is really important
i don't think i'm better than any man or
woman i really don't i'm aware that i'm
professionally successful
i'm aware that i have nice relationships
so are
hundreds of millions of people
i genuinely believe what makes
everything palpable for me and others
that have something
is humility it's also what grounds you
in the ability to innovate
yep
absolutely so i know we've got a couple
minutes left i do need to ask you the
question of for any listeners out there
i mean i've taken so much personally
from watching you and listening to your
different um your different social
accounts and things you've been saying

[26:00]
accounts and things you've been saying
publicly for years like what are the
two or three pieces of advice one piece
of advice you give to
an 18 year old a 22 year old and you
know maybe they don't come from the best
situation they're not they didn't grow
up in a wealthy family
yeah walk me it didn't work
is that gary's great i love that i mean
i've been really thinking like honestly
look at number one honestly
no matter
yeah no matter what you come from let me
give you one that i think is a secret of
life ready for this this one blows me
away
not everyone has this many don't but
many do if you grow up in a family that
doesn't have a very big financial bag
middle call it lower middle class and
down
and you have happiness in your home
you are
winning
if you are trained in the first 18 years
of your life
that happiness and joy
is not attached to money you are

[27:01]
is not attached to money you are
unstoppable and you're looking at that
person right now and i realized it when
i started seeing patterns
if you're grateful for what you have
instead of envious for what you don't
have
you will always win
there will always be somebody with more
money there will always be somebody
that's better looking there's always
somebody more athletic better grades
nicer car there always will be
there's also always going to be somebody
that's less there's 850 million people
on this earth
that do not have access to clean fresh
water
there's nobody watching this video right
now
that isn't in a remarkable situation
compared to the 8 billion
i don't know what else to tell you
like once you get there
once you really lean into gratitude
everything else clicks
i'm gonna give you another one since
it's right here on my desk number three
is probably leading to the most
happiness for me

[28:01]
happiness for me
i don't think
our world right now is built on valuing
accountability we're in full blame mode
and that's why so many people are upset
personal accountability
it's huge can you talk more about that
yeah
when when you don't focus on what you've
done wrong
and you're in full blame game when
you're in fingers instead of thumbs
you don't feel in control which then
immediately makes you upset
like if you think it's the government's
fault or your teacher's fault or your
parents fault or your boyfriend's fault
or your girlfriend's fault or your
brother's fault or society's fault or
luck's fault or if you think it's
something else's fault you by nature are
giving up control giving up control
feels very helpless and very desperate
and i'm
it
i i feel like accountability makes me
happy i think everything at vaynermedia
is my fault

is my fault
now that's a very overarching thing but
here's where i go with it if sally the
vp screws up or rick the vp screws up
well i hired the person that hired them
the end
right
and i think that right now because of
social media the mainstream media our
social unrest for a decade
it's just [ __ ] you know i've been
thinking a lot about this lately that
the world is very passionate to go blue
and red not just politically just like
how everyone's living their life
and like so much of my happiness comes
from purple
and i've been thinking a lot about that
i think accountability is incredibly
important i really do like what what
have you done
like it's almost like man you could do
anything like i love the fact that you
can do anything like even if you don't
like the country you live in no matter
where you are canada america
russia china you know and everything in
between like

[30:00]
between like
you could immigrate
my parents did
you know this is why i love web 3 by the
way is this exact idea like we've now
had conversations with some of the most
amazing minds in web 3 and one of the
things that i just blows me away about
everything about it is
it doesn't matter if you're a kid on the
street in india my family's from india
growing up with nothing or if you're a
country club kid growing up in greenwich
connecticut you have access to the
internet
and you can contribute and you can be in
these communities you can get in a
discord you can talk to people you can
build with other people
and the promise of that is so inspiring
that it's hard not to get behind it and
want to invest in it
the end the end we just we just um we
just spoke to geo the co-founder of uh
axey infinity yep and we're like how did
you
co-found axiomfinity he's like i
literally joined the discord
and then i became a co-founder he was

[31:00]
and then i became a co-founder he was
mopping floors in the district he was
like i was the community i was like i
was running yeah i joined the discord
this is a very special time i hope
people take advantage of it i have to go
to a family thing right now so i gotta
go but it's a special time don't miss
you're watching this video you're ahead
of 99 of the world do something about it
cheers well we appreciate you gary thank
you guys thank you so much man we'll see
you soon cheers bye-bye see ya
legend
what a legend dude i want to go run
through a brick wall right now
what an absolute legend
we're still on oh we're still hot well
he's a total [ __ ] legend
i was like i'm sweating like i want to
go run through a brick wall that was
great especially that ending yes that
ending was
really uplifting it really fires me up
man that was so cool really really cool
um takeaways ah geez so i mean i
summarized it when i was on there but
like for me the coolest things he said
um skin in the game when he was just
saying like one of the first things he

[32:00]
saying like one of the first things he
does as part of his process is he goes
and like puts a little into it um to
force himself to learn i'm a big
believer in that like when we when you
first got me in nfts the first thing i
did was go and do something stupid like
i i didn't mean to but i put some skin
in the game and i lost a bunch of money
on ether lambos and that was a great
learning experience for me i learned a
lot from it that's a that was a great
one for me and then the other two were
like kind of connected but just don't be
afraid to say i don't know about things
i thought that was so cool the way he
said he doesn't publicly say something
until he's 100 on it and then he gets
loud and so people like oh this guy's
allowed but you don't see all the
background all the work he's done to get
to a hundred on it and then that final
one of just like be willing to change
your mind right is such a powerful
concept and so many people can learn
from that because we live in this
polarized black and white culture where
you're not supposed to change your mind
you're supposed to be we used to like
criticize politicians for being
flip-floppers personally i look at that
and say that's actually a pretty
powerful thing that someone was able to
change their mind on an issue um and so
shifting the culture around that and his

[33:01]
shifting the culture around that and his
points on that i thought were just so so
astute
for me
uh what do you call it the counter
punches yeah i like that counter punches
so
understand them so for example
uh with nfts there's a bunch of counter
punch arguments which is like it's bad
for the environment it's a ponzi scheme
uh like so list it out and go actually
do the research and try to understand
and have a point of view
i feel like not enough people
you know on both sides like either pro
nfts
or anti-nfts or pro
this political party or auntie you know
and all assets a lot aspects of life i
think we don't do a good enough job at
understanding the counter punches i
agree with that i also think
it's because like social media culture
has made the like little quick quip um
you get a dopamine hit from that because
you do the little like ngmi to somebody
that says they don't understand it or
they provide a counter okay boomer no

[34:01]
they provide a counter okay boomer no
and people like it and people go like it
now you're like oh saying ngm i got me a
bunch of likes i'm gonna keep doing that
but the reality is when someone says
like oh i don't understand how this
works nick huber our friend like
constantly does that he questions these
different things in web3 and crypto for
me i find it as like personally
motivating to them to try to understand
why he thinks that and how you can
figure it out but the natural reaction
on social is to just like yell at the
person attack yeah attack and it doesn't
do you any good when you do that you
actually aren't learning you're not
developing you're not strengthening your
point of view and anything you're just
ignoring a counterargument to it and
especially if the counter argument comes
from someone you consider intelligent or
credible
it's worth listening to yeah i think
what i've noticed on places like twitter
is that
it feels like
everyone is attacking everyone a lot of
the times
and
it doesn't need to be the case like it's
totally cool to ask questions learn
understand counter punches so i think uh
listen i thought that conversation went
really well and it it started at web 3

[35:01]
really well and it it started at web 3
and i think it ended at um like life
lessons so yeah i mean i think it's
funny for me because like gary um
i've never met him i know him from his
online personas and the things he's done
and
i've always admired his energy and
enthusiasm around different issues and
things he's working on but i came away
from that just being like this [ __ ] is
the real deal man i mean like i got
fired up listening to him he is
motivating he's inspiring but he's also
humble and his humility around learning
these things and wanting to dive in his
track record of getting things right
once he dives in on things and figuring
them out he's not just some like
motivation guy you know that's just out
there motivating people like he is
really in the weeds putting his money
where his mouth is diving in on things
like in the in the battle in the
trenches um i i mean i was blown away i
love it
i thought it was awesome that was
awesome we're looking forward to getting
in the community after this we're gonna
do our best to get gary in there with us
