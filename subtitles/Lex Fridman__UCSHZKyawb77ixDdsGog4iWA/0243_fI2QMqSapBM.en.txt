- So time and space are emergent.
We kind of mentioned in the beginning,
but can you elaborate,
what do you feel, hope is
fundamental in our universe?
- A wave function living in Hilbert space.
- A wave function in Hilbert space
that we can't intellectualize
or visualize, really.
- We can't visualized it.
We can intellectualize it very easily.
- Like, well, how do you think about--
- [Interviewee] It's a
vector in the 10 to the 10
to the 122 dimensional vector space.
It's a complex vector, unit norm,
it evolves according to
the Schrodinger equation.
- Got it.
When you put it that way--
- [Interviewee] What's so hard, really?
(both laughing)
- [Interviewer] Yep.
