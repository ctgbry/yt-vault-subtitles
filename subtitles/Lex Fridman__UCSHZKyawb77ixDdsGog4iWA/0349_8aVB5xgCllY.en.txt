measure passion not progress so most of
us get an average of about 27,000 days

with a passionate pursuit of something
not by how much you've progressed
towards a particular goal because goals
are grounded in your comparison to other
human beings to something that's already
been done before passionate pursuit of
something is the way you achieve

who care for you like like I mentioned

who care for you like like I mentioned
your friends your family should not be

secure job because passion looks

it looks insecure advisors colleagues
will tell you to be pragmatic because
passionate looks like a distraction from
the main effort that you should be
focusing on
and since society will tell you to be to
find balance work-life balance in your
life because passion looks unhealthy
