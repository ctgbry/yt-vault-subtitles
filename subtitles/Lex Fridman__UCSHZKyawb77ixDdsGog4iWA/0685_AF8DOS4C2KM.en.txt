[00:00]
- The great lie we tell ourselves,
is that people who are evil
are not like us.
They're a class apart.
Everybody in history who
has sinned is a person
who's very different from me.
Robert George, the
philosopher over at Princeton,
he's fond of doing sort
of thought experiment
in his classes where he asks
people to raise their hand
if they had lived in Alabama

[00:16]
in 1861, "How many of you
would be abolitionists?"
And everybody raises
their hand and he says,
"Of course that's not true.
"Of course, that's not true."
The best protection against
evil is recognizing that it lies
in every human heart and the possibility

[00:30]
that it takes you over.
- Do you ever sit back,
in the quiet of your mind and think,
Am I participating in evil?
The following is a
conversation with Ben Shapiro,
a conservative political commentator,

[00:46]
host of the Ben Shapiro Show,
co-founder of The Daily Wire,
and author of several books,
including The Authoritarian Moment,
The Right Side of History,
and Facts Don't Care About Your Feelings.
Whatever your political leanings,

[01:01]
I humbly ask that you try to
put those aside and listen
with an open mind,
trying to give the most
charitable interpretation
of the words we say.
This is true in general for this podcast.
Whether the guest is Ben Shapiro

[01:16]
or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
Donald Trump or Barack Obama.
I will talk to everyone from every side,
from the far left to the far right,
from presidents to prisoners,
from artists to scientists,

[01:32]
from the powerful to the powerless.
Because we are all human,
all capable of good and evil,
all with fascinating stories
and ideas to explore.
I seek only to understand,
and in so doing,

[01:47]
hopefully add a bit of love to the world.

And now, dear friends, here's Ben Shapiro.

[02:01]
Let's start with a difficult topic.
What do you think about
the comments made by Ye,
formerly known as Kanye
West, about Jewish people?
- They're awful and antisemitic,
and they seem to get worse over time.
They started off with the
bizarre death con 3 tweet,

[02:18]
and then they went into even
more stereotypical garbage
about Jews and Jews being
sexual manipulators.
I think that was the Pete
Davidson, Kim Kardashian stuff.
And then, Jews running all of the media,

[02:31]
Jews being in charge of the
financial sector, Jewish people.
I mean, there's no, I mean,
I called it on my show,
there's Sherman Nazism,
and it is,
it's like right
from Protocols of the
Elders of Zion type stuff.
- Do you think those words come from pain,

[02:45]
where do they come from?
- It's always hard to try
and read somebody's mind,
what he looks like,
to me, just having
experience in my own family
with people who are bipolar is,
he seems like a bipolar personality.
He seems like somebody
who is in the middle
of a manic episode.

[03:00]
And when you're manic you
tend to say a lot of things
that you shouldn't say,
and you tend to believe that
they're the most brilliant
things ever said.
The Washington Post,
did an entire piece
speculating about how bipolarism played
into the kind of stuff that Ye was saying.

[03:15]
And it's hard for me to think
that it's not playing into it,
especially because even
if he is an anti-Semite,
and I have no reason to suspect he's not,
given all of his comments.
If he had an ounce of common sense,
he would stop at a certain point.

[03:30]
And bipolarism tends
to drive you well past
the point where common sense applies.
So, I would imagine it's coming from that.
From his comments,
I would also imagine that he's
doing the logical mistake,

[03:46]
that a lot of anti-Semites
or racist or bigots do;
which is somebody hurt
me, that person is a Jew,
therefore all Jews are bad.
And,cthat jump from a
person did something to me,
I don't like,
who's a member of a
particular race or class,

[04:01]
and therefore everybody of
that race or class is bad.
That's textbook bigotry
and that's pretty obviously
what Ye's engaging in here.
- So jumping from the
individual to the group.
That's the way he's been
expressing it, right.
He keeps talking about his Jewish agents,
and I watched your interview
with him and you kept saying,
"So just name the agents."
Just name the people who
are, who are screwing you.

[04:17]
And he wouldn't do it.
Instead, he just kept
going back to the general,
the group, the Jews in general.
I mean, that's textbook bigotry.
And, if we're putting any other context,
he would probably recognize it as such.

[04:30]
- To the degree is worth
fuel hate in the world.
What's the way to reverse that process?
What's the way to alleviate the hate?
- I mean, when it comes to
alleviating the kind of stuff
that he's saying, obviously debunking it.

[04:45]
Making clear that what
he's saying is garbage.
But, the reality is that I
think that for most people
who are in any way
engaged with these issues,
I don't think they're being convinced
to be antisemitic by Ye.

[05:00]
I think that there's a group
of people who may be swayed
that antisemitism is acceptable
because Ye is saying what he's saying,
and he's saying so very loudly,
and he's saying it over and over.
But yeah, I think that for example,
there were these signs that
were popping up in Los Angeles

[05:15]
saying, Ye is right.
Well, that group's been out
there posting antisemitic
signs on the freeways for years.
And, there are groups like that
posting antisemitic signs
where I live in Florida.
They've been doing that for years.
Well before YA was saying
this sort of stuff,
it's just like latest opportunity
to kind of jump on on
that particular bandwagon.
But listen, I think that
people do have a moral duty

[05:33]
to call that stuff out.
- So there is a degree
to which it normalizes
that kind of idea that
Jews control the media,
Jews control X institution.

[05:45]
Is there a way to talk about
a high representation of
a group like Jewish people
in a certain institution like the media
or Hollywood and so on,
without it being a hateful conversation?

[06:02]
- Sure, of course.
A high percentage of, higher
than statistically represented,
in the population,
percentage of Hollywood
agents are probably Jewish.
A higher percentage of lawyers generally
are probably Jewish.
A high percentage of
accountants are probably Jewish.

[06:16]
Also, a higher percentage of of engineers
are probably Asian.
Statistical truths are statistical truths.
It doesn't necessarily mean
anything about the nature
of the people who are being talked about.
They're a myriad of reasons

[06:30]
why people might be disproportionately
in one arena or another;
ranging from the cultural
to sometimes the genetic.
There are certain areas of the world
where people are better
long distance runners
because of their genetic adaptations
in those particular areas of the world.
That's not racist.

[06:45]
That's just fact.
What starts to get racist
is when you are attributing
a bad characteristic
to an entire population
based on the notion
that some members of that population
are doing bad things.
- Yeah, there's a jump between.

[07:00]
It's also possible that
record label owners
as a group have a kind of
culture that F's over artists.
- Sure.
- Doesn't treat artists fairly.
And, it's also possible that
there's a high representation
of Jews in the group of
people that own record labels,

[07:19]
But, it's that small,
but a very big leap that
people take from the group
that own record labels to all Jews.
- For sure.
I think that one of the
other issues also is that

[07:32]
antisemitism is fascinating
because it breaks down into
so many different parts.
Meaning that, if you look
at sort of different types
of antisemitism, if you're a
racist against black people,
it's typically because you're
racist based on the color
of their skin.
If you're racist, against
the Jews, you're antisemitic.

[07:47]
Then, there are actually
a few different ways
that breaks down, right.
You have antisemitism
in terms of ethnicity;
which is like Nazi-esk antisemitism.
You have Jewish parentage,
you have a Jewish grandparent,
therefore you are,
your blood is corrupt
and you are inherently going
to have bad properties.

[08:01]
Then, there's sort of old
school religious antisemitism;
which is that the Jews
are the killers of Christ,
or the Jews are the sons
of pigs and monkeys,
and therefore Judaism is bad
and therefore Jews are bad.
And, the way that you get
out of that antisemitism
historically speaking is mass conversion;

[08:16]
which most antisemitism for a
couple thousand years actually
was not ethnic,
it was much more rooted in
this sort of stuff, right.
If a Jew converted out of the faith,
then the antisemitism was
quote unquote alleviated.
And then, there's a sort
of bizarre antisemitism

[08:32]
that's political antisemitism,
and that is members of a
group that I don't like
are disproportionately Jewish.
Therefore all Jews are
members of this group
or are predominantly
represented in this group.

[08:46]
So, you'll see Nazis saying
the communists are Jews.
You'll see communist
saying the Nazis are Jews,
or you'll see communist
saying that the capitalists
rather are Jews.
And, so that's the weird
thing about antisemitism.
It's kind of like the
Jews behind every corner.
It's basically a big conspiracy theory.

[09:00]
Unlike a lot of other forms of racism;
which are not really conspiracy theory,
antisemitism tends to
be a conspiracy theory
about the levers of power
being controlled by a
shadowy cadre of people
who are getting together
behind closed doors
to control things.
- Yeah, the most absurd
illustration of antisemitism,

[09:15]
just like you said, is Stalin
versus Hitler over Poland.
That every bad guy was a Jew, right.
It was like, every enemy,
there's a lot of different
enemy groups, intellectuals,
political and so on.
Military, and behind any
movement that is considered

[09:33]
the enemy for the Nazis,
and any movement that's
considered the enemy
for the Soviet army are the Jews.
What is the fact that Hitler took power

[09:45]
teach you about human nature?
When you look back at the
history of the 20th century,
what do you learn from that time?
- I mean, there are a bunch of lessons
to Hitler taking power.
The first thing, I think
people ought to recognize
about Hitler taking power
is that the power had been centralized

[10:01]
in the government before Hitler took it.
If you actually look at the
history of Nazi Germany,
the Weimar Republic had
effectively collapsed.
The power had been centralized
in the Chancellery,
and really under Hindenburg
for a couple of years before that.

[10:16]
And so, it was only a
matter of time until someone
who was bad grabbed the power.
And so, the struggle between
the reds and the browns
in Nazism, in pre-Nazi Germany,
led to this kind of up
spiraling of radical sentiment

[10:31]
that allowed Hitler in
through the front door,
not through the back door.
He was elected.
- So you think communists
could have also taken power.
- I mean, there's no question communists
could have taken power.
They were a serious force
in in pre-Nazi Germany.
- Do you think there was
an underlying current
that would've led to an atrocity,

[10:45]
if the communist had taken power?
- Wouldn't have been
quite the same atrocity,
but obviously the
communists in Soviet Russia,
at exactly this time were,
were committing the Holodomor.
- Yeah.
- So it was, there were very few good guys
in terms of good parties.
The moderate parties were
being dragged by the radicals

[11:00]
into alliance with them
to prevent the worst case
scenario from the other guy.
So if you look at,
I'm sort of fascinated by
the history of this period,
because it really does speak to,
how does a democracy break down?
I mean, the 20's,
Weimar Republic was a
very liberal democracy.

[11:16]
How does a liberal democracy break down
into complete fascism,
and then into genocide?
And, there's a character
who was very prominent
in the history at that
time named Franz von Papen,
who was actually the
second to last chancellor
of the Republic before Hitler.

[11:30]
So he was the chancellor,
and then he handed over to Schleicher.
And then, he ended up,
Schleicher ended up collapsing,
and that ended up handing
power over to Hitler.
It was Papen who had stumped for Hitler
to become chancellor.
Papen was a Catholic Democrat.
He didn't like Hitler.

[11:45]
He thought that Hitler was
a radical and a nut job,
but he also thought that
Hitler being a buffoon,
as he saw it,
was going to essentially be
usable by the right forces
in order to prevent the
communists from taking power.

[12:00]
Maybe in order to restore
some sort of legitimacy
to the regime because he was popular.
In order for Papen
to retain power himself.
And then, immediately
after Hitler taking power,
Hitler basically kills
all of Papen's friends.
Papen out of quote
unquote loyalty, stays on.

[12:15]
He ends up helping the
Anschluss in Austria.
All this stuff is really interesting,
mainly because what it
speaks to is the great lie
we tell ourselves that people who are evil
are not like us.
They're a class apart.
People who do evil things,
people who support evil
people; they're not like us.
That's an easy call.

[12:31]
Everybody, in history who has sinned
is a person who's very different from me.
Robert George, the
philosopher over at Princeton,
he's fond of doing a sort
of thought experiment
in his classes where he asks people
to raise their hand if
they had lived in Alabama
in 1861, "How many of you
would be abolitionists?"

[12:47]
And everybody raises their hand.
And he says, "Of course that's not true."
Of course, that's not true.
The best protection
against evil is recognizing
that it lies in every human heart,
and the possibility
that it takes you over.

[13:01]
And so, you have to be very
cautious in how you approach
these issues, and the back
and forth of politics,
the sort of bipolarity of politics,
or the polarization in politics
might be a better way to put it,
makes it very easy to kind of fall

[13:16]
into the rock 'em sock 'em robots
that eventually could
theoretically allow you to support
somebody who's truly
frightening and hideous
in order to stop somebody who you think
is more frightening and hideous.
And, you see this kinda
language, by the way,
now pre-dominating almost all
over the western world, right.

[13:31]
My political enemy is
an enemy of democracy.
My political enemy is
gonna end the republic.
My political enemy
is going to be the person
who destroys the country
we live in.
And so, that person has to be stopped
by any means necessary.
And, that's dangerous stuff.

[13:46]
- So the communists had to
be stopped in Nazi Germany,
and so they're the devil.
And so any useful buffoon,
as long as they're effective
against the communists would do.
Do you ever wonder,
because the people that
are participating in evil

[14:01]
may not understand that
they're doing evil.
Do you ever sit back, you know,
in the quiet of your mind and think,
Am I participating in evil?
- I mean, my business partner and I,
one of our favorite memes
is from there's a British comedy show,

[14:17]
the name escapes me.
Of these two guys who
are members of the SS,
and they're dressed in the SS uniforms
and the black uniforms
with the skulls on them.
And they're saying to each
other, one says to the other guy,
"You notice like the British,
their symbol is something,

[14:30]
"It's something nice.
"And it's like, it's like an eagle,
"But ours, it's a skull and crossbones.
"You see that the Americans,
"You see the, the blue
uniforms very nice and pretty.
"Ours are jet black, are we the baddies?"
And you know, that's it.
(hearty laughing)
And the truth is, we look
back at the Nazis and we say,

[14:46]
"Well, of course they were the baddies.
"They wore black uniforms
and they had jack boots
"And they had this..."
And, of course they were the bad guys.
But, evil rarely presents
its face so clearly.
So yeah, I mean,
I think you have to constantly
be thinking along those lines
and hopefully you try to avoid it.

[15:02]
You can only do the best
that a human being can do.
But yeah, the answer is yes,
I would say that I spend an
inordinate amount of time
reflecting on whether I'm
doing the right thing,

[15:15]
and I may not always do the right thing.
I'm sure a lot of people
think that I'm doing the wrong
thing on a daily basis.
But, it's definitely a question
that has to enter your mind,
as a historically aware and
hopefully morally decent person.
- Do you think
you're mentally strong
enough, if you realize,

[15:30]
that you are on the wrong side
of history to switch sides?
Very few people in history
seem to be strong enough
to do that.
- I think that the answer,
I hope would be yes.
You never know until the time
comes and you have to do it.
I will say that having heterodox
opinions in a wide variety

[15:47]
of areas is something
that I have done before.
I'm the only person I've
ever heard of in public life,
who actually has a list on their website
of all the dumb stupid
things I've ever said.

[16:00]
Where I go through and I either say,
this is why I still believe this,
or this is why what I said
was terrible and stupid.
- Yeah.
- And I'm sure that list
will get a lot longer.
- Yeah, look forward to
new additions to that.
- [Ben] Yeah, exactly.
- It actually is a super, super long list.

[16:15]
People should check it out.
And, it's quite honest and raw.
What do you think about,
it's interesting to ask you,
given how pro-life you are,
about Ye's comments,
about comparing the Holocaust
to the 900,000 abortions

[16:32]
in the United States a year.
- I'll take this from two angles.
As a pro-life person,
I actually didn't find it offensive
because if you believe as I do,
that unborn and pre-born
lives deserve protection,
then the slaughter of just
under a million of them

[16:47]
every year for the last almost 50 years,
is a historic tragedy
on par with a holocaust.
From the outside perspective,
I get why people would
say there's a difference
in how people view the
pre-born as to how people view,
say a seven year old, who's
being killed in the Holocaust.

[17:01]
The visceral power and evil of the Nazis
shoving full grown human beings
and small children into gas chambers,
can't be compared to a person who,
even from pro-life perspective,
may not fully understand the consequences
of their own decisions or
from a pro-choice perspective,

[17:16]
fully understands the consequences,
but just doesn't think that
that person is a person.
That that's actually different.
I understand both sides of it.
I wasn't offended by Ye's
comments in that way though,
because if you're a pro-life human being,
then you do think that what's happening

[17:30]
is a great tragedy on scale
that involves the dehumanization
of an entire class of
people, the pre-born.
- So the philosophical, you
understand the comparison?
- I do, sure.
- So in his comments,
in the jumping from the
individual to the group,

[17:46]
I'd like to ask you,
you're one of the most
effective people in the world
that attacking the left,
and sometimes it can slip
into attacking the group.
Do you worry that that's the same kind
of oversimplification that Ye's.

[18:00]
doing about Jewish people?
That you can sometimes do
with the left as a group?
- So when I speak about the left,
I'm speaking about a philosophy.
I'm not really speaking
about individual human beings
as the leftist group,
and then try to name
who the members of this

[18:16]
individual group are.
I also make a distinction
between the left and liberals.
There are a lot of people
who are liberal who disagree
with me on taxes, disagree
with me on foreign policy,
disagree with me on a lot of things.
The people who I'm
talking about generally,
and I talk about the left
in the United States;
are people who believe that
alternative points of view

[18:31]
ought to be silenced
because they are damaging and harmful
simply based on the disagreement.
So that's one distinction.
The second distinction,
again, is when I talk about
the right versus the left.
Typically, I'm talking about a battle
of competing philosophies.
And so, I'm not speaking about,

[18:45]
typically, it would be hard to,
if you put a person in
front of me and said,
"Is this person of the
left or of the right?"
Having just met them, I
wouldn't be able to label them
in the same way that if you met somebody
with the name of Greenstein,
you immediately got Jew.
Or you met a black person, black person.
And, the adherence to a philosophy

[19:02]
makes you a member of a group.
If I think the philosophy is bad,
that doesn't necessarily mean
that you as a person are bad,
but it does mean that I
think your philosophy is bad.
- Yeah, so the grouping
is based on the philosophy
versus something

[19:15]
like a race, like the color of your skin,
or race, in the case of the Jewish people.
So it's a different thing.
You, can be a little bit
more nonchalant and careless
in attacking a group
because it's ultimately
attacking a set of ideas.
- Well, I mean, it is really nonchalant

[19:31]
in attacking the set of ideas.
And, I don't know that
nonchalant would be the way
I'd put it.
I try to be exact.
When you don't always hit,
but you know, if I say that,
I oppose the communists,
And then, presumably I'm
speaking of people who believe

[19:45]
in the communists philosophy.
Now, the question is
whether I'm mislabeling.
Whether I'm taking somebody
who's not actually a communist
and then shoving them in
that group of communists.
That would be inaccurate.
- The dangerous thing is it
expands the group as opposed
to you talking about the philosophy.
You're throwing everybody who's ever said,

[20:01]
"I'm curious about communism,
I'm curious about socialism."
'Cause there's like a gradient,
it's like to throw something at you.
I think Joe Biden said,
"MAGA Republicans."
- Right.

[20:15]
I think that's a very careless statement
because the thing you jump
to immediately is like all-
- Vote for Trump.
- All Republicans, right.
- Right.
- Versus, I think,
in the charitable interpretation,
that means a set of ideas.
- Yeah, my actually problem

[20:30]
with the MAGA Republicans line
from Biden is that he went
on in the speech that he made
in front of Independence Hall
to actually trying and find what it meant
to be a MAGA Republican,
who was a threat to the republic,
was the kinda language that he was using.
And later on in the speech
he actually suggested, well,
there are moderate Republicans.

[20:45]
And, the moderate Republicans
are people who agree with me
on like the Inflation Reduction Act.
It's like, well that
can't be the dividing line
between a MAGA Republican and a moderate.
Like a moderate Republican
is somebody who agrees with you,
that you gotta name me,
like a republican who disagrees
with you fairly strenuously,

[21:00]
but is not in this group
of threats to the republic.
You make that distinction,
we can have a fair discussion
about whether the idea of election denial,
for example, makes somebody
a threat to institutions.
That's a conversation that we can have.
And then, we'll have to discuss
how much power they have,

[21:15]
what the actual perspective
is, delve into it.
But you know,
I think that he was being over
broad and sort of labeling
all of his political
enemies under one rubric.
Now again, in politics,
this stuff sort of happens all the time.
I'm not gonna plead clean hands here,
'cause I'm sure that I've been inexact.
But, what would be good

[21:31]
in that particular
situation is for somebody
to sort of read me back the quote,
and I'll let you know
where I've been inaccurate.
I'll try to do that.
- And also, you don't shy away from humor
and occasional trolling and mockery,
and all that kind of stuff
for the fun, for the chaos,
all that kind of stuff.
- I mean, I try not to to do
trollery for trollery sake,

[21:48]
but, if the show's not
entertaining and not fun,
people aren't gonna listen.
And so, if you can't
have fun with politics,
the truth about politics is
we all take it very seriously.
'Cause it has some serious ramifications.
Politics is Veep,
it is not House of Cards.

[22:00]
The general rule of politics
is that everyone is a moron
unless proven otherwise.
That virtually everything
is done out of stupidity
rather than malice.
And that, if you actually
watch politics as a comedy,
you'll have a lot more fun.
And so, the difficulty for me
is I take politics seriously,
but also I have the ability
to sort of flip the switch

[22:16]
and suddenly it all
becomes incredibly funny
because it really is.
If you just watch it from a
pure entertainment perspective
and you put aside the fact that it affects
hundreds of millions of people,
then watching President Trump,

[22:30]
I mean, he's one of the funniest humans
who's ever lived watching.
Watching Kamala Harris be Kamala Harris
and talking about how much
she loves Venn diagrams
or electric buses.
I mean, that's funny stuff.
So if I can't make fun of that,
then my job becomes pretty
morose pretty quickly.
- Yeah, it's funny to figure out

[22:45]
what is the perfect balance
between seeing the humor
and the absurdity of the game of it,
versus taking it seriously enough
because it does affect
hundreds of millions of people.
It's a weird balance to strike.
It's like, I am afraid with
the internet that everything

[23:01]
becomes a joke.
- I totally agree with this.
I will say this,
I try to make less jokes about the ideas
and more jokes about the
people in the same way
that I make jokes about myself.
I'm pretty self-effacing
in terms of my humor.
I would say at least half the
jokes on my show are about me.

[23:17]
When I'm reading ads Tommy John
and they're talking about
their no wedgie guarantee,
I'll say things like,
"That would help me in high
school, because it would've."
I mean, just factually speaking,
if I can speak that way about myself,
I feel like everybody
else can take it as well.

[23:31]
- Difficult question.
In 2017, there was a mosque
shooting in Quebec City.
Six people died, five
others seriously injured.
The 27 year old gunman consumed
a lot of content online
and checked Twitter
accounts of a lot of people.

[23:46]
But, one of the people he
checked quite a lot of is you,
93 times in the month
leading up to the shooting.
If you could talk to that young man,
what would you tell him and
maybe other young men listening
to this that have hate in
their heart in that same way,

[24:02]
What would you tell?
- "You're getting it wrong.
"If anything that I or anyone
else in mainstream politics
"Says drives you to violence,
you're getting it wrong.
"You're getting it wrong."
Now again, when it comes
to stuff like this,

[24:15]
I have a hard and fast rule
that I've applied evenly
across the spectrum.
And that is,
I never blame people's
politics for other people
committing acts of violence;
unless they're actively
advocating violence.
So when a fan of Bernie Sanders
shoots up a congressional
baseball game, that is not
Bernie Sanders's fault.

[24:30]
I may not like his rhetoric.
I may disagree with him on everything.
Bernie Sanders did not tell
somebody to go shoot up
a congressional baseball game.
When a nut case in San Francisco
goes and hits Paul Pelosi with a hammer.
I'm not gonna blame Kevin McCarthy,
the house speaker, for that.
When somebody threatens Brett Kavanaugh,

[24:45]
I'm not gonna suggest that
that was Joe Biden's fault
because it's not Joe Biden's fault.
We can play this game all day long.
And, I find that the people
who are most intensely focused
on playing this game are
people who tend to oppose
the politics of the person,
as opposed to actually believing sincerely

[25:01]
that this has driven
somebody into the arms
of the god of violence.
But, I have 4.7 million Twitter followers,
I have 8 million Facebook followers,
I have 5 million YouTube followers.
I would imagine that some of them

[25:15]
are people who are violent.
I would imagine that some of
them are people who do evil
things or want to do evil things.
And, I wish that there were
a wand that we could wave
that would prevent those
people from deliberately
or mistakenly misinterpreting
things as a call of violence.

[25:31]
It's just a negative byproduct of the fact
that you can reach a lot of people.
And so, if somebody could
point me to the comment
that I suppose quote unquote
drove somebody to going
literally murder human beings,
then I would appreciate it.

[25:45]
So I could talk about the comment.
But, I don't, mainly because I just think
that if we remove agency from individuals,
and if we blame broad
scale political rhetoric

[26:00]
for every act of violence,
we're not gonna...
The people who are gonna
pay the price are actually
the general population because
free speech will go away.
If the idea is that things that
we say could drive somebody,
who is unbalanced, to
go do something evil,
the necessary byproduct is hate.

[26:15]
Is that, speech is a form of hate.
Hate is a form of violence,
speech is a form of violence.
Speech needs to be curbed.
And that. to me is deeply disturbing.
- So definitely, that man,
that 27 year old man,

[26:30]
is the only one responsible
for the evil he did.
But, what if he and others
like him are not nut cases?
What if they're people with
pain, with anger in their heart?
What would you say to them?
You're exceptionally influential
and other people like you,

[26:48]
that speak passionately about ideas.
What do you think is your
opportunity to alleviate the hate
in their heart?
- If we're speaking about
people who aren't mentally ill
and people who are just misguided,

[27:00]
I'd say to him, the thing I
said to every other young man
in the country,
you need to find meaning and
purpose in forming connections
that actually matter,
in a belief system that actually
promotes general prosperity

[27:15]
and promotes helping other people.
And this is why,
the message that I most
commonly say to young men is,
it's time for you to grow
up, mature, get a job,
get married, have a family,
take care of the people around you,
become a useful part of your community.
I've never at any point in
my entire career suggested

[27:31]
violence as a resort to political issues.
The whole point of having
a political conversation
is that it's a conversation.
If I didn't think that it
were worth trying to convince
people of my point of view,
I wouldn't do what I do for a living.

[27:45]
- So violence doesn't solve anything?
- No, it doesn't.
- As if this wasn't already
a difficult conversation.
Let me ask about Ilhan Omar.
You've called out her criticism

[28:00]
of Israel policies as antisemitic.
Is there a difference between
criticizing a race of people,
like the Jews, and criticizing
the policies of a nation like Israel?
- Of course, of course.
I criticize the policies of Israel
on a fairly regular basis.

[28:15]
I would assume from a different
angle than Ilhan Omar does.
But yeah, I mean, I criticize the policies
of a wide variety of states.
And to take an example,
I've criticized Israel's
policy in giving control
of the Temple Mount to the Islamic Waqf;
which effectively prevents
anybody except for Muslims

[28:30]
from praying up there.
I've also criticized
the Israeli government
for their COVID crackdown.
They can criticize the
policies of any government,
but that's not what Ilhan Omar does.
Ilhan Omar doesn't actually believe
that there should be a state of Israel.
She believes that Zionism is racism
and that the existence of
a Jewish state in Israel,

[28:45]
is in and of itself the great sin.
That is a statement she would
make about no other people
in no other land.
She would not say that the
French don't deserve a state
for the French.
She wouldn't say that
Somalis wouldn't deserve
a state in Somalia.
She wouldn't say that that Germans
don't deserve a state in Germany.

[29:00]
She wouldn't say for the
50 plus Islamic states
that exist across the world,
that they don't deserve
states of their own.
It is only the Jewish state
that has fallen under
her significant scrutiny.
And she also promulgates
laws about one specific state
in the form of suggesting, for example,

[29:16]
that Israel is an apartheid state;
which it is most eminently
not considering that
the last unity government in
Israel included an Arab party.
That there are Arabs who sit
on the Israeli Supreme
Court and all the rest.
And then, beyond that,
obviously she's engaged
in some of the same sort
of antisemitic ropes that
you heard from Ye, right.
The stuff about,

[29:31]
it's all about the Benjamins,
that American support for Israel
is all about the Benjamins.
And, she's had to be chided
by members of her own party
about this sort of stuff before.
- Can you empathize with the
plight of Palestinian people?
- Absolutely.
Some of the uglier things that
I've ever said in my career

[29:45]
are things that I said very
early on, when I was 17, 18, 19.
I started writing a
syndicated comment, I was 17.
I'm now 38.
So virtually all the dumb things,
I'd not say virtually all,
many of the dumb things,
the plurality of the dumb
things that I've said came from
the ages of, I would say 17 to maybe 23.
- Yeah.
- And they are rooted,
again, in sloppy thinking.

[30:01]
I feel terrible for people
who have lived under the thumb
and currently live under
the thumb of Hamas;
which is a national terrorist group,
or the Palestinian authority;
which is a corrupt
oligarchy that steals money
from its people and leaves them in misery.

[30:15]
Or Islamic Jihad,
which is an actual terrorist group.
The basic rule for the region
in my view, is if these groups
were willing to make peace with Israel,
they would have a state
literally tomorrow.
And if they are not, then
there will be no peace.
And, it really is that simple.

[30:30]
If Israel, the formulas typically used,
it's become a bit of a bumper sticker,
but it happens to be factually correct.
If the Palestinians put
down their guns tomorrow,
there would be a state.
If the Israelis put down their guns,
there'd be no Israel.

[30:45]
- You get attacked a lot on the internet.
- Oh yeah, you noticed.
- I gotta ask you about
your own psychology.
How do you not let that
break you mentally?
And, how do you avoid letting
that lead to a resentment

[31:00]
of the groups that attack you?
- There are a few sort of practical things
that I've done.
For example, I would
say that four years ago,
Twitter was all consuming.
Twitter is an ego machine,
especially the
notifications button, right.
The notifications button is
just people talking about you
all the time.

[31:15]
And the normal human tendency as,
"Wow, people talking about me,
"I gotta see what
they're saying about me."
Which is a recipe for insanity.
So my wife actually said,
"Twitter is making your life miserable.
"You need to take it off your phone."
So Twitter is not on my phone.
If I wanna log onto Twitter,
I have to go onto my computer
and I have to make the conscious decision

[31:31]
to go onto Twitter and then take a look
at what's going on.
- I could just imagine you like,
there's a computer in the basement,
you dissent into the check Twitter.
- That's pretty much-
- In the darkness.
- If you look at, when I actually tweet,
it's generally in the run
up to recording my show
or when I'm prepping for my show,

[31:45]
later in the afternoon, for example.
- That doesn't affect
you negatively mentally?
Like puts you in a bad mental space?
- Not particularly if it's restricted,
to sort of what's being watched now.
I will say that I think
the most important thing
is you have to surround
yourself with a group of people

[32:00]
who you trust enough to make
serious critiques of you,
when you're doing something wrong.
But also, you know that they have
your best interests at heart.
'Cause the internet is filled with people
who don't have your
best interests at heart,
and who hate your guts.
And so, you can't really take
those critiques seriously
or it does wreck you.
And the world is also filled
with (indistinct), right.

[32:17]
The, the, the more successful you become,
there are a lot of
people who will tell you,
"You're always doing the right thing."
I'm very lucky.
I got married when I
was 24, my wife was 20,
so she's known me long before I was famous
or wealthy or anything.
And so, she's a good sounding board.

[32:30]
I have a family that's
willing to call me out
on my bullshit, as you talk Ye about.
I have friends who are able to do that.
I try to have open lines of communications
with people who I believe have
my best interest at heart.
But, one of the sort of
conditions of being friends,

[32:45]
is that when you see
me do something wrong,
I'd like for you to let me
know that, so I can correct it.
And, I don't wanna leave
bad impressions out.
- The sad thing about the internet,
just looking at the critiques you get,
I see very few critiques from
people that actually want you
to succeed, want you to grow.
I mean, they're very,
they're not sophisticated.

[33:01]
They're just, I don't know, they're cruel.
The critiques are just,
it's not actual critiques,
it's just cruelty.
- And, that's most of Twitter.
I mean, as I said, Twitter is a place
to smack and be smacked.

[33:15]
I mean, anybody who uses Twitter
for an intellectual conversation,
I think, is engaging in category error.
- I use it to spread love.
I think it's still possible.
- Yeah, you're the only one.
It's you, it's you and
no one else, my friend.
(hearty laughing)
- Right, well, on that topic,
what do you think about
Elon buying Twitter?

[33:30]
What do you like?
What do you hope for on that front?
What would you like to
see Twitter improve?
- So, I'm very hopeful
about Elon buying Twitter.
I think that Elon is
significantly more transparent,
than what has taken place up till now.

[33:46]
He seems committed to the
idea that he's gonna broaden
the Overton Window to
allow for conversations
that simply were banned before.
Everything ranging from efficacy of masks,
with regard to COVID,
to whether men can become
women, and all the rest.
A lot of things that would
get you banned on Twitter

[34:00]
before without any sort
of real explanation.
It seems like he's dedicated
to at least explaining
what the standards are going
to be and being broader
in allowing a variety of
perspectives on the outlet.
Which I think is wonderful.
I think that's also why
people are freaking out.
I think the kind of wailing,

[34:15]
and gnashing of teeth, and
wearing of sack cloth and ash
by so many members of the legacy media,
I think a lot of that is because Twitter
essentially was an oligarchy
in which certain perspectives were allowed
and certain perspectives just were not.
And, that was part of a
broader social media reimposed

[34:33]
oligarchy in the aftermath of 2017.
So in order for just to
really understand, I think,
what it means for Elon
to take over Twitter,
I think that we have to take
a look at sort of the history
of media in the United States
in two minutes or less.

[34:47]
The United States, the media,
for most of its existence,
up until about 1990,
at least from about 1930s until the 1990s,
virtually all media was three
major television networks,
a couple major newspapers
and the wire services.
Everybody had a local
newspaper with wire services,

[35:00]
that basically did all the foreign policy
and all the national policy.
McClatchy, Reuters, AP, AFP, et cetera.
That monopoly oligopoly existed
until the rise of the internet.
There were sort of pokes at
it; in talk radio and Fox News,
but there certainly was not
this plethora of sources.

[35:15]
Then, the internet explodes
and all of a sudden
you can get news everywhere.
And, the way that people
are accessing that news,
I believe, significantly
younger than I am.
But we used to do this
thing called bookmarking,
where you would bookmark
a series of websites,
and then you would visit
them every morning.

[35:30]
And then, social media came up.
- Was this on AOL or?
- Yeah, exactly.
You had the dial up,
it was actually a can
connected to a string
and you would actually, it would go.
(high pitched squeaking)
And, then there came a point
where social media arose.

[35:45]
And, social media was sort
of a boon for everybody
because you no longer
had to bookmark anything.
You just followed your favorite accounts,
and all of them would pop up,
and you followed everything on Facebook
and it would all pop up
and it was all centralized.
And, for a while everybody was super happy
because this was the brand
new wave of the future,
made everything super easy.
Suddenly, outlets like mine
were able to see new eyeballs

[36:02]
because it was all centralized
in one place, right.
You didn't have to do it
through Google optimization,
you could now just put it on Facebook,
and so many eyeballs were on Facebook,
you'd get more traffic.
And everybody seemed pretty
happy with this arrangement,
until precisely the moment
Donald Trump became president.
At that point then the sort
of preexisting supposition

[36:18]
of a lot of the powers that be;
which was Democrats are
gonna continue winning
from here on out.
So, we can sort of use
these social media platforms
as ways to push our information
and still allow for there
to be other information out there.

[36:31]
The immediate response
was, we need to reestablish
this siphoning of information.
It was misinformation and disinformation
that won Donald Trump the election.
We need to pressure the social
media companies to start
cracking down on misinformation
and disinformation.
And, actually see this
in the historical record.

[36:46]
You can see how Jack Dorsey's
talk about free speech shifted
from about 2015 to about 2018.
You can see Mark Zuckerberg
gave a speech at Georgetown
in 2018; which he talked about
free speech in its value.
And by 2019, he was going
in front of Congress
talking about how he was
responsible for the stuff
that was on Facebook; which is not true.

[37:01]
He's not responsible for
the stuff on Facebook.
It's a platform.
Is AT&T responsible for the
stuff you say on your phone?
The answer is typically no.
So when that happened, all of these,
because all the eyeballs
had now be centralized
in these social media sites,
they were able to suddenly control

[37:15]
what you could see and
what you could not see.
And the most obvious example
was obviously leading up to 2020,
the election, the killing
of the Hunter Biden story,
is a great example of this.
And so, Elon coming in and taking over one
of the social media services and saying,
"I'm not playing by your rules."

[37:30]
There's not gonna be this
sort of group of people
in the halls of power who are gonna decide
what we can see and hear.
Instead, I'm gonna let
1,000 flowers bloom.
There'll be limits,
but it's gonna be on a
more case by case basis.
We're going to allow
perspectives that are mainstream,

[37:46]
but maybe not mainstream
in the halls of academia
or in the halls of media,
let those be said.
I think that's a really good thing.
Now, that comes with,
some responsibilities
on Elon's personal part;
which would be, for example,

[38:01]
I think more responsible and
dissemination of information
himself sometimes, right.
He got himself in trouble the
other day for tweeting out
that that story about Paul Pelosi,
that that was speculative and and untrue.
And, I don't think what
he did is horrific,
he deleted it when he found
out that it was false.

[38:16]
And, that's actually a
free speech working, right.
He said something wrong,
people ripped into him.
He realized he was
wrong and he deleted it;
which seems to me a better solution
than preemptively banning content,
which only raises more questions
than than it actually stops.
With that said, as the face
of responsible free speech,

[38:33]
and that's sort of what
he's pitching at Twitter.
He, I think, should enact that himself
and be a little more careful in the stuff
that he tweets out.
- Well, that's a tricky balance.
The reason a lot of people are
freaking out is because one,
he's putting his thumb on the scale

[38:46]
by saying he is more
likely to vote Republican.
He's showing himself to be center, right.
And sort of just having
a political opinion
versus being this amorphous thing
that doesn't have a political opinion.
I think, if I were to guess,

[39:00]
I haven't talked to him about it,
but if I were to guess, he's
sending a kind of signal
that's important for
Twitter, the company itself.
Because if we're being honest,
most of the employees are left-leaning.
So you have to kind of send a signal that,
like a resisting mechanism to say,

[39:15]
since most of the employees are left,
it's good for Elon to be more right
to balance out the way the
actual engineering is done.
To say, we're not going
to do any kind of activism
inside the engineering.
If I were to guess, that's
kind of the effective aspect

[39:32]
of that mechanism.
And, the other one, by
posting the Pelosi thing
is probably to expand the Overton Window.
Saying we can play,
we could post stuff,
we could post conspiracy theories,

[39:45]
and then through discourse,
figure out what is and isn't true.
- Yeah, again, like I say,
I mean I think that is a better mechanism
in action than what it was before.
I just think it gave people
who hate his guts the opening
to kind of slap him for no reason.
But, I can see the
strategy of it for sure.

[40:01]
And, I think that the general idea
that he's kind of pushing,
right where the company
had pushed left before.
I think that there is actually
unilateral polarization
right now in politics,
at least with the regard of social media.
In which one side basically says,

[40:16]
"The solution to disinformation
is to shut down free speech
"From the other side."
And the other side is basically like,
people like me are saying,
the solution to disinformation
is to let a thousand,
I'd rather have people on
the left also being able to

[40:30]
put out stuff that I disagree
with than for there to be
anybody who's sort of in
charge of these social media
platforms and using
them as editorial sites.
There are plenty,
I'm not criticizing MSNBC
for not putting on right wing opinions.
I mean, that's fine.
I run a conservative site.
We're not gonna put up left
wing opinions on a wide variety

[40:46]
of issues 'cause we are
a conservative site.
But, if you pitch yourself as a platform,
that's a different thing.
If you pitch yourself as the town square,
as Elon likes to call it,
then I think Elon has
a better idea of that
than many of the former employees did.
Especially, now that we have
that report from The Intercept

[41:01]
suggesting that there
are people from Twitter
working with DHS
to monitor disinformation,
and being rather vague about
what disinformation meant.
- Yeah, I don't think activism has a place
in what is fundamentally
an engineering company
that's building a platform.

[41:17]
The people inside the company
should not be putting a thumb on the scale
of what is and isn't allowed.
You should create a
mechanism for the people
to decide what is and isn't allowed.
Do you think Trump should have
been removed from Twitter?

[41:31]
Should his account be restored?
- His account should be restored.
And, this is coming from somebody
who really dislikes an enormous number
of Donald Trump's tweets.
Again, he's a very important
political personage.
Even if he weren't,

[41:45]
I don't think that he should
be banned from Twitter
or Facebook in coordinated fashion.
By the way, I hold that
opinion about people
who I think are far
worse than Donald Trump.
Everyone knows I'm not an Alex Jones guy.
I don't like Alex Jones.
I think Alex Jones-
- You think Alex should
be back on Twitter?

[42:01]
- I do actually,
because I think that
there are plenty of people
who are willing to say that
what he's saying is wrong.
And, I'm not a big fan of this idea
that because people I disagree with,
and people who have
personally targeted me.
By the way,

[42:15]
I mean Alex Jones has said
some things about me personally
that I'm not real fond of it.
- You guys are not?
- Well, we're not besties.
No, it turns out, yeah.
All I've said is I don't
really enjoy his show.
He's said some other stuff
about the antichrist and such;
but that's a bit of a
different thing I suppose.

[42:30]
Even so...
- Yeah.
- I'm just not a big fan of this idea.
I've defended people who
have really gone after me
on a personal level, have targeted me.
The town square is online,
banning people from the town
square is unpersoning them.

[42:46]
Unless you violated a criminal statute,
you should not be unpersoned
in American society,
as a general rule.
That doesn't mean that
companies that are not platforms
don't have the ability to respond to you.
I think Adidas is right
to terminate its contract
with Kanye, for example,

[43:02]
or with Ye.
But, Twitter ain't Adidas.
- So the way your stance on free speech
to the degree it's possible
to achieve on a platform,
like Twitter is you fight
bad speech with more speech,

[43:19]
with better speech.
So, if Alex Jones and
Trump was allowed back on,
in the coming months and years

[43:30]
leading up to the 2024 election,
you think that's gonna
make for a better world
in the long term?
- I think that on the principle
that people should be allowed to do this,
and the alternative being
a group of thought bosses
telling us what we can
and cannot see, yes.
Do I think in the short term
it's gonna mean a lot of things

[43:45]
that I don't like very much?
Sure, them's the class of doing business.
I think that one of the class of freedom
is people doing things that
I don't particularly like.
And, I would prefer the freedom
with all the stuff I don't
like, than not the freedom.

[44:01]
- Let me linger on the love a little bit.
You and a lot of people are
pretty snarky on Twitter;
sometimes to the point
of mockery, derision,
even a bit of,
if I were to say bad faith
in the kind of mockery,

[44:17]
and you see it as a war,
like I disagree with both
you and Elon on this.
Elon sees Twitter as a war zone,
or at least has saw it
that way in the past.
Have you ever considered
being nicer on Twitter?
(hearty laughing)

[44:30]
As a voice that a lot
of people look up to,
that if Ben Shapiro becomes
a little bit more about love
that's gonna inspire a lot of people
or no, is it just too fun for you?
- The answer is yes.
Sure, it's occurred to me.
Let's put it this way,

[44:45]
there are a lot of tweets
that actually don't go out
that I delete.
I'll say that Twitter.
Twitter's new function, that 32nd function
is a friend of mine.
Every so often,
I'll tweet something and
I'll think about it a second.
I'll be like,
"Do I need to say this?"
Probably not.
- Can you make a book published

[45:01]
after you pass away of all the
tweets that you didn't send?
- Oh no, my kids are
still gonna be around it.
I hope, so that's the legacy.
But yeah, I mean, sure, the answer is yes.
And there's a good piece
of what we would call
in Orthodox Judaism, Mussar.

[45:16]
This is like,
he is giving a Mussar schmooze, right now.
This is like the kind of,
be a better person stuff.
I agree with you.
I agree with you, and yeah.
I will say that Twitter
is sometimes too much fun.
I try to be at least,

[45:30]
if not even-handed,
then equal opportunity in my derision.
I remember that during the 2016 primaries,
I used to post rather snarky tweets
about virtually all of the candidates,
Republican and Democrat.
And, every so often I'll
still do some of that.

[45:47]
I do think actually the amount
of snark on my Twitter feed
has gone down fairly significantly.
I think if you go back a couple of years,
it was probably a little more snarky.
Today, I'm trying to
use it a little bit more
in terms of strategy
to get out information.
Now, that doesn't mean I'm
not gonna make jokes about,

[46:00]
for example, Joe Biden.
I will make jokes about Joe Biden.
He's the president of the United States.
Nobody else will mock him.
So, the entire comedic
establishment has decided
they actually work for him.
- So the president of the United States,
no matter who they are, get the snark.

[46:16]
- Yes, yes.
And, President Trump,
I think is fairly aware
that he got the snark from me as well.
When it comes to snarking the president,
I'm not gonna stop that.
I think the president
deserves to be snarked.
- So you're not afraid of attacking Trump?
- No, I mean, I've done it before.

[46:30]
- Can you say what your favorite
and least favorite things
are about President Trump
and President Biden, one at a time?
So maybe one thing that you
can say is super positive
about Trump, and one thing
super negative about Trump.
- Okay, so the super
positive thing about Trump

[46:46]
is that because he has
no preconceived views
that are establishmentarian,
he's sometimes willing to go
outta the box and do things
that haven't been tried before.
And, sometimes that works.
The best example being
the entire foreign policy
establishment telling
him that he couldn't get

[47:00]
a Middle Eastern deal done
unless he centered the
Palestinian Israeli conflict.
And instead he just
went right around that,
and ended up cutting
a bunch of peace deals
in the Middle East
or moving the embassy in Jerusalem.
Sometimes he does stuff and
it's really outta the box,
and it actually works.
And, that's kind of awesome
in politics, and neat to see.

[47:16]
The downside of Trump is
that he has no capacity
to use any sort of...
There's no filter between brain and mouth.
Well, whatever happens in his brain,
is the thing that comes out of his mouth.
I know a lot of people find
that charming and wonderful,

[47:30]
and from time, and it is very funny.
But, I don't think that
it is a particularly
excellent personal quality in a person
who has as much responsibility,
as President Trump has.
I think he says a lot of damaging,
and bad things on Twitter.
I think that he seems,

[47:46]
consumed, in some ways,
by his own grievances;
which is why you've seen him focusing
in on election 2020 so much.
And, I think that that is very negative
about President Trump.
I'm very grateful to president
Trump, as a conservative,
for many of the things that he did.
I think that a lot of
his personality issues

[48:00]
are pretty severe.
- What about Joe Biden?
- I think that the thing that
I like most about Joe Biden.
- Yes.
- I will say,
that Biden, two things.
One, Biden seems to be a very good father

[48:18]
by all available evidence, right.
There are a lot of people who are put out,
kind of tape of him talking to Hunter;
and Hunter's having trouble
with drugs or whatever.
And, I keep listening to
that tape and thinking,
he seems like a really good dad.

[48:30]
The stuff that he's saying to his son
is stuff that God forbid,
if that were happening with my kid,
I'd be saying to my kid.
And so, you can't help
but feel for the guy.
He's had an incredibly difficult go of it
with his first wife
and the death of members of his family,
and then Beau dying.

[48:45]
I mean, that kind of stuff,
obviously is deeply sympathetic in his...
He seems like a deeply sympathetic father.
As far as his politics,
he seems like a slap on
the back, kind of guy.
And I don't mind that.
I think that's nice, so far as it goes.
It's sort of an old school politics,

[49:01]
where things are done
with handshake and personal relationships.
The thing I don't like about him
is I think sometimes
that's really not genuine.
I think that that sometimes,
I think that's his personal tendency,
but I think sometimes he
allows the prevailing wins
of his party to carry him to
incredibly radical places.

[49:17]
And then, he just doubles
down on the radicalism
in some pretty disingenuous ways.
And, there I would cite
the Independence Hall speech;
which I thought was truly
one of the worst speeches
I've seen a president give.

[49:30]
- So, you don't think he's trying to be
a unifier in general?
- Not at all.
I mean, that's what he was elected to do.
He was elected to do two things,
not be alive, and be a unifier.
Those were the two things.
And like, and when I say not be alive,
I don't mean like physically dead,
this is where the snark comes in.
But, what I do mean is that

[49:46]
he was elected to not be
particularly activist.
Basically, the mandate was don't be Trump.
Be sane, don't be Trump,
calm everything down.
And instead he got in, he is like,
"What if we spend 7 trillion dollars?
"What if we pull out of Afghanistan
"Without any sort of plan?

[50:00]
"What if I start labeling
all of my political enemies,
"Enemies of the republic?
"What if I start bringing Dylan
Mulvaney to the White House
"And talking about how it is a moral sin
"To prevent the general
mutilation of minors?"
This kinda stuff is very radical stuff.

[50:15]
And, this is not a
president who has pursued
a unifying agenda;
which is why his approval
rating sank from 60%
when he entered office, to
low 40s or high 30s today.
Unlike President Trump,
who never had a high approval rating.
Trump came into office,
and he had like a 45% approval rating,
and when he left office,
he had about a 43% approval rating.

[50:31]
It bounced around between 45 and 37
pretty much his entire presidency.
Biden went from being a
very popular guy coming in,
to a very unpopular guy right now.
And, if you're Joe Biden,
you should be looking in the mirror
and wondering exactly why.
- Do you think that pulling
out from Afghanistan
could be flipped as a pro for Biden,

[50:45]
in terms of he actually did it.
- I think it's gonna be almost impossible.
I think the American people
are incredibly inconsistent
about their own views on foreign policy.
In other words,
we like to be isolationist
until it comes time for us
to be defeated and humiliated.
When that happens, we tend
not to like it very much.

[51:03]
- You mentioned Biden being a good father.
Can you make the case for and against
the Hunter Biden laptop story?
For it being a big deal
and against it being a big deal?

[51:15]
- Sure, the case for being a
big deal is basically twofold.
One, is that it is clearly relevant
if the president's son is running around
to foreign countries
picking up bags of cash
because his last name is Biden,
while his father is vice
president of the United States.

[51:31]
And, it raises questions
as to influence peddling
for either the vice president
or the former vice president
using political connections.
Did he make any money?
Who was the big guy?
All these open questions,
that obviously implicates
the questions to be asked.
And then, the secondary
reason that the story is big

[51:46]
is actually 'cause the
reaction of the story,
the banning of the story is in
and of itself a major story.
If there's any story
that implicates a presidential candidate
in the last month of an election,
and there is a media blackout,
including a social media blackout,
that obviously raises some
very serious questions

[52:01]
about informational flow and dissemination
in the United States.
- No matter how big of
a deal the story is,
it is a big deal that there's a censorship
of any relevant story.
- When there's a coordinated
collusive blackout, yeah.
That's a serious and major problem.
So those are the two reasons
why it would be a big story.

[52:16]
The two reasons,
a reason why it would not
be a big story perhaps,
is if it turns out, and we
don't really know this yet.
But let's say that Hunter Biden
was basically off on his own
doing what he was doing,
being a derelict or drug
addict or acting badly,

[52:33]
and his dad had nothing to do with it,
and Joe was telling the
truth and he really knew.
But, the problem is
we never actually got
those questions answered.
If it had turned out to
be nothing of a story,
the nice thing about stories
that turn out to be nothing
is that after they turned out
to be nothing, they're nothing.
The biggest problem with this story

[52:46]
is that it wasn't allowed
to take the normal life cycle of a story;
which is original story breaks,
follow on questions are asked,
follow on questions are answered.
Story is either now a big
story or it's nothing.
One, when the life cycle
of a story is cut off

[53:00]
right at the very beginning,
right when it's born,
then that allows you to speculate
in any direction you want.
You can speculate, "It means nothing.
"It's it's nonsense.
"It's Russian, it's a Russian laptop,
"It's disinformation."
Or on the other hand,
this means that Joe Biden
was personally calling Hunter
and telling him to pick up a sack of cash

[53:15]
over in Beijing and
then he became president
and he's influenced pedaling.
This is why it's important
to allow these stories
to go forward.
So this is why actually the bigger story
for the moment is not the laptop,
it's the reaction to the laptop
'cause it cut off that
life cycle of the story.
And then, at some point

[53:30]
I would assume that there will
be some follow on questions
that are actually answered.
The house is pledging,
if it goes Republican,
to investigate all of this.
Again, I wouldn't be supremely surprised
if it turns out
that there was no direct
involvement of Joe
in this sort of stuff.
Because it turns out, as I said before,

[53:45]
that all of politics is Veep.
And, this is always the
story with half the scandals
that you see is that everybody assumes
that there's some sort of
deep and abiding clever plan
that some politician is implementing.
And then, you look at it and it turns out,
now it's just something dumb, right.
This is sort of, perfect example of this,

[54:01]
President Trump with the
classified documents in Mar Lago.
So people on the left lane,
it's probably nuclear codes,
probably he's taking secret documents
and selling them to the
Russians or the Chinese.
And, the real most obvious explanation
is Trump looked at the papers and he said,
"I like these papers."
And then, he just decided to keep them.

[54:16]
And then, people came to him and said,
"Mr. President, you're not
allowed to keep those papers."
He said, "Who are those people?
"I don't care about what they have to say,
"I'm putting them in the
other room in a box."
It is highly likely that
that is what happened.
And it's very disappointing
to people, I think,
when they realize it.

[54:31]
The human brain, I mean,
you know this better than I do,
but the human brain is
built to find patterns.
It's what we like to do.
We like to find plans and patterns
because this is how we
survived in the wild,
is you found a plan,
you found a pattern, you crack
the code of the universe.
When it comes to politics,
the conspiracy theories
that we see so often,

[54:45]
it's largely because we're
seeing inexplicable events.
Unless, you just assume
everyone's a moron.
If you assume that there's
a lot of stupidity going on,
everything becomes quickly explicable.
If you assume that there must
be some rationale behind it.
You have to come up with
increasingly convoluted conspiracy
theories to explain just why
people are acting the way

[55:00]
that they're acting.
And, I find that,
I don't say a 100% of the time, but 90,
94% of the time,
the conspiracy theory turns out
just to be people being dumb
and then other people
reacting in dumb ways
to the original people being dumb.

[55:15]
- But it's also, to me, in
that same way, very possible,
very likely that Hunter Biden
getting money in Ukraine,
I guess for consulting
and all that kind of stuff
is a nothing burger.
He's qualified, he's
getting money as he should.

[55:30]
There's a lot of influence
pedaling in general
that's not corrupt.
- The most obvious
explanation there probably is
that he was fake influence pedaling;
meaning he went to Ukraine.
And he is like, "Guess what?
"My dad's Joe."
And they're like,
"Well, you don't have
any qualifications in oil

[55:45]
"And natural gas and you don't
really have a great resume
"But your dad is Joe.
And then, that was kinda the end of it.
They gave him a bag of cash,
hoping you would do something.
He never did anything.
- I think you're making
it sound worse than it is.
I think this in general,
consulting is done in that way.
Your name, it's not like you're-
- I agree with you.
- You're not,
it's not like he is some rare case

[56:01]
and this is an illustration of corruption.
If you can criticize consulting,
which I would.
- [Ben] That's fair.
- Which they're basically not providing...
You look at a resume and who's who.
If you went to Harvard,
I can criticize the same thing.

[56:15]
If you have Harvard on your resume,
you're more likely to be
hired as a consultant.
Maybe there's a network
there of people that you know
and you hire them in that same way.
If your last name is Biden,
there's a lot of last names
that sound pretty good at it.
- That's for sure.
For sure, for sure.

[56:30]
- It's not like-
- And, Hunter Biden admitted
that much, by the way.
In an open interview.
He was like,
"If your last name weren't Biden,
"Would you have got that job?"
And he is like, "Probably not."
And you're right.
- That's an honest, that's-
- I agree with you.
- It's not like he's getting
a ridiculous amount of money.
He was getting like a
pretty standard consulting
kind of money;

[56:45]
which I also would criticize
'cause they get a
ridiculous amount of money.
But, even to push back on the life cycle
or to steel man the
side that was concerned
about the Hunter Biden laptop story.
I don't know if there is a
natural life cycle of a story

[57:01]
because there's something about
the virality of the internet
that we can't predict that
a story can just take hold
and the conspiracy around it builds.
Especially around politics,
where the interpretation,

[57:15]
some popular sexy
interpretation of a story
that might not be connected
to reality at all,
will become viral.
And that, from Facebook's perspective,
is probably what they're worried about,
is organized misinformation campaign
that makes up a sexy story
or sexy interpretation

[57:33]
of the vague story that we have.
And that, has an
influence on the populace.
- I mean, I think that's true,
but I think the question becomes
who's the great adjudicator there.
Who adjudicates when the
story ought to be allowed

[57:45]
to go through even a bad life cycle
or allowed to go viral as opposed to not?
Now, that's one thing if you wanna say,
"Okay, we can spot the Russian accounts
"That are actually promoting this stuff,
"They belong to the Russian government.
"Gotta shut that down."
I think everybody agrees.
This is actually one of the slides
that's happened linguistically
that I really object to,

[58:00]
is the slide between
disinformation and misinformation.
You notice there was this evolution.
In 2017, there was a lot of
talk about disinformation.
It was Russian disinformation.
The Russians were putting out
deliberately false information
in order to skew election
results, was the accusation.
And then, people started
using disinformation or misinformation.

[58:16]
And misinformation is
either mistaken information
or information that is quote
unquote out of context.
That becomes very subjective very quickly
as to what out of context means.
And it doesn't necessarily have
to be from a foreign source,
it can be from a domestic source, right.
It could be somebody
misinterpreting something here.
It could be somebody
interpreting something correctly,

[58:31]
but PolitiFact thinks
that it's out of context.
That sort of stuff gets
very murky very quickly.
And so, I'm deeply
uncomfortable with the idea
that Facebook, I mean Zuckerberg
was on with Rogan and talking about
how the FBI had basically set lookout

[58:45]
for Russian interference in the election,
and then all of these
people were out there saying
that the laptop was
Russian disinformation.
So, he basically shut it down.
That sort of stuff is frightening,
especially 'cause it wasn't
Russian disinformation.
I mean the laptop was real.
And so, the fact that you
have people who seemed to,

[59:02]
let's put it this way,
it seems as though, maybe this is wrong.
It seems as though when
a story gets killed,
preemptively like this,
it is almost universally
a story that negatively
affects one side of the political aisle.
I can't remember the last
time there was a story

[59:15]
on the right that was
disinformation or misinformation,
where social media
stepped in and they went,
"We cannot have this,
"This cannot be be distributed.
"We're going to all collude so that this,
"Information is not distributed."
Maybe in response to the
story being proved false,
it gets taken down.
But, what made the Hunter
Biden thing so amazing

[59:30]
is that it wasn't even
a response to anything.
It was, the story got posted,
there were no actual doubts
expressed as to the verified
falsity the story.
It was just supposition
that it had to be false
and everybody jumped in.
So I think that confirmed a
lot of the conspiracy theories
people had about social
media and how it works.

[59:46]
- Yeah, if the reason you want
to slow down the viral spread
of a thing is at all
grounded in partisanship,
that's a problem.
You should be very honest with yourself
and ask yourself that question.

[1:00:00]
Is it because I'm on the
left or on the right,
that I want to slow this down?
Versus is it hate,
bipartisan hate speech?
It's really tricky.
But, like you, I'm very
uncomfortable in general,

[1:00:16]
with any kind of slowing down,
with any kind of censorship.
But, if there's something
like a conspiracy theory
that spreads hate, that becomes viral,
I still lean to let that
conspiracy theory spread

[1:00:30]
'cause the alternative is
dangerous, more dangerous.
- It's sort like the ring of power.
Everybody wants the ring.
'Cause with the ring you
can stop the bad guys
from going forward.
But, it turns out that the
ring gives you enormous power
and that power can be used
in the wrong ways too.
- You had The Daily Wire;

[1:00:46]
which I'm a member of.
(hearty laughing)
- I appreciate that, thank you.
- I recommend everybody sign up to it,
it should be part of your regular diet;
whether you're on the left and the right,
the far left or the far right,
everybody, should be part
of your regular diet.
Okay, that said,

[1:01:01]
do you worry about the
audience capture aspect of it
because it is a platform for conservatives
and you have a powerful voice on there.
It might be difficult
for you to go against

[1:01:16]
the talking points or
against the stream of ideas
that is usually connected
to conservative thought.
Do you worry about that?
- Well, I mean,
the audience would
obviously be upset with me
and would have a right to be upset with me
if I suddenly flipped all
of my positions on a dime.

[1:01:31]
I have enough faith in my
audience that I can say things
that I think are true
and that may disagree
with the audience on a fairly
regular basis, I would say.
But they understand that
on the deeper principle
or on the same side,
or at least I hope that
much from the audience.

[1:01:45]
It's also why we provide a
number of different views
on the platforms, many
of which I disagree with,
but are sort of within
the generalized range
of conservative thought.
It's something I do have to
think about every day though.
Yeah, I mean you have to,
you have to think about ,
"Am I saying this because I'm afraid

[1:02:00]
"Of ticking off my audience
"Or am I saying this because
I actually believe this?"
And you know, that's a
delicate dance a little bit.
You have to be sort of
honest with yourself.
- Yeah, somebody like Sam
Harris is pretty good at this,
at fighting, at saying

[1:02:16]
the most outrageous thing that he knows.
He almost leans into it,
he knows will piss off
a lot of his audience.
Sometimes you almost
have to test the system.
It's like if you feel,
you almost exaggerate your
feelings just to make sure

[1:02:32]
to send a signal to the audience
that you're not captured by them.
So speaking of people you disagree with,
what is your favorite
thing about Candace Owens,
and what is one thing
you disagree with her on?

[1:02:46]
- Well, my favorite thing about Candace
is that she will say things
that nobody else will say.
My least favorite thing about Candace
is that she will say things
that nobody else will say.
(hearty laughing)
I mean, listen,
she says things that are audacious
and I think need to be said sometimes.
Sometimes, I think that
she is morally wrong,

[1:03:02]
I think the way she responded to Kanye,
I've said this clearly, was
dead wrong and morally wrong.
- What was her response?
- Her original response was
that she proffered confusion
of what Ye was actually talking about.
And then, she was defending her friend.

[1:03:17]
I wish that the way that she
had responded was by saying,
"He's my friend.
"And also he said something
bad and antisemitic."
I wish that she had said that.
- [Lex] Right away.
- Right away.
- Yeah, I think you can also,

[1:03:30]
this is the interesting human thing.
You can be friends with
people that you disagree with
and you can be friends with people
that actually say hateful stuff.
And, one of the ways
to help alleviate hate
is being friends with people
that say hateful things.
- Yeah, and then calling
them out on a personal level,

[1:03:47]
when they do say wrong or hateful things.
- Yeah, from a place of love
and respect and privately.
- Privately is also a big thing, right?
I mean, the public
demand for denunciation,
from friends to friends, is difficult.

[1:04:02]
And, I certainly have
compassion for Candace,
given the fact that
she's so close with Ye.
- Yeah, it breaks my heart sometimes,
the public fights between
friends and broken friendships.
I've seen quite a few friendships
publicly break over COVID.

[1:04:17]
COVID made people behave
their worst, in many cases.
Which yeah, breaks my heart a little bit.
'Cause like the human connection
is a prerequisite for effective debate

[1:04:32]
and discussion and battles over ideas.
Has there been any argument
from the opposite political
isle that has made you change
your mind about something?
If you look back.

[1:04:45]
- So I will say that,
I'm thinking it through
because I think that my views
probably on foreign policy,
morphed somewhat.
I would say that I was
much more interventionist
when I was younger.
I'm significantly less
interventionist now.

[1:05:01]
I'd probably-
- Can you give an example?
- Sure I was a big backer of the Iraq War.
I think now, in retrospect,
I might not be a backer of the Iraq War,
if the same situation arose again,
based on the amount of evidence
that had been presented
or based on the sort of
willingness of the American public

[1:05:17]
to go it, right.
If you're gonna get involved in a war,
you have to know what
the end point looks like,
and you have to know what the
American people really are
willing to bear.
The American people are not willing
to bear open-ended occupations.
And so knowing that, you have
to consider that going in.

[1:05:32]
So, on foreign policy,
I've become a lot more of,
I'd say almost Henry Kissinger realist
in some ways.
When it comes to social policy,
I would say that, I'm fairly strong

[1:05:46]
where I was.
I may have become slightly convinced
actually by more of the conservative side
of the isle and things
like drug legalization.
I think when I was younger,
I was much more pro-drug
legalization then I am now,
at least on the local level.
On a federal level,
I think the federal government
can't really do much,

[1:06:01]
other than close the borders
with regard to fentanyl
trafficking, for example.
But, when it comes to how drugs
were in local communities,
you can see
how drugs were in local
communities pretty easily.
- Which is weird because
I saw you smoke a joint
right before this conversation.
- It's my biggest thing.
I mean, I try to keep that secret.

[1:06:16]
- Well that's interesting
about intervention.
Can you comment about the war in Ukraine?
So for me, it's a deeply personal thing,
but I think you're able to look at it
from a geopolitics perspective.
What is the role of the
United States in this conflict

[1:06:31]
before the conflict,
during the conflict,
and right now, in helping achieve peace?
- I think before the conflict,
the big problem is that the West took
almost the worst possible view;
which was encourage Ukraine
to keep trying to join NATO

[1:06:47]
and the EU, but don't let them in.
And so, what that does is
it achieves the purpose
of getting Russia really,
really, really ticked off
and feeling threatened.
But also, does not give any
of the protections of NATO
or the EU to Ukraine.
Zelensky is on film when
he was a comedy actor

[1:07:02]
making that exact joke.
He has Merkel on the
other line and she's like,
"Oh welcome to NATO."
And he's like, "Great."
And she's like,
"Wait, is this Ukraine on the line?
"And, oops."
But so, that sort of policy
is sort of nonsensical.

[1:07:15]
If you're gonna offer
alliance to somebody,
offer alliance to them.
And if you're going to
guarantee their security,
guarantee their security.
And, the West failed signally to do that.
So, that was mistakes in
the run up to the war.
Once the war began,
then the responsibility of the
West became to give Ukraine

[1:07:32]
as much material as is
necessary to repel the invasion.
And, the West did really well with that.
I think we were late on the
ball in the United States.
It seemed like Europe led
the way a little bit more
than the United States did there.
But, in terms of effectuating
American interests

[1:07:47]
in the region;
which being an American,
is what I'm chiefly concerned about.
The American interests were several fold.
One is preserve borders.
Two is degrade the Russian
aggressive military
because Russia's military
has been aggressive,

[1:08:01]
and they are geopolitical
rival of the United States.
Three, recalibrate the
European balance with China.
Europe was sort of balancing
with Russia and China.
And then, because of the war
they sort of rebalanced away
from China and Russia;
which is a real geostrategic opportunity

[1:08:15]
for the United States.
It seemed like most of those goals
have already been achieved at this point
for the United States.
And so then, the question
becomes, what's the off ramp here,
and what is the thing
you're trying to prevent?
So what's the best opportunity?
What's the best case scenario?
What's the worst case scenario?
And then, what's realistic?
So best case scenario is Ukraine
forces Russia entirely out

[1:08:33]
of Ukraine; including Luhansk,
Donetsk, and Crimea, right.
That's the best case scenario.
Virtually no one thinks
that's accomplishable;
including the United States.
The White House has
basically said as much.
It's difficult to imagine,
particularly Crimea,
the Russians being forced out of Crimea.

[1:08:46]
The Ukrainians have been
successful in pushing the Russians
out of certain parts
of Luhansk and Donetsk.
But, the idea they're
gonna be able to push
the entire Russian army
completely back to the Russian borders.
That would be at best a very,
very long and difficult slog,
in the middle of a
collapsing Ukrainian economy.

[1:09:01]
Which is a point that Zelensky has made.
It's not enough for you guys
to give us military aid.
We're in the middle of a war,
we're gonna need economic aid as well.
So it's a pretty open-ended
and strong commitment.
- Can I take a small tangent on that?
- [Ben] Sure.
- And best case scenario?
If that does militarily
happen, including Crimea,

[1:09:16]
do you think there's a world
in which Vladimir Putin,
would be able to convince
the Russian people
that this was a good
conclusion to the war?
- Right, the problem is
that the best case scenario,
might also be the worst case scenario.

[1:09:30]
Meaning that there are
a couple of scenarios
that are sort of the worst case scenario.
And this, is sort of the
puzzlement of the situation.
One, is that Putin feels so boxed in,
so unable to go back to
his own people and say,
"We just wasted tens of
thousands of lives here
"For no reason."
That he unleashes a
tactical nuclear weapon

[1:09:46]
on the battlefield.
Nobody knows what happens after that.
So we put NATO planes in the
air to take out Russian assets.
Do Russians start shooting down planes?
Does Russia then threaten
to escalate even further
by attacking an actual
NATO civilian center,
or even a Ukrainian civilian
center with nuclear weapons?

[1:10:01]
Like where it goes from
there, nobody knows.
'Cause nuclear weapons
haven't been used since 1945.
So, that is a worst case scenario.
It's an unpredictable
scenario that could devolve
into really, really significant problems.
The other worst case scenario,
could be a best case scenario,
it could be a worse,

[1:10:15]
we just don't know is Putin falls.
What happens after that?
Who takes over for Putin?
Is that person more moderate than Putin?
Is that person a liberalizer?
It probably won't (indistinct),
if he's gonna be ousted.
It'll probably somebody who's
a top member of Putin's brass

[1:10:30]
right now, and has capacity
to control the military.
Or it's possible the
entire regime breaks down,
and what you end up
with is Syria in Russia.
Where you just have an
entirely out of control region
with no centralizing power;
which is also a disaster area.
And so, in the nature of risk mitigation,

[1:10:47]
in sort of an attempt at risk mitigation,
what actually should be happening
right now is some off ramp
has to be offered to Putin.
The off ramp likely is going
to be him maintaining Crimea
and parts of Luhansk and Donetsk.
It's probably gonna be
a commitment by Ukraine,

[1:11:01]
not to join NATO formally,
but a guarantee by the
West to defend Ukraine
in case of an invasion of its
borders, again, by Russia.
Like an actual treaty
obligation, not like,
the BS treaty obligation
and win-win Ukraine gave up

[1:11:15]
its nuclear weapons in the 90s.
And, that is likely how
this is gonna have to go.
The problem is that
requires political courage,
not from Zelensky.
It requires courage from probably Biden
because the only, Zelensky is
not in a political position,

[1:11:30]
where he can go back to his own people,
who have made unbelievable
sacrifices on behalf
of their nation and
freedom and say to them,
"Guys, now I'm calling it quits.
"We're gonna have to give
them Luhansk and Donetsk
"And give Putin an off ramp."
I don't think that's an acceptable
answer to most Ukrainians
at this point in time,
from the polling data and from
the available data we have
on the ground.

[1:11:45]
It's gonna actually take
Biden biting the bullet,
and being the bad guy
and saying to Zelensky,
"Listen, we've made a
commitment of material aid.
"We're offering you all these things,
"Including essentially a defense pact.
"We're offering you all this stuff,
"But, if you don't come to the table,

[1:12:00]
"Then we're gonna have to
start weaning you all."
There will have to be a stick there,
it can't just be a carrot.
And so, that will allow Zelensky,
if Biden were to do that,
it allows Zelensky to blame
Biden for the solution
everybody knows has to happen.
Zelensky can go back to his
own people and he can say,
"Listen, this is the way it has to go.

[1:12:15]
"I don't want it to go
this way, but it's not my,
"I'm signing other people's checks.
"I mean, it's not my money."
And Biden would take the hit
because he wouldn't then
be able to blame Ukraine
for whatever happens next.
Which has been the easy road off,
I think for a lot of
politicians in the West.
Is for them to just say,

[1:12:31]
Well, this is up to the
Ukrainians to decide.
It's up to the Ukrainians to decide.
Well, is it totally up to
the Ukrainians to decide?
Because it seems like the
West is signing an awful lot
of checks and all of Europe
is gonna freeze this winter.
- This is the importance of
great leadership by the way.

[1:12:45]
That's why the people we
elect is very important.
Do you think there's power to
just one on one conversation?
Where Biden sits down with Zelensky,
and Biden sits down with
Putin, almost in person.

[1:13:00]
'Cause I, or maybe I'm
romanticizing the notion,
but having done these podcasts in person,
I think there's something
fundamentally different
than through a remote call,
and also a distant kind
of recorded political
type speak versus like man to man.

[1:13:16]
- So I'm deeply afraid
that Putin outplays people
in the one-on-one scenarios
because he's done it to
multiple presidents already.
He gets in one-on-one scenarios
with Bush, with Obama,
with Trump, with Biden;
and he seems to be a very canny operator
and a very sort of hard-nosed
operator in those situations.

[1:13:33]
I think that if you were
gonna do something like that,
an actual political face-to-face summit,
what you would need is for Biden
to first have a
conversation with Zelensky.
Where Zelensky knows what's going on.
So he's aware,
and then Biden walks in and
he says to Putin on camera,

[1:13:46]
"Here's the offer, let's get it together,
"Let's make peace.
"You get to keep this stuff."
And then, let Putin respond,
how Putin is going to respond.
But, the big problem for Putin I think,

[1:14:01]
and the problem with public facing forum,
maybe it's a private meeting.
If it's a private meeting,
maybe that's the best thing.
If it's a public facing forum,
I think it's a problem
'cause Putin's afraid
of being humiliated at this point.
If it's a private meeting,
then sure, except that again,
I just wonder whether,

[1:14:17]
when it comes to a
person as canny as Putin,
and to a politician that
I really don't think
is a particularly sophisticated
player in Joe Biden.
And again, this is not unique to Biden.
I think that most of our
presidents for the last 30,

[1:14:33]
40 years have not been
particularly sophisticated players.
I think that's a risky scenario.
- Yeah, I still believe
in the power of that.
'Cause otherwise,

[1:14:45]
I don't think stuff on paper
and political speak will
solve these kinds of problems.
Because from the Zelensky perspective,
nothing but complete victory will do.
- [Ben] Right.
- As a nation has people
sacrificed way too much
and they're all in.

[1:15:00]
And if you look at,
'cause I traveled to
Ukraine, I spent time there,
I'll be going back there hopefully.
Also, going back to Russia,
just speaking to Ukrainians.
They're all in, they're all in.
- Yeah.
- Nothing, but don't complete victory.

[1:15:15]
- Yep, don't blame them, that's right.
- And so for that,
the only way to achieve peace
is through honest human
to human conversation.
Giving both people a way to off ramp,
to walk away victorious.

[1:15:31]
And some of that requires
speaking honestly
as a human being,
but also for America to actually,
not even America, honestly,
just the president, be able
to eat their own ego a bit,
and be the punching bag a little,

[1:15:46]
just enough for both presidents
to be able to walk away
and say, "Listen, we got
the American president
"To come to us.
"And, I think that makes the President
"Look strong, not weak."
- I mean, I agree with you.

[1:16:00]
I think it would also require
some people on the right,
people like me, if it's Joe Biden to say,
"If Biden does that,
I see what he's doing.
"It's the right move."
I think one of the things
that he's afraid of,
to steel man him.
I think one of the
things he's afraid of is,
he goes and he makes that sort of deal,
and the right says "You just
coward in front of Russia,
"You just gave away Ukraine."

[1:16:16]
Whatever it is.
But, it's gonna require
some people on the right
to say that that move is the right move,
and then hold by it.
If Biden actually performs that move.
- You're exceptionally good at debate.
You wrote How to Debate the
Leftist and Destroy Them.

[1:16:32]
You're kind of known
for this kind of stuff,
just exceptionally
skilled at conversation,
at debate, at getting to
the facts of the matter
and using logic to get to
the conclusion in the debate.
Do you ever worry that this power,

[1:16:45]
you talked about the ring,
this power you were
given has corrupted you
and your ability to see what's...
To pursue the truth versus
just winning debates?
- I hope not.
So I think one of the things

[1:17:00]
that's kind of funny about the
branding versus the reality,
is that most of the things
that get characterized
as destroying in debates
with facts and logic,
most of those things are
basically me having a conversation
with somebody on a college campus.
It actually isn't like a formal
debate where we sit there

[1:17:15]
and we critique each other's positions,
or it's not me insulting anybody.
A lot of the clips that
have gone very viral
is me making an argument,
and then there not being an
amazing counter argument.
- [Lex] Yep.
- Many of the debates that I've held
have been extremely cordial.
To take the latest example
like about a year ago
I debated Ana Kasparian from Young Turks.

[1:17:31]
It was very cordial,
it was very nice.
Yeah, that's sort of the
way that I like to debate.
My rule when it comes to
debate and or discussion,
is that my opponent actually
gets to pick the mode
in which we work.
So if it's going to be a debate of ideas

[1:17:46]
and we're just going to discuss
and critique and clarify,
then we can do that.
If somebody comes loaded for bear,
then I will respond in kind.
Because one of the big problems,
I think in sort of the debate
slash discussion sphere

[1:18:00]
is very often misdiagnosis
of what exactly is going on.
People who think that
a discussion is debate
and vice versa.
And that can be a real problem.
And there are people
who will treat what
ought to be a discussion,
as for example,

[1:18:15]
an exercise in performance art.
And so what that is,
is mugging or trolling,
or saying trolley things
in order to just get,
that's something I actually
don't do during debate.
If you actually watch me talk to people,
I don't actually do the trolling thing.
The trolling thing is almost
solely relegated to Twitter
and me making jokes on my show.

[1:18:30]
When it comes to actually debating people,
that sounds actually a lot
like what we're doing right now
is just the person
maybe taking just an
adverse position to mine.
And so, that's fine.
Usually half the debate or discussion
is me just asking for
clarification of terms.
What exactly do you mean by this?

[1:18:46]
So I can drill down on
where the actual disagreement may lie.
Because some of the time people
think they're disagreeing
and they're actually not disagreeing.
When I'm talking with Ana Kasparian,
and she's talking about how
corporate and government
have too much power together, I'm like,
"Well, you sound like a tea party."
Like you and I are on
the same page about that.

[1:19:00]
That sort of stuff does tend to happen
a lot in discussion.
I think that when discussion
gets termed debate,
it's a problem.
When debate gets term discussion,
it's even more problematic
because debate is a different thing.
- And I find that your
debate and your conversation
is often in good faith,
you're able to steel
man on the other side.

[1:19:15]
You're actually listening,
you're considering the other side.
The times when I see that you,
venture pure destroys leftist,
it's usually just like you said,
the other side is doing the trolling
because they didn't...
I mean the people that do
criticize you for that interaction

[1:19:34]
is the people that usually get destroyed
are like 20 years old,
and they're usually not sophisticated
in any kind of degree,
in terms of being able
to use logic and reason,
and facts and so on.

[1:19:45]
- And, that's totally fine by the way.
If people wanna criticize me for speaking
on college campuses,
where a lot of political
conversation happens,
both right and left, that's fine.
I've had lots of conversations
with people on the other side
of the aisle too.
I've done podcasts with Sam Harris,
and we've talked about atheism.
Or I've done debates with Anna Kasparian,

[1:20:00]
or I've done debate with Cenk Uygur,
or I've had conversations
with lots of people
on the other side of the aisle.
In fact, I believe I'm the
only person on the right
who recommends that
people listen to his shows
on the other side of the aisle.
I say on my show on a
fairly regular basis,
that people should listen
to Positive America.
Now, no one on Positive
America will ever say

[1:20:16]
that somebody should listen to my show.
That is verboten.
That is not something that can be had.
It's one of the strangeness
of our politics.
It's what I've called the
happy birthday problem;
which is, I have a lot of
friends who are of the left,
and are publicly of the left.
And, on my birthday they'll
send you a text message,

[1:20:30]
"Happy birthday."
But, they will never tweet happy birthday,
less they be acknowledging
that you were born of woman
and that this can't be allowed.
So, on the Sunday Special,
I've had a bevy of people
who are on the other side of the aisle,
a lot of them ranging
from people in Hollywood,
like Jason Blum to Larry Wilmore, to Sam,

[1:20:47]
to just a lot of people on the left.
I think, we're in the near future
probably gonna do a Sunday Special
with Ro Khanna in California.
The California Congress person.
Very nice guy, I had him on the show.
That kinda stuff is fun and interesting.

[1:21:00]
But, I think that the easy way out
for a clip that people don't like,
is to either immediately clip the clip.
They'll take a two minute clip
and clip it down to 15 seconds.
Where somebody insults
me and then that viral;
which is, welcome to the internet.
Or to say, "Well you're
only debating in colleges,

[1:21:15]
"You're only talking to 20."
I talked to a lot more people than that.
That's just not the stuff you're watching.
- You lost your cool in an interview
with BBC's Andrew Neil,
and you are really honest about it after;
which was kind of
refreshing and enjoyable.
As the internet said,

[1:21:30]
"They've never seen
anyone lose an interview."
So to me, honestly,
it was like seeing like
Floyd Mayweather Jr.
Or somebody, knock down.
Can you take me through that experience?
- Here's that day.

[1:21:45]
That day is, I have a book released,
didn't get a lot of
sleep the night before.
And this is the last interview of the day,
and it's an interview with BBC.
I don't know anything about BBC,
I don't watch BBC, I don't
know any of the hosts.
So we get on the interview
and it's supposed to be about the book,
and the host Andrew Neil,

[1:22:01]
doesn't ask virtually a single
question about the book.
He just starts reading me battled tweets,
which I hate.
I mean, it's annoying and it's stupid,
and it's the worst form of an interview.
- [Lex] Yeah.
- When somebody just
reads you battled tweets,
especially when I've acknowledged
battled tweets before.
And so, I'm going
through the list with him

[1:22:16]
and this interview was solidly 20 minutes.
It was a long interview.
And we get to,
and I make a couple of
particularly annoyed mistakes
in the interview.
So annoyed mistake number
one, is the ego play,
There's a point in the
middle of the interview

[1:22:30]
where I say,
"I don't even know who you are."
Which was true, I didn't know who he was.
It turns out he was a very
famous person in Britain.
And so you can't make that ego play.
- But even if he's not famous, that's not-
- It doesn't, it's a dumb thing to do
and it's an ass thing to do.
So saying that was more just
kind of peak in silliness.

[1:22:46]
And so, that was mistake number one.
- I enjoyed watching that.
It was like, oh Ben is human.
(hearty laughing)
- Glad somebody enjoyed it.
So there was that.
And then, the other mistake
was that I just don't
watch enough British TV.
So the way that interviews are done there,

[1:23:01]
are much more adversarial
than American TV.
In American TV, if somebody
is adversarial with you,
you assume that they're a
member of the other side.
That's typically how it is.
And so, I'm critiquing
some of his questions
at the beginning
and I thought that the critique
of some of his questions
is actually fair.
He was asking me about abortion,
and I thought he was asking it from a way

[1:23:16]
of framing the question
that wasn't accurate.
And so, I assumed that he was on the left.
'Cause again, I'd never heard of him.
And so, I mischaracterized him,
and I apologize later for
mischaracterizing him.
We finally go through the interview.
It's 20 minutes, he just keeps
going with the battle tweets.

[1:23:31]
And finally, I got up and
I took off the microphone.
I walked out.
And immediately, I knew it was a mistake.
Like within 30 seconds of
the end of the interview,
I knew it was a mistake.
And, that's why even before
the interview came out,
I believe I corrected the
record that Andrew Neil
is not on the left.

[1:23:45]
That's a mistake by me.
And then, took the hit
for a bad interview.
And so as far as, what I
wish I had done differently,
I wish I'd known who he was.
I wish I'd done my research.
I wish that I had treated it as though

[1:24:00]
there was a possibility
that it was gonna be more
adversarial than it was.
I think I was incautious
about the interview
because it was pitched as,
it's just another book interview,
and it wasn't just another book interview.
It was treated much more
adversarially than that.
So I wish that, that's on me.
I gotta research the people
who are talking to me,

[1:24:15]
and watch their shows,
and learn about that.
And then obviously, the kind
of gut level appeal to ego
or arrogance, that a bad look,
and shouldn't have done that.
And losing your cool is always a bad look.
- The fact that that sort
of became somewhat viral

[1:24:31]
and stood out,
just shows that it
happens so rarely to you.
So just to look at the day
in the life of Ben Shapiro,
you speak a lot, very eloquently,
about difficult topics.

[1:24:46]
What goes into the research, the mental,
and you always look pretty like energetic,
and like you're not
exhausted by the burden,
the heaviness of the topics
you're covering day after day
after day after day.

[1:25:00]
What goes through the
preparation mentally, diet-wise,
anything like that?
When do you wake up?
- Okay, so I wake up
when my kids wake me up,
usually that's my baby
daughter who's two and a half.
She usually, we hear her on the monitor,
usually about 6:15, 6:20AM.

[1:25:16]
So I get up,
my wife sleeps in a little bit.
I go get the baby,
and then my son gets up,
and then my oldest daughter gets up.
I have eight, six, and two.
The boy's the middle child.
- Is that both a source
of stress and happiness?
- Oh yeah, it's the height of both, right.

[1:25:30]
I mean, it's the source
of the greatest happiness.
So the way that I characterize it is this,
when it comes to sort of kids and life.
When you're single,
your boundaries of
happiness and unhappiness,
you can be a zero in terms of happiness,
you can be like a 10
in terms of happiness.
Then, you get married and
it goes up to like a 20
and a negative 20;
because your happiest
stuff is with your wife.

[1:25:46]
And then, the most unhappy stuff
is when something happens to your spouse,
it's the worst thing in the entire world.
Then, you have kids and
all limits are removed.
So the best things that
have ever happened to me
are things where I'm watching my kids
and they're playing together
and they're being wonderful
and sweet and cute,
and I love them so much.
And, the worst things are
when my son is screaming at me

[1:26:01]
for no reason because he's being insane,
and I have to deal with that.
Or something bad happens
to my daughter at school
or something like that.
That stuff is really it.
So yes, the source of
my greatest happiness,
the source of my greatest stress.
They get me up at about
6:15 in the morning.
I feed them breakfast.
I'm kind of scrolling the news;

[1:26:15]
while I'm making the eggs.
Just updating myself on anything
that may have happened overnight.
I go into the office,
put on the makeup and
the wardrobe or whatever,
and then I sit down and do the show.
A lot of the prep is actually
done the night before

[1:26:31]
because the news cycle
doesn't change all that much
between kind of late at night,
and in the morning.
So, I can supplement in the morning.
So, I do the show.
- So a lot of the preparation,
like thinking through what are
the big issues in the world
is done the night before?
- Yeah, and that's reading
pretty much all the legacy media.

[1:26:47]
I rip on legacy media a lot,
but that's because a lot of
what they do is really good
and a lot of what they do is really bad.
I cover a lot of legacy media.
So that's probably covering,
Wall Street Journal,
New York Times, Washington
Post, Boston Globe, Daily Mail.
And then, I'll look over at
some of the alternative media.

[1:27:00]
I'll look at my own website, Daily Wire,
I'll look at Breitbart.
I'll look at The Blaze.
I'll look at maybe The Intercept,
I'll look at a bunch of different sources
and then I will look at
different clips online.
So media comes in handy here,
(indistinct) comes in handy
here, that sort of stuff.

[1:27:16]
'Cause my show relies very heavily
on being able to play people,
so you can hear them in their own words.
And, that's sort of the media diet.
So I sit down,
I do the show and then once
I'm done with the show,
I usually have between,

[1:27:30]
now it's like 11:15 in the morning maybe,
'cause sometimes I'll prerecord the show.
It's 11:15 in the morning,
I'll go home and if my wife's available,
I'll grab lunch with her.
If not, then I will go and work out.
I try to work out five
times a week with a trainer,

[1:27:46]
something like that.
And then, I will-
- Just regular gym stuff?
Just going to the gym?
- Yeah, weights and plyometrics,
and some CrossFit kind of stuff.
Beneath this mild astute
lies a hulking monster, yeah.

[1:28:03]
And, so I'll do that.
Then, I will do reading and writing.
I'm usually working on a
book at any given time.
- Do you shut off the rest of the world?

[1:28:16]
- Yes, I put some music in my ears.
Usually Brahms or Bach,
sometimes Beethoven or Mozart.
Those four it's usually,
those are on rotation.
- No rap?
- No rap, no rap.
Despite my extraordinary rendition of WAP.
I'm not in fact a rap fan.
- Do you still hate WAP, the song?

[1:28:32]
- I will say,
I do not think that it is the
peak of western civilized art.
- [Lex] Okay.
- I don't think that a
hundred years from now,
people will be gluing their faces to a WAP
and protest at the environment.
- But, Brahms and the
rest will be still around?
- Yes, I would assume.

[1:28:45]
If people still have a
functioning prefrontal
cortex in any sort of taste.
- Strong words from Ben Shapiro.
All right, so you got some
classical music in your ears
and you're focusing.
Are you at the computer
when you're writing?
- Yeah, I'm at the computer, usually.
We have a kind of a room
that has some sun coming in,

[1:29:01]
so it's nice in there.
Or I'll go up to a library
that we just completed for me.
I'll go up there and I'll write and read.
- Like with physical books?
- Yeah, I love physical books
and because I keep Sabbath.
I don't use Kindle.
Because when I'm reading a book,

[1:29:15]
and I hit Sabbath,
I have to turn off the Kindle.
So that means that I have
tons and tons and tons
of physical books.
When we moved from Los Angeles to Florida,
I had about 7,000 volumes.
I had to discard probably 4,000 of them.
And then, I've built that back up now.
I'm probably gonna have to
go through another round,
where I put them somewhere else.

[1:29:30]
I tend to tab books rather
than highlighting them
because I can't highlight on Sabbath.
So I have the little stickers
and I put them in the book.
A typical book from me, you
can see it on the book club,
will be filled with tabs on the side.
Things that I wanna
take notes, I actually,
I've gotten a person
who I pay to go through

[1:29:47]
and write down in files the quotes
that I like from the book.
So I have those handy.
Which is a good way for me to remember
what it is that I've read.
'Cause I read probably somewhere
between three and five books a week.

[1:30:01]
And then, in a good week five.
And then, I write, I read.
And then, I go pick up my
kids from school at 3:30.
According to my kids, I have no job.
I'm there in the mornings
until they leave for school.
I pick them up from school,

[1:30:15]
I hang out with them until they go to bed;
which is usually 7:30 or so.
I'm helping them with their homework,
and I'm playing with them.
And, I'm taking them on
rides in the brand new Tesla;
which my son is obsessed with.
And then, I put them to bed
and then I sit back down,
I prep for the next day.

[1:30:30]
Go through all those media sources
I was talking about,
compile kind of a schedule
for what I want the show to look like,
and run a show.
It's very detail oriented.
Nobody writes anything for me.
I write all my own stuff.
So every word that comes
outta my mouth, is my fault.
And then, hopefully I have a couple hours

[1:30:45]
or an hour to hang out with
my wife before we go to bed.
- The words you write,
do you edit a lot or does it
just come out, you're thinking?
What are the key ideas I want to express?
- No, I don't tend to edit a lot,
I thank God I'm able to write
extraordinarily quickly.
I write very, very fast.

[1:31:01]
In fact, in a previous life I was.
- You also speak fast, so similarly.
- Yeah, exactly.
And I speak in paragraphs,
it's exactly the same thing.
In a previous life, I was a ghost writer.
So, I used to be sort of known
as a turnaround specialist
in the publishing industry.
There'd be somebody who came
to the publisher and says,

[1:31:16]
"I have three weeks to get this book done.
"I don't have a word done."
And they would call me up and be like,
"This person needs a book written."
And so, in three weeks, I'd
knock out 60,000 words or so.
- Is there something you
can say to the process
that you follow to think?

[1:31:30]
How you think about ideas,
stuff is going on in the
world and trying to understand
what is happening.
What are the explanations?
What are the forces behind this?
Do you have a process or
just you wait for the news
to give you the interpretation?
- Well, I don't think
it's a formal process,

[1:31:47]
but because I read...
There's two ways to do it.
One is sometimes, the
daily grind of the news
is going to refer back to core principles
that are broader and deeper.

[1:32:01]
I thank God because I've read so much
on so many different things
of a lot of different point of views.
Then, if something breaks,
and a piece of news breaks,
I can immediately sort
of channel that into,
in the mental Rolodex.
These three big ideas that I
think are really important.

[1:32:17]
And then, I can talk at length
about what those ideas are
and I can explicate those.
And so, for example,
when we were talking about
Musk taking over Twitter
before and I immediately
go to the history of media.
That's me tying it into a broader theme.

[1:32:30]
- [Lex] Yeah.
- And, I do that, I would
say fairly frequently.
We're talking about, say
subsidization of industry,
and I can immediately tie that into,
okay, what's the history of subsidization
in the United States,
going all the way back to Woodrow Wilson
and forward through
FDR's industrial policy.

[1:32:46]
And, how does that tie into
sort of broader economic
policy internationally?
It allows me to tie into bigger themes
because what I tend to
read is mostly not news.
What I tend to read is mostly books.
I would say most of my media diet
is actually not the stuff.
Like, that's the icing on the cake.

[1:33:00]
But, the actual cake is the
hundreds of pages in history,
econ, geography, social science,
that I'm reading every week.
And so, that sort of stuff allows me
to think more deeply about these things.

[1:33:15]
So that's one way of doing it.
The other way of doing it is,
Russia breaks in the news.
I don't know anything about Russia.
I immediately go and I purchase
five books about Russia,
and I read all of them.
The fortunate thing for me,
and the unfortunate thing about the world
is you read two books on a subject.

[1:33:33]
You are now considered by the media,
an expert on the subject.
That's sad and shallow.
But, that is the way that it is.
The good news for me is that my job
isn't to be a full expert
on any of these subjects.
I don't claim to be.
I'm not a Russia expert.
I know enough on Russia
to be able to understand

[1:33:47]
when people talk about Russia,
what the system looks like,
how it works, and all of that.
And then, to explicate
that for the common man;
which a lot of people who are infused
with the expertise can't really do.
If you're so deep in the weeds,
that you're like a full on
academic expert on a thing;
sometimes it's hard to translate that over

[1:34:00]
to a massive audience;
which is really my job.
- Well, I think it can actually,
it's funny with the two books,
you can actually get a
pretty deep understanding
if you read and also
think deeply about it.
It allows you to approach a
thing from first principles.
A lot of times if you're
a quote unquote expert,

[1:34:16]
you get carried away by the
momentum of what the field
has been thinking about
versus like stepping back,
"All right, what is really going on?"
The challenge is to pick
the right two books.
- Right, usually what I'll try to find

[1:34:31]
is somebody who knows
the topic pretty well
and have them recommend,
or a couple people, and
have them recommend books.
So a couple years ago I
knew nothing about Bitcoin.
I was at a conference
and a couple of people
who you've had on your show, actually,
were there and I asked them,
"Gimme your top three books on Bitcoin."

[1:34:45]
And so then, I went and I read
like nine books on Bitcoin.
And so, if you're nine books on Bitcoin,
you at least know enough to get by.
- [Lex] Yeah.
- And so, I can actually
explain what Bitcoin is
and why it works,
or why it doesn't work in some cases,
and what's happening in
the markets that way.
So that's very, very helpful.

[1:35:02]
- Well, Putin as an example.
That's a difficult one to
find the right books on.
I think The New Czar is the one I read,
where it was the most objective.
- One I read, I think, about Putin was,
it was one called Strong Man.

[1:35:15]
And, it was very highly critical of Putin,
but it gave a good background
on him at the very least.
- Yeah, so I'm very
skeptical sort of things
that are very critical of Putin
because it feels like
there's activism injected
into the history.
Like, the way The Rise and
Fall of the Third Reich

[1:35:31]
is written about Hitler,
I like because there's almost
not a criticism of Hitler.
It's a description of
Hitler, which is very,
it's easier to do about
a historical figure;
which with William Shirer
with The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,

[1:35:45]
it's impressive because
he lived through it.
But, it's very tough to
find objective descriptions
about the history of the
man and a country of Putin,
of Zelensky, of any difficult,
Trump was the same.
And, I feel like-

[1:36:00]
- That's the hero
villain archetype, right?
- [Lex] Yeah.
- It's like, either
somebody's completely a hero
or completely a villain.
And, the truth is pretty much
no one is completely a hero
or completely a villain.
People, in fact,
I'm not sure that I love
descriptions of people
as heroes or villains, generally.
I think that people
tend to do heroic things

[1:36:16]
or do villainous things.
In the same way that I'm not sure
I love descriptions of people as a genius.
My dad used to say this
when I was growing up,
he used to say he didn't believe
that there were geniuses.
He said he believed that there
were people with a genius
for something because people, yes,
there are people who have very high IQ
and we call them geniuses,
but does that mean that
they're good at EQ stuff?

[1:36:32]
Not necessarily,
but there are people who
are geniuses at EQ stuff.
In other words,
it would be more specific to
say that somebody's a genius
at engineering than to
say just broad spectrum,
they're a genius.
And that, does avoid
the problem of thinking
that they're good at something
that they're not good at.
It's a little more specific.

[1:36:46]
- So because you read a lot of books,
can you look back, and it's
always a tough question,
'cause so many, it's
like your favorite song,
but are there books that have
been influential in your life
that are impacting your thinking?
Or maybe ones you go back to that

[1:37:00]
still carry insight for you?
- The Federalist Paper is a big one
in terms of sort of how
American politics works.
The first econ book that
I thought was really great
'cause it was written for teenagers,
essentially, is one called
Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt.
It's like 150 pages.
I recommend it to everybody
sort of 15 and up.

[1:37:17]
It's easier than say
Thomas Sowell's Basic Econ;
which is four or 500 pages.
- And it's looking what,
at like macroeconomics,
microeconomics, that kind of stuff?
- Macro, macro.
And, then,
there's a great book
by Carl Trueman called Rise and
Triumph for the Modern Self,

[1:37:31]
which I think is the best
book in the last 10 years.
That's been sort of impactful
on some of the thoughts
I've been having lately.
- What's the key idea in there?
- The key idea is that
we've shifted the nature
of how identity is done in the West,
from how it was historically done.
That basically, for nearly
all of human history,

[1:37:46]
the way that we identify
as human beings is as a mix
of our biological drives,
and then how that interacts
with the social institutions around us.
And so, when you're a child,
you're a bunch of unfettered
biological drives,
and it's your parents'
job to civilize you.
And, civilize you

[1:38:00]
literally means bring you
into civilization, right.
You learn the rules of the road,
you learn how to integrate
into institutions
that already exist and
are designed to shape you.
And it's how you interact
with those institutions
that makes you, you.
It's not just a set of biological drives.
And then, in the modern world,
we've really driven toward
the idea that what we are

[1:38:17]
is how we feel on the inside
without reference to the outside world.
And it's the job of the outside world
to celebrate and reflect
what we think about
ourselves on the inside.
And so, what that means
is that we are driven now
toward fighting institutions
'cause institutions are in positions.

[1:38:31]
So everything around us,
societal institutions,
these are things that
are crimping our style.
They're making us not feel
the way that we wanna feel.
And, if we just destroy those things,
then we'll be freer and more liberated.
It's, I think, much deeper model
of how to think about
why our social politics

[1:38:45]
particular are moving in
a particular direction.
Is that a ground shift has happened
in how people think about themselves.
And, this has had some somewhat
kind of shocking effect
in terms of social politics.
- So there's negative
consequences in your view of that.
But, is there also a positive
consequence of more power,

[1:39:03]
more agency to the individual?
- I think that you can make the argument
that institutions were
weighing too heavily
in how people form their identity.
But, I think that what we've done
is gone significantly too
far on the other side.
We basically decided to
blow up the institutions

[1:39:15]
in favor of unfettered
feeling slash identity.
And I think that that is
not only a large mistake,
I think it's gonna have dire
ramifications for everything
from suicidal ideation to
institutional longevity
in politics and in society more broadly.

[1:39:31]
- So speaking about the nature of self,
you've been an outspoken
proponent of pro-life.
Can we start by you trying to steel man,
the case for pro-choice?
That abortion is not murder,

[1:39:46]
and a woman's right to choose
is a fundamental human right, freedom.
- So I think that the
only way to steel man,
the pro-choice case is to, and
be ideologically consistent,
is to suggest that there
is no interest in the life

[1:40:02]
of the unborn,
that counter weighs at
all, freedom of choice.
So, what that means is we
can take the full example,
we can sort of the partial example.

[1:40:15]
If we take the full example.
What that would mean is that
up until point of birth;
which is sort of the democratic
party platform position,
that a woman's right to
choose ought to extend
for any reason whatsoever
up to point of birth.
The only way to argue that
is that bodily autonomy
is the only factor.
There is no countervailing factor

[1:40:30]
that would ever outweigh bodily autonomy.
That would be the strongest
version of the argument.
Another version of that argument
would be that the reason
that bodily autonomy
ought to weigh so heavily
is because women can't be
the equals of men,

[1:40:45]
if the vicissitudes of biology are allowed
to decide their futures.
If pregnancy changes women
in a way that it doesn't change men,
it's a form of sex
discrimination for women
to ever have to go through with pregnancy;
which is an argument
that was made by Ruth
Bader Ginsburg, kind of.
Those are the arguments.

[1:41:00]
The kind of softer version is the more,
I would say emotionally resonant
version of the argument;
which is that bodily
autonomy ought to outweigh
the interests of the
fetus up till point x.
And then, people have different feelings

[1:41:15]
about what point X looks like.
Is it up to the point of viability?
Is it up to the point of the heartbeat?
Is it up to 12 weeks or 15 weeks?
And, that really is where
the American public is.
Where the American public
is broadly speaking,
not state by state,
where there are various,
really varied opinions.
But, like broadly speaking,
it seems like the American
public by polling data
wants somewhere between

[1:41:30]
a 12 and 15 week abortion restriction.
And, they believe that
up until 12 or 15 weeks,
there's not enough there
for, to not be specific,
but to be kind of how
people feel about it,
to outweigh a woman's bodily autonomy.
And then, beyond that point,
then there's enough of
an interest in the life

[1:41:46]
of the pre-born child,
it's developed enough.
Then now, we care about it enough
that it outweighs a
woman's bodily autonomy.
- What's the strongest case
for pro-life in your mind?
- I mean, the strongest case for pro-life
is that from conception,

[1:42:00]
a human life has been created.
It is a human life with potential.
That human life potential with potential,
now has an independent
interest in its own existence.
- If I may just ask a quick question.
So conception is when a
sperm fertilizes an egg?

[1:42:15]
- Yes.
- Okay, just to to clarify
the biological beginning
of what conception means.
- I mean, because that is
the beginning of human life.
Now, there are other standards
that people have drawn.
Some people say
implantation in the uterus,
some people will suggest viability,

[1:42:31]
some brain development
or heart development.
But, the clear dividing line
between a human life exists
and a human life does not exist,
is the biological creation
of an independent human life
with own DNA strands and et cetera;
which happens at conception.
Once you acknowledge that
there is that independent
human life with potential,

[1:42:48]
and I keep calling it that
because people sometimes
say potential human life,
it's not a potential human life.
It's a human life that
is not developed yet
to the full extent that it will develop.
Once you say that,
and once you say that
it has its own interest.
Now, the burden of proof is to explain

[1:43:01]
why bodily autonomy ought to allow
for the snuffing out of that human life.
If we believe that human
life ought not to be killed
for quote unquote, no good reason,
you have to come up with a good reason.
The burden of proof is now shifted.
Now, we'll find people who will say,

[1:43:16]
"Well, the good reason is that
"It's not sufficiently
developed to outweigh
"The mental trauma or emotional trauma
"That a woman goes through.
"If, for example, she was
raped or the victim of incest."
Okay, and that is a fairly
emotionally resonant argument,
but it's not necessarily dispositive.

[1:43:30]
You can make the argument
that just because something horrific
and horrible happened to a woman,
does not rob the human life
of its interest in life.
One of the big problems
in trying to draw any line
for the self-interest of life,

[1:43:45]
in the human life is that
it's very difficult to draw
any other line that doesn't
seem somewhat arbitrary.
You say that independent heartbeat,
people have pacemakers.
If you say brain function,
people have various levels
of brain function as adults.

[1:44:00]
If you say viability,
babies are not viable after they're born.
If I left a newborn baby on a table,
and did not take care of it,
it would be dead in two days.
So, once you start getting
into sort of these lines,
it starts to get very fuzzy very quickly.
And so, if you're looking
for sort of a bright line

[1:44:15]
moral rule, that would be
the bright line moral rule.
And, that's sort of the pro-life case.
- Well, there's still mysterious
difficult scientific questions
of things like consciousness.
- So what does the
question of consciousness,

[1:44:30]
how does it come into
play into this debate?
- So I don't believe that consciousness
is the sole criterion
by which we judge the
self-interest in human life.
So we are unconscious a good
deal of our lives, right?

[1:44:45]
That does not, we will be conscious again.
When you're unconscious,
when you're asleep,
for example, presumably your
life is still worth living.
If somebody came in and killed you,
that'd be a serious moral
quandary at the very least.
- But the birth of consciousness,
the lighting up of the flame,

[1:45:01]
the initial lighting up of the flame,
there does seem to be
something special about that.
And, it's a mystery of when that happens.
- Well, I mean, Peter
Singer makes the case
that basically
self-consciousness doesn't exist
until you're two and a half.
He says that even
infanticide should be okay.

[1:45:15]
He's the bioethicist over at Princeton.
You get into some real dicey territory
once you get into consciousness.
Also, the truth is that
consciousness is more of a spectrum
than it is a dividing line.
Meaning, that there are
people with various degrees
of brain function.

[1:45:30]
We don't actually know
how conscious they are.
And you can get into eugenic
territory pretty quickly,
when we start dividing between
lives that are worth living
based on levels of consciousness,
and lives that are not worth living
based on levels of consciousness.
- Do you find it,
the aspect of women's freedom,

[1:45:47]
do you feel the tension
between that ability
to choose the trajectory of your own life
versus the rights of the unborn child?
- In one situation, yes.

[1:46:00]
In one situation, no.
If you've had sex with
a person voluntarily,
and as a product of that,
you are now pregnant, no.
You've taken an action with a
perfectly predictable result.
Even if you took birth control.
This is the way that human
beings have procreated
for literally all of human existence.
And by the way,

[1:46:15]
also how all mammals appropriate.
So the idea that this was an
entirely unforeseen consequence
of your activity,
I find, I have less sympathy for you
in that particular situation
because you could have made decisions
that would not lead you to
this particular impasse.
In fact, this used to be
the basis of marriage.

[1:46:31]
Was when we were a, apparently
more terrible society,
we used to say that people should wait
until they get married to have sex,
a position that I still hold.
And, the reason for that
was because then if you have
sex and you produce a child,
then the child will grow up
in a two parent family with stability.

[1:46:46]
So, not a ton of sympathy there.
When it comes to rape and incest,
obviously heavy, heavy sympathy.
And so, that's why I think you
see, statistically speaking,
a huge percentage of Americans,
including many pro-life Americans,
people who consider themselves pro-life,
would consider exceptions
for rape and incest.

[1:47:01]
One of the sort of dishonest
things that I think happens
in abortion debates is
arguing from the fringes.
This tends to happen a lot,
is pro-choice activists will
argue from rape and incest
to the other 99.8% of abortions.
Or you'll see people on
the pro-life side argue
from partial birth abortion

[1:47:16]
to all of abortion that
you actually have to take
on sort of the mainstream case,
and then decide whether or
not that's acceptable or not.
- But to you, the exception,
just ethically without generalizing it,
that is a valid ethically exception.
- I don't hold that there
should be an exception for rape

[1:47:32]
or incest because again,
I hold by the bright line
rule that once a human life
with potential exists,
then it has its own interest
in life that cannot be curbed
by your self-interest.
The only exception that I hold by is,
the same exception that
literally all pro-lifers hold by;

[1:47:46]
which is the life of the
mother is put in danger.
- Such a tough, tough topic.
'Cause if you believe
that that's the line,
then we're committing mass murder.
- Well, or at least mass killing.
So I would say that murder
typically requires a level
of mens rea that may be absent

[1:48:02]
and in many cases of abortion.
Because the usual follow on question is,
"Well if to murder, why
don't prosecute the woman?"
And the answer is because
the vast majority of people
who are having abortions,
don't actually believe
that they're killing a person.
They have a very different view

[1:48:15]
of what is exactly happening.
I would say that there are
all sorts of interesting
hypotheticals that come in to play
when it comes to abortion.
And you can play them any which way.
But, let's put it this way,
there are gradations of wrongs.

[1:48:30]
I don't think that all abortions
are equally blameworthy.
Even if I would ban virtually all of them.
I think that there are
mitigating circumstances
that make, while being wrong,
some abortions less morally
blameworthy than others.

[1:48:46]
I think that,
I can admit a difference between killing
a two week old embryo in the womb,
and stabbing a seven year old in the face.
I can recognize all
that while still saying,
I think that it would be wrong
to terminate a pregnancy.

[1:49:00]
- Do you think the
question when life begins,
which I think is a fascinating question,
is a question of science
or a question of religion?
- I mean when life begins,
is a question of science.
When that life becomes
valuable enough for people
to wanna protect it is
is gonna be a question

[1:49:16]
that is beyond science.
Science doesn't have moral judgements
to make about the value of human life.
This is one of the problems that,
Sam Harrison and I have had
this argument many times,
and it's always kind of interesting,
'cause Sam is of the opinion
that you can get to ought from is.
That science says "Is,
therefore we can learn ought."

[1:49:30]
So human flourishing is the goal of life.
And I always say to him,
I don't see where you get that
from evolutionary biology.
You can assume it,
just say you're assuming it,
but don't pretend that
that is a conclusion
that you can draw straight from biological
reality itself because
obviously that doesn't exist

[1:49:47]
in the animal world, for example.
Nobody assumes the innate
value of every ant.
- I think I know your answer to this,
but, let's test it
'cause I think you're going to be wrong.
(hearty laughing)
So there's a robot behind you.
Do you think there will
be a time in the future

[1:50:01]
when it will be unethical
and illegal to kill a robot,
because they will have sentience?
My guess is you would say,
"No, Lex, 'cause there's
a fundamental difference
"Between humans and robots."
And I just want to get you on record

[1:50:16]
'cause I think you'll be wrong.
- It depends on the level of development
I would assume of the robots.
You're assuming a complexity in the robots
that eventually imitates
what we in the religious life
would call the human soul.
- [Lex] Yes.

[1:50:30]
- The ability to choose
freely, for example.
- [Lex] Yes.
- Which I believe is sort of the capacity
for human beings.
- The ability to suffer.
- Yeah, if all of that could be
proved and not programmed,
meaning the freely willed
capacity of a machine

[1:50:47]
to do X, Y, or Z.
- You, could not pinpoint exactly
where it happens in the program.
- Right.
- [Lex] Yeah.
- It's not deterministic.
- [Lex] Yeah.
- Then it would raise serious
moral issues, for sure.

[1:51:00]
I'm not sure I know to
answer to that question.
- Are you afraid of that time?
- I'm not sure I'm afraid of that time.
I mean, any more than
I'd be afraid if aliens
arrived in the world,
and had these characteristics.
- Well, there's just a
lot of moral complexities
and they don't necessarily have
to be in the physical space.
They can be in the digital space.

[1:51:16]
There's an increased
sophistication and number of bots
on the internet, including on Twitter.
As they become more and more intelligent,
there's going to be serious questions
about what is our moral duty
to protect ones that have or claim

[1:51:31]
to have an identity.
- And that'll be really interesting.
Actually what I'm afraid of
is the opposite happening,
meaning that people,
the worst that should happen
is that we develop robots
so sophisticated that they
appear to have free will
and then we treat them with human dignity.
- [Lex] Yeah.

[1:51:45]
- That should be the worst that happens.
What I'm afraid of is
the opposite, is that,
if we're talking about this
particular hypothetical,
that we develop robots
that have all of these apparent abilities
and then we dehumanize them,
which leads us to also
dehumanize the other humans
around us; which you could
easily see happening.
And the devaluation of
life to the point where

[1:52:01]
it doesn't really matter.
I mean people have always treated,
unfortunately, newly discovered
other humans this way.
I don't think there's
actually a new problem.
I think it's a pretty old problem.
It'll just be interesting
when it's made of human hands.
- Yeah, it's an opportunity

[1:52:16]
to either celebrate humanity
or to bring out the worst in humanity.
The derision that naturally happens,
like you said with pointing out the other,
Let me ask you about climate change.
Let's go from the meme

[1:52:32]
to the profound philosophy.
The meme is,
there's a clip of you
talking about climate change
and saying that-
- Ah, the Aquaman meme.
- You said that, "For
the sake of argument,
"And if the water level
arises five to 10 feet
"In the next hundred years,

[1:52:45]
"People will just sell
their homes and move."
And then, the meme is sell to who?
Can you argue both sides of that?
- The argument that they're
making as a straw man,
the argument that I'm making is over time.
I don't mean that if a tsunami
is about to hit your house,
you can list it on eBay.
That's not what I mean, obviously.

[1:53:00]
What I mean is that human beings
have an extraordinary ability to adapt.
It's actually our best quality.
And that as water levels rise,
real estate prices in
those areas tends to fall.
That over time people tend
to abandon those areas.
They tend to leave,
they tend to, right now,

[1:53:15]
sell their houses.
And then, they tend to move.
And eventually, those
houses will be worthless
and you won't have anybody to sell to.
But presumably not that many people
will be living there by that point,
which is one of the reasons
why the price would be low
because there's no demand.
- So it's over a hundred years.
So all of these price dynamics
are very gradual relative

[1:53:31]
to the other price dynamics.
- Correct, that's why the joke of it,
of course is that like
I'm saying that tomorrow
there's a tsunami on your
so step and you're like,
"Oh, Bob will buy my house."
Bob ain't gonna buy your house.
Like we all get that.
But it's a funny meme, I'll admit,
I laughed at.
- How's your view on climate change,

[1:53:46]
the human contribution to climate change?
What should we do in
terms of policy to respond
to climate change?
How has that changed over the years?
- I would say the truth
is for years and years,
I've believed that climate
change was a reality
and that anthropogenic
climate change is a reality.

[1:54:03]
I don't argue with the IPCC estimates.
I know climatologists at
places like MIT or Caltech,
and they know this stuff better than I do.
The notion that climate
change is just not happening
or that human beings have not
contributed to climate change,

[1:54:15]
I find doubtful.
The question is to what extent
human beings are contributing
to climate change, that 50%, is it 70%?
Is it 90%?
I think there's a little bit
more play in the joints there,
so it's not totally clear.
The one thing I do know,
and this I know with factual accuracy,
is that all of the measures that are
currently being proposed are
unworkable and will not happen.

[1:54:32]
So when people say, Paris Climate Accords,
even if those were imposed,
you're talking about lowering
the potential trajectory
of climate change by a
fraction of a degree.
If you're talking about

[1:54:45]
the Green New Deal, net zero by 2050,
the carbon is up there in the
air and the climate change
is going to happen.
Also, you're assuming
that geopolitical dynamics don't exist.
Everybody's gonna magically
get on the same page
and we're all gonna be
imposing massive carbon taxes

[1:55:00]
to get to net zero by 2050.
I mean like hundreds of times higher
than they currently are.
And that's not me saying that,
that's Klaus Schwab saying
this at the World Economic Forum;
who's a big advocate of
exactly this sort of policy.
And the reality is that
we're gonna have to accept
that at least 1.5 degrees
Celsius of climate change

[1:55:15]
is baked into the cake by
the end of the century.
Again, not me talking William Nordhaus,
the economist who just won the Nobel Prize
in this stuff, talking.
And so, what that suggests to
me is what we've always known
human beings are crap at mitigation
and excellent in adaptation.
We are very bad at
mitigating our own fault.
We are very good at adapting
to the problems as they exist.

[1:55:31]
Which means that all of
the estimates that billions
will die, that there
will be mass starvation,
that we'll see the migration
in just a few years
of hundreds of millions of
people, those are wrong.
What you'll see is a
gradual change of living.
People will move away from
areas that are inundated

[1:55:46]
on the coast.
You'll see people building sea walls,
you'll see people adapting new
technologies to suck carbon
out of the air.
You'll see geoengineering,
this is the sort of stuff
that we should be focused on
and the sort of bizarre focus
on what if we just keep tossing
hundreds of billions of
dollars at the same three

[1:56:02]
technologies over and over in the hopes
that if we subsidize it,
this will magically
make it more efficient.
I've seen no evidence whatsoever that
that is going to be the
way that we get ourselves
out of this, necessity
being the mother invention.
I think human beings will
adapt because we have adapted

[1:56:16]
and we'll continue to adapt.
- So to the degree we invest
in the threat of this,
it should be into policies
that help with the adaptation
versus the mitigation?
- Right, sea walls, geoengineering,
developing technology to
suck carbon out of the air.
Again, if I thought that
there was more sort of hope

[1:56:31]
for the green technologies
currently in play,
than subsidization of those technologies,
I might be a little bit more for,
but I haven't seen tremendous progress
over the course of the last 30 years
in the reliability of,
for example, wind energy.
Or the ability to store solar
energy to the extent necessary

[1:56:46]
to actually power a grid.
- What's your thoughts on nuclear energy?
- Nuclear energy is great.
Nuclear energy is a
proven source of energy
and we should be radically
extending the use
of nuclear energy.
To me, honestly, this is
like a litmus test question

[1:57:01]
as to whether you take
climate change seriously.
If you're on right or left
and you take climate change
seriously, you should be
in favor of nuclear energy.
If you're not, I know that you're just,
you have other priorities.
- Yeah, the fascinating thing
about the climate change
debate is the dynamics
of the fear mongering
over the past few decades,

[1:57:15]
'cause some of the nuclear energy
was tied up into that somehow.
There's a lot of fear
about nuclear energy.
It seems like there's a
lot of social phenomena,
social dynamics involved versus
dealing with just science.
It's interesting to watch
and if, on my darker days,

[1:57:32]
it makes me cynical about
our ability to use reason
and science to deal with
the threats of the world.
- I think that our ability
to use reason and science
to deal with threats of the world,
is almost a timeframe question.

[1:57:45]
So I think, we're very bad
at looking down the road
and saying, because people
can't handle, for example,
even things like compound interest.
- [Lex] Yeah.
- Right, the idea that if I
put a dollar in the bank today,
that 15 years from now,
that's gonna be worth a
lot more than a dollar.
People can't actually see that.
And so the idea of let's foresee
a problem then we'll deal

[1:58:00]
with it right now,
as opposed to 30 years down the road.
Typically, we let the problem happen
and then we solve it,
and it's bloodier and worse
than it would've been,
if we had solved it 30 years ago.
But, it is in fact effective
and sometimes it turns out
the solution that we're proposing 30 years
in advance is not effective.

[1:58:15]
And that, can be a major problem as well.
- Well that's then to steel man,
the case for fear mongering,
for irrational fear mongering,
we need to be scared shitless
in order for us to do anything.
I'm generally against that.
But, maybe on a population scale,

[1:58:31]
maybe some of that is
necessary for us to respond
appropriate to long-term threats.
We should be scared shitless.
- But, I don't think think
that we can actually do that though.
First of all,

[1:58:45]
platonic lives are generally bad.
And then second of all,
I don't think that we actually
have the capacity to do this.
I think that the people who are,
the sort of elites of our
society who get together in rooms
and talk about this sort of stuff,
and I've been in some of those meetings.
At my synagogues Friday nights,
actually no, but...

[1:59:00]
- I was gonna make the
joke, but I'm glad you did.
- Yeah, I've been in
rooms, Davos like rooms.
And, when people discuss
these sorts of topics,
and they're like,
"What if we just tell people
that it's gonna be a disaster
"With tsunamis and the
day after tomorrow?"
It's like, you guys don't have that power.
You don't, and by the way,

[1:59:16]
you dramatically undercut your
own power because of COVID
to do this sort of stuff.
Because a lot of the,
what if we scare the
living hell out of you
to the point where you
stay in your own house
for two years,
and we tell you you can't
send your kids to school,
and then we tell you that the vaccine
is gonna prevent transmission,

[1:59:31]
and then we also tell you that
we need to spend $7 trillion
in one year,
and it won't have any inflationary effect.
And it turns out,
you're wrong on literally
all of those things.
The last two years have
done more to undermine
institutional trust than any time
in probably American history.
It's pretty, pretty amazing.

[1:59:45]
- Yeah, I tend to agree with
the only thing we have to fear
is fear itself.
Let me ask you, back
to the question of God
in a big ridiculous question.
Who's God?
- Who is God?
I'm gonna use sort of
the Aquinas formulation

[2:00:02]
of what God is.
That, if there is a cause of
all things not physical things,
if there is a cause underlying
the reason of the universe,
then that is the thing we call God.

[2:00:16]
So not a big guy in the
sky with the beard,.
He is the force underlying
the logic of the universe,
if there is a logic to the universe.
And He is the creator in the
Judea view of that universe.

[2:00:33]
And He, does have an interest in us
living in accordance with
the laws of the universe
that, if you're a religious
Jew, are encoded in the Torah.
But, if you're not religious Jew,
it would be encoded in the natural law

[2:00:45]
by sort of Catholic theology.
- Why do you think God
created the universe
or as is popularly asked,
what do you think is
the meaning behind it?
What's the meaning of life?
- What's the meaning of life?
So I think that the meaning of life

[2:01:00]
is to fulfill what God made you to do.
And that is a series of roles.
I think that human beings,
and here you have to look
to sort of human nature
rather than looking kind
of to big questions.
I've evolved something
that I've really been working on.

[2:01:16]
I'm writing a book about this actually,
that I call colloquially role theory.
And basically the idea is
that the way that we interact
with the world is through
a series of roles.
And those are also the
things we find most important
and most implementable.

[2:01:31]
There's sort of virtue ethics,
which suggests that if we act
in accordance with virtue,
like Aristotle, then we will be living
the most fulfilled and meaningful life.
And then, you have sort
of deontological ethics,
continent ethics, that
it's a rule-based ethic.

[2:01:46]
You follow the rules,
then you'll then you'll
find the meaning of life.
And then, what I'm proposing
is that there's something
that I would call role ethics,
which is there are a series of roles
that we play across our lives;
which are also the things
that we tend to put on our tombstones,
and find the most meaningful.
So when you go to a cemetery,

[2:02:01]
you can see what people
found the most meaningful
because it's the stuff
they put on the stone
that has like four words on it.
Like beloved father, beloved
mother, sister, brother,
you might have a job once in a while;
a creator, a religious person.

[2:02:15]
These are all roles that
have existed across societies
and across humanity.
And those are the things where
we actually find meaning.
The way that we navigate
those roles brings us meaning.
And I think that God created
us in order to fulfill those
roles for purposes that I
can't begin to understand

[2:02:31]
'cause I ain't him.
And, the more we recognize those roles,
and the more we live those roles,
and then we can express
freedom within those roles.
I think that liberty exists
inside each of those roles,
and that's what makes all of our lives
different and fun.
We all parent in different ways,

[2:02:46]
but being a parent is a meaningful role.
We all have spouses, but you know,
how you interact with that relationship
is what makes your life
meaningful and interesting.
That is what we are put on earth to do.
And, if we perform those roles properly,
and those roles do include
things like being a creator,

[2:03:00]
like we have a creative
instinct as human beings,
being a creator, being an innovator,
being a defender of your family,
being somebody who builds up,
being a social member of your community;
which is something that we're built to do.
If we fulfill those roles properly,
then we will have made
the world a better place
then we inherited it.

[2:03:15]
And, we'll also have had
the joy of experiencing
the sort of flow they
talk about in psychology.
Where, when you engage in these roles,
you actually do feel a flow.
- So these roles are a fundamental part
of the human condition.
- [Ben] Yes.
- So, the book you're working on

[2:03:32]
is constructing a system
to help us understand.
- It's looking at, let's
assume that all that's true.
The real question in the
book is how do you construct
a flourishing and useful
society in politics?

[2:03:46]
- Ah, so a society level.
If this is our understanding
of a human being,
how do we construct a good society?
- Right, exactly, because
I think that a lot
of political theory is right now based in
either J.S. Mill kind of thought,
which is all that a good politics does,

[2:04:01]
allows you wave your hand around
until you hit somebody in the face.
Or a Rawlsian thought,
which is what if we constructed society
in order to achieve the most
for the least, essentially.
What if we constructed society
around what actually makes
humans the most fulfilled?

[2:04:15]
And that is the fulfillment
of these particular roles.
And where does liberty come into that?
How do you avoid the idea
of a tyranny in that?
"You have to be a mother,
you must be a father,
"You must be a..."
Where does freedom come into that?
Can you reject those roles
totally as a society and be okay?

[2:04:31]
The answer probably is not.
So you need a society
that actually promotes
and protects those roles,
but also protects the
freedom inside those roles.
And that raises a more
fundamental question
of what exactly liberty is for.
And I think that both
the right and the left
actually tend to make a mistake
when they discuss liberty.

[2:04:47]
The left tends to think that
liberty is an ultimate good,
that simple choice makes a bad thing good,
which is not true.
And I think the right talks about liberty
in almost the same terms sometimes.
And, I think that's not true either.
The question is whether
liberty is of inherent value

[2:05:02]
or instrumental value.
Is liberty good in and of
itself or is liberty good
because it allows you
to achieve X, Y or Z?
And, I've thought about this one a lot,
and I tend to come down on
the latter side of the aisle.
I mean this is,
you asked me areas where I moved,
this may be an area where I've moved.

[2:05:15]
Is that I think when you think
more shallowly about politics
or maybe more quickly because
this is how we talk in America
is about liberties and rights.
We tend to think that the right
is what make, not like
the political right,
rights make things good,
liberties make things good.
The question really is
what are those rights and liberties for?

[2:05:30]
- [Lex] Yeah.
- Now, you have to be careful,
so that that doesn't shade into tyranny.
You can only have liberty to do the thing
that I say that you can do.
But, there have to be spheres
of liberty that are roiling
and interesting and filled with debate,
but without threatening
the chief institutions

[2:05:46]
that surround those liberties.
Because if you destroy the institutions,
liberties will go too.
If you knock down the
pillars of the society,
the liberties that are
on top of those pillars
are going to collapse.
And, I think if people
are feeling as though
we're on the verge tyranny,
I think that's why.
- This is fascinating by the way.

[2:06:00]
It's an instrumental
perspective on liberty
that's gonna give me a lot to think about.
Let me ask a personal question.
Was there ever a time that
you had a crisis of faith,
where you questioned your belief in God?
- Sure, and I would,

[2:06:16]
less call it a crisis of faith,
and an ongoing question of faith;
which I think is,
I hope most religious people.
The word Israel, right, in Hebrew,
Israel means to struggle with God.
That's literally what the word means.
And so, the idea of struggling with God.

[2:06:33]
Where if you're Jewish or Bene Israel,
the idea of struggling
with God I think is endemic
to the human condition.
If you understand what God's doing,
then I think you're wrong.
And, if you think that that
question doesn't matter,

[2:06:45]
then I think you're also wrong.
I think that God is a
very necessary hypothesis.
- So struggle, the
struggle with God is life.
That is the process of life?
- That's right, because
you're never gonna get to that
answer otherwise your God, and you aren't.
- Why does God allow cruelty
and suffering in the world?

[2:07:00]
One of the tough questions.
- So we're going deep here.
There's two types of
cruelty and suffering.
So if we're talking about
human cruelty and suffering,
because God does not
intervene to prevent people
from exercising their free will
because to do so would be
to deprive human beings

[2:07:16]
of the choice that makes them human.
This is the sin of the
garden of Eden, basically.
Is that God could make you an angel,
in which case you wouldn't have the choice
to do the wrong thing.
But, so long as we are going
to allow for cause and effect
in a universe shaped by your choice,

[2:07:31]
cruelty and evil are going to exist.
And then, there's the question
of just the natural cruelty
and vicissitudes of life.
And, the answer there is I
think that God obscures himself.
I think that if God were to
appear in all of his glory
to people on a regular basis,

[2:07:45]
I think that would make faith,
you wouldn't need it.
There'd be no such thing as faith.
It would just be reality.
Nobody has to prove to you
that the sun rises every day.
But, if God is to allow us
the choice to believe in Him,
which is the ultimate choice
from a religious point of view,

[2:08:01]
then He's gonna have to
obscure himself behind tragedy
and horror and all those other things.
I mean, this is a fairly well
known capitalistic concept
called tzimtzum in Judaism;
which is the idea that when
God created the universe,
He sort of withdrew in order to make space
for all of these things to happen.

[2:08:16]
- So God doesn't have a
instrumental perspective on liberty?
- Right, in a chief sense,
He does because the best use of liberty
is going to be belief in Him.
And you can misuse your liberty, right?
There will be consequences

[2:08:30]
if you believe in an afterlife
or if you believe in sort of
a generalized better version
of life led by faith, then
liberty does have a purpose.
But, He also believes that
you have to give people,
from a cosmic perspective,
the liberty to do wrong
without threatening
all the institutions of society.

[2:08:46]
I mean, that's why it
does say in the Bible
that if man sheds blood by man,
shall his blood be shed, right.
That there are punishments,
that are in biblical
thought for doing things
that are wrong.
- So for a human being who
lacks the faith in God.
So if you're an atheist, can
you still be a good person?

[2:09:02]
- Of course, 100%.
And there are a lot of religious people
who are crappy people.
- How do I understand that tension?
- Well, from a religious perspective,
what you would say is that it
is perfectly plausible to live
in accordance with a set
of rules that don't damage

[2:09:15]
other people without believing in God.
You just might be understanding the reason
for doing that wrong, is what
a religious person would say.
This is the conversation,
again, that I had with Sam.
Basically, is you and I
agree, I said this to Sam,
"You and I agree nearly everything
"When it comes to morality.
"Like we probably disagree
on 15 to 20% of things.

[2:09:31]
"The other 80% is because you grew up
"In a Judeo Christian society and so do I.
"And we grew up 10 miles from each other,
"Around the turn of the millennium."
So there's that.
So you can perfectly well be an atheist
living a good moral decent life

[2:09:45]
because you can live a
good moral decent life
with regard to other people
without believing in God.
I don't think you can
build a society on that
because I think that that relies on
the sort of
goodness of mankind.
Natural goodness of mankind.
I don't believe in the
natural goodness of mankind.
- [Lex] You don't?
- No, I believe that man was created

[2:10:01]
both sinful and with the capacity for sin,
and the capacity for good.
- But, if you let them
be on their own, doesn't-
- Without social
institutions to shape them,
I think that that's very
likely to go poorly.
- Oh, interesting.
Well, we came to something we
disagree on, but that may be,

[2:10:18]
that might reflect itself in our approach
to Twitter as well.
(hearty laughing)
I think if humans are left on their own,
they tend towards good.
They definitely have the
capacity for good and evil.

[2:10:31]
But, when left on their own,
I tend to believe they're good.
- I think they might be good with limits.
What I mean by that is
that what the evidence
I think tends to show
is that human beings are quite tribal.
So what you'll end up with
is people who are good

[2:10:45]
with their immediate family,
and maybe their immediate neighbors.
And, then when they're
threatened by an outside tribe,
then they kill everyone.
Which is sort of the
history of civilization
in the pre-civilizational era;
which was a very violent time.
Pre-civilizational era was quite violent.
- Do you think on the topic of tribalism

[2:11:00]
in our modern world,
what are the pros and cons of tribes?
Is that something
where we should try to
outgrow as a civilization?
- I don't think it's
ever gonna be possible
to fully outgrow tribalism.
I think it's a natural human condition
to want to be with
people who think like you

[2:11:17]
or have a common set of beliefs.
And, I think trying to obliterate
that in the name of a universalism,
likely leads to utopian results
that have devastating consequences.
Utopian sort of universalism
has been failing every time

[2:11:30]
it's tried, whether
you're talking about now
it seems to be sort of
a liberal universalism;
which is being rejected
by a huge number of people
around the world in
various different cultures.
Or you're talking about
religious universalism,
which typically comes
with religious tyranny
or they're talking about communistic

[2:11:45]
or Nazistic sort of universalism,
which comes with mass slaughter.
So this is, universalism,
I'm not a believer in.
I think that you have some values
that are fairly limited,
that all human beings
should hold in common,
and that's pretty much it.

[2:12:01]
I think that everybody
should have the ability
to join with their own culture.
I think how we define
tribes is a different thing.
So I think that tribes
should not be defined
by innate physical
characteristics, for example.
Because I think that, thank God,

[2:12:15]
as a civilization we've outgrown that.
And I think that that is a
childish way to view the world.
And, all the tall people aren't a tribe.
All the black people aren't,
all the white people aren't a tribe.
- So the tribes should
be formed over ideas
versus physical characteristic?
- That's right, which is why,

[2:12:30]
actually to go back to
sort of the beginning
of the conversation when it comes to Jews,
I'm not a big believer in ethnic Judaism.
As a person who takes Judaism seriously.
Judaism is more to me than
you were born with a last name
like Berg or Stein.

[2:12:45]
And so I-
- Hitler would disagree with you.
- He would disagree with me.
But that's 'cause he was a tribalist.
Who thought in racial terms.
- So maybe robots will help
us see humans as one tribe,
maybe that, as long as-
- This is Reagan's idea, right?
Reagan said, "Well, if
there's an alien invasion,
"Then we'll all be on the same side.

[2:13:00]
"So I'll go over to the Soviets
and we'll talk about it."
- There's some deep truth to that.
What does it mean to be a good man?
The various role that
a human being takes on
in this role theory that
you've spoken about.
What does it mean to be good?

[2:13:17]
- It means to perform,
now I will do Aristotle.
It means to perform the function well.
What Aristotle says is the
good, is not like moral good,
moral evil, in the way that
we tend to think about it.
He meant that a good cup holds liquid,

[2:13:31]
a good spoon holds soup.
It means that, a thing that is broken
can't hold those things, right?
So the idea of being a good
person means that you are
fulfilling the function
for which you were made.
It's a teleological view of humanity.
So if you're a good father,

[2:13:45]
this means that you are bringing
up your child in durable
values that is going to
bring them up healthy,
capable of protecting
themselves and passing on
the traditional wisdom of the ages
to future generations;
while allowing for the
capacity for innovation.
That'd be being a good father.
Being a good spouse would
mean protecting and unifying

[2:14:01]
with your spouse and
building a safe family,
and a place to raise children.
Being a good citizen of your community
means protecting the fellow
citizens of your community;
while incentivizing them
to build for themselves.

[2:14:15]
And, it becomes actually much
easier to think of how to,
this is why I like the role
theory because it's very hard,
since in sort of in virtue theory,
to say be generous.
How does that manifest?
I don't know.
I don't know what that looks like.
Sometimes being generous
might being not generous
to other people.

[2:14:30]
When Aristotle says that
you should be benevolent,
what does that mean?
This is very vague.
When I say be a good dad,
most people sort of have
a gut level understanding
of what it means to be a good dad.
And mostly, they have a
gut level understanding
of what it means to be a really bad dad.
And so, what it means to be a
good man is to fulfill those

[2:14:45]
roles as many of them as you can,
properly and at full function.
And that's a very hard job.
And I've said before that,
because I engage a lot with
the public and all of this,
the word great comes up a lot.
What is it to be a great leader?
What is it to be a great person?
And I've always said to people,
it's actually fairly easy to be great.

[2:15:01]
It's very difficult to be good.
There are a lot of very great
people, who are not very good,
and they're not a lot of good people.
And most of them,
frankly, most good people
die mourned by their family and friends.
And two generations
later, they're forgotten.
But, those are the people who
incrementally move the ball

[2:15:16]
forward in the world sometimes
much more than the people
who are considered great.
- Understand the role in your
life that involves being a cup
and be damn good at it.
- Exactly, that's right.
- [Lex] Hold the soup, it's very-
- Jordan Peterson.

[2:15:30]
- Yeah, it's like lobster
with Jordan Peterson.
- [Ben] Exactly, exactly.
I think people quote
you for years and years
to come on that.
What advice would you give,
a lot of young people look up to you,
what advice, despite
their better judgment.
No, I'm just kidding.
(hearty laughing)

[2:15:45]
Only kidding, only kidding.
They seriously look up to
you and draw inspiration
from your ideas, from your bold thinking.
What advice would you give to them?
How to live a life worth living?
How to have a career
they can be proud of and
everything like that?

[2:16:04]
- Live out the values that you think
are really important
and seek those values in others,
would be the first piece of advice.
Second piece of advice,
don't go on Twitter until you're 26.
- Why 26?
- Because your brain is fully
developed at that point.

[2:16:18]
As I said early on,
I was on social media and writing columns
from the time I was 17.
It was a great opportunity.
And as it turns out,
a great temptation to say
enormous numbers of stupid things.
When you're young,
you're kind of trying out ideas

[2:16:30]
and you're putting them on,
you're taking them off.
And, social media
permenatizes those things
and engraves them in stone,
and then that's used against
you for the rest of your life.
So I tell young people this all the time,
if you wanna be on social
media, be on social media,
but don't post, watch.
If you wanna take in
information, more importantly,
you should read books.

[2:16:45]
As far as other advice,
I'd say engage in your community.
There's no substitute for
engaging in your community,
and engage in interpersonal action
because that that will soften you
and make you a better person.
I've become a better
person since I got married.
I've become an even better
person since I've had kids.

[2:17:01]
So you can imagine how terrible I was
before all these things.
Engaging your community does allow you
to build the things that matter
on the most local possible level.
The outcome, by the way,
of the sort of the politics
of fulfillment that I
was talking about earlier

[2:17:15]
is a lot of localism.
Because the roles that I'm talking about
are largely local roles.
So that stuff has to be protected locally.
I think we focus way too much
in this country and others,
on world beating solutions,
national solutions,
solutions that apply to
hundreds of millions of people.
How about we get to the solutions
that apply for like five?

[2:17:31]
And then we get to the
solutions that apply to like 20,
and then we get to the solutions
that involve 200 people
or a thousand people.
Let's solve that stuff.
And I think the solutions
at the higher level
flow bottom up, not top down.
- What about mentors
and maybe role models?

[2:17:45]
Have you had a mentor or
maybe people you look up to,
either you interacted on a local scale,
you actually knew them or
somebody you really looked up to?
- For me, I'm very lucky.
I grew up in a very solid
two-parent household.
I'm extremely close with my parents.
I've lived near my parents
literally my entire life,

[2:18:00]
with the exception of
three years of law school.
Right now, they live a
mile and a half from us.
- What'd you learn from about life
from your parents and your father?
- Oh man, so many things from my parents.

[2:18:16]
- [Lex] Good and bad.
- That's a hard one.
I mean, I think the good stuff from my dad
is that you should hold
true to your values.
He's very big on, you have values.
The values are important
and hold true to them.
- Did you understand what your values are?
What your principles are early on?
- Fairly quickly, yeah.

[2:18:31]
And so, he was very big on that,
which is why, for example,
I get asked a lot in the Jewish community,
why I wear a kippah.
And the answer is,
it never occurred to me
to take off the kippah.
I always wore it.
Why would I take it off at any point?
That's the life that I wanna live.
And, that's the way it is.

[2:18:46]
So that was a big one from my dad.
From my mom, practicality.
My dad is more of a dreamer.
My mom is much more practical.
And so, the sort of lessons that I learned
from my dad are that you can have,
the counter lesson is that
you can have a good idea,
but if you don't have a
plan for implementation,

[2:19:01]
then it doesn't end up as reality.
And I think actually he's learned that
better over the course of his life too.
But, my dad from the
time I was very young,
he wanted me to engage with other adults
and he wanted me to
learn from other people.
And, one of his rules was
if he didn't know something,

[2:19:15]
he would find somebody who
he thought did know the thing
for me to talk to.
That was a big thing.
So, I'm very lucky.
I have wonderful parents.
As far as sort of other mentors,
in terms of the media, Andrew
Breitbart was, was a mentor.
Andrew, obviously, he was kind
of known in his latter days,

[2:19:30]
I think more for the militancy
than when I was very close with him.
- So for somebody like me who doesn't,
who knows more about the militancy.
Can you tell me what
makes him a great man?
- What made Andrew great is
that he engaged with everyone.

[2:19:45]
I mean, everyone.
So there are videos of him
rollerblading down the boulevard,
and people would be protesting,
and he would literally
roller blade up to them
and he would say,
"Let's go to lunch together."
And, he would just do this.
That's actually who Andrew was.
- What was the thinking behind that?
- That's who he was.

[2:20:00]
He was just garrulous.
He was much more outgoing
than I am actually.
He was very warm with people.
Like for me, I would say that with Andrew,
I knew Andrew for, let's
say I met him when I was 16.
He passed away when I would've been 28.
So I knew Andrew for 10, 12 years.

[2:20:17]
And people who met Andrew
for about 10 minutes
knew Andrew 99% as well as I knew Andrew
because he was just all out front.
Everything was out here.
And, he loved talking to people.
He loved engaging with people.

[2:20:30]
And so, this made him a lot
of fun and unpredictable,
and fun to watch and all of that.
And then, I think Twitter got to him.
Twitter is one of the
lessons I learned from Andrew
is the counter lesson.
Which is Twitter can poison you.
Twitter can really wreck you.
If you spend all day on Twitter,
reading the comments and
getting angry at people

[2:20:45]
who are talking about you,
it becomes a very difficult life.
And I think that, in the
last year of his life,
Andrew got very caught up in that
because of a series of
sort of circumstances.
- It can actually affect your mind.
It can actually make you resentful.
All that kind of stuff.
- I tend to agree with that.
But, the lesson that I
learned from Andrew is

[2:21:01]
engage with everybody.
Take joy in sort of the
mission that you're given.
And, you can't always fulfill that.
Sometimes, it's really
rough and difficult.
I'm not gonna pretend that it's all fun
and rainbows all the time,
'cause it isn't.
And some of the stuff that I
have to cover I don't like,

[2:21:15]
and some of the things I have to say,
I don't particularly like.
That happens.
But, that's what I learned from Andrew.
As far as sort of other mentors,
I had some teachers when I was a kid,
who said things that stuck with me.
I had fourth grade teacher
named Ms. Genetty who said,

[2:21:30]
"Don't let potential be
written on your tombstone."
Which is a pretty...
- That's a good line.
- It's a great line,
particularly to a fourth grader.
There was guy, an 11th
grade English teacher
named Anthony Miller, who was
terrific, really good writer.
He had studied with James Joyce

[2:21:45]
at Trinity College in Dublin.
And so, he and I really got along.
And, he helped my writing a lot.
- Did you ever have doubt in yourself?
Especially, as you gotten
into the public eye
with all the attacks.
Did you ever doubt your
ability to stay strong,
to be able to be a voice of the ideas

[2:22:01]
that you represent?
- Definitely, I don't
doubt my ability to say
what I wanna say.
I doubt my ability to handle
the emotional blow back
of saying it.
Meaning that, that's difficult.
I mean, again, to take just one example.
In 2016, the ADL measured that
I was the number one target

[2:22:17]
of antisemitism on planet Earth.
That's not fun, that's unpleasant.
And when you take critiques,
not from Antisemites,
but when you take critiques
from people generally,
we talked about near the beginning,
how you surround yourself with people

[2:22:31]
who are gonna give you good feedback.
Sometimes it's hard to tell.
Sometimes people are giving you feedback
and you don't know whether
it's well motivated
or poorly motivated.
And if you are trying
to be a decent person,
you can't cut off the
mechanism of feedback.
And so, what that means is
sometimes you take to
heart the wrong thing

[2:22:45]
or you take it to heart too much,
you're not light enough about it.
You take it very, very seriously.
You lose sleep over it.
Man, I can't tell you the number of nights
where I've just not slept
because of some critique
somebody's made of me.
And I've thought to
myself, maybe that's right.
And sometimes it is right.

[2:23:00]
- Some of that is good to
stew in that criticism,
but some of that can destroy you.
Do you have a shortcut?
So Rogan has talked about
taking a lot of mushrooms.
Since you're not into the mushroom thing.
What's your escape from that?
Like when you get low,

[2:23:16]
when you can't sleep?
- Usually writing is a big one for me.
The writing for me is cathartic.
I love writing that.
That is a huge one.
Spending time with my family.
Again, I usually have a
close circle of friends,
who I will talk with

[2:23:30]
in order to sort of
bounce ideas off of them.
And then, once I've kind
of talked it through,
I tend to feel a little bit better.
Exercise is also a big one.
I mean, if I go a few
days with that exercise,
I tend to get pretty
grumpy pretty quickly.
I gotta keep this six
pack going somehow, man.

[2:23:45]
(hearty laughing)
- There you and Rogan agree.
Well, we haven't, aside
from Twitter mentioned love.
What's the role of love
in the human condition?
Ben Shapiro.
- Man, don't get asked for love too much.
In fact, I was-

[2:24:02]
- [Lex] You don't get that
question on college campuses?
- No, I typically don't, actually.
In fact, we were at an event recently,
it was a Daily Wire event,
and in the middle of this event,
was a meet and greet with
some of the audience.
And, in the middle of this event,
this guy walks by with this girl.

[2:24:16]
They're talking and they're talking to me
and their time kind of runs,
the security's moving them.
And he says, "No, no, no, wait.
"Hold on a minute."
And he gets down on one knee
and he proposes to the girl
in front of me.
And I said to him,
"This is the weirdest
proposal in human history.
"What, what, what is happening right now?
"I was your choice of cupid here?"

[2:24:31]
He said, "Well, you know,
"We actually like got together
"'Cause we listened to your show."
And I said,
"I can perform it like a
Jewish marriage right now.
"We're gonna need like a glass,
we're gonna need some wine.
"It's gonna get weird real fast."
But yeah, so love doctor.
I'm typically not asked too much about.

[2:24:46]
The role of love
is important in binding
together human beings,
who ought to be bound together.
And the role of respect is
even more important in binding
together broader groups of people.

[2:25:00]
I think one of the mistakes
that we make in politics
is trying to substitute love for respect
or respect for love.
And, I think that's a big mistake.
So I do not bear tremendous love
in the same sense that I do for my family,
for random strangers.
I don't, I love my family.
I love my kids.
Anybody who tells you they love your kid

[2:25:16]
as much as you love your kid
is lying to you.
It's not true.
I love my community more than
I love other communities.
I love my state more
than I love other states.
I love my country more than
I love other countries.
That's all normal and that's all good.
The problem of empathy

[2:25:30]
can be when that becomes so tight knit
that you're not outward looking,
that you don't actually have
respect for other people.
So in the local level,
you need love in order to
protect you and shield you,
and give you the strength to go forward.
And then beyond that,
you need a lot of respect for people
who are not in the circle of love.

[2:25:46]
And I think trying to
extend love to people
who either are not gonna love you back
or are gonna slap you in the face for it,
or who you're just not that close to.
It runs the risk of
being arsehats and fake.

[2:26:01]
Or it can actually be
counterproductive in some senses.
- Well, there's some sense
in which you could have
love for other human beings
just based on the humanity
that connects everybody.
So you love this whole project

[2:26:17]
that we're a part of
and actually, sort of another
thing, we disagree on.
So loving a stranger,
like having that basic empathy
and compassion towards a stranger,

[2:26:30]
even if it can hurt you,
I think it's ultimately...
That to me is what it
means to be a good man.
To live a good life is
to have that compassion
towards strangers.
'Cause to me, it's almost,
it's easy and natural and obvious

[2:26:47]
to love people close to you.
But, to step outside
yourself and to love others.
I think that's the
fabric of a good society.
You don't think there's value to that?
- I think there can be,
but I think we're also discussing love
almost in two different senses.

[2:27:00]
Meaning that when I talk about love,
what I think of immediately
is the love I bear for my wife
and kids or my parents or my siblings.
- [Lex] What about friendship?
- Or the love of my close friends.
But, I think
that using that same term
to describe how I feel

[2:27:16]
about strangers, I think
would just be inaccurate.
And so, that's why I'm
suggesting that respect
might be a more solid
and realistic foundation for
the way that we treat people
far away from us or
people who are strangers.
Respect for their dignity,
respect for their priorities,

[2:27:30]
respect for their role in life.
It might be too much of
an ask, in other words.
There might be the rare human being
who's capable of literally
loving a homeless man
on the street the way they
he loves his own family.
But, if you respect the
homeless man on the street,
the way that you respect your own family,

[2:27:46]
because everyone is deserved,
everyone deserves that respect.
I think that you get to the same end
without forcing people into a position
of unrealistically expecting themselves
to feel a thing they don't feel.
One of the big questions in religion

[2:28:00]
that comes up is God
makes certain requests
that you feel certain ways.
You're supposed to be (indistinct).
happy about certain things
or you're supposed to love
thy neighbor as thyself.
You'll notice that in that statement,
it's thy neighbor.
It's not just like generally anyone.

[2:28:15]
It's love thy neighbors, in any case.
- I think that extends to
anyone that follows you
on Twitter, thy neighbor,
because God anticipated
the social network aspect
that is not constrained by geography.
- Yeah, I'm gonna differ with
you on the interpretation
on that, but in any case.

[2:28:32]
The kind of extension of
love outwards might be too big an ask.
So maybe we can start with respect
and then hopefully out
of that respect can grow
something more,
if people earn their way in.

[2:28:45]
'Cause I think that
one of the big problems
when we were talking about universalism
is when people say,
"I'm a world citizen.
"I love people of the other country.
"As much as I love myself or
as much as I love my country."
It tends to actually lead to,
and almost cram down utopianism.
That, I think can be kind of difficult

[2:29:01]
because with love
comes a certain expectation of solidarity.
And I think,
when you love your family,
you love your wife,
there's a certain level of
solidarity that is required
inside the home in order to preserve
the most loving kind of home.
And so, if you love everybody,

[2:29:16]
then that sort of implies a
certain level of solidarity
that may not exist.
So maybe the idea is for me,
start with respect,
and then maybe as people
respect each other more,
then love is an outgrowth of
that as opposed to starting
with love and then hoping
that respect develops.
- Yeah, there's a danger
that that word becomes empty

[2:29:30]
and instead is used for
dogmatic kind of utopianism.
- I mean, this is the
way that, for example,
religious theocracies very often work.
We love you so much,
we have to convert you.
- So let's start with respect.
What I would love to see
after our conversation today,

[2:29:48]
is to see a Ben Shapiro
that continues the growth on Twitter
of being even more respectful
than you've already been.
And maybe one day, converting
that into love on Twitter.
If I could see that in this world,

[2:30:01]
that would make me die a happy man.
- [Ben] Wow.
- A little bit more.
- If I can make that happen for you.
- Love in the world, for
me, as a gift, for me.
- I'll try to make that happen.
I do have one question, I'm
gonna need you to tell me.
Which jokes are okay?

[2:30:15]
Are jokes still okay?
- So yeah, can I just run
your Twitter from now on?
You just send it to me.
- 100%, I will pre-screen you the jokes,
and you can tell me if
this is a loving joke
or if this is a hate filled.
- People will be very surprised
by the all the heart emojis
