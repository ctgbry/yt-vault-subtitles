first of all the astronauts that went to
the moon allegedly they uh wore omegas
but uh also it's a it doesn't have the
same sort of cachet value as rolex's or
a lot of like the a lot of like the
people that have a peripheral
understanding of watches yeah but

understanding of watches yeah but
they're fucking phenomenal watches they
make amazing watches i have a bunch of
omegas i love them but that is my
favorite watch and you have my favorite
watch now

thing i think a watch could add his
perspective on our like the cosmic scale

[01:46]
perspective on our like the cosmic scale
that's why i like that watch and that's
why i think you should have it because i
would look that watch and i would say
this is where we are right now with the
moon cycle yeah and when it comes full
moon like right now it's just kind of
like a little it's probably a quarter
moon or something like that yeah yeah
well when it comes full noon you'll get

a real sense
of what it actually looks like because
it's beautiful it's a beautiful high
resolution image of the moon with like
little stars behind it

like
engineering that's what i like i'm a fan
of engineering and what i like about

[02:30]
of engineering and what i like about
that watch is the engineering behind it
is that there is a mechanical watch
meaning the time is kept within like a
second or two
i don't know what it is like a day or i
forget what it is but also with a
complication this is crazy complication

[02:46]
complication this is crazy complication
that shows the moon rising across and
when the when it goes dark and this i
know when i can go outside to see the
stars because i look at my watch and
when my watch shows me no moon that's
when i go outside on my deck
because when i go outside of my deck i

[03:00]

know i'm just gonna see nothing but
stars and no moon at all no light
pollution just beautiful stars in the
sky
