- Hey, Lex. My name is Andrew,
I lead the Google Beam team,
and we're going to show you
a demo today.
- Whoa, okay.
- Okay, Lex. Here we are. All right.
- This is real already.
Wow!
- This is real.
Good to see you. This is Google Beam.
- So you can feel the depth of this.

[00:16]
- Yeah, great to meet you.
- Wow.
Wow. So for people,
probably can't even imagine
what this looks like, there's
a 3D version, it looks real.
You look real.
- Yeah, it looks real to me,
it looks real to you.
- It looks like you're
coming out of the screen.
So I saw demos of this,

[00:31]
but they don't come close
to the experience of this.
I think one of the top YouTube comments
on one of the demos I saw was like,
"Why would I want a high definition?
I'm trying to turn off the camera."
But this actually is,
this feels like the
camera has been turned off
and we're just in the same room together.

[00:45]
This is really compelling.
- That's right. I know it's
kind of late in the day too,
so I brought you a snack
just in case you're a
little bit hungry, but.
- So, can you push it farther
and it just becomes out?
- Yeah, let's try to float
it between the rooms.
You know, it kind of fades it
from my room into your room.
- And then you see my hand,

[01:01]
the depth of my hand.
- Yeah, of course. Yes.
- Wow.
- Of course. Yeah.
It feels like you, try this,
try to give me a high five,
and there's almost a
sensation of feeling touched.
- Yeah.
- You almost feel.
- Yes.
- Because you're so attuned
to, you know, that should be a high five,
feeling like you could connect
with somebody that way.
So it's kind of a magical experience.

[01:15]
- Oh, this is really nice.
How much does it cost?
There's nothing, I'm not wearing anything.
Well, I'm wearing a suit and tie.
- I don't think so.
- To clarify.
I'm wearing clothes. This is not CGI.
- There's two things.
Two really hard things
that we put together.

[01:31]
One is a AI video model.
So there's a set of cameras,
you asked kind of about those earlier.
There's six color cameras,
just like webcams that we have today,
taking video streams and
feeding them into our AI model
and turning that into a
3D video of you and I.

[01:45]
It's effectively a light field.
So it's kind of an interactive 3D video
you can see from any perspective.
That's transmitted over
to the second thing,
and that's a light field display.
And it's happening bidirectionally.
I see you and you see me, both
in our light field displays.
These are effectively flat
televisions or flat displays,

[02:03]
but they have the sense
of dimensionality, depth.
Size is correct.
You can see shadows and
lighting are correct.
And everything is correct
from your vantage point.
So if you move around ever
so slightly and I hold still,

[02:16]
you see a different perspective here.
You see kind of things that
were occluded, become revealed.
You see shadows that, you know,
move in the way they should move.
All of that's computed and generated
using our AI video model for you.
It's based on your eye position.
Where does the right
scene need to be placed

[02:31]
in this light field display
for you just to feel present.
- It's real-time, no latency.
I'm not seeing, you
weren't freezing up at all.
- No, no, I hope not.
I think it's you and
I together, real-time.
That's what you need
for real communication.
And at a quality level.
- This is awesome!
