so if aliens do alien species were to
make contact forgive me for staying and
aliens for a bit longer do you think
they're more likely to be friendly to
befriend us or to destroy us
well I think for the most part our
they'll pretty much ignore us if you
were deer in the forest who do you fear

than that we have nothing to offer them
I mean think about it for a moment

I mean think about it for a moment
people love Shakespeare and they love
the arts and poetry but outside of the
earth they mean nothing absolutely
nothing I mean when I write down an
equation is strings
I would hope that on the other side of
the galaxy there's an alien writing down
that very same equation in different
notation but that alien on the other
side of the galaxy
Shakespeare poetry Hemingway it would be
nothing to him or her or it
