[00:00]
the following is a conversation with
Jordan Peterson his second time on this
The Lex fredman
podcast you have given a set of lectures
on ni as part of the new Peterson
Academy and the lectures were powerful
there's some element of the
contradictions the tensions the drama
the way you like lock in on an idea but
then are struggling with that idea all
of that that feels like it's a it's a
nich and yeah well he has a big
influence on me stylistically and
like in terms of the way I approached
writing and also many of the people that
were other influences of mine were very
influenced by him so I was blown away
when I first came across his writings
there're
so they're so uh intellectually dense
that I don't know if there's anything
that approximates that dovi maybe
although he's much more wordy nich is
very succin partly cuz he was so ill CU

[01:00]
very succin partly cuz he was so ill CU
he would think all day he couldn't spend
a lot of time writing and he condens his
writings into very short while this
aphoristic style he had and it's it's
really something to strive for and and
then he's also an exciting writer like
dovi and and dynamic and and romantic in
that emotional way and so it's really
something and I really enjoyed doing the
I did that lecture that you described
that lecture series is on the first half
of Beyond Good and Evil which is a
stunning book and uh
that was really fun to take pieces of it
and then to describe what they mean and
how they've echoed across the decades
since he wrote them and yeah it's been
great taking each sentence seriously and
deconstructing it and really struggling
with it I think underpinning that
approach to writing requires deep
respect for the person I think if we
approach writing with that kind of
respect you can take Orwell you can take
a lot of writers and really d again on

[02:00]
a lot of writers and really d again on
singular sentences yeah well those are
the great writers because the greatest
writers virtually everything they wrote
is worth attending to know and and I
think nich is in some ways the ultimate
Exemplar of that
because often when I read a book I'll
mark one way or another I often fold the
corner of the page over to indicate
something that I've found that's worth
remembering I couldn't do that with a
book like Beyond Good and Evil because
every page ends up marked and and that's
in marked contrast so to speak to many
of the books I read now where it's it's
it's quite frequently now that I'll read
a book and there won't be an idea in it
that I haven't come across before and
with a thinker like n that's just not
the case at the sentence level and I
don't think there's anyone that I know
of who did that to a greater extent than
he did so there's other people who whose
thought is of equivalent value I've I've
returned recently and I'm going to do a
course on to the work of this Romanian

[03:01]
course on to the work of this Romanian
historian of religion mer elata who's
not nearly as well known as he should be
and whose work by the way is a real
antidote to the postmodern nihilistic
Marxist stream of literary
interpretation that the universities as
a whole have adopted and ilad is like
that too I I was I used this book called
The Sacred and the profane quite
extensively in a book that I'm releasing
in mid November we who wrestle with God
and it's of the same sort it it it's
endlessly
analyzable I had to walked through the
whole history of religious ideas and he
had the intellect that enabled him to do
that and everything he wrote is dream
dream likee in its density
so every sentence or paragraph is
evocative in an imager Manner and that
also what would you say deepens and
broadens the scope and that's part of

[04:00]
broadens the scope and that's part of
often what distinguishes writing that
has a literary end from writing that's
more merely technical like the literary
writings have this imagistic and
dreamlike reference space around them
and it takes a it takes a long time to
turn a complex image into something
semantic and so if your writing evokes
deep imagery it has a depth that can't
be captured merely in words and the
great romantic poetic philosophers n has
a very good example dovi is a good
example so is mer El they have that
quality and it's a good way of thinking
about it you know it's kind of
interesting from the perspective of
technical analysis of intelligence
there's a good book called the user
illusion which is the best book on
Consciousness that I ever read it
explains the manner in which our
communication is understandable in this
manner so imagine that when you're
communicating something you're trying to
change the way that your target audience
perceives and acts in the world so

[05:00]
perceives and acts in the world so
that's an embodied issue and but you're
using words which aren't when obviously
aren't equivalent to the actions
themselves you can imagine that the
words are surrounded by a cloud of
images that they evoke and that the
images can be translated into actions
yeah and and the greatest writing uses
words in a manner that evokes images
that profoundly affects perception and
action and that's the so I would take
the manner in which I act and behave I
would translate that into a set of
images my dreams do that for me for
example then I compress them into words
I toss you the words you decompose them
decompress them into the images and then
into the actions and that's what happens
in a meaningful conversation it's a very
good way of understanding how we
communicate linguistically so if the
words spring to the visual full visual
complexity and then that can then
transform itself into action that's and

[06:00]
transform itself into action that's and
change in perception and because per
well those are both relevant and it's an
important thing to understand because
the classic empiricists make the
presumption and it's an erroneous
that perception is a value-free
Enterprise and they assume that partly
because they think of perception as
something passive you know you just turn
your head and you look at the world and
there it is it's like perception is not
passive there is no perception without
action ever ever and that's a weird
thing to understand because even when
you're looking at something like your
eyes are moving back and forth if they
ever stop moving for a tenth of a second
you stop being able to see so your eyes
are jiggling back and forth just to keep
them active and then there's involuntary
movements of your eyes and then there's
voluntary movements of your eyes like
what you're doing with your eyes is very
much like what a blind person would do
if they were feeling out the Contours of
a object you're sampling and you're only
sampling a small element of the space
that's in front of you and the element

[07:01]
that's in front of you and the element
that you choose to sample is dependent
on your aims and your goals so it's
value saturated and so all your
perceptions are action predicated and
partly what you're doing when you're
communicating is therefore not only
changing people's actions let's say but
you're also changing the the strategy
that they use to perceive and so you
change the way the world reveals itself
for them see this is why it's such a
profound experience to read a
particularly deep thinker because you
could also think of your perceptions as
the axioms of your thought that's a good
way of thinking about it a perception is
like a what would you say it's a thought
that's so set in concrete that you now
see it rather than conceptualize it a a
really profound thinker changes the way
you perceive the world that's way deeper
than just how you think about it or how
you feel about it what about not just
profound thinkers but thinkers that
deliver a powerful idea for example
utopian ideas of Marx or utopian

[08:00]
utopian ideas of Marx or utopian
ideas you could say dystopian ideas of
Hitler those ideas are powerful and they
can saturate all your perception with
values and they they focus you in a way
where there's only a certain set of
actions yeah right even a certain set of
emotions as well and it's intense and
it's direct and they're so powerful that
they completely alter the perception and
the words bring to life yeah it's like a
form of possession so there's two things
you need to understand to make that
clear the
first issue is that as we suggested or
implied that perception is action
predicated but action is goal predicated
right the act towards goal
and these propagandistic thinkers that
you described they attempt to unify all
possible goals into a coherent
Singularity and there's advantages of
that there's advant the advantage of
Simplicity for for example which is a

[09:00]
Simplicity for for example which is a
major advantage and there's also the
advantage of motivation right so if you
provide people with a simp simple manner
of integrating all their actions you
decrease their anxiety and you increase
their motivation that can be a good
thing if the unifying idea that you put
forward is valid but it's the worst of
all possible ideas if you put forward an
invalid unifying idea and then you might
say well how do you distinguish between
a valid unifying idea and an invalid
unifying idea now was very interested in
that and I don't think he got that
exactly right but the postmodernists for
example especially the ones and this is
most of them with the Neo Marxist bent
their presumption is that the
fundamental unifying idea is power that
everything's about compulsion and force
essentially and that that's the only
true unifying ethos of mankind which is
I don't know if there's a worse idea
than that I mean there there are ideas
that are potentially as dangerous the
nihilistic idea is pretty dangerous

[10:01]
nihilistic idea is pretty dangerous
although it's more of a disintegrating
notion than a unifying idea the
hedonistic idea that you live for
pleasure for example that's also very
dangerous but if you wanted to go for
sheer pathology the notion that and this
is Fuko and a nutshell and marks for
that matter that power rules everything
not only is that a terrible unifying
idea but it it fully justifies your own
use of power and and I don't mean the
power nche talks about his will to power
was more his insistence that a human
being is an expression of will rather
than a mechanism of self- protection and
security like he thought of the life
force in human beings as something that
strived not to protect itself but to
exhaust itself in being and becoming
it's it's like a it's like an upward
oriented motivational Drive even towards
meaning now he called it the will to
power and that had some unfortunate
consequences at least that's how it's
translated but he didn't mean the power

[11:01]
translated but he didn't mean the power
motivation that people like fuku or Marx
was became so hung up on so it's not
power like you're trying to destroy the
other it's Power full flourishing of a
human being the creative force of a
human being that well you could imagine
that and and you should you could
imagine that you could segregate
competence and ability like imagine that
you and I were going to work on a
project we could organize our project in
relationship to the ambition that we
wanted to attain and we can organize an
agreement so that you were committed to
the project voluntarily and so that I
was committed to the project voluntarily
so that means that we would actually be
United in our perceptions and our
actions by the motivation of something
approximating voluntary play now you
could also imagine another situation
where I said here's our goal and uh you
better help me or I'm going to kill your
family well the probability is that you
would

[12:01]
would
be quite motivated to undertake my
bidding and so then you might say well
that's how the world works it's power
and compulsion but the truth of the
matter is that you can force people to
see things your way let's say but it's
nowhere near as good a strategy even
practically than the strategy of that
would be associated with something like
voluntary voluntary
joint agreement of pattern of movement
strategy towards a goal see this is such
an important thing to understand because
it it helps you start to understand the
distinction between a unifying force
that's based on Power and compulsion and
one that is much more in keeping I would
say with the ethos that governs western
western societies free western societies
there's really a qualitative difference
and it's not some morally relativistic
illusion so if we just look at the
Nuance of n's thought

[13:00]
Nuance of n's thought
uh the idea he first introduced And Thus
Spoke zaratustra of the Uber mench yeah
that's another one that's very easy to
misinterpret because it sounds awfully a
lot like it's about power yeah right for
example in the 20th century it was mis
represented and co-opted by Hitler to
advocate for the uh extermination of the
inferior non- Arian races yeah and the
Dominion of the superior Aryans yeah and
yeah well that was partly because n's
work also was misrepresented by his
sister after his death but definit but I
also think that there's a fundamental
flaw in that Nichi and
conceptualization so n of course
famously announced the death of God but
he did that in a manner that was
accompanied by Dire warnings like nich
said because people tend to think of
that as a triumphalist statement but n
actually said
that he really said something like the
unifying ethos under which we've
organized ourselves psychologically and

[14:01]
organized ourselves psychologically and
socially has now been fatally undermined
by well by the rationalist proclivity by
the empir empiricist proclivity there's
a variety of reasons mostly it was
conflict between the enlightenment view
let's say in the classic religious View
and and that there will be dire
consequences for that and N knew like
dovi knew that see there's a proclivity
for the human psyche and for human
societies to move towards something
approximating a Unity because the cost
of disunity is high fractionation of
your goals so that means you're less
motivated to move forward than you might
be because there's many things competing
for your attention and also anxiety
because anxiety actually signals
something like goal conflict so there's
an inescapable proclivity of value
systems to unite now if you kill the
thing that's uniting them that's the
death of God they either fractionate and
you get confusion anxiety and
hopelessness
or you get social disunity or and you

[15:02]
or you get social disunity or and you
get social disunity
or something else arises out of the
Abyss to constitute that unifying force
and N said specifically that he believe
that one of those manifestations would
be that of um communism and that that
would kill he said this in Will To Power
that that would kill tens of millions of
people in the upcoming 20th century I
keep he
he could see that coming 5050 years
earlier and dovi did the same thing in
his book the demons so this is the thing
that the a religious have to contend
with it's a real conundrum because I
mean you could dispute the idea that our
value systems tend towards a unity and
and and Society does as well because
otherwise we're disunified but the cost
of that disunity as I said is goal
confusion anxiety and hopelessness so
it's like a real cost so you could
dispense with the notion of unity
altogether and the postmodernists did

[16:00]
altogether and the postmodernists did
that to some degree but they pulled off
a slight of hand too where they replaced
it by power now n did he's responsible
for that to some degree because n said
with his conception of the Overman let's
say is that human beings would have to
create their own values because the
value structure that had descended from
on high was now shunted aside but
there's a major problem with that many
major problems the psychoanalysts were
the first people who really figured this
out after n because imagine that we
don't have
a relationship with the transcendental
anymore that orients us okay now we have
to turn to
ourselves okay now if we were a Unity a
clear Unity within ourselves let's say
then we could turn to ourselves for that
Discovery but if we're a fractionated
plurality internally then when we turn
to ourselves we have we turn to a
fractionated plurality well that was
Freud's observation it's like well how

[17:01]
Freud's observation it's like well how
can you make your own values when you're
not the master in your own house like
you're a war of competing motivations or
maybe you're someone who's dominated by
the will to force and compulsion and so
why do you think that you can rely on
yourself as the source of values and why
do you think you're wise enough to to
consult with yourself to find out what
those values are or what they should be
say in the course of a single life I
mean you know it's it's difficult to
organize your own personal relationship
ship like one relationship in the course
of your life let alone to try to imagine
that out of whole cloth you could
construct an ethos that would be
psychologically and socially stabilizing
and last over the long run it's like and
of course Marx people like that the the
the people who reduce human motivation
to a single axis they had the
intellectual hubus to imagine that they
could do that postmodernists are a good
example of that as well okay but if we
lay on the table religion
uh communism

[18:01]
uh communism
Nazism they are all unifying
ethos they're unifying ideas but they're
also horribly dividing ideas they both
unify and divide
religion has also divided people yeah
because in the nuances of
how uh the different peoples wrestle
with God they have come to different
conclusions and then they use those
conclusions or perhaps the people in
power use those conclusions to then
start wars to start hatred to divide
yeah well it's one of the key sub themes
in the gospels is the sub theme of uh
the Pharisees and so the the fundamental
enemies of Christ in the gospels are the
Pharisees and the scribes and the
lawyers so what does that mean the
Pharisees are religious
Hypocrites the scribes are academics who
worship their own intellect and the
lawyers are the legal Minds who use the
law as a weapon and so they're the enemy

[19:01]
law as a weapon and so they're the enemy
of the Redeemer that's the pl that's a
subplot in in in the gospel stories and
that actually all means something the
phic problem is that the best of all
possible ideas can be used by the worst
actors in the worst possible way and
maybe this is an existential conundrum
is that the most evil people use the
best possible ideas to the worst
possible ends and then you have the
conundrum of how do you separate out
let's say the genuine religious people
from those who use the religious
Enterprise only for their own
machinations we're seeing this happen
online like one of the things that
you're seeing happening online I'm sure
you've noticed this especially on the
right-wing troll right-wing Psychopathic
troll side of the distribution is the
weaponization of a certain form of
Christian idation and that's often
marked at least online by the presence
of what would you say cliches like
Christ is King which has a certain

[20:01]
Christ is King which has a certain
religious meaning but a completely
different meaning in this sphere of
emerging right-wing pathology right-wing
the political Dimension isn't the right
dimension of analysis but it's
definitely the case that the best
possible ideas can be used for the worst
possible purposes and that also brings
up another Spectre which is like well is
there any reliable and valid way of
distinguishing truly beneficial unifying
ideas from those that are pathological
and so that's another thing that I tried
to detail out in these lectures but also
in this new book it's like how do you
tell the good actors from The Bad actors
at the most fundamental level of
analysis and good ideas from the bad
ideas and you lecture on Truth they need
you also struggled with so how do you
know how do you know that communism is a
bad
idea versus it's a good idea implemented
by Bad
actors right right that's a more subtle
variant of the religious problem that's
what the that's what the Communists say

[21:00]
what the that's what the Communists say
all the time the modern day Communists
like real communism has never been tried
and you could say I suppose with some
justification you could say that real
Christianity has never been tried
because we always fall short of the
ideal Mark and
so I mean my rejoinder to the Communists
is something like every single time it's
been implemented wherever it's been
implemented regardless of the culture
and the background of the people who've
implemented it it's had exactly the same
catastrophic consequences it's like I
don't know how
many examples you need of that but I
believe we've generated sufficient
examples so that that case is basically
resolved now the general rejoinder to
that is it's really something like well
if I was in charge of the Communist
Enterprise the Utopia would have come
about right but that's also a form of
dangerous pretense part of the way see
that problem is actually resolved to
some degree in the notion of in the

[22:02]
some degree in the notion of in the
developing notion of sacrifice that
emerges in the western Canon over
thousands and thousands of years so one
of the suggestions for example and this
is something exemplified in the passion
story is that you can tell the valid
holder of an idea because that Holder
will take the responsibility for the
consequences of his idea onto
himself and that's why for example you
see one way of conceptualizing Christ in
the gospel story is as the ultimate
sacrifice to God so you might ask well
what's the ultimate sacrifice and there
there are variants of answer to that one
form of ultimate sacrifice is the
sacrifice of a child the offering of a
child and the other is the offering of
the self and the story of Christ brings
both of those together because he's the
son of God that's offered to God and so
it's a archetypal resolution of that
tension between ultimate sacrifice
ultimate because once you're a

[23:02]
ultimate because once you're a
parent most parents would rather
sacrifice themselves than their children
right so you have something that becomes
of even more value than yourself but the
sacrifice of self is also a very high
order level of sacrifice Christ is an
archetype of the pattern of being that's
predicated on the decision to take to
offer everything up to the highest value
right that pattern of
self-sacrifice and I think part of the
reason that's valid is
because the person who undertakes to do
that pays the price thems it's not
externalized they're not trying to
change anyone else except maybe by
example it's your problem that like soja
niton pointed that out too um when he
was struggling with the idea of good
versus evil and and you see this in more
sophisticated literature you know in
really unsophisticated literature or
drama there's a good guy and the bad guy
and the good guy guys all good and the

[24:00]
and the good guy guys all good and the
bad guys all bad and in more
sophisticated
literature the good and bad are
abstracted you can think of them as
spirits and then those Spirits possess
all the characters in The Complex drama
to a late greater or lesser degree and
that battle is fought out both socially
and internally in the high order
religious
conceptualizations in the west if they
culminate let's in the Christian Story
the notion is that battle between good
and evil is fundamentally played out as
an internal drama yeah so the uh for a
religious ethos the battle between good
and evil is fought within each
individual human heart right it's your
moral duty to constrain it to constrain
evil within yourself and well there's
more to it than that because there's
also the insistence
that if you do that that makes you the
more most effective possible
like Warrior let's say against evil

[25:01]
like Warrior let's say against evil
itself in the social world that you
start with the battle that occurs within
you in the soul let's say the soul
becomes the Battleground between the
forces of Good and Evil the idea there
there's an idea there too which is if
that battle is undertaken successfully
then it doesn't have to be played out in
the social world as actual conflict
right you can rectify the conflict
internally without it having to be
played out as fate as young put it so
what would you say to n who called
Christianity the slave
morality and his critique of religion in
that way was slave morality versus
Master morality and then you put in Uber
into that well that's that see I would
say that the woke phenomenon is the
manifestation of the slave morality that
n criticized and
that there are there are elements of
Christianity that can be Gerry banded to
support
that mod of perception and conception

[26:04]
that mod of perception and conception
but I think he was wrong in he was wrong
in his essential criticism of
Christianity in that regard now it's
complicated with nche because nche never
criticizes the gospel stories directly
what he basically criticizes is
something like the pathologies of
institutionalized religion and I would
say most particularly of
the what would you say
of the sort of casually too nice
Protestant form you know that's a a
thumbnail sketch and perhaps somewhat
unfair
but given the alignment let's say of the
more mainstream po Protestant movements
with the woke mob I don't think it's an
absurd criticism it's something like the
degeneration of Christianity into the
notion
that good and harmless are the same
thing or good and empathic are the same
thing thing which is simply not true and

[27:00]
thing thing which is simply not true and
and far too simplified and so and I also
think n was extremely wrong in his
presumption that human beings should
take it to themselves to construct their
own values I I think he made a colossal
error in that presumption and that is
the idea of uber match that the great
individual the best of us yeah should
create our own values well and I I think
the reason that he was wrong about that
is that so when God gives instructions
to Adam and Eve in the garden of Eve he
basically tells them that they can do
anything they want in the wall Garden so
that's the kind of balance between order
and nature that makes up the human
environment human beings have the
freedom vouch safe to them by God to do
anything they want in the garden except
to mess with the most fundamental rule
so God says to people you're not to eat
of the fruit of the tree of the
knowledge of Good and Evil which
fundamentally means there is an implicit
moral order and you're to abide by it
you're Freedom stops at the foundation

[28:01]
you're Freedom stops at the foundation
and you can think about that I'd be
interested even in your ideas about this
as an engineer let's say is
that there is an ethos that's implicit
in being
itself and your ethos has to be a
reflection of that and that isn't under
your control you can't gerrymander the
foundation
because the your foundational beliefs
have to put you in harmony like musical
harmony with the actual structure
structure of reality as such so I can
give you an example of that
so our goal in so far as we're
conducting ourselves properly is to have
the kind of interestes in conversation
that allows both of us to express oursel
in a manner that enables us to learn and
grow such that we can share that with
everyone who's listening and if our aim
is true and upward then that's what
we're doing well that means that we're
going to have to match ourselves to a
pattern of interaction and that's marked

[29:00]
pattern of interaction and that's marked
for us emotionally like you and I both
know this if we're doing this right
we're going to be interested in the
conversation we're not going to be
looking at or watch we're not going to
be thinking about what we're aiming at
we're just going to communicate now the
religious interpretation of that would
be that we were doing something like
making the Redemptive logos manifest
between us in dialogue and that's
something that can be shared to do that
we have to align with that pattern I
can't decide that there's some arbitrary
way that I'm going to play you I mean I
could do that if I was a psychopathic
manipulator but to do that optimally I'm
not going to impose a certain mode
of a certain a priority aim let's say on
our communication and manip and
manipulate you into that
so the constraints on my
ethos reflect the actual structure of of
the world and I can't this is this is
the Communist presumption it's like
we're we're going to burn everything
down and we're going to start from

[30:00]
down and we're going to start from
scratch and we've got these axiomatic
presumptions and we're going to put them
into place and we're going to socialize
people so they now think and live like
Communists from day one and human beings
are infinitely malleable and we can use
a rational set of presuppositions to
decide what sort of beings they should
be the transhumanists are doing this too
it's like no there's a pattern of being
that you have to fall into alignment
with and it I think it's the pattern of
being by the way that if you fall into
alignment with it gives you hope it it
it protects you from anxiety and it
gives you a sense of harmony with your
surroundings with other people and none
of that's arbitrary but don't you think
we both ared to this conversation with
rigid axioms that we have maybe we're
blind to them but in the same way that
the Marxist came with very rigid axioms
about the way the world is and the way
it should be aren't we coming to that
well we definitely come to the
conversation with a hierarchy of
foundation oxums right and I would say

[31:00]
foundation oxums right and I would say
the more sophisticated you are as a
thinker the the deeper the level at
which you're willing to play so imagine
first that you have presumptions of
different depth there's more predicated
on the more fundamental axioms and then
that there's a a space of play around
those and that space of play is going to
depend on the sophistication of the
player obviously
but those who are capable of engaging in
deeper conversations talk about more
fundamental things with more play now we
have to come to the conversation with a
certain degree of structure because we
wouldn't be able to understand each
other or communicate if if a lot of
things weren't already assumed or taken
for granted how rigid is the hierarchy
of axioms that religion provides this is
what I'm trying to understand the
rigidity of that hierarchy is play well
play is not rigid at all no no no no no
no it's got a rigid some constraints it
took me about 40 years to figure out the

[32:00]
took me about 40 years to figure out the
answer to that question so it wasn't I'm
serious about that so it wasn't it
wasn't a random answer
so play is very rigid in some ways so
like if you and I go out to play
basketball or chess like There are rules
and you can't break the rules because
then you're no longer in the game but
then there's a dynamism within those
rules that's well with chess it's
virtually infinite I mean I think what
is it there's more patterns of potential
games on a chessboard than there are
subatomic particles in the observable
universe like it's an insane space so
it's not like there's not Freedom within
it but by the it's it's a weird Paradox
in a way isn't it because music is like
this too is that there are definitely
rules and so and there are things you
can't throw a basketball into a chess
board and still be playing chess but
weirdly enough if you adhere to the
rules the realm of Freedom increases
rather than decreasing and I I think you
can make the same case for a playful
conversation as it's like we're playing
by certain rules and a lot of them are

[33:00]
by certain rules and a lot of them are
implicit but that doesn't mean that it
might mean the reverse of constraint you
know
because in this seminar for example that
I was referring to the Exodus seminar
and then the gospel seminar everybody in
the seminar there's about eight of us
played Fair nobody play used power
nobody tried to prove they were right
they put forward their points but they
were like here's a way of looking at
that assess it and they were also doing
it genuinely it's like this is what I've
concluded about say this story and i'
and I'm going to make a case for it but
I'd like to hear what you have to say
because maybe you can change it you can
extend it you can find a flaw in it and
that's well that's a conversation that
has flow and that's engaging and that
other people will listen to as well and
that's also see I think that one of the
things that we can conclude now and we
can do this even from a neuroscientific
basis is that that sense of engaged
meaning is a marker not only for the
emergence of Harmony between you and
your environment but for the emergence

[34:01]
your environment but for the emergence
of that Harmony in a way that is
developmentally Rich that moves you
upward towards what would you
say well I think towards a more
effective entropic State that's actually
the technical answer to that but it
makes you more than you are and there's
a directionality in that well I would
like to sort of the reason I like
talking about communism because it has
clearly been shown as a set of ideas to
be destructive
to to humanity but I would like to
understand from an engineering
perspective the characteristics of
communism versus religion uh where you
can identify religious thought is going
to lead to a better human being a better
society and communist Marxist thought
it's not because there's ambiguity
there's room for play in communism and
Marxism because they kind of had a
utopian sense of where everybody's
headed don't know it's going to happen
maybe Revolution is required but after

[35:00]
maybe Revolution is required but after
the revolution is done we'll figure it
out and there's an underlying assumption
that maybe human beings are good and
they'll figure it out when once you
remove the oppressor I mean all these
ideas kind of until you put them into
practice you could they can be quite
convincing if you in the 19th century if
I was reading which is kind of
fascinating the 19th century produced
such powerful ideas marks and nich oh
fascism too for that matter fascism so
you know if I was sitting there uh like
especially if I'm feeling shitty about
myself um a lot of these ideas are
pretty powerful as as a as a way to plug
the Ness hole Yeah right absolutely well
and some of them may actually have an
appropriate scope of application it
could be that some of the foundational
axioms of Communism socialism SLC
communism are actually functional in a
sufficiently small social group maybe a
Bible group even like I I also have a

[36:00]
Bible group even like I I also have a
I'm not sure this is correct but I have
a suspicion that the pervasive
attractiveness of some of the radical
left ideas that we're talking about are
pervasive precisely because they are
functional within say families but also
within the small tribal groups that
people might have originally evolved
into and that once we become
civilized so we produce societies that
are united even among people who don't
know one another that different
principles have to apply as a
consequence of scale so that's that's
partly an engineering response but but I
think there's a more a deeper way of
going after the Communist problem so I
think part of the Communist the problem
fundamental problem with the Communist
axim is the notion that the world of
complex social interactions can be
simplified sufficiently so that
centralized planning authorities can
deal with it and I think the best way to
think about the free Exchange rejoiner
to that presumption is no the sum total

[37:01]
to that presumption is no the sum total
of human interactions in a large
civilization are so immense that you
need a distributed network of cognition
in order to compute the proper way
forward and so what you do is you give
each actor their domain of individual
choice so that they can maximize their
own movement forward and you allow the
aggregate direction to emerge from that
rather than trying to impose it from the
top down which I think is
computationally impossible so that might
be one engineering reason why the
Communist solution doesn't work like I
read in Sol nedson for example that the
the central Soviet authorities often had
to make 200 pricing decisions a
day now if you've ever started a
business or created a product and had to
wrestle with the problem of pricing
you'd become aware of just how
intractable that is like how do you
calculate worth well there's the central
existential problem of Life how how do
you calculate worth it's not something
like a central Authority can sit down

[38:01]
like a central Authority can sit down
and just manage and you you there is a
lot of inputs that go into a pricing
decision and the free market answer to
that is something like well if you get
the price right people will buy it and
you'll survive this is a fascinating way
to describe how ideas fail so communism
perhaps fails because uh just like what
people believe the Earth is flat when
you look outside it's it looks
flat but you can't see Beyond the
Horizon I guess so in the same way with
Communism communism seems like a great
idea in my family and my people I love
but it doesn't scale and and it doesn't
iterate it doesn't that's a form of
scaling too right well I mean whatever
ways it breaks down it doesn't scale uh
and you're saying religious thought is a
thing that might scale I would say
religious thought is the record of those
ideas that have in fact scaled right and
iterated itated does religious thought
great so I mean there's a fundamental

[39:01]
great so I mean there's a fundamental
conservative aspect to religious thought
tradition yeah there this is why like
mer elad for example who I referred to
earlier one of the things elad did and
very effectively and people like Joseph
Campbell who in some ways were
popularizers of Jose of elad's ideas and
Carl Jung's what they really did was
devote themselves to an analysis of
those ideals ideas that scaled and
iterated across the largest possible
spans of time and so ilad and Yung Eric
neyman they were looking and and
Campbell they were looking at patterns
of narrative that were common across
religious Traditions that had spanned
Millennia and found many patterns the
heroes myth for example is one of those
patterns and it's I think the evidence
that it has its reflection in human
neurophysiology and neuros pychology is
incontrovertible and so these
foundational narratives they last
they're common across multiple religious
Traditions they Unite they work
psychologically but they also reflect
the underlying neurophysiological

[40:01]
the underlying neurophysiological
architecture so I can give you an
example of that so the hero myth is
really a quest myth and a quest myth is
really a story of exploration and
expansion of adaptation right so Bilbo
The Hobbit he's kind of an ordinary
every man he lives in a very constrained
and orderly and secure world and then
the quest call comes and he goes out and
he expands his personality and develops
his wisdom and that's reflected in human
neuropsychological architecture at a
very low level way below cognition so
one of the most fundamental elements of
the mamalian brain and even in lower
animal forms is the hypothalamus it's
sort of the root of primary motivation
so it governs lust and um and it
regulates your breathing and it
regulates your hunger and it regulates
your thirst and it regulates your
temperature like really low-level
biological Necessities are regulated by
the hypothalamus when you get hungry
it's the hypothalamus when you're

[41:00]
it's the hypothalamus when you're
activated in a defensively aggressive
manner that's the hypothalamus half the
hypothalamus is the origin of the
dopaminergic tracts and they subsume
exploration and so you could think of
the human motivational reality as a
domain that's governed by axiomatic
motivational States love sex defensive
aggression hunger and another domain
that's governed by exploration and the
rule would be something like when your
basic motivational states are sated
explore well then and and that's not
cognitive like I said this is deep deep
brain architecture it's extraordinarily
ancient and and the exploration story is
something like go out into the unknown
and take the risks because the
information that
you discover and the skills you develop
will be worthwhile even in sating the
basic motivational drives and then you
want to learn to do that in a iterative
manner so it sustains across time and

[42:00]
manner so it sustains across time and
you want to do it in a way that unites
you with other people and there's a
pattern to that and I do think that's
the pattern that's we strive to
encapsulate in our deep religious
narratives and I think that in many ways
we've done that successfully what is the
believe in God how does that fit in what
does it mean to believe in God okay so
in one of the stories that I cover in uh
we who wrestle with God which I've only
recently begun to take apart say in the
last two years is the story of Abraham
it's a very cool story and it's also
related by the way to your question
about what makes communism wrong and
dovi knew this not precisely the Abraham
story but the the same reason in Notes
from Underground dovi made a very
telling observation so he speaks in the
voice of a cynical nihilistic and bitter
bureaucrat who's been a failure who's
talking cynically about the nature of
human beings but also very ACC
accurately and one of the things he
points out with regards to Modern

[43:01]
points out with regards to Modern
utopianism is that human beings are very
strange creatures and that if you gave
them what the Socialist utopians want to
give them so let's say all your needs
are taken care of all your material
needs are taken care of and even
indefinitely dov's claim was you don't
understand human beings very well
because if you put them in an
environment that was that comfortable
they would purposefully go insane just
to break it into bits just so something
interesting would happen right and he
says it's it's the human Pro proclivity
to curse and complain and he says this
in quite a cynic and CTIC manner but
he's pointing to something deep which is
that we're not built for comfort and
security we're not infants we're not
after
satiation so then you might ask well
what the hell are we after then that's
what the Abraham story addresses and
Abraham is the first true individual in
the biblical narrative so you could
think about his story as the archetypal
story of the developing individual so

[44:00]
story of the developing individual so
you said well what's God well in the
Abraham story God has characterized a
lot of different ways in the classic
religious texts like the Bible is
actually a compilation of different
characterizations of the Divine with the
insistence that they reflect an
underlying unity in the story of
Abraham the Divine is the Call to
Adventure so Abraham has the Socialist
Utopia at hand he's from a wealthy
family and he has everything he needs
and he actually doesn't do anything
until he's in his 70s now hypothetically
people in those times lived much longer
but the voice comes to Abraham and it
tells him something very
specific it
says leave your zone of comfort leave
your parents leave your tent leave your
community leave your tribe leave your
land go out into the
world and Abraham thinks well why I've
got naked slave girls peeling grapes and
feeding them to me it's like what do I

[45:00]
feeding them to me it's like what do I
need an adventure for and God tells them
and this is the Covenant by the way part
of the Covenant that the god of the
Israelites makes with his people it's
very very specific it's very brilliant
he says if you follow the voice of
Adventure you'll become a blessing to
yourself so that's a good deal because
people generally live at odds with
themselves and he says God says that's
not
all you'll become un blessing to
yourself in a way that furthers your
reputation among people and validly so
that you'll accomplish things that were
real and people will know it and you'll
be held high in their esteem and that
will be valid so that's a pretty good
deal because social people would like to
be regarded as of utility and worth by
others and so that's a good deal and and
God says that's not
all you'll establish something of
lasting permanent and deep value that's
why Abraham becomes the father of
Nations and finally caps it off and he

[46:01]
Nations and finally caps it off and he
says there's a bet there's a better
element even to it there's a Capstone
you'll do all three of those things in a
way that's maximally beneficial to
everyone else and so the Divinity in the
abrahamic story is making a claim he
says first of all there's a drive that
you should attend to so the spirit of
Adventure that calls you out of your
zone of comfort now if you attend to
that and you make the sacrifices necess
necessary to follow that path then the
following benefits will accue to you
your life will be a blessing everyone
will hold you in high estem you'll
establish something of permanent value
and you'll do it in a way that's
maximally beneficial to everyone else
and so so think about what this means
biologically or from an engineering
standpoint it means that the instinct to
develop that characterizes outward
moving children let's say or adults is
the same Instinct that allows for
psychological stability that allows for
movement upward in a social hierarchy
that establishes something iterable and

[47:02]
that establishes something iterable and
that does that in a manner that allows
everyone else to partake in the same
process well you know that's a good deal
and like I can't see how it cannot be
true because the alternative hypothesis
would be that the spirit that moves you
beyond yourself to develop the spirit of
a curious child let's say what is that
antithetical to your own esteem is that
antithetical to other people's best
interest is it not the thing that
increases the probability that you'll do
something permanent that's that's a
stupid Theory so God is a call to
Adventure with some constraints a call
to true adventure to true adventure true
adventure yeah and then that's a good
observation because that begs the
question what constitutes the most true
adventure well that's not fully fleshed
out until at least from the Christian
Perspective let's say that's not fully
fleshed out until the Gospels
because the passion of Christ is the you

[48:00]
because the passion of Christ is the you
could say this is the perfectly
reasonable way of looking at it the
passion of Christ is the truest
adventure of Abraham it's a terrible
thing he because it's a it's a the the
passion story is a catastrophic tragedy
although it obviously has its Redemptive
elements but one of the things that's
implied there is
that there's no distinction between the
true adventure of life and taking on the
pathway of maximal responsibility andth
burden and I can't see how that cannot
be true like cuz the counter hypothesis
is well Lex the best thing for you to do
in your life is to shrink from all
Challenge and hide right to remain
infantile to remain secure not to ever
push yourself beyond your limits not to
take any risks well no one thinks that's
true so basically the maximally
worthwhile Adventure could possibly be
highly correlated with the hardest
possible available
Adventure the hardest possible available

[49:00]
Adventure the hardest possible available
Adventure voluntarily
undertaken does it have to be absolutely
how do you define voluntarily well
here's an here's an example of that um
that's that's that's a good question too
when Christ is the night before the
crucifixion which in principle he knows
is coming he asks God to relieve him of
his burden and understandably so I mean
that's the scene in famously in which
he's sweating literally sweating blood
because he knows what's coming and the
the the Romans designed crucifixion to
be the most agonizing and humiliating
Poss agonizing humiliating and
disgusting possible death right so there
was every reason to be apprehensive
about that and you might say well could
you undertake that voluntarily as an
adventure and the answer to that is
something like well what's your
relationship with
death like that's a problem you have to
solve and you could fight it and you
could be bitter about it and there's
reasons for that that especially if it's
painful and degrading but but the

[50:01]
painful and degrading but but the
alternative is something
like well that's what's fleshed out in
religious imagery always it's very
difficult to to cast into words it's
like no you you welcome you welcome the
struggle that's why I called the book we
who wrestle with God you welcome the
struggle and Alex I don't see how you
can come to terms with life without
construing it something like construing
is something like bring it on welcome
the struggle and I I can't see that
there's a limit to that it's like well I
welcome the struggle until it gets
difficult well so there's not a bell
curve like uh the struggle of moderation
basically you have to welcome whatever
as hard as it gets and the crucifixion
in that way is a symbol of that well and
it well it's it's worse than that in
some ways because the crucifixion
exemplifies the worst possible death but
that isn't the only element of the
struggle because mythologically

[51:02]
struggle because mythologically
classically after Christ's death he
Harrows hell and what that means as far
as I can tell psychologically is that
you're not only required let's say to
take on the full existential burden of
life and to welcome it regardless of
what it is and to maintain your upward
aim despite all Temptations to the
contrary but you also have to confront
the root of malevolence itself so it's
not merely tragedy and I think the
malevolence is actually worse and the
reason I think that is because I know
the literature on post-traumatic stress
disorder and most people who encounter
let's say a challenge that's so brutal
that it fragments them it isn't mere
suffering that does that to people it's
an encounter with malevolence that does
that to people their own sometimes Often
by the way Soldier will go out into a
battlefield and find out that there's a
part of him that really enjoys the mayem
and that conceptualization doesn't fit
in well with everything he thinks he

[52:01]
in well with everything he thinks he
knows about himself and humanity and
after that contact with that dark part
of himself he never
recovers that happens to people and and
it happens to people who encounter Bad
actors in the world too if you're a
naive person and the right narcissistic
psychopath comes your way you are in
like Mortal trouble because you might
die but that's not where the trouble
ends if there's a young young man in
their
20s listening to this how do they escape
the pull of zi's Notes from Underground
with the eyes open to the world how do
they select the adventure so there's
other characterizations of the Divine
say in the Old Testament story so one
pattern of characterization that I think
is really relevant to that question is
the conception of God as calling and
conscience okay so what does it mean
it's a description of the manner in
which your destiny announces itself to

[53:00]
which your destiny announces itself to
you and I'm I'm using that terminology
and and it's it's distinguishable say
from nich's notion that you create your
own values it's like part of the way you
can tell that that's wrong is that you
can't voluntarily gerrymander your own
interests right like you find some
things
interesting and that seems natural and
and autonomous and other things you
don't find interesting and you can't
really for yourself to be interested in
them now so what is the domain of
interest that makes itself manifest to
you well it's like an autonomous spirit
it's like certain things in your field
of perception are illuminated to you
think oh that that's interesting that's
compelling that's gripping Rudolph utto
who studied the phenomenology of
religious experience described
that as
numinous thing grips you CU you're
compelled by it and maybe it's also
somewhat anxiety provoking it's the same
reaction that like a cat has to a dog

[54:00]
reaction that like a cat has to a dog
when when the cat's hair stands on end
that's an awe response and so there's
going to be things in your
phenomenological field that pull you
forward compel you that's like the voice
of positive emotion and enthusiasm
things draw you into the world might be
love might be aesthetic interest it
might be friendship it might be social
status it might be um Duty and and and
and indust ousness like there's various
domains of interest that shine for
people that's sort of on the positive
side God is calling right that would be
akin to the spirit of Adventure for
Abraham but there's also God as
conscience and this is a useful thing to
know
too certain things bother you they they
they take root within you and they they
turn your thoughts towards certain
issues like they things you're
interested in that you've pursued your
whole life there are things I'm
interested in that that I felt as a

[55:00]
interested in that that I felt as a
moral compulsion and so you could think
and I think the way you can think about
it technically is
that something pulls you forward so that
you move ahead and you develop and then
another voice this is a voice of
negative emotion says while you're
moving forward stay on this narrow
pathway right and it'll Mark deviations
and it marks deviations with shame and
guilt and anxiety regret and that
actually has a voice don't do that well
why not well you're wandering off the
straight narrow path so the Divine marks
the path way forward and reveals it but
then puts up the constraints of
conscience and the Divine in the Old
Testament is portrayed not least as the
dynamic between calling and conscience
what do you do with the negative
emotions you didn't mention Envy there's
some really dark ones that can really
pull you into some bad places Envy fear
yeah EnV is a really bad one pride and
envy are among the worst those are the
sins of Cain by the way in the story of

[56:01]
sins of Cain by the way in the story of
Cain and Abel cuz Cain fails because his
sacrifices are insufficient he doesn't
offer his best and so he's rejected and
that makes him bitter and unhappy and he
goes to complain to God and God says to
him some two things he said if God tells
him if your sacrifices were appropriate
you'd be accepted it's a brutal thing
it's a brutal rejoiner and he also says
uh you can't blame your misery on your
failure you could learn from your
failure when you fail you invited in the
spirit of envy and resentment and you
allowed it to possess you and that's why
you're miserable and so Cain is
embittered by that response and that's
when he kills Abel and so you might say
well how do you fortify yourself against
that pathway of resentment and part of
classic religious
practice is aimed to do that precisely
what's the antithesis of envy
gratitude that's something you can
practice right and I mean literally

[57:01]
practice right and I mean literally
practice I think Envy is one of the
biggest enemies for a young person
because basically you're starting from
nowhere life is hard you've achieved
nothing and you're striving and you're
failing constantly because and you see
other people whom you think aren't
having the same problem yeah and they
succeed and they could be your neighbor
they could be succeeding by a little bit
or somebody on the internet succeeding
by a lot and I think that that can
really pull a person down that kind of
Envy can really destroy a person yeah
yeah definitely well the Gratitude
element would be something like well
yeah you don't know anything and you're
at the bottom but uh you're not
80h you know one of the best predictors
of wealth in the United States is
age so then you might saywell who's got
it better
the old rich guy or the young poor guy
and I would say most old Rich guys would

[58:01]
and I would say most old Rich guys would
trade their wealth for youth so it's not
exactly clear at all at any stage who's
got the upper hand who's got the
advantage and you know you could say
well I've got all these burdens in front
of me because I'm young and oh my God or
you could
say every dragon has its treasure and
then that's actually a pattern of
perception you know I'm not saying that
people don't have their challenges they
certainly do but
discriminating between a challenge and
an opportunity is very very difficult
and learning to see a challenge as an
opportunity that's the beginning of
wisdom it's interesting I don't know how
it works maybe you can elucidate but
when you have Envy towards
somebody if you just celebrate them so
gratitude yeah but actually as opposed
to sort of ignoring and being grateful
for the things you have like literally
celebrate that person it transforms it
like it lights the way I don't know why

[59:00]
like it lights the way I don't know why
that is exactly abely the only reason
you're envious is because you see
someone who has something that you
want okay so let's think let's think
about it well first of all the fact that
they have it means that in principle you
could get it at least someone has so
that's a pretty good deal and then you
might say well the fact that I'm envious
of that person means that I actually
want something and then you might think
well what am I envious of I'm envious of
their attractiveness to women it's like
okay well now you know something about
yourself you know that one true
motivation that's making itself manifest
to you is that you wish that you would
be the sort of person who is attractive
to women now of of course that's an
extremely common longing among men
period but particularly among young men
it's like well what makes you so sure
you couldn't have that well how about
here's an answer you don't have enough
faith in yourself
and maybe you don't have enough faith in
well I would say the Divine you don't

[1:00:00]
well I would say the Divine you don't
believe that the world is characterized
by enough potentiality so that even
miserable you has a crack at the brass
ring and like I I I talked about this
actually practically in one of my
previous books because I wrote a chapter
called uh compare yourself to who you
are and not to someone else at the
present time well why well your best
Benchmark for tomorrow is you today and
you might not be able to have what
someone else has on the particular axis
you're comparing yourself with them on
but you could make an incremental
improvement over your current state
regardless of the direction that you're
aiming and it is the case and this is a
law the return on incremental
Improvement is exponential or geometric
and not linear so even if you start this
is why the hero is always born in a low
lowly place mythologically right Christ
who redeemed seems the world is born in
a manger with the animals to
poverty-stricken parents in the middle

[1:01:00]
poverty-stricken parents in the middle
of a god-forsaken desert in a
nondescript time and
place isolated well why well because
everyone
young struggles with their insufficiency
but that doesn't mean that great things
can't make themselves manifest and part
of the insistence in the biblical text
for example is that it's incumbent on
you to have the courage to have faith in
in yourself and in the spirit of reality
the essence of
reality regardless of how you constr the
evidence at hand right look at me I'm so
useless I don't know anything I don't
have anything it's hopeless I don't have
it within me the world couldn't offer me
that possibility well what the hell do
you know about that this is what job
figures out in the midst of his
suffering in the Book of Job because job
is tortured terribly by God who makes a
bet with Satan himself to bring him down
and job's decision in the face of his

[1:02:02]
and job's decision in the face of his
intense suffering is I'm not going to
lose faith in my Essential goodness and
I'm not going to lose faith in the
essential goodness of being itself
regardless of how terrible the face it's
showing to me at the moment happens to
be and I think
okay what do you make of that claim well
let's look at it practically you're
being tortured by the arbitrariness of
life that's horrible now you lose faith
in yourself and you become cynical about
being so are you infinitely worse off
instantly and then you might say well
yeah but it's really asking a lot of
people that they maintain Faith even
well even in their Darkest Hours it's
like yeah that's that might be asking
everything from people but then you also
might ask this is a very strange
question
is if you were brought into being by
something that was essentially good

[1:03:00]
something that was essentially good
wouldn't that thing that brought you
into being demand that you make the best
in yourself manifest and wouldn't it be
precisely when you most need that that
it would be that you'd be desperate
enough to risk what it would take to let
it emerge so you kind of make it seem
that reason could be the thing that
takes you out of a place of Darkness
sort of find finding that calling
through reason I think it's also
possible when reason fails you to just
take the leap navigate not by reason but
by finding the thing that scares you the
risk to take the risk take the leap and
then figure it out while you're in the
air yeah well I that I think that's
always part of a heroic Adventure you
know is that ability to cut the gordian
knot but but you could also ask from an
engineering perspective okay what are
the axioms that make it decision like
that possible and the answer would be
something like I'm going to make the

[1:04:00]
something like I'm going to make the
presumption that if I move forward in
good faith whatever happens to me will
be the best thing that could possibly
happen no matter what it is and I think
I think that's actually how you make an
alliance with truth and I I also think
that truth is an adventure and the way
you make an alliance with truth is by
assuming that whatever happens to you if
you're living in truth is the best thing
that Could Happen even if you can't see
that at any given moment because
otherwise you'd say that truth would be
just the handmaiden of Advantage well
I'm going to say something truthful and
I pay a price well that means I
shouldn't have said it well that
possibly but that's not the only
possible standard of evaluation you can
because what you're doing is you're
making the outcome your deity right well
I just reverse that and say no no truth
is the deity the outcome is variable but
that doesn't eradicate the initial axium
where's the

[1:05:00]
where's the
constant right where's what's the
constant he
maybe uh when you said uh Abraham was
being fed by naked ladies that's an
interpolation obviously but would have
been out of keeping for the times but it
does make me think sort of in stark
contrast to n's own life that perhaps
getting laid early on in life as a
useful starter
uh step one get laid and then go for
adventure there's some basic satiation
of Des I think it's perfectly reasonable
to bring the sexual element in because
it's a powerful motivating force and it
has to be integrated I don't think it's
adventure it's romantic adventure right
right but the the lack of basic
interaction sexual interaction I feel
like is the engine that drives towards
that cynicism of the inel
there there's there's there's very
little doubt about that we know
perfectly well anthropologically that

[1:06:01]
perfectly well anthropologically that
the most unstable social situation you
can generate is young men with no access
to women that's not good and they'll do
anything anything to reverse that
situation so that's very dangerous but
then I would also
say there's every suggestion that the
pathway of Adventure itself is the best
Pathway to romantic attractiveness and
we we know this in some ways in a very
blunt manner the Google boys the
engineers who are too what would you say
naively oriented towards empirical truth
to note when they're being Politically
Incorrect they wrote a great book called
a billion Wicked thoughts which I really
like it's a very good book and
it's Engineers as
psychologists and so they'll say all
sorts of things that no one with any
sense would ever say that happen to be
true and they studied the pattern of
pornographic fantasy and women like porn
graphic stories not images so women's
use of pornographic pornography is

[1:07:00]
use of pornographic pornography is
literary who are the main protagonists
in female pornographic
fantasy Pirates werewolves vampires
surgeons billionaires Tony Stark you
know yeah and so the basic pornographic
narrative is Beauty and the Beast those
five categories terrible aggressive male
tameable by the right relationship hot
erotic attra action and so I would say
to the young men who and I have many
times to the young men who are locked in
isolation it's first of all join the
bloody Club because the default value of
a 15-year-old male on the mating Market
is zero and there's reason for that you
know and zero is a bit of an
exaggeration but not much and the reason
for that is well what the hell do you
know like you're not good for anything
you you have potential and maybe plenty
and hopefully that'll be made manifest
but you shouldn't be all upset because
you're the same loser as everyone else
your age has always been since the

[1:08:01]
your age has always been since the
beginning of time but then you might ask
well what should I do about it the
answer is get yourself together you know
stand up straight with your shoulders
back take on some Adventure find your
calling abide by your conscience put
yourself together and you'll become
attractive and we know this is look we
know this is true the correlation
between male sexual
opportunity and relative masculine
status is about 6 that's higher than the
correlation between intelligence and
academic achievement I don't think that
there's a larger correlation between two
independent phenomena in the entire
social science and health literature
than the correlation between relative
male social status and reproductive
success it's by far the most fundamental
determinant but what's the cause and
effect there it's a loop men are
motivated to attain social status
because it confers upon them
reproductive success and that's not only

[1:09:00]
reproductive success and that's not only
cognitively but biologically I'll give
you an example of this there's a
documentary I watch from time to time
which I think is the most brilliant
documentary I've ever seen it's called
crumb and it's the story of this
underground cartoonist Robert Crum who
was in high school was in the category
of
males for whom a date was not only not
likely but in
unimaginable so he was at the bottom of
the Bottom Rung and almost all the
reactions he got from females weren't
wasn't just no it was like are you out
of your mind like with that contempt
right and then he became successful and
so the documentary is super interesting
because it tracks the utter pathology of
his sexual fantasies because he was
bitter and resentful and if you want to
understand the psychology of Serial
sexual killer and the like and you watch
crumb you'll know find out a lot more
about that than anybody with any sense

[1:10:00]
about that than anybody with any sense
would want to know but then he makes
this transition and partly because he
does take the heroic Adventure path and
he actually has a family and a and
children and he he's actually a pretty
functional person as opposed to his
brothers one of whom commits suicide and
one of whom is literally a repeat sexual
offender it's a brutal documentary but
he what he did in his adolescence after
being rejected was he found what he was
interested he was a very good artist he
was very interested in music and he
started to pursue those sort of
single-mindedly and he became successful
and as soon as he became successful and
the documentary tracks this beautifully
he's immediately attractive to women and
and then you might ask too even if
you're cynical like well why do women
why do I have to perform for women and
the answer to that is something like why
the hell should they have anything to do
with you if you're useless they're going
to have infants they don't need another
one right partly the reason that women
are hypergamous L they want males who
are of higher status than they are is
because they're trying to redress the

[1:11:00]
because they're trying to redress the
reproductive burden and it's substantial
I mean the female of any species is the
sex that devotes more to the
reproductive function that's a more
fundamental differ definition than
chromosomal differentiation and that's
taken to its ultimate extreme with with
humans and so of course women are going
to want someone around that's useful
because the cost of sex for them is an
eight 18yearold period of dependency
with an infant so so so I think the
adventure comes first heroic adventure
comes first well it's complex because
the other problem let's say with the
Crum boys is that their mother was
extremely pathological and they didn't
get a lot of genuine feminine nurturance
and affection oh of course but the
family and Society are not going to help
you most of the time with a heroic
Adventure right they're going to be a
barrier versus a in good families
they're both because because they put up
constraints on your behavior but they
like I've interviewed a lot of
successful people about their calling

[1:12:03]
successful people about their calling
let's say because that's I do that with
all my podcast guests how how did the
path that you took to success make
itself manifest and it's it's very the
pattern's very typical almost all the
people that I've interviewed had a
mother and a father now it's not
invariant but I'd say it's there 99% of
the time it's really high and both of
the parents or at least one of them but
often both were very encouraging of the
person's interests and Pathway to
development that's fascinating i' I've
heard you analyze it that way before and
I I had a reaction to that idea because
you focus on the positive of the parents
yeah I feel like it was the maybe I I
see biographies differently but it feels
like the struggle within the family was
the Catalyst for greatness in in in a
lot of biography
maybe I'm misinterpreting it but I I
don't think you I think that that's a

[1:13:00]
don't think you I think that that's a
reflection maybe correct me if I'm wrong
I think that's a reflection of that
dynamic between positive and negative
emotion like my son for example who's
doing just fine um he's firing on all
cylinders as far as I'm concerned he has
a nice family he gets along with his
wife he's a really good musician he's
got a company he's running well um he's
he's a delight to be around he was a
relatively disagreeable infant he was
tough-minded and so and he he didn't
take no for an answer and so there was
some tussle in regulating his behavior
he spent a lot of time when he was two
sitting on the steps trying to get his
act together and so that was the
constraint and and but that wasn't that
wasn't something that was it's an
opposition to him away because it was in
opposition to the immediate
manifestation of his hedonistic desires
but it was also an imp to further
development me the rule for me when he
was on the stairs was as soon as you're

[1:14:00]
was on the stairs was as soon as you're
willing to be a civilized human being
you can get off the stairs and you might
think well that's nothing but arbitrary
super ego patriarchal oppressive
constraint or you could say well no what
I'm actually doing is facilitating his
cortical maturation because when a child
misbehaves it's usually because they're
under the domination of some primordial
emotional or motivational impulse
they're angry they're over enthusiastic
they're they're upset um they're selfish
like it's narrow
self-centeredness expressed in a
immature manner but see okay uh tell me
if I'm wrong but it feels like the
engine of greatness at least on the male
side of things has often been trying to
prove the father wrong or trying to gain
the acceptance of the father so that
tension where the parent is not
encouraging like you mentioned but is
basically
saying no you you won't be able to do
this okay so my observation as a

[1:15:01]
this okay so my observation as a
psychologist has been that it's very
very difficult for someone to get their
act together unless they have at least
one figure in their life that's
encouraging and show shows them the
pathway forward so so you can have a lot
of adversity in your life and if you
have one person around who's a good
model and you're neurologically intact
you can latch onto that model now you
can also find that model in books and
people do that sometimes like I've
interviewed people who had pretty frag
fragmented childhoods who turned to
books and found the pattern that guided
them in like let's say the the The
Adventures of the heroes of the past
because that's a good way of thinking
about it and I read a a book called
Angela's Ashes that was written by an
Irish author Frank mccort fantastic book
beautiful book and his father was an
alcoholic of gargantuan proportions he
just an an Irish drinker who drank every
scent that came into the family and many
of whose children died in poverty and

[1:16:02]
of whose children died in poverty and
what Frank
did as a testament to the human spirit
is he sort of divided his father
conceptually into two elements there was
sober morning Father who was encouraging
and with whom he had a relationship and
then there was drunk and useless later
afternoon and evening father and
he rejected the negative and he
Amplified his relationship with the
Positive now like he had other he had
other things going for him but he you
know he did a very good job of
discriminating and and I mean partly the
question that
you're raising is to what degree is it
useful to have a beneficial
adversary yeah and I mean struggle-free
progress is not possible and I think
there are situations under which where
you know you might be motivated to prove
someone in
your immediate circle wrong but then

[1:17:00]
your immediate circle wrong but then
that also implies that at some level for
some reason you actually care about
their judgment you know you just didn't
write them off completely well I mean
that's why I say there's an archetype of
a young man trying to gain the
approval of his father and I think that
repeats itself in a bunch of biographies
that I've read I don't know there must
have been an engine somewhere that they
found of approval of uh encouragement
maybe in books maybe in the mother or
maybe the the role of the parents has
flipped well my my father was hard to
please very did you ever succeed yes but
it wasn't easy ever when when was the
moment when you uh
succeeded late pretty late like 40 maybe
later was it uh gradual or a definitive
moment when a shift
happened my father always was always

[1:18:01]
happened my father always was always
willing to approve of the things I did
that were good although he was not
effusive by any stretch of the
imagination and the standards were very
high now I was probably fortunate for me
you know and and I it does bear on the
question you're asking is like if you
want someone to motivate you optimally
God it's complicated because there has
to be a tempor mental dance between the
two people
like what you really want is for someone
to apply the highest possible standards
to you that you're capable of
reaching right and that's a that's a
that's a vicious dance because you have
to have a relationship with your child
to do that properly you know because you
want to if you want to be optimally
motivating as a father you keep your
children on the edge it's
like you might not reward something your
child that you would think would be good
in someone else because you think they
could do better and so my father was

[1:19:01]
could do better and so my father was
pretty clear about the idea that he
always expected me to do better and was
that Troublesome it was like I felt
often when I was young that there was no
pleasing him but I also knew that that
wasn't I knew that that wasn't right see
I actually knew that wasn't right
because I could remember especially I
think when I was very young that I did
things that he was pleased about I knew
that was possible so it wasn't it
wasn't unpredictable and arbitrary it
was just difficult it sounds like he's
hit a pretty good
optimal but it's uh for each individual
human that optimal differs well that's
why you have to have a relationship with
your children you have to know them and
and well with yourself too and and with
your wife
you you you can't hit that
optimal that optimal is probably
love that's because love isn't just

[1:20:01]
love that's because love isn't just
acceptance love is acceptance and
encouragement and it's not just that
either it's also no don't do that that's
beneath you you're capable of more and
how harsh should that be it's like
that's a really hard question you know
like if you really love someone you're
not going to put up with their stupidity
don't do that you know one of the rules
I had with my little kids was don't do
anything that makes you look like an
idiot in public why cuz I don't want you
disgracing yourself why not cuz I like
you I think you're great and you're not
going to act like a bloody fool in
public so that people get the wrong idea
about you no what about inside a
relationship how a successful
relationship is how much challenge how
much
peace is a successful relationship one
that is
easy one that is
challenging I would say to some degree
that depends on your temperament my wife

[1:21:01]
that depends on your temperament my wife
is quite a provocative
person and there are times when I I
suppose do I wish that there are times
when I casually wish that she was easier
to get along with but as soon as I think
about it I I don't I don't think that
yeah cuz i' I've always liked her we
were friends ever since we were little
kids and she's she plays rough and I
like that as it turns out now that
doesn't mean it isn't a pain from time
to time but you know and that is going
to be a temperamental issue to some
degree and and an issue of negotiation
like she plays rough but fair and the
fair part has been establishing that
it's been part of our ongoing
negotiation and part of it is in the
play you get to find out about yourself
or what your temperament is cuz I don't
think that that's clear until it's
tested oh definitely not definitely not
you find out all all sorts of things
about yourself in a relationship that's
for sure well and partly the reason that

[1:22:00]
for sure well and partly the reason that
there is provocativeness especially from
women in relationship to men is they
want to test them out it's like can you
hold your temper when someone's
bothering you well why would a woman
want to know that well maybe she doesn't
want you to uh snap and hurt her
kids and so how's she going to find that
out ask you well you're going to say
well I'd never do that it's like never e
let's find out if it's never
never so we don't know how people test
each other out in relationships but or
why exactly but it's intense and
necessary what's your and what's in
general should a man's relationship with
temper be you should have one and you
should be able to regulate it like
that's part of that attractiveness of
the Monstrous that characterizes women's
fantasies right because and N pointed
this out too go back to n you know n one
of n's claim was that most of what
passes for Morality is nothing but
cowardice you know I'd never cheat on my

[1:23:00]
cowardice you know I'd never cheat on my
wife it's like uh is there anybody
asking you
to that you actually find attractive or
are there dozens of people asking you to
that you find
attractive it's like well I would never
cheat it's like no you just don't have
the opportunity now I don't I'm not
saying that everyone's in that position
you know that they would cheat even if
they had the opportunity because that's
not true but and it's the same with
regards to oh I'm a peaceful man it's
like no you're not you're just a weak
coward you wouldn't dare have it to have
a confrontation physical or metaphysical
and you're passing it off as morality
because you don't want to come to terms
with the fact of your own weakness and
cowardice and part of the that what I
would say is Twisted pseudo-christian
morality that nche was criticizing was
exactly of that sort and it tied into
resentment and envy and he tied that in
explicitly said that failure in life
masked by the morality that's nothing
but weak
cowardice turns to the resentment that

[1:24:01]
cowardice turns to the resentment that
undermines and destroys everything and
that does that purposefully yeah I think
he was criticizing if under the facade
of niceness there's an ocean of
resentment yeah that's for
sure that's that for sure that's also
the danger of being too forthcoming with
people see this is another thing let's
say about my wife who's not particularly
agreeable it's like she's not
particularly agreeable but she's not
resentful and that's because she doesn't
give things away that she that she isn't
willing to and if you're agreeable and
nice and your conflict avoidant you'll
push yourself too far to please the
other person and then that makes you
bitter and resentful so that's not
helpful do you think you'll be in
trouble for saying this on a podcast
later no no we we know each other pretty
well and like I said it's it's not it's
a trait that I find admirable it's
provocative and um challenging and it
seems to work well we've been together
50 years so uh quick pause bathroom

[1:25:01]
50 years so uh quick pause bathroom
break if we can descend from the realm
of ideas down to
uh history and reality I would say the
time between World War I and World War
II was uh one of History's biggest
testing of
ideas and really the most dramatic kinds
of ideas that
helped us understand the nature of Good
and Evil I just want to ask you sort of
a a question about Good and Evil uh
Churchill in many ways was not a good
man Stalin as you've documented
extensively was a horrible
man but you can make the case that both
were necessary for stopping an even
worse human being in Hitler so to what
degree do you
need monsters to fight

[1:26:01]
need monsters to fight
monsters do you
need bad men to be able to fight off
greater
evils it's everything in its proper
place is the answer to that you know we
might think that our life would be
easier without fear let's say we might
say that our life would be easier
Without Anger or pain but
the truth of the matter is is that those
things are beneficial even though they
can cause great suffering but they have
to be in their proper place and that
capacity that could in one context be a
terrible Force for evil can in the
proper context be the most potent Force
for good a good man has to be formidable
and partly what that means as far as I
can tell is that you have to be able to
say no and no means like I thought a lot
about no working as a clinician because
I did a lot of strategic counseling with
my clients in a lot of extremely
difficult situations and I learned to

[1:27:01]
difficult situations and I learned to
take apart what no meant and also when
dealing with my own children because I
used no sparingly because it's a
powerful weapon let's say but I meant it
and with my kids what it meant was if
you continue that pattern of behavior
something you do not like will happen to
you with 100%
certainty
and when when that's the case and you're
willing to implement it you don't have
to do it very often with regards to
monstrosity it's like weak men aren't
good they're just weak that's n's
observation that's partly again why he
was tempted to place the will to power
let's say and to deal with that notion
in a manner that when it was tied with
the revaluation of all values was
counterproductive and counterproductive
in the final analysis it's not like he
not like there wasn't something to what
he was driving at you know formidable
men are admirable and you know don't

[1:28:01]
men are admirable and you know don't
mess with them Douglas Murray's a good
example of that he's you know he's a
rather slight guy but he's got a spine
of Steel and there's no more than a bit
of what's a monstrous in him and Joo
willink is like that and Joe Rogan is
like that and you're like that but
there's a different level I mean if you
look to me churo might represent the the
thing you're talking about but World War
II Hitler would not be stopped without
Stalin well I wonder yes yes and you you
if I may insert into this picture of
complexity Hitler would have not stopped
until he enslaved and exterminated the
entirety of the Slavic people the Jewish
people the Slavic people the gypsies the
everybody who's non Arian but then
Stalin in the mass rape of German women
by the Red Army as they March towards
Berlin is a kind of manifestation the

[1:29:00]
Berlin is a kind of manifestation the
full monstrosity that a person can be
you you can easily be in a situation you
can easily and unfortunately find
yourself in a situation where all you
have in front of you are a variety of
bad
options you know that's partly why if
you have any sense you try to conduct
yourself very carefully in life because
you don't want to be in a position where
you've made so many mistakes that all
the options left you are terrible and so
you said well was it necessary to Ally
with Stalin it's like well it's very
difficult to second guess the trajectory
of something as complex as World War II
but we could say casually at least as
westerners have in general that that
Alliance was necessary now I think the
mistake that the West made in the
aftermath of World War II was in not
dealing as forthrightly with the
catastrophes of Communism as an ideology
as we did with Fascism and that's
especially true of the intellectuals in
the universities I mean it was very

[1:30:00]
the universities I mean it was very
common when I was teaching both at
Harvard and at the University of Toronto
for the students in my personality class
where we studied soul niten Who's
actually an existential psychologist in
many ways and a deep one none of them
knew anything about the Soviet
atrocities none of them knew anything
about what happened in Ukraine and the
death of 6 million productive people had
no idea that the Communists killed tens
of millions of people in the aftermath
of the re Russian Revolution they know
even less about Ma and the great Le yeah
right right which which some estimates
are 100 million people now you know when
your error bars are in the tens of
millions well that's a real indication
of a cataclysm and nobody knows how many
people died from direct oppression or
indirect in the Soviet Union 20 million
it seems like a reasonable estimate Sol
nen's upper bound was higher than that
and how do you uh
measure the intellectual output that was

[1:31:00]
measure the intellectual output that was
suppressed and killed off the the the
number of intellectuals artists and
writers that were put into prod Farmers
for that matter and anyone who was
willing to tell the truth right
absolutely so yeah catastrophic and so I
think the West's
failure wasn't so much allying with
Stalin I mean it was Douglas MacArthur
who wanted to continue he thought we
should just take the Soviets out after
the second world war and they removed
them from any position of authority
where such a thing might be made
possible and people were tired and but
was MacArthur wrong well he certainly
wasn't wrong in his insistence that
Stalin was as big a monster as Hitler or
bigger
so the valorization of the leftist
proclivity the radical leftist
proclivity is the sin of the West I
think more intensely than allying with
Stalin tricky Nuance topic but if we

[1:32:01]
Stalin tricky Nuance topic but if we
look at the modern day and the threat of
communism Marxism in the United States
uh to
me it's
disrespectful to the atrocities of the
20th century to call somebody like kamla
Harris a
communist but I see the sort of
escalation of the extremeness of
language being used used when you call
somebody like Donald Trump a fascist
then it makes total sense to then use
similar extreme terminology for somebody
like KLA Harris but maybe I could ask
your evaluation if you look at the
political landscape today somebody like
Joe Biden and K Harris well the first
thing I would say is that I think that
viewing the political landscape of today
as a political landscape is actually
wrong I think it's not the right frame
of reference because what I see
happening are are a very small
percentage of dark tetrad personality
types so mellan manipulative

[1:33:03]
types so mellan manipulative
narcissistic wanting undeserved
attention Psychopathic that makes them
predatory parasites and sadistic because
that goes along with the other three
that's
about in the serious manifestation
that's probably 3 to 5% of the
population and they're generally kept
under pretty decent controlled
by civilized people and stable social
interactions I think that their
machinations are disinhibited
by cost-free Social Media communication
so they gain disproportionate influence
now these people want undeserved
recognition and social status and
everything that goes along with it and
they don't care how they get it because
when I say they want that I mean that's
all they want so in the realm of social
media you
mentioned uh yes but are you also

[1:34:01]
mentioned uh yes but are you also
suggesting that they're over represented
in the realm of politics politicians and
so on they're over represented in the
realm of fractious political discourse
because they can use ideas first of all
they can use let's say the benevolent
ideas of the right and the benevolent
ideas of the left either one and switch
back and forth for that matter as a
camoufl FL for what they're actually up
to so how do you you've interviewed a
lot of people and you have a really
powerful mind you have a good read on
people so how do you know when you're
sitting across from a psychopath I I
wouldn't say that I do know in normal
social circumstances we have evolved
mechanisms to keep people like that
under control let's say that you and I
have a series of interactions and you
screw me over once I'm not going to
forget that now I might not write you
off because of the one time but if it
happens three times it's like we're not
going to play together anymore and
in normal
times most of our social networks are
connected and interacting so like if

[1:35:03]
connected and interacting so like if
you ripped me off three times and I
noted that I'm going to tell everybody I
know and they're going to tell everybody
they know and soon everyone will know
and that's the end of your tricks but
that assumes that we know who you are
and we're in continual communication
well all of that's gone
online so anonymity does that
and so does the amplification
of
emotional
intensity by the social media platforms
and their algorithms I think what we're
doing this is happening on Twitter
continually is we're giving the 5% of
psychopaths a radically disproportionate
voice and what they're doing is there's
a bunch of them on the left and they're
all we're so compassionate and there's a
bunch of them on the right and at the
moment they're all we're so Christian
and Free Speech oriented it's like no
you're not you're a narcissistic
Psychopaths and that's your camouflage

[1:36:00]
Psychopaths and that's your camouflage
and you hide behind your anonymity and
you use um fractious and divisive
language to to attract fools and to
elevate your social status and your
clout and and not only that to gain what
would you say satisfaction for your
sadistic impulses see the problem is
it's hard to tell who's the psychopath
and who is a
uh uh heterodox truth Seeker yeah well
if you were charitable about Tucker
Carlson's recent interview you'd say
that was exactly the conundrum he faced
and it is hard like I've thought about
for example interviewing Andrew Tate and
I thought I don't think so and then I
thought why I figured it's not obvious
to me at all that he wouldn't charm me
so I knew this guy Robert hair Robert
hair was the world's foremost authority
on psychopathy he established the field

[1:37:00]
on psychopathy he established the field
of clinical analysis of Psychopathic
behavior and Har was a pretty agreeable
guy so you know he would give people the
benefit of the doubt and he interviewed
hundreds of serious Psychopaths like
imprisoned violent offenders and he told
me in one of our conversations that
every time he sat down with a violent
offender psychopath and he had a measure
for psychopathy that was a clinical
checklist so he could identify the
Psychopaths from just the say
run-of-the-mill criminals every time he
sat down with them they pulled the wool
over his eyes and it wasn't he
videotaped the the interviews and it
wasn't until later when he was reviewing
the videos that he could see what they
were doing but in person their tricks
were more sophisticated than his
detection ability well okay this is
fascinating because again you're a great
interviewer I would love it if you
interviewed somebody like Putin so this
idea that you are a fool in the face of
psychopathy just doesn't jive with me

[1:38:00]
psychopathy just doesn't jive with me
I'm an agreeable guy that's the problem
I'll give people the benefit of the
doubt right right but that's good
because the way you reveal psychopathy
is by being agreeable not weak
but uh seeking with empathy to
understand the other person and in the
details in the little nuanced ways that
they struggle with questions
yeah the psychopathy is revealed so so
from uh we're kind of just to separate
the two things so one over
representation of psychopathy online uh
with anonymity that's a serious
fascinating problem but in the interview
one-on-one yeah I don't know if the job
of a human being in conversation is to
uh not talk to Psychopaths but to talk I
mean like how would you interview Hitler
well I've you know I've had very
difficult clinical interviews with
people in my clinical practice and so
what do you how do you how do you
approach that well I I really probably
approach that the way I approach most

[1:39:00]
approach that the way I approach most
conversations and it's something like
I'm going to assume that you're playing
a straight game but I'm going to watch
and if you throw the odd crooked
maneuver in then I'll note it and after
you do it three times I'll think okay I
see I thought we were playing one game
but we're actually playing another one
and if I'm smart enough to pick pick
that up that usually works out quite
successfully for me but I'm not always
smart enough to pick that up but see
here's a nice thing this a one-on-one
conversation that's not recorded is
different than one that's listened by a
lot of people because I would venture to
I trust the intelligence of the viewer
and The Listener to detect even better
than you yes and I think that's true by
the way to detect the psychopathy yeah
I've had the odd interview with people
that I wasn't happy with having
organized
because I felt that I
had brought their ideas to a wider

[1:40:00]
had brought their ideas to a wider
audience than might have been
appropriate but my conclusion and the
conclusion of my producers and the
people I talked to was that we could run
the interview the discussion and let the
audience sort it out and I would say
they do so I think as a general rule of
thumb that's true and I also think that
the long form interviews are
particularly good at that because it's
not that easy to Main maintain a
manipulative stance especially if you're
empty for like 2 and 1 half hours yes
you get tired you get irritable you show
that you lose the track you're you're
going to start leaking out your mistakes
and so and that actually is the case for
all the world leaders I would
say one hour is too short in something
happens at like 2our plus Mark where you
start to leak and I'm trusting the
intelligence of the of the listener to
sort of uh to detect that yeah and it
and it might be the intelligence of the
distributed crowd and I mean that is

[1:41:00]
distributed crowd and I mean that is
what I've seen with the YouTube
interviews is that it's hard to
fool people as such over a protracted
period of time and I guess it's partly
because everybody brings a different
slightly different set of falsehood
detectors to the table and if you
aggregate that it's pretty damn accurate
but of course you know it's it's comp at
because um ideas of Nazi ideology spread
in the 20s there was a real battle
between Marxism and Nazism oh yeah and I
believe there are some attempts at
censorship of Nazi ideology censorship
very often does the opposite it gives
The Fringe
ideologies power if they're being
censored because that's an indication
that the uh the the the man in power
doesn't want the truth to be heard kind
of idea and that just puts fuel to the
it also motivates the paranoid types
because one of the reasons that paranoia

[1:42:02]
because one of the reasons that paranoia
spirals out of control is because
paranoid people almost inevitably end up
being persecuted because they're so
touchy and so suspicious that people
start to walk on eggshells around them
as if there are things going on behind
the scenes and so then they get more
distrustful and more paranoid and
eventually they start misbehaving so
badly that they are actually persecuted
Often by legal authorities and you know
it's down the rabbit hole they go and so
you know musk is betting on that to some
degree right he believes that free
expression on Twitter X will sort itself
out and be of net benefit and I follow a
lot of really bad accounts on X because
I like to keep an eye
on the pathology of the left let's say
and the pathology of the right thinking
at least in my clinical way that I'm
watching the Psychopaths dance around
and try to do what Their subversion and
it's an ugly place to inhabit that's for
sure but it's also the case that a very

[1:43:03]
sure but it's also the case that a very
tiny minority of seriously Bad actors
can have a disproportionate influence
and one of the things I've always hoped
for for social media channels is that
they separate the anonymous accounts
from the verified accounts they should
just be in different categories people
who will say what they think and take
the hits to their
reputation Anonymous types if you want
to see what the anonymous types say you
can see it but don't be confusing them
with actual people cuz they're not the
same we know that people are we know
that people behave more badly when
they're Anonymous that's a very
wellestablished psychological finding
well and I think the danger to our
culture is substantive I think the
reason that everything perhaps the
reason that everything started to go
sideways pretty seriously around
2015 is because we invented these new
modes of communication we have no idea
how to police them and so the
psychopathic
manipulators they have free reign about
30% of the internet is prnography a huge

[1:44:02]
30% of the internet is prnography a huge
amount of internet traffic is outright
criminal and there's a penumbra around
that that's you know Psychopathic
narcissistic troublemaking trolls and
that might constitute the bulk of the
interactions online and it's partly
because people can't be held responsible
so the Free Riders have free reign it's
a fascinating technical challenge yeah
how to make our society resilient to the
Psychopaths on the left and the right
yeah yeah it might be the fundamental
problem of the age given the
amplification of communication by our
social by our social networks and so to
generalize across Psychopaths you could
also think about Bots yeah which behave
similar to psychopaths in their
certainty and not carrying their
maximizing some function they're not
carrying about anything else attention
yeah yeah yeah short-term attention even
worse yeah because because you might you
know that's another problem a like if
the algorithms are maximizing for the
grip of short-term attention they're

[1:45:00]
grip of short-term attention they're
acting like immature agents of attention
right and so then imagine the worst case
scenario is negative emotion gers more
attention and short-term gratification
Garners more attention so then you're
maximizing for the grip of short-term
attention by negative emotion I
mean that's not going to be a principle
if we were talking earlier about you
know unsustainable
unifying axioms that's
definitely that's definitely one of them
maximize for the spread of negative
attention negative emotion that Garner
short-term attention Jesus brutal I
just I tend to uh not think there's that
many Psychopaths so maybe to push back a
little bit it feels like there's a small
number of psychopaths m 3 to 5% is is
the is the estimate worldwide in terms
of humans sure but in terms of the the
pattern of stuff we see online My Hope

[1:46:00]
pattern of stuff we see online My Hope
Is that a lot of people on the extreme
left and extreme right or just the
trolls in general are just young people
kind of going through the similar stuff
that we've been talking about trying on
the cynicism and the
resentment uh there is there's a drug
aspect to it there's a pull to
that to uh to talk about somebody
to take somebody down
I mean there is some pleasure in that
there's a
dark pull towards that and I think
that's the sadistic Po and I think a lot
of people I mean see when you say
sadistic it makes it sound like some
kind of it's a pathology it's pleasure
in the suffering of others right but I
just think that all of us
have the capacity for that all humans
have the capacity for that yeah some
more than others but everyone to some
degree and when you're young you don't
understand the full implic of that on
your own self so if you participate in
taking other people down that's going to
have a cost on your own development as a

[1:47:01]
have a cost on your own development as a
human being like it's going to take you
towards a dust's nose from underground
in the basement cynical all that kind of
stuff alone which is why a lot of young
people try it out you know the the
reason is you get older and older you
realize that that there's a huge cost to
that so you don't do it but there's
young people that so like I would I
would like to sort of believe and hope
that a large number of people who are
trolls are just trying out the derision
no doubt and then so they can be saved
they can be they can be helped they
could they could be shown that there's
uh more growth there's more flourishing
to uh celebrating other people and
actually and criticizing ideas but not
in the way of derision LOL but by
formulating your own self in the world
by formulating your ideas in a strong
powerful way and also removing the cloak
of anonymity and just standing behind
your ideas
carrying the responsibility of those
ideas yeah I think all of that is right
I think the idea that that's more likely

[1:48:00]
I think the idea that that's more likely
to occur among young people that's clear
people as they mature get more agreeable
and conscientious so we actually know
that that what you said is true
technically it's definitely the case
that there's a an innate tilt towards
pleasure in that sort of behavior and
it's it is associated to some degree
with dominant striving um and I do think
it's true as you pointed out that many
of the people who are toying with that
pattern
can be socialized out of it in fact
maybe most most people even even the
repeat criminal types tend to desist in
their late 20s so imagine that so 1% of
the criminals commit 65% of the crimes
so imagine that that 1% are the people
that you're really concerned with they
often have stable patterns of offending
that emerged in very very
young like even in infancy and have
and continued through adolescence and
into adulthood if you keep them in
prison until they're in their in the
middle of their late 20s most of them

[1:49:01]
middle of their late 20s most of them
stop and that might be the easiest way
to understand that might just be delayed
maturation
so are most people
salvageable yes definitely is everyone
salvageable well at some point it
becomes first of all they have to want
to be salvaged that's a problem but then
it also becomes something like well how
how much resources are you going to
devote to that like the the farther down
the rabbit hole you've gone the more
energy it takes to haul you up so there
comes a point where the probability that
you'll be able to get enough resources
devoted to you to rescue you from the
pit of Hell that you've dug is zero and
that's a very sad thing and it's very
hard to be around someone who's in that
situation very very hard and it seems
that it's more likely that the leaders
of movements are going to be Psychopaths
and the followers of movements are going
to be the the people that we're
mentioning that

[1:50:00]
mentioning that
are kind of lost themselves to the
ideology of the movement well we we know
that what you said is true even
historically to a large degree because
Germany was successfully densified and
it's not like everybody who participated
in every element of the Nazi movement
was brought to Justice not not in the
least the same thing happened in Japan
so to some degree the same thing
happened in South Africa right and so
and it's the case for example also in
the stories that we were referring to
earlier the biblical Stories the
Patriarchs of the Bible most of them are
pretty bad people when they first start
out like Jacob's a really good Jacob is
the one who becomes Israel he's a major
player in the biblical narrative and
he's a pretty bad actor when he first
starts out he's a mama's boy he's a liar
he uh he steals from his own brother and
in a major way he deceives his father

[1:51:00]
in a major way he deceives his father
he's a coward you know and yet he turns
his life around so be careful the
leaders you idolize in
worship but then it's not always clear
to know who is the good and who's the
evil y that's
hard you have been through some dark
places in your mind over your life uh
what have been some of your dark hours
and how did you find the
light well I would say I started
contending with the problem of evil very
young 13 or
14 and that that's been the
main that was my main
motivation of study
for 30 years I guess something like
that at the end of that 30 years it
became more and more
I became more and more interested in
fleshing out the alternative like once I
became convinced that evil existed and I

[1:52:00]
became convinced that evil existed and I
that was very
young I I always I always believed that
if you could understand something well
enough that you could formulate a
solution to it but it turns out that
seeing evil and understanding that it
exists is less complicated
than a technical description of its
opposite like what is
good you can say well it's not that for
sure it's not owitz how about we start
there it's as far from owitz as you can
get it's as far from enjoying being an
owitz campg guard as you can get okay
well where are you when you're as far
away from that as you could possibly get
what does that mean that and it does
have something to do with play as far as
I'm concerned like I think the
antithesis of Ty is play so that took me
a long time to figure out that
specifically you know um and so that was

[1:53:00]
specifically you know um and so that was
very dark like I spent a lot of time
studying the worst behaviors that I
could discover abstractly in books but
also in my clinical practice and and in
my observations of people and so that's
that's rough um more recently I was very
ill and in a tremendous amount of pain
like that lasted pretty much without any
break for 3 years
and what was particularly useful to me
then was the strength of my
relationships my immediate relationships
my
friendships also the relationships that
I had established more broadly with
people you know
U Because by the time I became illite
was reasonably well known and people
were very supportive when when I was
having trouble and that was very helpful
but it's certainly the case that it was
the connections I had particularly with

[1:54:00]
the connections I had particularly with
my family but also with my friends that
were the Saving Grace and that's
something to know you know I
mean it's necessary to Bear the burdens
of the world on your own shoulders
that's for sure the burdens of your own
existence and whatever other
responsibilities you can mount but that
by no means means that you can or should
do it alone and so you know you might
say
well welcoming the adversity of Life as
a Redemptive challenge is a task that's
beyond the ability of the typical person
or even maybe of anyone but then when
you think well you're not
alone maybe you're you're not alone
socially you're not alone familial maybe
you're not alone metaphysically as well
you know there there's an insistence and
I think it's true there's an insistence
for example in the old and the New
Testament alike that
the more Darkness you're willing to
voluntarily encounter the more likely it
is that the spirit of Abraham and the
Patriarchs will walk with you and I

[1:55:02]
Patriarchs will walk with you and I
think that's right like I I think it's
sort of technically true in that the
best parts of yourself make themselves
manifest if you want to think about it
that way the best parts of yourself
whatever that means make themselves
manifest when
you're contending actively and
voluntarily with the most difficult
challenges why wouldn't it be that way
way and then you could think well that's
yourself it's like well are the best
unrevealed parts of you
yourself well no they're a kind of
metaphysical reality they're not yet
manifest they only exist in potential
they transcend anything you're currently
capable of but they have an existence
you could call that yourself but like it
was yung's contention for example with
regards to such terminology that the
reason we use the term self instead of
God is because when God was dispensed
with let's say by the processes n
described we just found the same thing
deep within the instinctive realm let's

[1:56:02]
deep within the instinctive realm let's
say we found it at the bottom of the
things instead of at the top it's like
it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
fundamentally what matters is whether or
not that's a
reality and I think it's the fundamental
reality because I do think
that the deeper you delve into things
this is what happens to Moses when he
encounters the burning bush so Moses is
just going about his life he's a
Shepherd he's an adult he has wives he
has children he has responsibilities
he's left his home and he's established
himself and so things are pretty good
for
Moses and then he's out by Mount Corb in
that story but it's the central mountain
of the world it's the same Mountain as
SI which is the place where Heaven and
Earth touch and he sees something that
grabs his attention
right that's the burning bush and Bush
is a tree that's life that's the tree of
life and the fact that it's on fire is
that's life ex exaggerated because

[1:57:01]
that's life ex exaggerated because
everything that's alive is on fire and
so what calls to Moses is like the
spirit of being itself and it it tracks
him off the Beaten Track and he decides
to go
investigate so Moses is everyone who
goes off the Beaten Track to investigate
and so as he investigates he delves more
and more deep ly until he starts to
understand that he's now walking on
sacred ground so he takes off his shoes
and that's a symbolic reference of
identity transformation he's no longer
walking the same path he no longer has
the same identity he's in a state of
flux and that's when what happens is
that he continues to interact with this
calling and Moses
asks what it is that's being revealed
and God says I'm the spirit of being
itself that's basically the answer I am
what I am it's it's a more complex
utterance than that I am what I will be
I am what was becoming it's all of that

[1:58:01]
I am what was becoming it's all of that
at the same time it's the spirit of
being that's speaking to him the spirit
of being and becoming and it tells Moses
that he now because he's delved so
deeply into something so compelling his
identity is transformed and he's become
the leader who can speak truth to power
and so he allies himself with his
brother Aaron who's the political arm
and who can communicate and he goes back
to Egypt to confront the Tyrant and
that's that's an indication of that idea
that if you wrestle with life properly
that the spirit of being and becoming
walks with you and it's like I how can
that not be true because the the
contrary would be that there would be no
growth in challenge well
that's you have to be infinitely
nihilistic to believe that it's obvious
but it's also just fascinating that
hardship is the thing that is um that
ends up being the Catalyst for delving

[1:59:01]
ends up being the Catalyst for delving
deeply it's hardship voluntarily
undertaken well and it's crucially true
look if you bring someone into therapy
let's say they're afraid of elevators
and you trick them into getting near an
elevator you'll make them worse but if
you if you negotiate with them so that
they voluntarily move towards the
elevator
on their own
recognizance they they'll overcome their
fear and they become generally braver
but it has to be voluntary see I got to
push back and explore with you the
question of voluntarily yeah let's look
at n yeah he suffered through several
health issues throughout his life
migraines eyesight issues digestive
problems depression with suicidal
thoughts and yet he is one of the
greatest Minds in the history of
humanity so were these problems that he
was suffering arguably
involuntarily a feature or a bug that's
a good question the same thing happens

[2:00:00]
a good question the same thing happens
in the story of job because job is a
good man God himself admits it and the
the Satan comes along and says to God I
I see you're pretty proud of your your
man there job God says yeah he's doing
pretty well and Satan says I think it's
just because things are easy for him let
me have a crack at him and see what
happens and God says yeah I think you're
wrong do your worst right and that's how
people feel when those slings and arrows
come at them let's say like n well job's
response to that now the story is set up
so that what befalls job is actually
quite arbitrary right these catastrophes
that you're describing the volunteerism
in job is his refusal to despair even in
the face of that adversity and that
seems like something like an expression
of voluntary free will he refuses to
lose faith and the the way the story
ends is that job get get everything back
and more and you know so that's a
descent and Ascent story and a cynic
might say well the ends don't justify

[2:01:00]
might say well the ends don't justify
the means and I would say fair enough
but that's a pretty shallow
interpretation of the story what it
indicates instead is that if you're
fortunate because let's not forget that
and
you optimize your attitude even in the
face of adversity that there it's not
infrequently the case that your fortunes
will reverse you know and I found that
in many
situations the
journalists
whose who whose goal was most
malicious in relationship to me who were
most concerned
with improving their own what would you
say fostering their own notoriety and
gaining social status at my expense were
the ones who did me the greatest favor
those were the interview that went
viral and so that's that's interesting
you know because they were definitely
the places where the most disaster was
at hand and I felt that in the aftermath

[2:02:02]
at hand and I felt that in the aftermath
every time that happened our my whole
family was destabilized for like two
months because things it wasn't obvious
at all which way the dice were going to
roll but you leaned into that so in a
sense that there's this kind of a
transformation from the involuntary to
the voluntary basically saying bring it
on that act of Bring It On turns the
hardship involuntary hardship into
voluntary hardship well not necessarily
let's say but you could say that's your
best bet well you know I'm I'm I'm never
going to say that you can transcend all
catastrophe with the right attitude
because that's just too much to say but
I could say
that in a dire situation there's always
an element of choice and if you make the
right choices you you improve the degree
you improve your chances of

[2:03:01]
you improve your chances of
success to the maximal possible degree
it might be too much to say but
nevertheless is could be true Victor
Franco Marcus
aurelus well that's what the
resurrection story proclaims is that you
know even under the darkest imaginable
circumstances the
fundamental finale is the victory of the
good
and that seems to me to be
true do you have regrets when you look
back at your
life in the full analysis of
it well as I said I was very ill for
about 3 years and it was seriously
brutal like every this is no lie every
single minute of that 3 years was worse
than any single time I'd ever
experienced in my entire life up to
that so that was rough was the roughest
the physical or

[2:04:00]
the physical or
psychological pain just literal
pain yep yeah I was walking like 10 to
12 miles a
day rain or shine winter didn't
matter not good and it it was it was
worse than that because
as the day
progressed my pain levels would fall
until
by 10 11 at night when I was starting to
get tired I was
approaching what would you say I was
approaching something like an ordinary
bad
day but as soon as I went to sleep then
the Clock Was reset and all the pain
came back and so it it wasn't just that
I was in pain it was that sleep itself
became an
enemy and that's really rough man
because sleep is where you take refuge

[2:05:01]
because sleep is where you take refuge
you know you're worn out you're tired
and you go to sleep and you wake up and
it's generally it's something
approximating a new day this was like
Copus on steroids and that was it was
very difficult to maintain hope in that
because I would do what I could like
there were times when it took me like an
hour and a half in the morning to stand
up
and so I do all that and more or less
put myself back into something remotely
resembling Human by the end of the day
and then I knew perfectly well exhausted
if I fell asleep that I was going to be
right at the bottom of the bloody Hill
again and so after a couple of years of
that it was definitely the fact that I
had a family that that carried me
through that what did you learn about
yourself
about yourself and about the human mind
from that from all of those days well I
think I learned more
gratitude for the people I had around me

[2:06:00]
gratitude for the people I had around me
and I
learned how fortunate I was to have that
and how crucial that was my wife learned
something similar she she was diagnosed
with a form of cancer that as far as we
know killed every single person who ever
had it except her it's quite rare um
and her experience was that what
really gave her hope and played at least
a role in Saving her was the realization
of the depth of love that her son in
particular had for her and that that
says nothing about her relationship with
Michaela with her daughter it just so
happened that it was the revelation of
that love that made Tammy understand the
value of her life in a way that she
wouldn't have realized of her own accord
we're very very there's no difference
between ourselves and the people that we
love and there might be no difference
between ourselves and everyone
everywhere but we can at least realize

[2:07:01]
everywhere but we can at least realize
that to begin
with in the form of the people that we
love and I hope I'm better at that than
I was I think I'm better at it than I
was I'm a lot more grateful for just
ordinary ordinariness than I was because
when I first recovered I remember I was
standing first started to recover I was
standing in this Pharmacy waiting for a
prescription in little town and they
weren't being particularly efficient
about it and so I was in that standing
in the aisle for like 20 minutes and I
thought I'm not on fire I could just
stand here for like the rest of my life
just not being in pain and enjoying that
and you know that would have been
something that before that would have
been you know I would have been
impatient and RAR to go cuz I didn't
have 20 minutes to stand in the middle
of an
and I thought well you know if if you're
just standing there and you're not on
fire things are a lot better than they
might be and I
certainly I know that and I think I

[2:08:02]
certainly I know that and I think I
remember it almost all the time you gain
a greater ability to appreciate the
mundane moments of Life yeah definitely
the miracle of the mundane right yeah I
think n had
that CU he was very ill and so
I suspect he had you know and he was
regarded by the inhabitants of the
village that he lived in near the end of
his life as something approximating a
saint he apparently conducted himself
very admirably despite all his suffering
you know but that still there's this
tension as there is in much of nicha's
work between the um uh the miracle of
the mundane appreciating the miracle of
the mundane versus uh fearing the
tyranny of the mediocre it's more than
mediocre and resentful yes but that's
you uh giving him a pass or seeing well

[2:09:00]
you uh giving him a pass or seeing well
fair enough you know there's a kind of I
mean the tyranny of the
mediocre I I always hated this idea that
some people are better than others and I
understand it but it's a dangerous idea
this is why I like the story of Kan and
Abel I would
say because C is
mediocre but that's because he refuses
to do his best it's not something
intrinsic to him and I actually think
that's the right formulation because you
know I had people in my clinical
practice who
were they were lost in many dimensions
from the perspective of comparison one
woman I remember in particular who man
she had a lot to contend with she was
not educated she was not intelligent she
had a brutal family like terrible
history of psychiatric hospitalization
um and when I met
her at a

[2:10:01]
hospital she was an
outpatient from the psychiatric ward and
she had been in there with people that
she thought were worse off than her and
they were and that was a long way down
that was like Dante's Inferno level down
it was a long-term psychiatric impatient
Ward some of the of the people had been
there for 30 years it it made uh One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest look like a
romantic
comedy and she had come back to see if
she could take some of those people for
a walk and was trying to find out how to
get permission to do it and so you
know better better than other people
some people are more intelligent some
people are more beautiful some people
are more athletic
is maybe it's possible for everyone at
all levels of attainment to strive
towards the
good and maybe those talents that are

[2:11:00]
good and maybe those talents that are
given to people unfairly don't privilege
them in relationship to their moral
conduct and I I think that's true like
there's no evidence for example that
there's any correlation whatsoever
between intelligence and
morality you're not better because
you're smart and what that also implies
is if you're smart you can be a lot
better at being worse
I think for myself I'm just
afraid of dismissing people because of
my perception of them yeah well that's
why we have that metaphysical
presumption that everybody's made in the
image of God right despite that immense
diversity of apparent ability there's
that underlying metaphysical assumption
that yeah we all vary in
our perceived and actual utility in
relationship to any PR proximal goal but
all of that's independent of the
question of axiomatic worth and that
Preposterous as that notion appears to

[2:12:00]
Preposterous as that notion appears to
be it seems to me that societies that
accept it as a fundamental aaic
presumption are always the societies
that you'd want to live in if you had a
choice and that to me is an existence
proof for the utility of the
presumption and also you know if you
treat people like that in your life
every encounter you have you make the
assumption
that it's it's an assumption of what
would you it's radical equality of worth
despite individual variance in ability
something like that man your
interactions go way better I mean
everyone wants to be treated that way
look here's a developmental sequence for
you naive and
trusting hurt and cynical okay well is
hurt and cynical better than naive and
trusting it's like yeah
probably is that where it ends how about
cynical and
trusting as step three right and then

[2:13:00]
trusting as step three right and then
the trust becomes courage it's like yeah
I'll put my AR my hand out for you but
it's not cuz I'm a
fool and I think that's right because
that's the re-instantiation of that
initial trust right that makes
childhood magical and paradisal but it's
the ad mixture of that with wisdom it's
like like yeah you know we could be we
could walk together
uphill but that doesn't mean and I'll
presume that that's your
aim but that doesn't mean that I'm not
going to watch what's a better life
cynical and safe
or hopeful and vulnerable to be hurt oh
you you can't dispense with vulnerable
to be hurt that's that's the other
realization it's like you're going to
stake your life on something you can
stake your life on security but it's not
going to help you don't have that option
so what do you do when you're betrayed
ultimately by some people you come

[2:14:01]
ultimately by some people you come
across
grieve and look
elsewhere do what you can to
forgive and not least so you lighten
your own
burden maybe do what you can to help the
person who betrayed
you and if that all proves impossible
then
wash your hands of it
and move on to the next adventure and do
it again yeah
yeah boy this life something else uh so
we've been talking about some heavy
difficult topics and you've talked about
truth in your n lectures and elsewhere
when you think when you write when you
speak how do you find what is true you
know Hemingway said uh all you have to
do is write one true sentence yeah how
do you do that well I would say first
that you practice that it's like it that
question is something and and Hemingway

[2:15:00]
question is something and and Hemingway
knew this at least to some degree and he
certainly wrote about it is that you
have to orient your life
upward as completely as you can because
otherwise you can't distinguish between
truth and falsehood it it has to be a
practice know and for me I started to
become serious about that practice when
I realized
that it was individ ual it was the
immorality of the individual the
resentful Craven deceitful immorality of
the individual that led to the terrible
atrocities that humans engage in that
make us doubt even our own worth I
became completely convinced of that that
the fundamental root cause of evil let's
say wasn't economic or
sociological that it was spiritual just
psychological and that if that was the
case you had an ex existential
responsibility to aim upward and to tell
the truth and that everything depends on
that and I became convinced of that and

[2:16:00]
that and I became convinced of that and
so
then
look you set your path with your
orientation that that's how your
perceptions work as soon as you have a
goal a pathway opens up to you and you
can see it and the world divides itself
into obstacles and and things that move
you forward and so the pathway that's in
front of you depends on your aim the
things you perceive are concretizations
of your aim if your aim is untrue then
you won't be able to tell the difference
between truth and falsehood and you
might say well how do you know your aim
is true it's like well you course
correct continually and you can aim
towards the ultimate are you ever sure
that your aim is the right direction you
become increasingly accurate in your
apprehension is it like part of the
process to cross the line to uh to go
outside the over to window to dip a to
outside the open the window for a bit of
course that's what you do in part and
play um I was at the comedy Mothership
and every single comedian was like
completely reprehensible all they were

[2:17:01]
completely reprehensible all they were
doing was saying things that you you
can't say well but it was in play what
I'm trying to do in my lectures is I'm
on the edge like I have a question I'm
trying to address and I'm trying to
figure it out I don't know where the
conversation is going truly like it's
it's an exploration and I think the
reason that the audience is responding
is because they can feel that it's a
Highwire act you know and I could fail
and you know my lectures have degrees of
success sometimes I get real fortunate
and there's a perfect narrative Arc I
have a question I'm investigating it it
comes to a punchline conclusion just at
the right time and it's like the whole
Act is complete and sometimes it's more
fragmented but I can tell when the
audience is engaged because everyone's
silent you know except maybe when
they're laughing but there's a kind of
sense that you're arguing with yourself
when you're lecturing it's beautiful
it's it's really beautiful and Powerful
to watch like nche does the same there's
contradictions in what you're saying
there's a struggle of what you're saying
but I do think that when you're doing
the same on the internet you get

[2:18:00]
the same on the internet you get
punished for the deviations you get
punished for the exploration especially
when that explores outside the over to
window look if you're going to play hard
in a conversation to explore you're
going to say things that cost that are
edgy right that are going to cause
trouble and that might be wrong and that
that's another reason why Free Speech
protection is so important you actually
have to protect the right let's say in
the optimal circumstance you have to
protect the right of well-meaning people
to be wrong now you probably have to go
beyond that to prot truly protect it you
have to even protect the right of people
who aren't meaning well to be wrong you
know and and we also need that because
we're not always well-meaning but but I
don't you know the alternative to that
protection would be the insistence that
people only say what was 100% right all
the time I'm also I guess the is a a
call to our fellow humans not to reduce
a person to a
particular
statement this is what the internet
tends to want to do especially if it's

[2:19:01]
tends to want to do especially if it's
the worst thing they ever said yeah yeah
yeah cuz God well anyone judged by that
standard is doomed unless they're silent
but it also just makes you not want to
play yeah right not want to uh take sort
of radical thought experiments and carry
out that's kind of the definition of a
totalitarian state no one's playing in a
total State ever but in this case it's
an emergent one yeah with Psychopaths uh
roaming the landscape well thean that
that might be the general pattern of
totalitarianism well in totalitarianism
there's usually one psychopath not
multiple yeah but everyone well everyone
else is complicit at least in their
silence yeah does the study of the
pathology of psychopaths online wear on
you yes definitely do you ever consider
doing a less of that yes
yes yes definitely but you

[2:20:00]
know probably I experienced most of that
on
X but that's also where I found most of
my guests that's also where I get a
sense of the Zeitgeist which is
necessary for example if you're going to
be a podcast host it's necessary for me
to make my lectures on point and up to
date to get a sampling of the the
current moment you have to be of the
moment in in many ways to function at a
high level is there a price there's a
price to be paid for that because
you're you're exposed to everything in a
sense and and you can also over sample
the darkness yeah yeah definitely and it
can make you more and more cynical yeah
well it's a danger right yeah yeah well
luckily for me you know I have many
things that counterbalance that the
familiar relationships we talked about
the friendships the and then also all of
the public things I do are positive the
lecture tours for example which I'm on a
lot they're basically 100% positive so

[2:21:03]
lot they're basically 100% positive so
I'm very
well butress against that that's great
to hear darker element as a fan in the
arena watching the Gladiators fight your
mind is too important to be lost to the
cynical to the to the battles with the
uh with the abyss well you you have a
moral obligation too to maintain a
positive positive orientation it's a
moral
obligation the future is of course rif
with contradictory possibilities and I
suppose in some ways the more rapid the
rate of transformation the more
possibility for good and for evil is
making itself manifest at any moment but
it looks like the best way to ensure
that the future is everything we wish it
would be is to maintain faith that that
is the direction that will prevail and I
think that's a form of moral commitment
when it's not just naive optimism well

[2:22:00]
when it's not just naive optimism well
