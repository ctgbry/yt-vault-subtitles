I think at this point large-scale
reliable data is really important but
also important are the human stories and
something that caught my eye was the day
in life of an emergency room doctor
Craig Spencer that he revealed in a
series of tweets thank you everyone for

[00:16]
series of tweets thank you everyone for
the incredible messages of support and
encouragement many of you asked what it
was like in the emergency room right now

the life of an emergency room doc a

amount of oxygen we can give but still
breathing fast you immediately assess
this patient it's clear what this is
what needs to happen you have a long and
honest discussion with the patient and

[01:31]
honest discussion with the patient and
family over the phone it's best to put
her on life support now before things
get much worse you're getting set up for
that but you're notified of another
really sick patient coming in you rush
over they're also extremely sick

[01:46]
over they're also extremely sick

rinse it all away never happier time for
family you reflect on the fact that it's
really hard to understand how bad this
is and how bad is going to be if all you
see are empty streets hospitals and

[04:30]
see are empty streets hospitals and
nearing capacity we're running out of
ventilators ambulance sirens don't stop

this is a moving accounting through a
series of tweets by an emergency room
doctor on the very front lines of
fighting Cove 819 without question the
best thing we could do now is stay home
while people like Craig Spencer doctors
nurses health care workers service

[05:45]
nurses health care workers service
workers support us and treat the people
who are sick and really importantly as
we get more and more reliable data this
isn't the time to panic this is the time
to take optimal action given that we're
operating under a huge amount of
uncertainty the two things we need to do

[06:02]
uncertainty the two things we need to do
is the most important is to save lives
and the second is collect good reliable
data before we can reopen the economy we
have to get good data to understand the
spread of the virus in order to be able

spread of the virus in order to be able
to control it and all the while treating
people who are sick without overwhelming
the resources of our medical system stay
