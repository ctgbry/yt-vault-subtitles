- When you meditate, we're
all human, we're all mortal.
When you meditate on your own mortality,
having achieved a lot of
success on whatever dimension,
what do you think is
the meaning of it all,

[00:16]
the meaning of our short existence
on Earth as human beings?
- I think that evolution
is the greatest force
in the universe, and
that we're all tiny bits
of an evolutionary type of
process where it's just matter

[00:34]
and machines that go through
time, and that we all have
a deeply embedded inclination
to evolve and contribute to evolution.

[00:47]
So I think it's to personally evolve
and contribute to evolution.
- I could have predicted
you would answer that way.
It's brilliant and exactly right.
