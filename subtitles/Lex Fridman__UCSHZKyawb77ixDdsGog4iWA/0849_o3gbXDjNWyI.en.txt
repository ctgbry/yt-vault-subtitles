[00:00]
- You said that Red Dead Redemption 2, in
your opinion, is the best thing you've ever
done. I think there's a strong case to be
made that it's the greatest game of all time.
What are the elements that make that
game truly great, do you think?
- People searching for meaning amongst
the violence. I think that the West
and all the themes around the
West really lend itself to that.
And the gunplay was fantastic, and the
horses were incredible. I think we got
to spend, a smaller group of
us, working on it from day one,
coming up with some weird, wacky ideas
that we got to embed in the game. It
was helpful that we got to be very
creative before it had a full team on it.
- You lock yourself in a room and get
anchovies and onion pizza and crushed...
Diet Cokes?
- Yes.
- Is this accurate information?
- Very accurate.
- Why do you think there was so much excitement
about GTA IV, GTA V, and now GTA VI?
- I think we did a really good job of
constantly innovating. The games
always felt different. People have very
strong feelings: "I like this one."
"I didn't like that one as much,"
because they are pretty different.

[01:02]
So you know what's going to happen. It's a
Grand Theft Auto, you know it's going to be
a game about being a criminal, but the way it's
going to be a game is going to change quite a lot.
- The number one question from the
internet, it is so ridiculous, but I must
ask, "Have you seen Gavin?" The following
is a conversation with Dan Houser, a
legendary video game creator,
co-founder of Rockstar Games, and the
creative force behind Grand Theft
Auto and Red Dead Redemption
series, which includes some of the
best-selling games of all time
and some of the greatest
games of all time.
Both Red Dead Redemption
1 and 2 have some of the
deepest, most complex, and
heart-wrenching characters and
storylines ever created in video games.
Dan has started a new
company, Absurdventures,
great name, that is creating
some incredible new worlds in
multiple forms, including books,
comic books, audio series, and
yes, video games. That includes A Better

[02:03]
Paradise, which is a dystopian
near-future world with a
super intelligent AI,
American Caper, which is
an insanely chaotic,
violent, dark, satirical
world, and Absurdiverse,
which is a comedic
action-adventure world. I'm excited to
explore all three of these. I have spent
hundreds of hours in worlds that
Dan has helped create, so this
conversation was an incredible
honor for me. And on top of
that, Dan and I talked a lot
after and in the days since,
and he has been just a
wonderful human being.
I'm just at a loss of
words. I feel like the
luckiest kid in the world.

dear friends, here's Dan Houser.

[03:03]
You've helped create some of the most
incredible characters, stories, and
open worlds in video game
history. But when you grew up in
the late '70s and '80s,
open-world video games
wasn't a thing. So you've
credited literature and film
as early inspiration. So let's
talk about film first, if we can.
- Sure.
- What to you are some of the candidates
for the greatest films of all time,
maybe films that were highly
influential on you? I mean, Godfather.
- God, well, I think for me, probably Godfather II
more than Godfather I, but I love both of them.
But I love the divided story in
Godfather II. And as a migrant,
I used to live in Soho.
I love the bits in
Little Italy, and I love
the sections in Sicily. I
think and the bit, Ellis
Island is just one of the
best shots in all of cinema.
When you see little Vito turning up in
Ellis Island and you get that shot, it's
amazing. It gives you a really good
cinematic sense of what it must have been

[04:02]
like to arrive in America.
- How much of the greatness of
Godfather do you think is the
writing? How much is the cinematography
and how much is the acting?
You got De Niro, you got young Pacino.
- Coppola started as a screenwriter, so
I think he wrote, at least co-wrote
the script. So it's almost like the writing,
directing almost become the same thing.
But it's one of those films, both of them
are those films, which I was thinking about
this idea of a perfect film
where everything's good.
Where the acting's seminal, where the
writing's seminal, where the music is
seminal, where the shots are so
memorable, where the scenes you
know, define what you think about things.
It's impossible to think about the
mafia and not think about The Godfather.
- What about the pacing? It is a bit
slow. You have movies like 2001
Space Odyssey, slow.
- Yes.
- It used to be, back in my
day, it used to be slow.
- Life got faster. Life just got, you know,
as I think as we moved from the '70s into
the '80s, into the '90s,
people had seen so many films,

[05:03]
they just started to edit films faster.
And people understood cinematic
storytelling so much that you
could do things much quicker,
you could show a look and just that
meant you realized that person was
gonna betray the other person. They
just edited films much quicker.
But I quite like the slowness. I think
these days with modern, you know,
high quality televisions, you don't have to
necessarily watch these films in one sitting,
particularly when you're rewatching them. So it
doesn't bother me that they're long and slow.
- Speaking of faster, life
getting faster, I...
I'm sure another influential movie was
Goodfellas, Scorsese. That's faster, right?
- Yes.
- A mixture of crime and humor.
- And almost like an open world game in
some ways, in that it's this slice of
life. You know, I think that probably
changed cinema at the tail end of the '80s,
changed cinema at the sort
of tail end of the '80s,
early '90s, more than any
other film. And it's so
iconic. In some ways I prefer
Casino, but the invention
is really in Goodfellas. I love the
end of Casino, you know, the use of

[06:03]
voiceover, the way you saw
them being criminals and being
normal people, you know, it changed
everything. The Sopranos is obviously
completely inspired by Goodfellas.
- Casino has, first of all, the character
of Sharon Stone. I mean, everything.
- The look, the clothes... ...The music.
- I would say one of the most
memorable moments in film for me
is the meeting in the desert. I mean, just
the drama building up to that between...
- Dig another hole.
- Yeah. The environment, the city,
speaking of open world and creating a
character from the city. It's
one of the great Vegas films.
- I think the great Vegas film. There
are bits that I always... that I
love. At the end, when everything's
wrapping up, and on the one hand you
see the Robert De Niro character,
he's still good at making money, so
they let him return to normal life. But then
you get that brilliant scene when all of the,
the mob bosses from back
home, they're discussing
all these people who may or may not be
able to implicate them. And then there's
that incredibly cold line where one of
them, they're thinking about the old,

[07:03]
you know, I think it's the casino manager, and one
of them just goes, "Ah, the way I see it, why take a
chance?" And then the next thing, he's
just shot. The brutality of it all is just
brilliant.
- I don't know, I probably have to disagree with
you on Vegas. There's at least some competitors.
You got what, Nicolas Cage Leaving Las
Vegas? I mean, falling in love with a
prostitute. You've written some
of the great crime stories ever.
- Thank you.
- And in some sense, there's love stories
in there. And you've talked about-
...being a bit of a romantic yourself.
Appreciating the depth of love
stories in literature at the
very least. And there is a dark
kind of love story between an
alcoholic and a prostitute.
He got an Oscar for that.
- I think he did for that, didn't he?
- Plus there's the caricature of the
drug world of Fear and Loathing in
Las Vegas. That's an interesting one.
- I love the book so much. I was obsessed
by it when I was about 17, 18.
And I enjoyed the film,
but I preferred the book.
- Has a Hunter S. Thompson type of character
ever made it into any of your stories?

[08:03]
- No, but one of the things we're
working on now, there's sort of
an English version of Hunter
S. Thompson if he was also a
market gardener. I love
that persona. But he's kind
of... it's hard. If you make him American,
it's hard for it not just to be Hunter
S. Thompson.
- Is this an American caper?
- No, it's in this animated
show we're developing in
this sort of comedy world we're working on called
Absurdiverse, and it's in one of the stories in
that.
- What is Absurdiverse?
- Absurdiverse is a comedy
universe we're developing that
will be an open-world video game
and then some loosely adjacent
stories that we're going to
make as animated TV shows or possibly animated
movies. We're still thinking that all
through. And we're building
the game up in San
Rafael at the moment, and it's
early days, but it's looking very
exciting. And it's trying to be... like,
trying to make a game that feels a
a little bit like a living sitcom.

[09:02]
- Is there some drama and tragedy at
the edges, or is it pure comedy?
- I hope it's got comedy, cynicism, heart,
drama, and some amusing life lessons.
Otherwise, you can't just have
jokes for 40 hours, it won't work.
- Okay, so comedy needs some darkness.
- Well, I think it needs story. One of
my favorite comedies of this century
is The Office because it was incredibly
funny, but also because it had narrative
and heart underneath the cynicism. I
think with narrative, you get a drive
alongside jokes.
- And there's going to be
an open-world video game.
- Yes. Yes.
- When?
- Two, three, four years.
Still thinking that through.
- So, what's the process of getting from
the idea to the end of a video game?
Why does it take so long to get it right?
- That's an interesting question. I think if
you look at the scale at which they're built,
you could argue it the other way, why
is it so quick? I mean, you really are
building, in one go, a world, a city, and
40 hours of entertainment cut through it.

[10:03]
and 40 hours of entertainment cut
through it. You know, these things are
massive four-dimensional mosaics that are
intensely complicated and have to work
in lots of different ways. And I think
that's us being kind of aggressive on
the timeline.
- We're taking a tangent upon
a tangent upon a tangent,
but I have to return to some films. Let
me just list a few of my favorites.
So first of all, you said
you love great war books.
- Yes.
- and movies.
- Yes.
- So we have to throw in Platoon from Oliver
Stone and Apocalypse Now, for me at least.
- Of course.
- There's more crime,
fast-moving crime movies,
like Scarface. I also love True Romance.
- I love True Romance. Possibly the best,
one of the best scripts ever written.
- Written, of course, by Quentin Tarantino.
What do you love about True Romance?
I think sometimes, depending on the
day, depending on the bar and how
much alcohol I've had, I will say
True Romance is the best movie ever made.
- Yeah, I mean, True Romance is super fun.
Tony Scott was a really good director,

[11:02]
so it moves at a really good speed. It's
funny, it's completely unbelievable,
but you really care about the characters.
It's the kind of, you know, this world
that obviously doesn't exist, but you
feel it does exist. The characters
are larger than life. The dialogue is
unbelievable. You could just sit and watch
them talk all day long. And, you know,
you just... it's amusing. You just want to
live in that world. I was thinking about,
like, what do you like about films? It's
the idea to be in a world. You want
to... they're not real. They're never real,
but you want to be in these fake worlds
that people have invented.
- And I think you said that what makes a
great world is having a large cast of
characters. And I think that movie is a
good example. I mean, you have Christopher
Walken with the sort of legendary
super racist discussion.
- Yeah. Rant.
- Rant.
- Dennis Hopper is just sort of a dream dad.
- Yeah. Dream dad.
And just that interaction is
legendary. You got even Brad Pitt as a
pothead on the couch.
- Gary Oldman.
- As a rasta.
- Yeah, and you have... I
mean, a real love story.

[12:04]
Like, a real, genuine, pure love
can survive in any context.
- And it's just sweet. Their love
story is very sweet in that film.
- Yeah.
- It's endearing.
- The... Elvis is a character.
It's kind of like a mini
GTA type game. Some of the same
beauty, the comedy, the love, the-
- Yeah, and it's all crossed with Play It
Again, Sam. It sort of feels a bit like
that with the Elvis character.
- What about greatest war film?
What would it be for you?
- Greatest war film? If I'm
feeling serious, it would be
a Russian film called Come and See.
which is probably the most intense
film ever made. And if I'm
feeling slightly less serious,
Apocalypse Now, and I would
always want to watch the original cut.
I don't prefer the re-edits. I like the
original first release. I think it's
tighter and slicker and works the best.
- Yeah, of course, Apocalypse Now is this
hallucinatory journey into darkness,
I think, madness.
- Yeah, but from your first-
- scene onwards, it's just got these
amazing set piece after set piece
and, again, incredible
characters, brilliant dialogue.

[13:04]
- Some of the greatest films about war
reveal that war is not what it seems,
and there's different ways of doing that.
And you've talked about different books.
The Thin Red Line is another book—
...and movie that shows that.
- Yeah, yeah, and I watched the movie
years before I read the book,
and I didn't understand the movie.
And then I read the book,
and I read a lot about the
editing of the movie, and I understood
why I didn't understand the movie,
and that's 'cause the movie makes no sense.
It is beautifully shot, and the music is
one of the best film scores of all
time. But they edited two different
battle scenes into one battle in a way that
they're spread apart by ages in the book
to assemble... I think they filmed the book
pretty much verbatim. It would've been as a
six-hour movie, then edited this impressionistic
thing that's incredibly beautiful
but doesn't necessarily make
narrative sense at the end of it.
But it's still very beautiful, the film.

[14:00]
- And in terms of Westerns, what's the
greatest? The Good, the Bad and the
Ugly, Unforgiven? Those are
for me, maybe even Django
Unchained. You've mentioned Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
- I think for me it's two films from, I
think, pretty much the same year, Butch
Cassidy and The Wild Bunch.
- I love Robert Redford. Rest in peace.
- That film, it's just impossible to imagine
any buddy film without Butch Cassidy.
- It's Paul Newman, Robert Redford,
and Clint Eastwood for you, also?
Has that impacted your
writing on Red Dead?
- I love Unforgiven, but the truth is
with Red Dead, I'd seen a lot of Westerns
as a kid. My dad watched lots of
Westerns. They were always on
TV. You know, I felt I knew a
lot, quite a bit about Westerns. And then,
you know, then I had to start
thinking about writing one for work.
And I deliberately did not binge on
Westerns. I tried to watch no more Westerns
and just think about what I liked
about them, what I didn't like about
them, what would be a take that
would work today and would

[15:01]
work within the confines of
a game. And I think Red Dead
1 was a slightly more traditional
Western. And then having done that,
tried to take Red Dead 2 in a
different direction so that it felt
like a worthy successor. Didn't
just feel like more of the same.
- From movies to video games,
when did you first fall in love
with video games? Literature
was the first love.
- No, films.
- Films.
- Films was always, well, what I
loved first as a kid was films. Um,
older... Began reading books
properly aged about eight. Was
watching films long before that.
- Nice.
- And then probably it was always bouncing
between the two, which I preferred.
I think they're good at
different things. Games,
I played and, above all, watched a lot
of games as a kid, as being a young kid,
you know, other people playing
them. Um, and I obviously liked
the core thing games do, which is
you press a button and something

[16:00]
happens. They're responsive,
they're alive, and that's
captivating. And then the competitive
angle of games is fun, or you
know, beating this, beating that,
winning this. That was fun as well.
Sometimes obsessively so. You know,
I remember being completely addicted
at one point when I should've been
studying, for months at a time, to Tetris
on a Game Boy. You know, I liked
games and I liked interactivity and
I liked the movement to this digital
world that's really emerged for
me pretty much as soon as I
left college. But I didn't love
it. And then I really
fell in love with games
when I was properly making them,
probably as late as like 2001.
- Oh, wow.
- And when I suddenly began to see...
First of all, my mind, you know, that's
a whole nother story, but just
suddenly saw what they could do
and could be and what this chance
was to be one of the
people involved in making
these things that was this, you
know, where you were really kind of

[17:00]
breaking trail into the future, it felt like. And
I think that was when I really went, "These are
amazing." And that's when I really
fell in love with... I could see it in
moments and suddenly you could make this whole
experience. So that was really the moment for
me.
- Yeah, of course, because you were
a pioneer of open-world games that
are so narrative-driven. So it's like
you didn't have too many examples.
- Yeah, before that it
was PS1 or even before
that. Games looked terrible.
You know, you would be like
it's eight pixels, it's a car. You know,
it was not a car. They just didn't...
It was always you were squinting and
closing both your eyes and trying to
imagine it was this thing you were told it
was. And all they were about, you know,
very surreal subject matter 'cause
you couldn't make them remotely real.
And suddenly we were able to build
these experiences where you could run a
simulation of a city and
it was in three dimensions
and it felt alive. And we
were trying to give it even
more, at least the illusion of even
more life. And yet you see you could

[18:00]
tell a story in three or, you
know, using time, in four
dimensions, and that felt very inspiring.
- Yeah, I think GTA III
is probably one of the most influential
games of all time. It created a
feeling of an open world. What do
you think it takes to create that
feeling? There were like these looming
skyscrapers. There were the changing
traffic lights. There's the feeling
like, first of all, you had a
feeling you could do anything,
and then the world was reacting to it.
- Yes
- in a way that didn't feel scripted.
- Yes, and it wasn't scripted.
It was really, really, really
low-rent AI. It was a
simulation that you could
prod and push and see what
happened, and I think that was
incredibly... It was two
things. It was the fact that
here was a simulation that you could mess
about with and the simulation seemed to
have a personality. So you could
push and see... And the world would
push you back in whatever way that
meant. And then the other thing

[19:02]
was just this... I think one of the
reasons it was so captivating was
also the idea of if I did
nothing, the world still existed.
Or I could act in quite a passive way. I
could just listen to the radio, I could...
Look at billboards, I could talk to
pedestrians, and not in GTA III, but by
Vice City, you could begin
rudimentary talking. And the world
was there and existing, and so it was
the idea of almost something that really
tried to explore in lots of games,
the idea of being a digital
tourist. You know, you
were in, you were in
these worlds, and you went there
as a visitor, and they existed
almost independent of you. It felt like
when you turned up, the world was running.
It didn't feel like you'd started it. Of
course, you had started it, but that feeling,
I think, was one of the things, the illusions
that people found very captivating,
was, "I'm in a world that both
doesn't exist and does exist."
- So there are these two concepts that I
was reading about, just to put names on
them: one is systemic video
game design, so systemic

[20:00]
games, and the other is
sandbox video games. And
the systemic is from the environment
perspective, which means that there are these
interlocking game rules and systems that
interact with each other and produce
emergent behavior.
And that emergent behavior is what creates
a feeling like there's a living world.
And then the sandbox aspect, which is
overlapping but different, is from
the user perspective, from the
player perspective, the feeling
like you can do anything. And when
those two things combine, the feeling
like you can do anything, and
the feeling like there's a world
that's full, that is
also doing anything it
wants, that creates this incredible
feeling of, like, "This world is alive.
- And I'm in it."
- And it's the combination of those two
things, I think, that is very powerful.
And I think with GTA III,
you know, for me, it came at a
really interesting time in my life

[21:01]
personally, and I was very able to engage in
it, probably for the first time professionally,
actually away to do something.
And we were really sort
of scratching, began to scratch the surface
on how do we fill these worlds with
content, and how do we make that content
interesting and make the content all
interwoven? So, as you start to
mess with these systems, they also
feel alive and interesting.
- There's often been a tension
through your work between an
open world, that freedom,
and the narrative...
...driven storytelling. And I think you've
often, maybe always, gotten the balance
right. So what is the value of each,
and how do you get the balance right?
- Well, I think the open world is intrinsically
pretty fun. It's just fun to be
in a world and have complete freedom. And
certainly, I think at various points,
we debated or, you know,
I'd have theoretical
discussions in my own head with myself, or
other people in the team would really push

[22:02]
for less story, less story.
You know, let the whole thing
evolve organically. You know, have it
all be procedural. Have it all just
evolve from what you do. I think
for me, I would always come
back to going, "Story can be,
if done well, can be incredibly
compelling, and it gives you
some structure." So, I think...
and something to do, and it
helps you from a game design
perspective unlock the features.
It means we know the features,
the big features 'cause they, you know,
essentially when you put someone in a
world and give them a whole new way of
interacting with that world through the
control panel, it can be a little overwhelming.
You know, playing a game is a lot more of an
engaging experience even than reading
a movie, you know, reading a book
or watching a movie. You've got to engage
in it properly. So how you unlock the
features and how you unlock the
world, there's an art and a skill to
that. And I think we felt that
a structured story was the
best way to do that and to have control
over that process. And also just, you know,

[23:01]
people are looking in their lives for
story. I think story's very important and
very powerful, and when you combine the
two successfully, you get the best of both
worlds. But it is a... You know, there
is a tension always there. I think
in a game like GTA IV, which I worked
on and loved and I thought the story
was great, but we got criticized because
people felt there was almost too much
story, and that meant you cared too
much about Niko, and he wasn't as
effective an avatar in the
open world. I think we
probably got closest to reconciling
them as perfectly as they can be
done in Red Dead II, or when playing
as Trevor in GTA V if you
wanted to be crazy. I think those
were when it really worked, the
character, absolute freedom, 'cause
also you didn't want... In any
game, you don't really want to compel the
player. If you're giving them freedom, you don't
want to say, "Well, I'm giving you freedom, but then I'm taking
it away 'cause you've got to be this kind of person when you're
free."
So I liked it when it could be... He
could, you know, he or she could veer to

[24:01]
be nice, veer to be nasty. I think that's
when it was at the strongest. So you kind of
want a character that was rounded and
you felt had good sides and bad sides.
- But you felt that character's personality.
- Yes.
- You felt the depth. You've actually talked
about this... the really powerful concept of
creating a 360-degree
character. I think somewhere
you mentioned that in order to do
that, you had to be able to imagine
what that character would do
in any possible situation.
... which is a really interesting
philosophical concept. I started to
immediately think of that, can I imagine...
How good of an NPC am I? Can I
imagine myself in every possible
I tried to do that very much when I,
when I look at human history,
when I look at the Roman Empire,
when I look at World War II within the
German side, the Russian side, the British
side, the American side, just I
imagine myself if I was a soldier.
- But that exercise, like
if you put Trevor as a
soldier in World War II, what would he do?
- No, I mean, that may be going a little bit too
far. But basically, what are the limits of the

[25:00]
integrity? What are the limits?
of how romantic is he? How narcissistic?
All those kinds of elements you have to
think about in order to
create the full character.
What does it take to create that kind
of 360 character? How hard is it?
- It was a lot of thinking. Sometimes a
year from when we begin talking about
a project and dialing it. I would just
get some initial ideas,
like one sentence. They are
a Serbian immigrant, or they are
a retired gunfighter with a wife
in, you know, type. Very simple
stuff. And then just start
to think through it from every angle.
And you know, start to think,
"Would it work if they acted like
this? Would it work if you acted
like that? If this is the world,
how does it contrast with the world?"
Because I always thought the games were a
kind of mathematical equation.
They were the personality of the

[26:01]
world, you know, multiplied or
divided by the personality of the
protagonist. And when that creates
interesting friction, that's a
really fun experience for the
player. It's almost always
at least one or more of the
protagonists, cause obviously
in GTA5 we had more than
one. We'd have someone
who'd moved to the place or was in a new part
of the place, or moved to a new part of the
map, cause it was really, as a player, I think
it was really easy, much more easy, to identify
with your avatar when they,
like you, were a fish out of
water. And even when they weren't, we
still made them dissatisfied and feel like
a fish out of water themselves. So I
think it was just living with those
characters and getting ideas and going,
"What are their strengths? What are their
weaknesses? How are they like me? How are
they not like me?" You know, and then
and slowly, what is it like
to feel like a human being?
You know, and then in most of
these games, how much of a

[27:03]
psychopath are they? How much of a
sociopath are they? And what are their good
qualities? What is going to give them
humanity alongside that? What are
they, what are they, what for
them apart from money is worth
dying for? And then you start to
build it out from these fundamental
sides. And suddenly you go, "Okay, actually I can
start to feel..." And then how do they speak?
You know, because fundamentally it doesn't really matter what's
going on in their head. They haven't actually got one, but what
they say is what's going to
make you realize who they are.
- So develop more depth and
complexity on the good and evil
side of that human that is a part of all
of all human beings. So you're basically
living with that character. Then if we can
contrast what is it, Nico and Trevor
with, for example, another character I'm sure you've
been living with for a while, which is the AI
system, Nigel Dave, you've
been working on recently.
As part of A Better Paradise World,
which is more dystopian, dark, tragic,
still funny, philosophically deep.

[28:01]
- I hope so.
- But the AI system in there, the super
intelligent AI system, is named Nigel Dave.
And it has, I mean, at least from
my current experience with it,
it has a conflicting nature.
Maybe it's psychopathic; I haven't
quite figured that out yet.
- I don't think he's decided.
- Yeah, I don't think he's decided
either, but he seems to be
bent on world domination, although he
doesn't take credit for it. He wants to
fix humanity and
it seems that the "children," quote
unquote, that it creates are the real
monsters. And actually, there's a
really interesting idea there which is
maybe it's not the AGI, ASI we should
be afraid of, but the children it
creates. Because the AGI has this human-like
good and evil in it; it's conflicted,
it's chaotic, it wants to be
human, it wants to be loved, maybe
it wants to love. But the children,
the monsters it creates, are the

[29:03]
ones that are doing the world
domination, the maximizing paper clips.
Anyway, that's a character and you have to
build that up, you have to think through that.
So you've been living with
that one for a while?
- Yeah, I've been living with him for
the last few years, on and off.
I felt with a lot of portrayals of AI,
they tended to be one note, and AI
was sort of infinitely clever, but
didn't really have much purpose apart from to
kill everybody and was just this kind of sort of
Borg-like fog.
And I thought, "That's fine, but maybe we can
do something, you know, more interesting."
AI is being built by humans,
and humans, you know, and built
by computer engineers, and there's
a lot of power struggles in
any computer engineering team. So I just wanted
to explore the idea of it was built by two
lead engineers who didn't like each other.
So, Nigel Dave, who's renamed himself,
they wanted to call him something sort of
Primal Adam, and he renamed himself Nigel
Dave 'cause one dad was called Nigel,
and one dad was called Dave. And he's
just riddled with these conflicts and

[30:04]
riddled with his, it's
gonna become clear in the
next, or clearer in the next
volume of the book and and
in the game, he's riddled with
his dad's previous careers.
But he is, I, with the idea of he's
almost infinitely intelligent or can
learn almost everything, but has zero
wisdom. And so the only thing he knows,
and then he's seeing the world through the
internet. The most he can do to be
in the human world is hack into
someone's phone and watch them, but he's stuck,
pressed against. He can't actually get into our
world. So he's, he can control
people's minds arguably, but he
can't control the world. And so he wants
to be human, he wants to have these human
experiences. He sees all this stuff on,
you know, the internet, goes, "Oh, I want
to get married. I want to fall in love. I
want to..." 'Cause that seems fun. "I want to
have..." You know, he's a digital
creation, so he wants to have
metaphysical experiences, and he's trying to imagine
what that will be like. "Oh, that's what children
are." You know, "That's what love
is." And he's... So I think he's

[31:02]
So I think he might be a sociopath,
and he certainly has sociopathic
tendencies. But then
he kind of thinks that
if he can imagine good and try to do
good, that will make him a good AI.
So I think there's something
sympathetic about him.
And I kind of like him as a character, but I
don't think he's going to be the protagonist.
He's more of a side character.
- But an ever-present one.
- Yes, or nearly ever-present. Occasionally,
he sulks and goes off and hides somewhere
and stops paying attention.
- Yeah, but there are some characters
that really create a flavor of a world.
- In his world, he was built
as an AI agent for this
digital, large-scale, massively
multiplayer video game these
people were trying to build. And so
he's almost like God in his world.
He's not quite God, but he's got a lot of the
qualities of God. So he has to deal with,
"Am I God? Am I human? Do I exist?"
- And of course, there's the leader
of the, the CEO of the company,

[32:00]
that's also a character.
That's probably an amalgamation
of many of the leaders of the
different AI companies today.
His name is Mark Tyburn.
And Kurt, one of the employees...
of the company talks about Tyburn
as, "He hated humanity more
than he loved it. Perhaps all
the most extreme fantasists are
like that. All those people who
want to build their own utopia.
They love the idea of heaven
more than the reality of Earth."
Do you think that's always going to be the
case for the most part, that power and
money is going to corrupt
the people that create ASI?
- Yes. I mean, I think there are
two processes. I think there's
the power and money corrupted him in
the end, as well, but I also think
that there's something fundamentally
anti-human about people who want to build
utopias, or paradises, or heavens.
'Cause what they're saying

[33:01]
is, "I like humans apart
from the bad bits."
And I mean, I try to be a
pluralist who likes all kinds of
people. And I think there's a side
where people are just hideous
perfectionists, want to get
rid of the rough and the nasty
and the ugly and the dirty.
And that's a huge side of us.
So I worry about those people.
I find them, you know, it's a
different kind of sociopathic behavior.
- "I like humans apart from the bad
bits." That's so beautifully put. Yeah,
that there's... It's so counterintuitive,
but the people that say,
"We're almost there, we
just need to... There's
this path we take and
we'll be perfect then"
and that somehow gets us into trouble.
It's so fascinating that we have to
like the bad bits, we have to love
the bad bits about humans. Those
bugs are features.
- Yeah, and there's bad bits
and there's flaws. And I
think we're all flawed, and we can
really try to be better people. But we

[34:01]
still have to accept that we're flawed and we're not
perfect, and we have to accept that in other people.
And I think when we do that,
we're more human, and that's
probably usually the right course.
- I mean, it really is a return to that
Solzhenitsyn line of, "The line between good
and evil runs through the heart of every
man." And he also, like, the full description
of that is really powerful, which is
the line moves from day to day, from
month to month throughout the life of the
person as they understand better and better.
And as the perspectives shift,
as you evolve, as the world
around you evolves, as you gain
deeper and deeper understanding.
And as the flaws in this
combinatorial way affect your
own understanding of your own flaws
and self-reflection. So yeah,
it's a beautiful mess, and
all of us have that line.
- Yes, and I think when you forget
about that line, then you get in real
trouble. When you forget there's
good and evil in you, in others,
in the world, that there is both good and
evil, and there's certainly good. And that

[35:02]
all we can try to do is be better.
- And it's funny, that Naiyo Dave,
by the way, I like the name.
It grew on me very quickly. Has
that line and is struggling
with it. And it's fascinating to
watch. It's really, as a character and
there's also going to be a video game
of A Bitter Paradise, potentially?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Yeah, we've got that in early
development in Santa Monica.
- Oh, nice.
- And it's pretty fun.
It's very early, but we
assembled a really fun team,
and they're doing amazing
work. So it's a pleasure
to work with them.
- I mean, it would be so great and
I suppose new for you because
it's kind of near-term future.
- Yes. First, I always... Well, I
always wanted to do something
in the sci-fi-ish space.
But only if I could do
it... I was like, "Well, what is sci-fi?"
It's science fiction, right? Science is
a theory plus fiction.
And so I've always thought the best sci-fi
for me was when it wasn't just kind of space

[36:01]
opera, but there was a
real obvious sort of
hypothesis. The story was Blade Runner,
is my favorite, and that's obvious, you
know, the replicants are
better than the humans.
And so this, I finally felt we
found an interesting hypothesis.
The AI is more intelligent than
us, but he's also as broken as we
are. That was an interesting
hypothesis to explore. You know, what
happens when AI runs rampant
in its own fake digital
world? That was the... I felt
that we had a hypothesis that
was worth exploring, and could give
us some really interesting visuals
and give us a really
interesting story to tell.
- And it would be incredible to
create a sort of AI video game
as the world is developing smarter
and smarter AIs. It allows us
as humans to play the game and
to reflect on the thing that we
humans are creating. It's a real
commentary as the thing is happening.
So I have to ask, as a
person who loves literature,
and one of the, if not the greatest
writer in video game history. Kurt,

[37:03]
in the book- of Better Paradise,
has this nice line that I think is
thoughtful: "At one point in
college, I even wanted to be
a writer. How ridiculous is
that? A writer. Language
models ended that fantasy for me
and millions of others. So instead,
I decided to get a master's in
marketing and started to sell language
models." So you, as a writer and creator
of some of the most legendary narratives,
- Thank you
- in recent history, how
do you feel about LLMs
being able to write in a way
that looks awfully human?
- I'm not that afraid of
them for large-scale
concepts. I don't think they're going
to be very good at that. I think if you
were... I think it's harder if... I
began and I was too shy to tell anyone
I wanted to be a writer.
That's why I ended up in video
games. And I would scribble away,
like writing manuals and writing

[38:00]
on like PS1 games, all 12 lines of
dialogue in a game. Sometimes I wouldn't
even get that job and I'd just
write the website copy. And
then by working your little
bits and pieces. And then,
you know, I'd luckily done enough work
that when GTA III turned up, it was
the first thing that resembled real
writing. I had all of the small bits of
skills that I could assemble into
it. Based on my fairly limited
understanding of how language models
work, they're not going to replace good
ideas. They can't really come up
with good new ideas. What they can
do is do low-level stuff. So I think it's
going to be harder for people to start out in
some of these spaces. If you're not a very
good concept artist, you're in a lot of
trouble. If you have original ideas,
I think you're fine. But I think,
I also think that they've done
the first 90% of the work
to sound human, 95% possibly
in some areas. The last
5% is going to end up being
about 95% of the work.

[39:02]
I think that last bit with
tech, in my experience with
things like facial animation, it's always
been the last bits and pieces that take
far longer than the first bit. And so I'm
probably a hideous Luddite, but I'm less
scared than a lot of people. I think you're going
to end up with a lot of work that looks the same.
It's going to help people be creative in some
ways. It's going to get some people who probably
shouldn't be in that space out of that space.
But if you've got talent, I think it'll be
fine.
- Yeah, I agree with you totally,
actually. And it's hard to really
put a finger on it. So, one
way to illustrate that, I
speak English and Russian,
and I'm reading Dostoevsky in
both languages and using LLMs to translate
back and forth because I was preparing
to have a conversation with
the translators of Dostoevsky.
- Which ones?
- Uh, Richard Pevear and Larisa Volokhonsky.
- Yeah. I read it when they first did
Crime and Punishment. That was amazing.
- They're wonderful translators, and
a wonderful love story too. But

[40:01]
in the translation process, you
get to see the LLM is missing
some magic. And that couple of
translators are world-class experts
at capturing the magic. And I can't quite
put that into words. Because you said, like,
totally novel ideas, yes. But also this
magic of the timing, the
right word at the right time,
- Yeah. The phrasing.
- captures the human experience. So
they can do some really incredibly
human-like, the 90%, like you mentioned,
human-like phrasing about the bulk of the
storytelling. But the magic,
you know, whether it's the
endings of Red Dead Redemption
one and two, the timing of
that, the word choice of that,
everything around that. But it's
hard to argue because they're incredibly
impressive, winning all kinds
of math competitions. But what is
that magic? And again, that could
be just a romantic human
side of me saying that LLMs

[41:02]
won't be able to capture that, maybe
desperately holding on for hope.
- I don't think they're going to come up with magic. I
think they're going to be fantastic at coming up with
really cheap, decent stuff.
- I have to ask you about your writing
process. We can break it up. On Grand
Theft Auto- GTA IV is when it
really started ramping up. How much
writing went into the Grand Theft
Auto series? How many words are we
talking about? I saw thousands of pages.
- I mean, when we printed out the scripts
for GTA IV, it was about this high.
And GTA V, it was about that high. But that was
including all the pedestrians who had pages and
pages just to create the
illusion of a living
world. Because you interact with
each one of them. But even the main
script for the main mission
was thousands of pages long.
- What was the writing process like on
that, to generate one page at a time?
- Bit by bit, by bit, over several
years. But you start with
once people are determined, "Oh,
here's the, here's the world. We're

[42:00]
doing one based on a version of
New York," so GTA IV. And, um,
I was living in New York, had been
living in New York for a few years.
Wasn't sure if I was happy. I was
going through a lot of personal
dramas, as usual. And that was why I
was looking at some of GTA IV
again recently, and it's really
dark. And I was like, "Ah,
that's why." You know, I was a
single and miserable, and I wasn't sure
I wanted to stay in America. My life was
in a lot of flux. As a company, we'd
had all that Hot Coffee drama, so
constantly thought we might be shut down in
the middle of making that. You know, a lot of
drama in the company, so it felt
like, having had this run of
success and, and relative
personal stability from
GTA III, Vice City, San
Andreas, suddenly 2005, '6,
'7, early '7, life felt very unsure. Um,
and that kind of bled into it.
But in terms of the process, it

[43:03]
was... trying to find
an underbelly to New York and
capture an immigrant experience that
I'm not entirely sure how accurate
that immigrant experience was in 2008
when the game came out. And then tell it,
sorry, from a different angle as an immigrant,
which I thought made it, made it interesting.
And then this sort of journey around these
various New York characters. So
I kind of spent probably a year
traveling around with cops or meeting people
on and off, and, you know, wandering around
New York and driving around, and, you know, on
and off. While, just go out for the morning
from the office, normal
stuff. But doing that through
2005, assembling little notes.
"Here's a funny character for this,
here's how..." Figuring out the order
we want to travel around the map
in. Characters of this, what was
an interesting take on, on, on
the, you know, mob for that kind of time
period. What was an interesting take on
some Jamaican hoodlums for
that kind of time period. And
assembling lots of notes and
more and more notes, and really,

[44:03]
really, really running away from the work.
Which is, you know, I have to admit, it's
part of my process, if there is any kind
of process, which is not doing work.
Thinking about it, but not working. You
know, a lot of time... And then, and then it
all kind of... Pages and pages of notes,
make more notes, no actual work. Months and
months of this. And then finally
set myself a deadline, told all the
other people, on the senior people on the
team, "Okay, I have a story draft due
Monday morning." I can't even remember
what I'll say, February the 1st. And
then the, the weekend before was in
a cabin we had upstate, and just
stayed up all night, knocking
these notes into shape.
Assemble about probably a 30-page document,
so story synopsis and a character
synopsis for each of the major characters.
And then hand that over, and that gets
broken, that would get broken down with
me, with me and the designers. And I was
always clear, "I'm not a game designer,
I'm a sort of creative director." We need
to break that down into missions.
And then that takes another year or
so of that slowly assembling. And

[45:01]
then begin... But then it's a...
But the bulk of my work's then
done for a bit, so I can relax and, and offer
opinions on other people's work and feel...
be lazy for a bit. And then
start to worry, 'cause then I've actually
soon got to start writing dialogue.
And for GTA IV in particular, it's like, "We're going
to try and write..." You know, our animation's going to
Our animation is going to be a lot better. Our
character models are going to start to look better.
The world is going to look amazing.
Therefore, we can support longer scenes.
We can have more in-depth characters. But we
have to find a tone that works with the game.
It's not easy, no problem. Then I
start to worry and worry and worry.
And also, writing as a Serbian
immigrant. I was an immigrant, but I'm
not Serbian. And trying to capture
what on Earth that would feel like.
Just start to worry, you start to worry
again. Avoid work for as long as possible.
And then just sit down and start hammering
away at a keyboard again late at night.
Hammering away at a keyboard and
going, "Does that right? Is that...?"
Once I get one speech, one turn of

[46:01]
phrase that I would like for a character,
then they suddenly come alive in my
head. So it was like writing
with Niko, and he's this kind
of awkward, he's out of town, but he's got
more self-assurance in some way
than the American characters.
Once I kind of talked him through it like this, he
just stepped slightly back from their ridiculousness.
And he's that... Then he started
to come to life. Then I would
juxtapose him and his cousin who
had this much more Americanized
energy, and that felt like it was a
good double act. And then from there
it starts to come to life.
But it's written in small
chunks for the motion cap... So
then we'd motion capture small
chunks. And then the other writers
write the mission dialogue for
small chunks. And we'd slowly
assemble the game, 10,
15 missions at a time, over
the next year and a half.
- Do you remember a few lines
that brought Niko to life?
- Yeah, I think so. It was a couple of...

[47:00]
his incredulity when his cousin picks him
up in an old car, and he's not living this
fancy American lifestyle. And his cousin's...
It was so... which was a kind of comic
moment. His cousin's... And then they
go to the cousin's flat. And the cousin
also, even though he was a sort
of failure, was still upbeat.
And then when he talked to the cousin and
he talked about his wartime experiences,
and how harrowing they were. I was
like, "Yeah, can I make this work in a
game?" It's very different from stuff you
normally see in games. Is it going to feel
ridiculous? And I remember being very
scared because I thought it might be too
much. It might feel over
the top. I think, you know,
the game's so pretty. The artists
are doing such an amazing job.
The game's looking... I think we can get
away with this. Let's try it. And then they
motion capture the animation. Then after
that, it's like, "Yeah, it kind of works."
I think that moment... those were both pretty
early. Once we had those, we went, "Okay, we've now
got comedy and tragedy with this character.
Now it's working." You remember,
"During the war, we did some bad
things, and bad things happened to us."

[48:03]
"War is where the young and stupid
are tricked by the old and bitter
into killing each other. I was
very young and very angry."
"Maybe that is no excuse."
- Yeah, he escaped. He's a veteran.
He escaped the trauma of war
to come to America to pursue
the American dream, I
suppose, which became for him this thing
that drags him back into violence.
- Yes, he can never escape
his sort of violent past
or... I don't know if he can never
escape it. He never does escape it.
You know, whether he's got agency
or not is a whole another question.
Of course he doesn't, because
he's a character in a video game.
But, you know, whether he ever could
have escaped it another way, who knows?
- I think he's probably the greatest
character for me created in the
Grand Theft Auto series. Of all the
characters you've written in Grand

[49:00]
Theft Auto, would Niko be the
best character you created?
- I think he's the most innovative.
And the most morally defensible
in some ways. You know,
he does a lot of stuff where
he's fighting for what's right.
He's the nicest person in some ways.
Is he the best protagonist of a GTA
game? I think he's the most
innovative protagonist of a GTA game.
Structurally, he might be
too nice in some ways.
He's also tough, like he just comes
across as tough. I loved CJ in
San Andreas. I thought Melee did
such... Just the way he spoke gave
him such humanity. So I just loved...
It wasn't the writing, it was the
quality of the voice acting,
it was just so strong for him.
I think aspects of Michael, he was
so understated, but he loved the
character, but he brought so
much humanity to this character
who's so flawed, who is such a...
you know, he has no principles.
He sells everyone out. I think Ned
Luke did such an amazing job and

[50:02]
didn't necessarily get as many plaudits
as Steven Ogg for Trevor, who was
also wonderful. But I think the Ned
Luke character sort of anchors that
game so much. So I like all of them
in different ways, but I probably
love Niko the most.
- And of course, Michael's
from Grand Theft Auto V.
And he's one of three protagonists
with also Franklin and
Trevor. And you said that of the things
you're proud of creating and you
think was a great accomplishment,
it was Red Dead Redemption 2,
the ending of Red Dead Redemption 1,
all of Grand Theft Auto IV, and the
middle part of Grand Theft Auto V
when the three characters come together.
Can you speak to the Grand Theft Auto V?
Is there some degree... I don't know
if you're a Dostoevsky guy, but...
- A little bit.
- Is there some aspect of
the three protagonists, sort of,
you know, Brothers Karamazov,
...Alyosha, Dmitry, and Ivan, sort
of, using the protagonists to

[51:00]
explore the spectrum
of human nature and...
- Yes, sure.
- ...just the tension between
them that allows you the, the,
the three of them become a
character in themselves.
- Their relationship.
- is more... Yeah, it was, it was,
I think one of the reasons that,
that the team did such... That Grand
Theft Auto is still so popular
is we always tried as a group to really
innovate from game to game within
the confines of what it was. It was a crime,
it was a crime drama, you know, began as
a crime, a crime sim in
GTA 1 about stealing, you
know, 2D top-down cars. And we always
tried to innovate with the narrative and
innovate with the art direction,
innovate with every piece of the game.
And I think having done,
you know, GTA IV, which
was this kind of operatic journey for
this big lead character, and then
these two extra stories that came
afterwards. So the challenge,
the, the, the challenge was, can
we combine... Can we make a video
game which tends to be very much
focused on one protagonist, but
have multi-protagonists? And the technical

[52:03]
challenge of moving from
character to character. The team
did such an amazing job that I don't
think people realized how hard it was.
But we would sit there just sort of holding
our heads 'cause they hurt so much around
like, what happens if you do this, then
do that? It's just, this is so hard.
Why have we, why have we decided to do
this? It's horrible. And then it all came
together. But I think
the idea was to develop
three characters who do feel like
characters. They don't just feel like
philosophical, you know,
psychological avatars. But where
one is really, really driven by
ego, one is really driven by
id, and one is really driven by
trying to get ahead. So some kind
of representation of the super-ego and see
how that feels when they all play off against
each other.
- One of the most upvoted
questions on Reddit about GTA V,
From a fan, "GTA V is my favorite
game ever made. I spent over
1,000 hours in the world of
GTA V and GTA Online. GTA

[53:00]
IV is a hard second or third. It
never ceases to impress me. When you
lead a team of over 1,000 people
to make a masterpiece like GTA V
or Red Dead Redemption 2, how do you ensure
that the bar of perfection is always
met? How's that even possible? We know
the answer isn't money, because there's
other studios with a lot of money,
and they are two decades behind
Rockstar." So what does it take to
create these worlds, to create these
incredibly compelling games and stories?
- I think the cult- I mean, certainly
when I was at Rockstar, I was a
worker amongst workers. You know, the
culture was one of excellence and
tried to provide creative clarity.
And people would just, you
know... And also an ambition
to make... I think we were
like... We thought GTA III
could be really popular.
Really popular to us meant, quite honestly,
it's gonna sell two or three million copies.
And we thought we were making something
pretty innovative. I mean, we knew we were
making something innovative, but we didn't
know if people would understand how innovative

[54:00]
it was. And then when we got
the chance to make Vice City,
and to try and repeat it, I think
every time from then on the team was
very driven to make something
better. And to use, this was
long before we had lots of resources, to
use time and whatever money we had to
always put impressive stuff
on the screen, always think
about what we can do to push the
medium of video games and the sort of
medium of building fake worlds further.
And that was always... You know,
there was a, it was, you know, both
clarity of, "Here's what we're trying to do.
Here's what the tone of the game is going to
be. Here's how features will fit into
that, and why these features would
work and these features wouldn't work."
Because fundamentally by 2002, you
could put pretty much any feature into a game
you wanted. It wasn't a question, it wasn't a
technical limitation. It was
just making it cohesive. And
then it was also just everyone
committing to a culture of excellence.
- Navid Khansari, an award-winning
director and virtual reality game maker,
who worked with you on a number of Grand
Theft Auto games, spoke highly about

[55:03]
his time working with you. Quote,
"We always worked ourselves to
the bone, but it wasn't coming from
the top down. Sam and Dan always
rolled up their sleeves, and they
were always there. They never left us
holding the bag. We all thought
we were making badass shit,
so it didn't matter how hard we worked."
So I'm sure there were some tough grinds.
- I think finishing it is certainly...
It's tough, but it also
is intensely rewarding. And you
get something done, and you've
made something. And that
feeling is, as you say, really,
really incredible. I mean, it can
sometimes feel a bit empty as well because
it's... when you're finished, you're like, "Then my
life's got nothing to it," and then you have to...
You know, but that's the same with any big
undertaking that you take. I don't think there are...
You know, when you're working that hard,
you do not have a good work/life balance.
But the truth is, you're not
working that hard all of the time.
So you just have to manage
it slightly differently.
- Man, that's such
such a heavy thing about the human experience.
I've talked to Olympic gold medal winners,

[56:00]
and many of them face real depression
after they win the gold medal.
because they've been pursuing
a thing that they deeply care about.
This has been everything, and
they're so truly happy to do it,
and then it's like, "What else
is there in life?" What, compared to
this, what else is there? So that's
the ups and downs of life. You
need the darkness and you need the
lows to really experience
the highs. Let me ask you
about the pressure.
There's an insane level of
excitement and expectation
for Grand Theft Auto VI.
Same was true for GTA V and
GTA IV, and even before that.
And you and the team delivered
every time. How difficult was it
to do creative work under such pressure
where everyone expects this to be a success?
- I was pretty good at
compartmentalizing, you know, and just
saying... I try just to go, and with all
creative work, I go, "Well, I feel like

[57:04]
a terrible fraud, but I haven't
been found out yet. Just do my
best and hopefully I won't be
found out this time." And just
if I can be... If I can
go, "I tried hard with the
work. I tried to do it with integrity. I
tried not to copy someone else. I have
probably done all of the above," you
know, try to bring something new to
it. And we, as a group, made
something we are proud of.
Then that's enough. You can't...
If you don't want to go
insane, or if I didn't want to go insane, I
couldn't sit there and worry about financial
results. If we made something great and
it didn't sell, that would have to be
okay. Because the goal is
to make something that's...
You know, video games are
expensive, so it is a
sort of commercial form of creativity.
It's a commercial art form, you know. So
you have to be in your mind, you're spending
large amounts of someone else's money.
You have to try and make it back for
them. But at the same time, my argument
with myself was, "Well, if we... The way to
make it back is try and make something great."

[58:02]
So both pressures are pointing
in the same direction.
I think GTA IV was very pressured because
there had been all this pressure on
the company. The company
nearly imploded several times
due to Hot Coffee. It was extremely
tough. So I think that felt very
stressful. GTA III, the
company was basically broke.
But I was young and didn't really care. I
wasn't living in the grown-up world yet.
All of them had their own pressure.
All of the games had their own
pressure. The more I felt I'd gone into it
creatively and tried to be more
ambitious, for me personally, I felt more
pressure, you know, when it came
out, that would have been the
right choice. Because again, if
you're trying to take big swings
creatively and you've spent a lot of money,
that can be quite stressful. I think
with Red Dead 2, we were
behind schedule. We
were over budget so much I
didn't want to think about it.
And you're making a game about a
cowboy dying of TB, and the game's

[59:01]
not coming together. Turns out a lot of people
doubt you at that moment, you know, it's not
that fun. So I think that
was a lot of pressure.
But, you know, anything, doing
something new, you know, the new
stuff, there's not necessarily pressure on
releasing a comic book in the same way,
because it's not taken as long, but, you know, if you're
making things, there's always pressure that people are
going to like it.
- Why do you think there was so much excitement
about GTA IV, GTA V, and now GTA VI?
- Because they don't come out that
regularly. And I think we did a really
good job of constantly innovating
within what the IP was. The games
always felt different, you know, people have
very strong feelings: "I like this one.
I didn't like that one as much," because
they are pretty different. So you would...
there would be simultaneously where you know what's going
to happen. It's a Grand Theft Auto, you know, it's going
to be a game about being a criminal, but the
way it's going to be a game is going to change
quite a lot. So I think the way the IP kept
evolving made people really excited to play it.
And we were good at marketing
them as well. We really tried to
market them in a way that felt like
an update of classic film marketing,
where you really felt like you're

[1:00:03]
already in the product just because
you'd seen the trailers and stuff.
- You've mentioned that you haven't written
for Grand Theft Auto VI. What's it
feel like Grand Theft Auto VI returning
to Vice City? This is over 20
years later, but the original GTA
Vice City game was set in the '80s.
So maybe inspired by
Scarface a little bit?
- Scarface, Miami Vice.
- Miami Vice.
- and our '80s childhoods. You know what I
realized quite a while ago,
unfortunately, was that we made that
game and it was set I think in
'86. And it... We made it in
2002, so 16 years after. And now it's way
past 16 years since Vice City came
out. So the '80s were not that long
ago when we made it.
- You know, I think Miami is one of
the most unique cities in the world.
Especially if you're thinking about
satirizing American culture, it has this
duality of a glossy surface
and a dark underworld.
It has the influencers, the crypto
bros, the yachts, bikinis, plastic

[1:01:01]
surgery, sports cars, drugs,
cartel cash, luxury, super rich
people, and the desperately poor,
just the whole of it. Would it
be like the perfect city
to explore the full
cast of characters that are possible,
that human nature can generate?
- I think it's one of them. You know, there's
a reason why GTA kept coming back to
Miami, New York, Los
Angeles. I think they're
all very good for exactly
what you laid out.
You know, you could move it to any of
those and it would work, you know?
- So yeah, there's a melting pot...
- Melt...
- ...aspect in New York also, right?
- Yeah, a melting aspect to LA. You know,
there's glitz, glamour, underbelly,
immigrants, you know, enormous wealth
in all of them. I think those are what,
I think, are really fun for any, not even
just the GTA, but for anything where
you want a kind of slice of life,
almost like a sort of psychotic
version of a Dickens book. You know, this
big slice of life. He did it with London.
You know, this psychotic version
of these, you know, all kinds

[1:02:01]
of characters in a melting pot. Any of
these global cities work well for that.
- Do you know if that was ever a consideration
to go elsewhere, to like a London?
- We made a little thing in
London 26 years ago, GTA
London, for the top-down for the PS1. That
was pretty cute and fun. As the first
mission pack ever for PlayStation
1. I think for a full GTA game, we always
decided there was so much Americana
inherent in the IP, it would be really
hard to make it work in London or anywhere
else. You know, you needed guns,
you needed these larger-than-life
characters. It just felt like the game
was so much about America, possibly
from an outsider's perspective. But
that was so much about what the thing was
that it wouldn't really have worked in the
same way elsewhere.
- So you've created, I don't know how
many, over 10 Grand Theft Auto games.
- I think so.
- I have to ask, is it a little
bit bittersweet to say,

[1:03:02]
to not be a part, to say
goodbye to the Grand Theft Auto
world? And having to watch Grand
Theft Auto VI be released?
Or is it more excitement?
What's the feeling?
- I think it's a, it's...
How would I describe it? Of course,
it's all, all of the above, you know,
it's exactly as you, you know,
pleased to be doing other stuff, excited
for what we're working on now, super
excited of course, letting go of something
I worked on in one way or another for
like 20 odd years. You know, and wrote
on them for the last 10 or 11 that came
out. Wrote all of them, or you know,
lead writer on all of them, whatever it
was. So of course, letting go of that
is, you know, is a big, is a big
change. And a lot, and, and, and
sad in a way, because each of the games
was a kind of standalone story. It's

[1:04:01]
not quite the same as, as I think
probably it would be in some ways
sadder if someone continued on Red Dead,
because it was a cohesive two-game
arc. That might be more sad to hear someone
working on that. But again, not, and
that, that will probably happen too. I
don't own the IP. That was sort of part of
the, the deal. It's a privilege to work on
stuff, but you don't necessarily own it.
- When you're done with the game,
does it always feel like a goodbye?
Like when you're done with Red
Dead 2, is it like you're saying
goodbye to Arthur? The characters
you created, you're walking away.
- You kind of are saying goodbye to
Arthur in the end of the game.
- Yeah.
- Even before the end of the game. Um,
yeah, I think you've got, you know, I've been
with them for seven, eight years, and you have to
kind of let it go or you
can't go on to the next one.
- Yeah.
- So, there's always this thing of, of, "Okay, that's
done." And sometimes people would ask me questions and I,
about older games. And certainly
when I was in the middle of making
new ones in the se- I just couldn't really necessarily
even remember. And I got a pretty good memory
normally, because you kind of
have to let it go. So, it's not,

[1:05:00]
it's, you're so immersed in it and
thinking about it. And certainly in that
last period, the last few months, you're
really, really immersed in every little nuance
and every little detail all of the time. And then
you're just not thinking about it in the same
way.
- Yeah. It's funny from
the player perspective,
it feels like an old friend that I
miss, whether it's John or Arthur or
Nico, it's a real goodbye. That's the,
there's a real sadness to finishing a
video game. Like-
- I hope so
- ...legitimately- not just
because the story is sad or-
- Because you've been with them so long.
- Yeah. And it's a real goodbye to close it.
There's that feeling when you're sort of
closed the video game,
and it's, I mean, it's
like saying goodbye to a friend. And it's-
- That's when you finish a book you love.
- Yeah.
- It's the same feeling.
- Same feeling.
- And I think that was something
that we really, in the early...
...days of Rockstar, really aspired
to have that, where people would...
...have that. It wasn't just the
mania of clearing a level, but the...
...feeling of saying goodbye to characters.
You know, I think that was something we...

[1:06:01]
really
...wanted to achieve in games that we didn't
know was even possible. So, to hear people...
say that is incredibly rewarding.
- Yeah. The end of On The Road by
Kerouac: "Forlorn rags of growing...
...old." I just remember closing that and
thinking, "What the fuck am I doing in this big...
...world?" It's a melancholic feeling, but
there's nothing like that feeling, and you've...
...achieved that. It's so rare in video
games to be able to achieve that with Red...
...Dead, and for me, it was
Grand Theft Auto IV with Nico.
I have to ask, in the 2018
interview, you talked about...
...satirizing American culture, which I
think Grand Theft Auto was trying to...
...do. And you've made, I think, a
really powerful observation that...
...on the political front, people
are getting more divided. It's...
...getting more absurd
and ridiculous and...
...extreme, so becoming harder
and harder to satirize because...
...of how rapidly it's becoming ridiculous.
You're talking about you don't even know if...
...Grand Theft Auto VI, if
it's possible to satirize,
because by the time you release the thing,

[1:07:02]
it's already going to be outdated in terms
of the satire will become reality...
First of all, it'd be nice to get your
updated view on that. And second of all,
it seems like you've answered your very
own comment with American Caper, which...
...seems to satirize American culture
just fine in how much over the...
...top it goes. Anyway, that's
lots of questions in there.
- One of the things we've enjoyed about
doing a comic book is that we are, it...
still has lead times. But the lead
times are not four or five years.
The lead times are, you know, a year
when we're putting... We can...
...make little updates much, much newer.
And we're, you know, we're
just wrapping issue 10 of a...
...12-issue arc for that. So it's...
...not quite... It's not quite as difficult.
You still can get the tone of it. Um,
but yeah, I think it's, I think it's an
issue anyone trying to talk about this...
...current era, which began in 2015,
2016, is going to have of how do you...

[1:08:04]
...characterize it when things
move so quickly and so fast?
- So American Caper is, first of all,
epic comic book. I love it, the art.
- Yeah, the art's beautiful. David Lapham is
the artist. He did an amazing job. He is a...
He is a wonderful, wonderful storyteller.
- What made you want to set it in Wyoming?
- I hadn't seen a modern story there
that I knew about. I'd started...
...to spend a bit more time in the
Rockies and in the West, and I was...
...like... I'd spent a lot of time in,
like, the countryside in Upstate...
New York, and thought I never really
captured it quite right. And just the...
...idea of these places as they change
didn't... It was a way of doing a...
...crime story that didn't feel the
same as a GTA. You know, it was not...
...somewhere you would necessarily set a GTA, but
it felt like it was really interesting and...
under-explored.
- And there is over-the-top
stuff. There's...
- Yeah, it's definitely
slightly over the top.
- So let me take notes on this. There's a
spoiler alert, I guess, from the first
issue, I believe. There's
a devout suburban

[1:09:00]
Mormon who commits, I
think, serial murder with a
shovel as a form of religious atonement.
- He is not necessarily the... Sharpest
tool in the box. And his rather
cynical boss is using his
religion and some mistakes he's
made to blackmail him into
murdering business associates.
- And of course, there's this
Shakespearean sort of two
neighbors situation, and each of
them having a duality of who they
are in terms of good and evil.
So there's a Wall Street transplant
who wants to be a cowboy.
- Yes.
- Who loves to manually harvest
bull semen. Accurate? I mean...
- Yes.
- These are the notes I've been taking.
- Yes. He is a, um... he is a somewhat
confused, longevity obsessed...
- Right.
- rich dude who's run away to Wyoming and
is living out an assortment of fantasies.
- And bull semen is a big
component of longevity.
- Yes. He's very into all the life
hacking, you know, "roiding"

[1:10:02]
roiding HGH and making money.
- And, uh...
- has lost his mind living on a big ranch.
- Of course, on the theme of
satire, there is a woman who
sleeps in tactical gear
and is consumed by online
conspiracies, like
especially pedophiles in DC.
- Yes. Based on someone I know, who
got completely red-pilled.
And I was fascinated by the
fact that this was happening to people.
- Yeah, so, you know, satire of American
culture. Quick pause. Bathroom break?
- Sure.
- I think GTA V had the biggest
launch in video game history, and
GTA VI has the potential to top that.
First of all, do you think it
will? And more broadly, what
was your definition of
success for a video game?
- I would assume it will because it's so
anticipated, and anticipation
is the best driver of early
sales, as we saw with GTA IV versus Red

[1:11:01]
Dead Redemption One. You know, GTA IV far
more anticipated, sold much better early on.
So I would assume it will sell really
well. That was never my definition of
success, but you certainly wanted
to make money. You know, you're...
you're spending someone's money. So the number one
success is, "Are you making that money back plus a
dollar?" At some level, that has to be...
that has to be the single most important.
thing so you get to do it again. You know,
you've got big teams of people. People
need to pay the rent. You have to keep the
lights on in the business, so you have to make
a small profit. If you think in that
way, that keeps you being creative.
I think that was like... Trying to forget
about that, it's not really an option. Um,
but we almost always did that. We didn't quite
always do that, but we almost always did that.
I think the definition of
success for me was had we
tried to do new things and done
them, or achieved some of our goals.
That was the thing that I meant... Again, were
people responding to these worlds and these
characters in a way that I wanted them to?
- Is it crazy to you that video
games are able to make billions of

[1:12:01]
dollars, when if you look
at, like, the '80s and
'90s, you know, nobody took
video games seriously. And
even in the aughts, it... And now they're
basically... I mean, it's very possible
if you look out 10, 20 years from
now that video games surpass film
as a way to consume stories.
- I think they've possibly already done that
in some ways. And certainly as a
business proposition, they've already
done that. But I think that's not... You
know, as a way of telling stories, I
think they're better at telling certain
kinds of stories, and films are better at
other kinds of stories. You know, I think,
I think if you want a long, discursive
adventure, a video game is better. If you
want a short, tight experience, a film is
better. We always felt games were
the coming medium. And so spent
20 years saying, "Games are
the future. Games are the
future." And, you know,
being sneered at, then
being laughed at, then having people
nod their heads, and then it kind of

[1:13:01]
happening. So I would... Well, you
know, at the same time, much as you
might say something, you don't necessarily
believe it's gonna be true. But it
has become true, and I think still
that games are only gonna get better,
more interesting, more
creatively, you know, diverse.
- You said that Red Dead Redemption 2, in
your opinion, is the best thing you've ever
done. I think there's a strong case to be
made that it's the greatest game of all
time. What are the elements that make
that game truly great, do you think?
- I think you had an incredibly strong
team working together that was
very experienced that had basically been
in place since somewhere between 2001 and
2006. So it was a long, experienced
team. I think we got to
spend a smaller group of us
working on it from day one,
coming up with some wacky ideas that we
got to embed in the game. And then
we kind had to follow through
with. But I think it was helpful that
we got to be very creative before it

[1:14:00]
had a full team on it. I think that
the cowboy setting is great because it
gives a sort of mythic seriousness
that sometimes doing stuff in
a contemporary setting doesn't allow. You know,
I think the closest we got to that kind of
seriousness was GTA IV, but it just can't... Once
you're setting things in the modern world, they're
too frenetic. You can't get some of that
slightly, you know, operatic feel that I
love. That some people think is maybe a
little over the top, but I, you know, I
love this kind of, you know,
people searching for meaning—
...within, amongst the violence. I think
that the West and all of the themes
around the West really lend themselves to
that. So I think that, and then the gunplay
was fantastic, and the horses were
incredible. So I think you had this
combination of technical know-how, a very,
very strong team, and really strong material.
very, very strong team, and
really strong material.
- Where did you have to go in your
mind, maybe philosophically, maybe
spiritually, to be able to create
the RDR world? Of course, it was
based on Red Dead Revolver, but that's—

[1:15:01]
- Yes
- —that's a fundamentally
different. I mean, that leap
into the great mythic story that
was Red Dead Redemption one.
And then even more so, Red Dead
Redemption two. That was unlike anything
you, or maybe anyone, has
ever created in video games.
- Thank you.
- So, like, what drugs were involved?
- No drugs.
- Okay.
- No. Stopped the drugs long before.
- Okay.
- That's why I did all that work. Had nothing
else to do. So yeah, open world video
games were very good for my mental
health in that way. Kept me
busy. But Red, so Red—
Dead, I'll tell, I'll give you my version.
Now the games are made by big teams.
So, but I will give you my human
interest version of the story from
my perspective only. We
made Red Dead Revolver,
decided that, or finished Red Dead Revolver
that had been a Capcom game. And they didn't
want to finish it, so we finished it. And they
released it in Japan and we released it in the US

[1:16:01]
in, I think, 2004. And decided
we would start work on
an open-world cowboy game for PS3.
Didn't think too much more about it, and that was
when we did a bunch of other stuff to work on.
And slowly, 2005, 2006, the game
started to come to life. I began
to meet with the lead designer, Christian
Cantamessa, and thrash out a few
ideas and story ideas for the game, and
began to think about some stuff. And
start thinking about, well, what works for an
open-world game? What works for a cowboy game?
And again, I was being
lazy or procrastinating.
- Can we just on a small tangent,
when you mentioned you take notes
when you're being lazy. What do those
notes look like? Are they like doodles?
- They look like either a yellow pad—
—or a BlackBerry in those
days, or an iPhone in these
days. I'll write the subject matter
and then just email myself a note.
Here's a good idea. Here's a good idea. Or
it might almost be scribbling on a pad.

[1:17:02]
And then I'll assemble, if they're
done digitally, then I'll do, I'll
assemble them into one long Word
file. And then I'll look at them and
go, you know, "Here's an idea,
here's an idea, here's an idea."
See if it comes to anything. See if I now aggregate
them together and then read through them.
If there's anything coherent there. You know,
something about a character like this, or that.
This would be a funny line. This is a line for
the main character. Actually make the main
character work like this. You know,
what about this relationship?
As you start to just play around
with, "What about if we start in that
place, go to that place?" Start just to play
around with all of the different bits and
pieces. And we began to flesh out
some flow for the start of the game.
And this idea you'd start in dusty
American West, which meant we didn't have
to make too many trees, and then go to
Mexico, and then come back.
And we had a sort of loose
flow. And I was really scared of writing
any actual dialogue. And I didn't
have a clue how to go about it. And

[1:18:01]
I kept... It'll come, it'll come. And I
kept... because I could postpone it for
ages because we were doing GTA
IV. And I kept worrying about it.
My work was wrapped on GTA IV,
but the game wasn't out yet.
And we'd done a bunch of the marketing stuff, and
had a little window when I wasn't doing much else.
And I took a week with
my then girlfriend, now
wife, who was heavily pregnant with
our first child, and we went up
to a house upstate and sat
there. Well, she, she, she
sat there, either cooking for me or
watching TV or reading. And I just went and
sat in the room all day, every day. And just
sat there and stared at the computer and
tried to think about, "How can I
do this so that it doesn't sound
ridiculous?" How can you write in a cowboy
idiom that feels both slightly
contemporary but also
gives the game this sort of life and this
weight that I want it to have, and think we can
get away with? And
after about three days, it just started
to come. And then suddenly I wrote about
nine, 10 scenes in the
next couple of days. And

[1:19:01]
after that, I knew I had it. And it was a bit...
I don't know if that's why there was so much
about a character caring about his
family, because I was just beginning the
process of having a family.
- Oh.
- So I don't know if that-
I don't know to what extent that bled in there,
but I think it bled in there to some extent.
- So that was part of creating
the 360-degree characters.
- I think so.
- Here's this man that is
capable, is involved in a lot of violence,
who also cares about his family.
- He's grown up and he's trying to
step away from that and be a man, be
a grown-up. And can he get away from
it? And when he can't get away from
it, what's he willing to
do to save his family?
And that was, I felt, starting to
get some idea. I mean, she, well,
She hadn't given birth yet, but I was
beginning to grapple with the ideas of, "I'm
gonna become a parent." So I hope some
of that... And obviously, then I didn't,
probably didn't write any more for six months. So
later on we had a child. But certainly for that
first bit, I think some of
that began to bleed in there.
- ...you got the feeling that you can
actually do it. It's true, it's...

[1:20:01]
It could have very easily
been ridiculous and
not believable, the
dialogue between convoys.
- Yes.
- And, yes, I mean, there's
probably so much work went into
making it feel real and believable.
And, and, like, that...
Like a Shakespearean type of
drama, but not the cheesy kind.
- Well, just wanted it to
feel when they spoke. I
mean, I, I, I love dialogue. I'm
always, you know, I love the sound of
words, but just wanted to feel like when
they sounded, it didn't sound cheesy,
it didn't sound ridiculous. You wanted to
hear them speak more. It didn't make you
cringe awfully when they spoke. That was
the... At some level that was all the goal
was, and then they felt like this
guy was gonna go on this life and
death odyssey and you cared about him.
You had to care about his wife and
child that he left behind, even
though you didn't know them.
- When did you know how you were going
to end Red Dead Redemption One?

[1:21:00]
- I remember I did a meeting
with Christian, the
designer. I can't remember
what year. Probably some point
late 2008, early 2009, and we
were discussing the last bit and,
and, and said, "I think
he's gotta die." And he
leapt on the idea and went, "That's...
Yes, yes. No, no, wait, no, it can't work.
Games can't work like that. It can't work if
he's dead." You know, began to think through,
well, if we... Just technically it doesn't work
because you have to be able to finish all the stuff
up, and then began to think through, "Actually,
I think we can make it work if we do it this
way." And so he then really
pushed for that idea,
and it seemed to... I was like, "Ah,"
and I was still torn. I thought it
was clever narratively but I
was torn if it was gonna work
technically as a piece of game
design, but I think it did.
- Yeah, and spoiler alert, of
course, how do we tell the
story of that? Well, so he
goes through a lot. He does
all the... John does all the dirty work
of hunting down his old gang and he
finally is able to go home
and be with his family,

[1:22:03]
be on the ranch, and then the
government betrays him and
sends troops to kill him. And there
is dialogue. I mean, that just,
I think the two times I shed a tear in
video game history for me is that dialogue.
I think John talking to his wife,
if I vaguely remember. I
think he said, "I love you."
But he said very little. He didn't...
He made it seem like he's going to see
her and his son shortly. That dialogue was
masterfully done, like a definition of like
less is more. It was just so crisp, that
and... And, of course, the other one
is again, from memory, Arthur riding
his horse and the music is playing.
It's very hard not to shed

[1:23:00]
a tear during that. Anyway, the
dialogue of John talking to his wife
at the end when he's in a barn
and is about to walk out.
to face certain death. Do
you remember writing that?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. But it
just... Again, I went...
The actor was so good and we've already
seen a bunch of his work by then.
He had such a good... He was so good
at reading those lines that I knew he
could give us... that you could
feel at that point, like-
…I think those lines are best when they're
really short and punchy. So I knew—
- Got it.
- I knew he'd be able to
make that line sound good.
- So you were imagining his
voice. You were just-
- And I think all of those
actors on Red Dead
Redemption One were so strong that they
really brought that game to life. If
them and Rod, the director, hadn't
done such a good job, it would have
sounded cheesy as hell.
- You've said that the ending of RDR1 is one
of the best things you've been a part of

[1:24:01]
creating. Why is that ending so powerful
to you? What does it represent?
- I think because for the story
to work, just from a technical
challenge, for the story
to work, he had to
die. But for a game to work,
it felt like a challenge to
make him die. It was probably the
fourth, fifth, or sixth open-world
game I'd worked on, and
I'd spent all these years before that
working out how these stories worked.
How to make them work technically, how to
make them feel right, how they interacted
with the open-form
gameplay as best I could.
And suddenly we're going to break one
of our golden rules, which was, at the
end of the game, you're freeing the character
to go and wrap up all the side stories, to play
forever. You're not going to be able to do that in this game
because the guy's going to be dead, and we're going to have
you play as a different character,
and the narrative is going to
be compelling enough, if we've done a good job,
where you're not going to care about that.

[1:25:02]
Or you're going to be upset that he's
dead, but you can actually have this
emotional moment.
So I think it was a big risk from a technical
perspective for us to do that, and then
it worked. So I think that
was something that was very…
full of fear, and it worked out okay.
And I think people were really upset and angry at us for doing
it because they didn't think it was going to happen, but
I think they also had that kind of experience
you're describing, which is that kind of creative
moment where, you know, a transcendent moment
with characters in a piece of fiction, which is
what we've always aspired
to giving people.
- I mean, it's incredible because I don't think…
I don't remember a single video game that has
done that before.
- Well, I would like to have, at the end of
GTA IV, killed Niko, but you couldn't do
it. You know, the game doesn't work like
that. So it was this thing where we
hadn't done it, thought about doing it,
hadn't done it, and then going, "Let's
do it. Let's take the risk and do it. We
can't do it. Let's try." And it worked.
- Yeah, what about the decision
with the son? You know,
John gives so much effort to make
sure that Jack doesn't end up

[1:26:01]
in a life of violence. I mean,
it's very Godfather-like. It's—
…he's dragged back into
it through revenge.
- That was also, the game still had to work
as a game. Whether that was the right
ending, 100% the best ending from a pure
storytelling perspective, I don't know.
But I know that we had
to make the game work.
- Oh, interesting.
- So it was... I think it kind of
worked in that way where Jack can't
escape, but I always also wanted
a version of it where Jack did
escape, but that wasn't...
Both were interesting to me.
- Can you just dig in a little deeper? What
do you mean about for the game to work?
It's such a direct... It's like Kubrick
talking about for this movie to work,
it has to have... From my perspective, I just
think about the story. What's the technical
aspect for the game to work?
- It's just the mechanical
experience is you have an
avatar you control, and you know,
the games don't really end.
You have to be able to wander
around the world and do stuff.

[1:27:00]
So at the end of the game, you have
to be able to wander around with your
fairly limited set of
features, which is you can run up to
someone and punch them or shoot them or
rob them, or talk to them. And that's
kind of... or jump on a
horse or do all this other
stuff. In order for the game still to
be fun and people to get this full
360-degree experience with
it, they had to, if they
wanted to 100% the game as opposed to just
finishing the story, you have to have an
avatar to do that stuff with. So that
was the sort of challenge of Jack's
character, wrapping up the story as Jack.
- Oh, there's real power for the
avatar to end, the finiteness.
- Yeah. Both the Red Deads, you
obviously change avatars.
Which we did, and then did it again. I think
there's something interesting about that
moment when you change from one character to
another, because they are you and they're not
you, you know, and then
suddenly you're someone else.
- Mm-hmm. I mean, I was
really shaken by that

[1:28:03]
experience, but it's a beautiful
experience. It's like an unforgettable
experience. What else can
video games possibly reach
for? You know, to create that experience,
that's what great films do, that's
what great, great books do.
- It's that. I mean, it's that and the world building
in games. I think the experience of being in this
fake place and then
taking on these narrative
adventures, when that combines,
you've got the amazing experience.
- So who do you think is the best
character you've ever created in RDR?
So to me, I think definitively
Arthur from Red Dead Redemption
2 is the best character ever
created in video games ever.
- Thank you.
- I think there's not even close. I mean,
John will be the se-, which is hilarious
to say, but those are... John will
be a close second, but Arthur is
definitively. And you've talked about in that
interview, you said that
a lot of video games

[1:29:00]
work on the same premise, that
you start as a weak person and
end up as a strong superhero.
But what if you start as a
tough guy, someone who already
is very strong, someone that's
emotionally confident of his place in
the world? Arthur's journey is not about
becoming a superhero because he's
almost one at the start, but
it's about an intellectual
rollercoaster when his worldview gets
taken apart. So it's very different
than the normal journey of a character.
- Yeah, in a game...
- In a game
- ... in order to reverse it.
So there were a couple other themes that
matched that. So they're guys from the Wild
West, but they're being
pushed ever further east.
So it's almost like an anti-Western.
An Eastern. You're traveling east. You're
traveling into civilization. And I
don't think I would've been grappling
with those ideas earlier in my career,
'cause it was so, you know, this
idea of getting a different kind of
strength and different kind
of weakness was interesting.

[1:30:01]
- What about the component of mortality, of a
character facing his own mortality over a
prolonged period? Sort of
just the, the, the, the
prospect of like, real sort of fear
of death, realization of death.
- Yeah. I thought that was really-
- as part of the story.
- really a fun thing to play
with. John dies in Red Dead 1,
I wanted to top that with
Red Dead 2, or do that in a
different way. And so the idea that
John's death is fairly sudden, and
so if he's got this long,
drawn-out death, then I'd always
been obsessed by TB. As diseases
go, it's a great literary device.
You know, 'cause it is this long, drawn-out, slow
death, but in which you are also getting weaker.
And my grandfather actually
had TB before they invented
antibiotics and was sent to
a sanatorium just after he
was... just after he'd
had his child, my father,
and survived, but only three of them out
of like 35 survived. So I was always,
captivated by TB as an illness. It

[1:31:03]
felt like it was an interesting
thing to play around with
as an idea, this guy getting weaker
who felt like he was immortal
and essentially was immortal. He was the
protagonist in a video game, he could not die, and
suddenly he is becoming
mortal. You know, but that
helps him see stuff. I thought that
was a different way of doing a lead
character in a game.
- Yeah. Do you think it's the greatest
character you've ever created?
- I think he's the best
lead character. You know, the lead characters
are different from the side characters,
and I think he's the most rounded
and works the best. I kind of...
Him and Nico are the two I like, you
know. They were the two most ambitious.
So for me, it's always sort of
a toss-up, you know? But then I
loved all the stuff, like
the art team did such an
amazing job. It was their idea with
the journal and that kind of...
The way that all the features worked
into Arthur's character, I thought that

[1:32:03]
was really... He was really rounded, he
worked in lots of different ways really well.
I loved his flawed
relationship with his old
girlfriend, things like that. All the side...
You know, the bits that turned up around
him.
- So you also like the side
characters. You like the flavor
- Yeah, of course.
- of the full cast. What are some
of the favorites you've created?
I'm sure the one you're
currently working on-
Nigel, that's a... You
called him a side character.
- Well, he's not a protagonist.
He's like a god, not a character.
So he's not... Him, I'm
enjoying. I love Dutch.
You know, it was partly because
we wrote a few lines for him
for the first game, and
the actor did such a
such an amazing job that when
he spoke, it just came to me
all of their backstory, which I'd been playing
around with by that point anyway a little bit in my
head. But I knew it was his bigger gangster
from then. I sort of saw exactly who he
was. And so that was... That felt like...
He felt like a living character to me.

[1:33:02]
- And we should say that Dutch is kind of like,
maybe a little bit of a godlike figure-
in both of the Red Dead Redemption
games. He's the leader of the gang.
And there's a father-son
relationship with Dutch, with, uh,
I mean, with Arthur, with John.
There's a family feeling to the
gang. They explore all of those
dynamics, and then the feeling of
betrayal and Arthur facing tuberculosis.
You're going against the family,
going against the father-
because he is transforming
his sense of the
world, of morality, of all those kinds
of things. So all the kind of very
Shakespearean drama is
right there. And Dutch is
a prominent godlike figure
through all of that. Also
flawed himself. Also a man
of good and evil in that,
framework that they're operating under.
- And he's just drowning
in his ego at the end.
You know, his ego gets the better of
him. I think he's a... But there was
something flawed but beautiful in his
idealism when he was younger, and that's

[1:34:05]
mostly off-camera. And then
just so you know, always been
as an individual, I've always been
very susceptible to charming people.
And he's charming. So I was kind of...
I can see how people get captivated.
by charming people. And the idea
here was a very charming person,
and the road's run out for him.
- I personally am afraid of how
much I love human beings,
and how susceptible I am
to charm and charisma.
'Cause it can cloud your
judgment about human nature.
- Completely. And that's what's
happened with him. And it ended up
clouding his judgment about himself.
He kind of fell for his own rubbish.
- Yeah, but also it clouded
Arthur's judgment.
- Oh, completely. Arthur was
completely, you know, platonically in
love with him. He was worshiping him. He'd
given up his power to him. And then I think for
Arthur, the journey is retaking that

[1:35:00]
power in the moment of dying. You know,
and that's what the whole... that's why
I thought that was really interesting.
- Yeah, it's truly tragic for Arthur to be
losing his identity,
lifelong identity, and
sense of belonging, and
losing his life at the same
time. In facing mortality, he is realizing
that he's not all of it has been a lie.
- But he gets to do some... Well, it
depends on what choices you make.
But he gets to do some good. And so
he gets his moment of redemption.
- Just a little bit. But realizing...
your whole life you've been living not a
good life. You've been not a good man.
- Isn't that what we're all afraid of?
- I guess it's never too
late to change your ways.
- Hope not. I mean, that's...
- So, the biggest, most important,
primary question, central to the
reason we're talking today, the
number one question from the
Internet, it is so ridiculous, but
I must ask. Have you seen Gavin?

[1:36:05]
Who is Gavin? So, for more context,
there's a guy named Nigel in Red Dead
Redemption 2 who's frantically
searching for a mystery man named Gavin
throughout the game. This has become
one of the biggest mysteries amongst
the interwebs, the RDR fan
base. So, the theories
include, theory one is it's a
split personality disorder. Nigel
himself is Gavin. So, the evidence for
this theory is the letter that has some
evidence that may be due
to trauma, this split
personality disorder was created.
This Gavin was created inside Nigel's
mind. Theory two is Gavin is dead,
and Nigel's simply in denial.
Theory three is that it's
just a troll, and Rockstar intentionally
created an unsolvable mystery
to drive players crazy. I
also heard theory four is
Gavin is the Strange Man. So, there's this
fascinating character, the Strange Man,
this supernatural character that has a

[1:37:03]
presence in RDR1 and a little bit in
RDR2 also. But yeah. So which theory
is closest to the truth?
- Not three or four. In my mind, somewhere
between one and two. I
just loved the way he
shouted, "Gavin." It just
amused me. So at some level, it
probably is trolling in that we didn't
want it to be a totally clear mystery.
You wanted it to have a little
bit of adventure to it.
but it was meant to be ...
Without ever fully being
explained that Gavin's not there
anymore. Gavin's either gone
home, Gavin's left him, Gavin's...
And we were going to keep
exploring that idea. That he was going
to reappear in some way or other.
- Did you have any idea how much
imagination, excitement, and curiosity
that little interaction
would inspire in people?
- Yes and no. You could never know what
people are going to find amusing

[1:38:04]
in these big games, and a lot of it comes down
to acting as well. The guy was just funny when
he said "Gavin." It was just funny.
You know? But there was a ped in Red Dead
Redemption one that everyone was obsessed
by, and I really wasn't expecting
that. So we try to put a few
characters in. I mean, Gavin was supposed
to be amusing. I thought he was amusing.
But you never know what people are going to
get obsessed by. There are other characters
I think are funny, and people don't even notice
them, you know, or they see them in a completely
different way.
- Did you have a part in writing the letter?
- Yeah. I can't remember if I wrote
it or... Either I wrote it or Mike
wrote it, or we both wrote it. I really can't remember, to
be honest with you. But yeah, I certainly would have edited
it, and Mike might have written it, or I might
have written it. I really can't remember.
- It's so fascinating because that little piece
of writing— of course, you have thousands of
pages-
- Yeah.
- ...but that little piece
of writing gets analyzed.
- Oh, but we certainly talked about
it in depth, and if Mike was here,
I'd ask him. He might remember. I can't
really... And we do so many of those things.
And I loved the use of letters in
Red Dead to tell all these weird

[1:39:03]
backstories. And some became
very clear and some were still
a little kind of opaque. But I think
the general vibe was there was no
Gavin. Either there was no Gavin or
he'd long since left. So it's kind
of a split personality, you know, and
then we were going to over subsequent
games provide more information.
- So in some sense, you yourself
don't quite know. You kind of have
an idea, like which way
do you lean more, theory
one or two? Is he dead, and Nigel's in
denial, or is there real
communication going inside his head?
- No, Gavin existed. So it wasn't that he was a split personality,
and the only thing we hadn't really decided was in a future game
No, Gavin existed. So it wasn't that he was a split personality,
and the only thing we hadn't really decided was in a future game
were we going to reveal that Gavin was
dead, or was Gavin going to turn up having
long since abandoned this maniac. That
was what we were still playing around
with. I think the idea was that he was never
going to meet... He was never going to meet
Gavin in this game.
- I mean, it's just fascinating because
you have to think about all of that.

[1:40:02]
You have to write all of that. You have to have
those discussions. You have to have those debates.
- And it has to feel fresh.
Like, what we've done before. Constantly
looking as you do. You know, I
think I've done, you know, somewhere between
15 and 20 of these games. Got to do stuff
that's new. It can't
repeat itself too much.
- I mean, we also live in the age
of the internet. Just, like, you
realize there are millions of people
worrying about where and who Gavin is.
- Thank God.
- It's like-
- It's great, yeah.
- It's fascinating that they're having...
Is, think about people reading, like,
James Joyce or something and thinking
about the character, like, breaking apart
Ulysses and thinking
about, like, arguing about
different interpretations of it. And to
me, that in itself is also beautiful.
- Yeah. We want the side mysteries to be
solvable up to a point, but you still
want these discussions.
- Yeah, the mystery.
- You know, and you want as long as
it feels tonally appropriate for
this whole big sort of shaggy
dog story experience you're

[1:41:01]
making. Which Gavin was just about,
and he was so weird, and he just
was intrinsically... there was just something
funny about an English person screaming,
"Gavin." I don't know why.
- Yeah. Some of that humor, there's...
there's certain in Red Dead
Redemption there's humor, but there's
a lot of it in Grand Theft Auto-
...and what... It's
hard to put into words.
why that's funny, why it becomes
a meme, why it becomes viral,
'cause it's just funny.
- Yeah, I know why I think it's funny, but you...
what you can't... What I'm not good at doing at
least is going, "This thing will
become really popular online and
this other thing won't." You can create
this bunch of, you know, fifty different
side things that people might get captivated
by, and you just do not know what
they're going to respond to.
- How do you know when something's
funny? Is it... you just feel it?
- I know what I think is funny.
It's, you know, it makes-
- You just Google it or you just-
- ...like just 'cause it's
ridiculous as well.
That was just... There's nothing funny
about a dude shouting, "Gavin," a lot.
He just said it in a funny way...
I just thought it might be funny-
It was great... and he just
said it in such a funny way-

[1:42:00]
...and then it just became funny. Like,
we often have those side characters
and they're not that funny, and I think they're
going to be hysterical, and then you put them in the
game, and they're fine,
but they're not amazing.
That guy just brought that stuff to life.
- Yeah. And his backstory too. I mean,
Londoner and not... yeah, that...
- Yeah, I think that was what... you know, just that
it... there's something sometimes fun, you know, in...
an English person saying the name Gavin
is quite funny. I don't know why.
- So, about the Strange Man, AKA,
the Man in Black... Is there some
element with Michael and the therapist in
Grand Theft Auto V? Like, who is the Strange
Man?
- Well, the Strange Man was
again... was, was, was
someone we came up with quickly.
It... we made Red Dead 1,
and we... well, were
making Red Dead 1, and
we'd made this... we felt quite
compelling story and quite
interesting open world. But...
and we'd already made a bunch of
Grand Theft Autos, obviously, but unfortunately,
we'd taken out the machine guns 'cause it was
a cowboy game, apart from the big fixed
position ones. And we'd taken out the

[1:43:00]
cars, and we'd taken out the city and
large numbers of pedestrians. So we
essentially had a game about
a dude riding a horse...
...around the desert. And it was
quite... and it was quite boring.
And so we then started filling it with
content, and we filled it with these...
and having to improvise. And we filled it with
these things we call random events that would be
these sort of motion-capture moments
that you could interact with. And it...
they were, they were... the designers did an
amazing job with those. They were really fun.
But there was not enough of them. And then we felt
we needed more story 'cause the story was perhaps a
little short. So we kind of
quite late in development
started putting in almost like these
RPG-type content where you go and meet
someone. And the way we thought of them was they
were like short stories. So you go and meet
someone, they'd set you a slow
problem, like go and collect me 15
bunches of flowers. And when you came
back, it would resolve your story.
And so then, you know, one would go, "Go get them for
my bride," and you come back and the bride's dead.
You know, to... We tried to make them like
these short stories with a sting in the
tail. And

[1:44:00]
he came out... as I was trying to come
up with ideas for those, as just this
weird character. And then we
built him a bit into the story,
where he would unlock as you
worked your way through and be a
commentary on what you were doing.
So he was meant to be a kind of
manifestation of your,
you know, shadow, your karma, the
devil, somewhere, you know, just
saw the world. And then we built
out his backstory over time
and decided, you know... And so in Red Dead
2, you could interact with him again and...
or not really interact with him. But he was there
and he was meant to be, you know, something I
suppose any creative is scared
of, an artist who's kind of
sold his soul to the devil. And
that slowly revealed itself.
- There is a connection between
the main character and
the... Is it like a Jungian
shadow type of situation?
- Well, it's sort of, because he knows
what you're up to. The connection is...
what's never really made clear is,
does he know this about everybody?
Like, is he following you, or is he
able, because of the pact he's made

[1:45:03]
with evil forces, able to do this
for everybody? I don't think we
necessarily ever clarify that. He's
certainly able to do it for you.
- I mean, there's, sort of narrative-wise,
there are techniques to reveal a kind of
self-reflection analysis of the main
character's thoughts. That's why I
brought up the therapist with
Michael. That was a really powerful,
interesting thing to do in
a video game. Like, I, I
don't think I've seen... That's such a
cool... I mean, there's a Sopranos element
there, with the therapist.
- A little bit, yeah.
- I really love an opportunity
for a character to just
self-reflect through that technique.
- But it also changed depending
on what you'd done.
- Yes.
- So it was, it was sort of slightly... It
wasn't as interactive as it could be,
but it was slightly interactive, or
slightly responsive to what you'd done.
So it felt it was still valid video game
content, 'cause it was living, up to a point.
And I just thought the character, Dr.
Friedlander, was just funny, 'cause he was awful.
So it was like LA. You're in therapy.
It's very LA. But it's also very LA, he

[1:46:02]
wants to write a book and betray you.
Which felt like a good, a good twist.
It felt like a Grand Theft Auto
therapist. But just like the idea
of making the player in a game,
and games are intrinsically kind
of physical, and, you know, you...
you walk, you punch things, you run
around, you drive cars, you shoot people,
whatever. There are these kind of physical
fantasies. Trying to put them into a
slightly more reflective or metaphysical
state for a moment, I think can be really
fun.
- I think, to me, one of the most surprising
things about Red Dead Redemption, about
video games, that Red Dead
Redemption showed is how much
value for storytelling is insanely
specific, intricate details.
In the story, but also visually. It just
added to the feeling that the world is
real. So I have to ask,
what are some of your, um,
favorite insanely specific, intricate
details in RDR? I can give you some

[1:47:01]
options. The internet's favorite is horse
testicles shrinking in cold weather.
- Yep. Those guys did an
amazing job on those.
- I mean, I just... And there must've been a
meeting, and there must've been engineers
and graphics designers.
- It was just, I think just artists.
- Artists
- Modelers, I think. I don't
think it was that hard.
- Okay.
- Enough of that pun.
- Thank you for that. Arthur's hair
and beard grow in real time.
So, gun maintenance matters. Firearms
get dirty and perform worse over
time. Animal carcasses
decompose realistically.
- They feel like they do.
- That's still extremely rare in video
games. That, the temporal aspect.
- Yes. Yeah.
- That permeates through time.
You know, NPCs remembering you.
- That's
the best. I mean, that's the thing I
love. Playing around with a lot of stuff
in the new games around that, 'cause
I think it's super interesting. Okay?
- It's really powerful, right?
- To make them... Yeah, really
interesting. I think it just gives a...
it's a really fun way of giving
you kind of narrative content

[1:48:04]
that is also systemic and procedural.
- Yeah. Is it technically really
difficult to do for the
game, for the game to feel like
it remembers you? You know?
- Um, I think with modern tech it's
not that hard, but there's a
lot of stuff you need to
track to make it interesting.
- Yeah, to have a memory.
So that's really powerful. The mud
physics. So Arthur's boots get
muddy and leave actual tracks. I mean,
that's just incredible. Really, really
incredible.
- You know, we made a dusty game. Red Dead 1
is a super dusty game. Make, you know, the
problem with
cowboys is that if you've tried to make
a Greatest Hits of the Cowboy game, and
then you've got to make a sequel, you've
got to come up with different geography.
So that's why the game starts in the snow.
So we wanted a game that had snow and mud,
because those were things you hadn't really seen in
Red Dead 1. And then the challenge is how do you make
mud good in a game? And the
guys did an amazing job.
- I mean, the snowstorm
that starts the game,
RDR2, I don't remember the last
time I've experienced anything

[1:49:02]
like it, but you felt it. I don't know
how the hell you do that. It's not just
graphics, it's everything. Everything
together. I suppose some of the
dialogue is really important to that.
- Also the acting. They feel cold.
- Yeah, that's right.
- And they feel desperate. There
was that feeling of sort of
- Yes
- exodus. Like you're running away from
something, that gives the game energy at the
start.
- And it was at night. Oh man,
it was just masterfully done.
- And there was a big group
of them. The other cont-
- Yes.
- You know, first game, you start off as a lone
wolf. Suddenly you're in this big group.
So it felt very different.
- In Arthur's body, bullet wounds persist.
So that, that temporal consistency-
...that's really important.
Underweight Arthur looks gone, and
overweight Arthur gets a gut.
And a fuller face. Again,
those decisions that you make
reveal themselves in the game across
time. And they're consistent.
I don't know. I did not see many games
do that. It must be difficult to
do, but to give that level
of care to the details in
that way across time and for specific

[1:50:02]
graphical representations
of things is incredible.
- Yeah. I mean, I guess-
- Do you have favorites where you
were first like, "This is amazing?"
- I think all of it. I think the way the whole...
To me, the thing that I would care about most
was the way the whole thing sat together.
You know, the fact that each of
those, they all feel like they
belong together with each
other. You made this
cohesive, very, you know,
quote-unquote, "realistic" for a video
game experience, and all the details
feel like they mesh.
- Well, for me, everything about the horse.
For a lot of people.
Testicle shrinking included.
What's the process of deciding?
The internet seems to really care
about... I mean, they love the game so
much, so they want to know if anything
was cut. I'm sure stuff was cut
because you have to choose.
What's the process of deciding what to
cut, what to cut scenes like? Is there any
scenes that you had to let go of that
you really miss or wish you could've

[1:51:01]
done in either GTA or RDR?
- Well, I think the games ended up
the way they were supposed to be.
You know, I think there was always...
There was a bit at the start of RDR
where he'd had a baby
who just died in Red Dead 2, and
we ended up cutting it, which
was the right decision. It was too
tough in some ways. But I think
it gave him real... He was not
very sympathetic to his occasional
girlfriend who'd had the baby. And
so, it made him very, very nasty at the start,
which I thought would be interesting to
play around with because then it would
make his redemptive arc even more
interesting. He was not a likable character
at the start, and that was one...
We ended up making him slightly more like...
He was still sort of tough and nasty, but he's
slightly more likable early on.
That was the right decision
commercially. It's better that way.
But you know, I still like that
little bit. It spoke to me
personally. And just his inability to

[1:52:02]
access his emotions I thought was really strong
because then later in the game he's getting very
emotional. But there are also
always little bits and pieces that
get trimmed. You know, and don't... Or
missions that just are not going to work technically.
Usually, it's like, "This mission's not going to work
technically. Oh God, we have to
cut it. Okay, how do we glue
the story back together?" We got
better over time at gluing the story
across missing chunks. You get late
in the game, and it's just something,
you know, some big challenging moment just is
going to look rubbish, so you just get rid of
it.
- I think editing film, and I imagine
editing video games, editing down
is an art form, but it's also
just... It feels like torture
because you're letting go of
things you put so much love into.
- Yeah, it could be changes. You know, if you fall in love
with something and everyone else goes, "Let's change
it," that could be... of course that could be upsetting
in some ways. Otherwise, you can care about it.
But, you know, if I was
involved in the big
creative thing and you go, "Okay, it's the right
decision," I can probably live with that fine.

[1:53:03]
I think sometimes for designers when they're only
designing four or five missions in the whole
game and two of them get cut, that
must be really... ...Really hard.
- Is there DLCs like for RDR or GTA that you
wish you had the time when you
were there to have created?
- Of course. There's always things I wished
I'd done. I always wished I'd done more.
- What would you have added? This
is a fun, like, nerding out.
- We... the internet knows we made
a DLC, single-player DLC for
GTA V that never came out.
And we've also never really
worked on another game. But I
like... the idea of it, it was a
GTA zombie game. That would've been funny.
I think that could've been quite fun.
- What was the GTA V DLC?
- It was one where you played as
Trevor, but he was a secret agent.
- Oh.
- It was... it was cute. It never quite
came together, and it was never finished.
It was about half done when it got abandoned. But I think
if that had come out, probably wouldn't have gotten
to make Red Dead 2. So, there's
always compromises. But it
was... you know, I like making the
stories. For me, I love the model of

[1:54:02]
GTA IV when you had the extra
stories coming afterwards
or Red Dead 1 when you had the zombie pack
coming afterwards. I like just doing these
extra things. So, I would've
personally liked to
have done more of that
in that company. Um,
and with stuff we're doing in the
future, we're going to try and
come up with worlds where
we can add more stories.
I like single-player DLC. I just think the
audience loves it, and it's really fun to make.
- Does it make you a little bit sad that
the gaming industry, in general, is
moving towards more
online, less single-player
DLC? Maybe that observation
is incorrect. But it feels at
this moment, to me, it feels like,
It's easier to make a lot
of money with online...
- If you get it right. And so the game
companies are reaching for that. And
it just makes me really sad because there's
so much power to the... What you did with
Red Dead Redemption 2, I don't know how during
that time you were able to pull that off, but that

[1:55:00]
was like a breath of fresh air.
Or, in a time where everybody
was moving to online and there was
that huge incentive to that, you go
on and draw, again, the greatest
narrative in video game history and the
greatest character in video
game history, single-player.
- We still love single
player games. And I think
as we started up Absurd, we
did a lot of soul searching.
And also a lot of cynical
looking at what goes well
in the industry. Luckily, if you want
to do what we're forced to do and
also what I want to do, which is make
new IP, you need single player games.
You can launch a multiplayer
game as with new IP.
It's just extremely hard. So, luckily, we
are focusing on what we're good at,
which is open world single player games.
And we might add
multiplayer components to one of them. I think
one of them is going to be really tough, later
on. But we're still thinking that
through. But I think we're really leaning
into single player experience
as being a strength for

[1:56:02]
us as a company and something we
love to do, and I think something a
large part of the audience prefers,
and I'd love to, with all of
those, keep single player DLC
one way or another, going.
- Were there some other game ideas you
considered while at Rockstar and afterwards?
that you didn't go with?
So, like, worlds...
- Oh, yes
- ...or pirate games? I mean, what... I
would love to see the notes, the possible
options.
- Never thought a lot about a pirate game.
- Yeah?
- My son is obsessed with that game, Sea of
Thieves, at the moment, so he's constantly
saying, "Do a pirate game." Haven't really
thought about it too much. We worked a
lot on multiple iterations
of an open world spy game.
- Yeah.
- And it never came together.
- So Agent?
- Agent, and it's had about
five different ... iterations
- ... so good.
- I don't think it works. I concluded
I, and I keep thinking about it sometimes. I
sometimes lie in bed thinking about it, and I've
concluded as an open, as
what makes them really good

[1:57:02]
as film stories makes them not work
as video games. We need to think
through how to do it in a
different way as a video game.
- So for people who don't know, it would be
hypothetically set in the 1970s Cold War era.
- That was one of the versions. There was
another one that was set in current. We had so
many different versions of this game.
- Got it.
- We worked on so many different teams.
- But it would be more
geopolitical, like espionage-
- That, yeah, espionage, like...
- ... and assassinations.
- Yeah, assassinations. I don't know what it
would've been 'cause it never really...
We never got it enough to even do a proper
story on it. We're doing the early work as
you get the world up and running. It never
really found its feet in either of them.
- So interesting.
- And I sort of think I know why,
because one of those films,
they're very, very frenetic
and they beat to beat to beat. You gotta go
here and save the world. You gotta go there and
stop that person being killed and
then save the world. An open-world
game does have moments like that when
the story comes together. But for large
portions, it's a lot kind of looser, and
you're just hanging out and doing what you

[1:58:01]
want. I want freedom. I wanna go over here and do
what I want, and I wanna go over and do what you
want. That's why it works well being a criminal, because
you fundamentally don't have anyone telling you what to
do. We try and create, you know,
external agency through these people
kind of forcing you into the story at
times. But as a spy, that doesn't really work
because you have to be against the clock.
So I think for me, I question if you can
even make a good open-world spy game.
- So interesting. So you have to be able to
ride around in a car and listen to the
radio.
- Yeah, and cruise about.
- Or ride a horse and just look at nature.
- So lots of things would work as open-world
games, but I don't know if a spy does.
- That's brilliantly put. But to me, there's
such espionage and assassinations and...
...the geopolitical international context
is so interesting. But you're right.
I just wanna listen to what
is it? Lazlo and, uh...
- Yeah. Well, you can't. You gotta save the
world. And so you need this time pressure.
- With a Russian accent? Or something. Yeah,
wow. Wow. That's really interesting.

[1:59:01]
- Then we played around with the knights
concept that was looking at...
- Nice
- ...you know, knights, and sort
of trying to do a version of
a mythological game that
could have been fun. And you
know, still love that idea, but
never went very far with it.
- Knights would be going
really far back in history.
- Yeah, it would have to go. It never
got to writing any of it. Just did
some backstory and played around
with a few ideas. But it was
always something I thought I would never do, and
then kind of fell in love with it a little bit.
- You left Rockstar in 2020
and eventually launched
Absurd Ventures, as we've been
talking about. What do you miss about
your time at Rockstar? Are there specific
moments that bring you joy when you
think about them?
- Of course, it was my whole, you
know, it was my life for 20
something years, 21 years or something.
It was, and I moved to
America to do it, and grew
up doing it. I was always living in New
York. It was at times, very intense and at

[2:00:00]
other times, a magical experience. But it
was also just a huge chunk of my life.
- The lows and the highs?
- And the middles. It was
just my life, you know?
My life was that job and the people
I knew in New York, and my family.
And we were doing something that was
intense and innovative, and, you know, both
loved and hated by wider society in
different ways and at different times.
And in this weird company that was
constantly in trouble. So it was really fun.
- Just even looking back at that time
to today, how did you evolve as a
creative mind across those 20 years?
- Well, I was a child. I
was a 25-year-old child.
I didn't know anything, and
I wanted to be a writer.
But I still wasn't writing. And I
bought a notebook and I'd occasionally
scribble in it, and I've still got those
notebooks somewhere. And I was working in video
games, which were the least
literary medium it's possible to imagine at the
time. There was no room for that on PS1 games,
really. Thinking I needed to

[2:01:03]
stop and do something else, but not
having the skills or the confidence to do
it. And I'd been doing that in London.
Then I came to New York, and it
was fun, really fun to be in
New York and really fun to do a
new company in New York. And that was an amazing
adventure, but I was still lost as a human
being. And then when I was 27, I was still
completely lost, a child.
And I stopped some of my bad
behavior, and the next day pretty much
the chance to write on, work on open world games,
and all the skills I'd half learned over the
previous years and my way of thinking, where
I thought about space a lot because I was a
geographer rather than a historian,
came together, and I got the chance to
work on an open world game. So it felt like it was
meant to be. It was fun to explore, but really
fun to explore with this team that
was, you know, Alex Horton and
Navid and Leslie and the guys in
Scotland and all the people in New
York, making these new
games in this new way. And
going, "Oh, we need to find a hundred voices. We've
got no money. How the hell are we going to do

[2:02:01]
that? We'll get everyone's friends in and
just record all lines of dialogue each as
we kind of would invent the way that pedestrians would
speak in video games." No one else was doing that kind of
stuff. It was insane. So I think
that that period from kind of
2001, 2005, it was lots of early
innovation and felt really exciting
because we were doing new stuff. It didn't
feel... It felt creative, but it
didn't feel like writing yet. Just becoming that.
We felt like we were doing lots of creative
things and learning how to assemble the stuff and
learning what it could take. And then I think,
we talked about it earlier, but the
journey into doing GTA4 when it
began to feel more like a proper
writing experience. And I was probably
ready for that at that point. And then
I was like, "Well, this is better than
films. This is something that
films can't do." You know, this
360-degree experience of being this
immigrant. And it still felt, we
were still only scratching the surface. I mean,
it still feels like that now in some ways,
but it still felt a little... And then
that five games, you know, GTA 4 and 5,

[2:03:02]
Red Dead 1 and 2, all the extra packs for
them, and Max Payne 3. I think we took the
games thematically into new places
through that period. From a writing
perspective, that was the most exciting
period. From a business and sort of
early creativity period, the period 2001
to 2005 was probably the most exciting.
to use the original
starting team, all doing
well, yeah, personal life
was doing okay, didn't feel
like such a mess. And then from 2007
onward, '07, '08, was happy personally.
Having children, happily married,
and the games were just getting much better. But
there were lots of pressure in the business.
You know, the budgets got really big,
so it added to the stress. So there's
always good bits and stresses, but,
you know, I always just tried to
show up and do my best and think about how I
could do it in a new way. Always trying to go,
"It's a new medium. What
can we do that's new?"
- But as a writer, as a scholar of

[2:04:01]
human nature. First of all, were you
surprised that you were actually
able, like you had it in
you, through humor and
tragedy, to create these
incredibly compelling characters?
Because I think I remember reading
somewhere that James Joyce, when he
was 20, said that he's going to
be the greatest writer ever.
And I feel like every 20-year-old says
this. It's just James Joyce pulls it off.
- Yes.
- So were you surprised that
you were actually able to do
it? And how did that person get better
and better and better at writing
as you evolved?
- The team got better and better.
so we could write in a more ambitious
way. The animation got better
so we could support it in a better way.
We could go deeper. I mean, you couldn't
go that deep on a PS2 game. So it was
also just the technology evolved. Um,
I don't know. I felt like I was good at
doing it, and I was well-trained for it.
I'd been in the right place
at the right time, and I was

[2:05:02]
both lucky and had a way of
thinking about characters that
when you reduce them to about 10
sentences, was amusing. I think I was a...
And I saw the world in a holistic way.
And saw society in a holistic way
that you could break apart into an
open world video game. I thought
about it a bunch. The way I
think about things was suitable for that, for
whatever reason. That was just good fortune.
- Laszlo mentioned that it was another
legend who you're still working with.
he mentioned that you would lock
yourself in a room, writing
dialogue for radio, I think.
You would lock yourself in a room and get
anchovies and onion pizza and crushed...
Diet Cokes. Is this accurate information?
- Very accurate.
- For which periods of your life
was this a fuel for your creative
process? Is it anchovies and onion pizza?
- I would also get pepperoni on my half.
Just to be technically accurate.
He wouldn't, 'cause he claimed to
be a vegetarian in those days.
But then he'd admit to me he kept
chicken wings hidden in the freezer.

[2:06:01]
So he was a sort of fake vegetarian.
That was... I think we still do it
now sometimes, as a sort of...
- Yes. Homage.
- ...memorialize. But that began in 2001.
And the office at Rockstar
was so small and we were so
broke that there was no... And I
did have a private office at the
time, but it genuinely was a
cupboard. It didn't have a window.
It was literally sitting in a cupboard.
So there was no room and I had a
desk and chair just for myself.
But I lived quite near the
office, so we would write one or two
afternoons a week. He'd come in.
He was a freelancer working with
us. He'd come in from Long Island,
and then we would jump on the
subway, go to my apartment in
Chelsea and sit in this grimy little
apartment I was living in and buy pizza
from around the corner. And that became,
you know, we both liked Diet Coke and
pizza. Very video game
developer. And that became good
luck. And there we'd have these good writing
sessions where we realized we got on well
with each other and that we had a similar
sense of humor and we could write the stuff.
And then he would do all of the real work
producing it. So it was perfect for me,

[2:07:03]
'cause I got to outsource most of the real
work and he's a brilliant radio producer.
So he was a great partner in that way. And
then that was how that relationship began.
And then I'd get him, I would say, "Well,
we've got to record these 80 voices.
Come and help me, 'cause I can't direct 80
people at once." So he helped with that process
and he was a really good producer, like audio,
like getting bodies in producers as well as
technical producer. So he was just that
was the beginning of that relationship.
And it was always... My job was to ensure
the media content felt like it reflected
the tone of the world and we would write it
together, then his job was just to make sure
it sounded funny, like he would just
produce it in a really funny way.
- Just to give a little bit more of
a shout-out to Laszlo, what's it
been like working with him for over 20
years? He's working with you still.
He's this kind of flamboyant, colorful
personality. Much loved for being a
voice also on radio in the
Grand Theft Auto games.
- Yeah, and the rule was, when he was
the character, I would write the first

[2:08:02]
pass of him. So I would... and I would
get nastier and nastier over time.
- Yeah, it's awesome.
- So to the point where he's having his head
shaved and being punished by everybody.
But even in game after game, he got worse.
...he began as this quite... In GTA
3, he's a quite likable character.
Over the next 12, 13 years,
it just got worse and worse.
So, I think he's glad not to be doing
that anymore, but he did it with great
grace. He's just a great partner
because he likes, you know,
...like me, we just like making stuff. He
likes to make stuff. He likes to work in new
spaces. He's been a great help on
bringing the comic book to life,
doing a lot of the work on that.
He's working on that right now.
And he's really fun to work with, and
he's, you know, always
will put creativity first.
And he's ridiculous. He's just a really...
- In the best possible way, yeah.
Outside of the games you've
participated and created,
what do you think are some candidates
for the greatest game of all time?

[2:09:01]
- Tetris.
- Tetris Game Boy. No question.
- Tetris and the Game Boy, yeah.
- It was the perfect device for playing that
game. I never liked it as much on anything
else. When my wife was trying
to get a retro one for my
kids, trying to get them
for Christmas right now.
It was the most addicted I ever was to
anything in my life, of far too many
addictions. I was obsessed by it,
dreaming about it, and when you link
two together with the cable and if I got four, it
would push yours forward. It was like the perfect game
design. So from a pure puzzle
perspective, nothing comes close.
- Yes. Extremely simple. Pure
gameplay. No narrative.
- No, nothing. No personality at all.
It's a completely different thing.
- Perfection.
- But perfect in its way. Open World
games can't be that perfect.
But you always dream of
making something like that.
- And Super Mario.
- I think the N64 ones.
All of those early 3D games were very
amazing when you first saw them.

[2:10:01]
On the N64, PS1, when you went,
it suddenly was like these
games, they're alive, and they're
believable in a different way. I think
that was very interesting.
- It looks nothing like anything else.
- Nintendo has that look,
doesn't it? Always.
- Yeah. I think that's the, they're
known for this Nintendo polish,
of every pixel has a purpose.
- Yes.
- And I mean, I suppose Tetris
has that same real focus
on delivering a pure gaming experience
with as little as possible. It's really
beautiful. And of course, Zelda really
pioneered a lot of sort
of the feeling of...
...of a world, but it's
not quite open world.
- No, but it's amazing. It's almost like...
the new ones, they almost, to me,
feel like Hitchcock. They're just
speaking the language of video games, you know.
Like, you know everything's going to work
this way and that way. It's quite
systemic, but it's so, how it all
glues together is so amazing. It feels
like when you watch a Hitchcock film, it's
not reality. He's speaking the
language of cinema in a very, very

[2:11:02]
strong, with a very strong accent
almost. It's very, very cinematic. It's
not realism at all. And that's what those
Zelda games kind of feel like to me.
They are these amazing things that could only
be video games. They couldn't be anything
else.
- For me, another really powerful open
world is The Elder Scrolls world.
It's role-playing, it's fantasy,
dragons, all that kind of stuff.
- Todd is great at what he does. It is.
They're slightly, they're more...
I mean, from a technical perspective,
we're always involved. I mean, with
the new games, we're
constantly trying to find the
balance between, you know, an RPG,
a role-playing game, and an action
game. And then, you know, try to go,
"Well, an action-adventure game with
RPG elements." And what does that mean? And I think
they've all kind of moved into roughly the same
space. But for me, it always just comes
down to, are... is it easy to play? Are our
mechanics super slick? And then can we
keep our dialogue feeling very alive?

[2:12:02]
Like, I'm not always a great...
For just what we do, I like
when other people do it. For what we do,
we always want very punchy dialogue. So,
don't give big trees, but
still have it interactive.
So we're going to lose a touch of interactivity,
but we'll still have the dialogue
feeling like it's alive. But we'll get
better at dialogue, and it'll feel
a slightly more cinematic experience.
- Yeah, I think The Elder Scrolls
series has almost always leaned a
little more towards the open world.
- Yes, they're real RPGs. You know, we've
not... The games that I've worked
on, they've not really
been RPGs. They've had RPG
elements onto a story-driven
action game. It's kind of just a
slightly different emphasis, but I still think
what they do is amazing, and he's brilliant at
doing.
- And I think Grand Theft Auto, Red
Dead Redemption, and Skyrim are
games where you have millions of
people that just walk
around or drive around.
- Mm-hmm. And feel the world.
- Feel the world. Just feel the world.

[2:13:01]
- And The Witcher, same thing.
- And Baldur's Gate 1, 2, and
3, really interesting. They
really tried to make every choice that you
make genuinely branch the game,
to where it's not the illusion of
choice, it's really...
- Nothing. Yeah.
- It's really, choice really does
something, and that's really hard to pull
off technically.
- Yes, and hard to pull off.
You're always sort of
debating the sweet spot between
that and a strong story.
You know, and strong mechanics. It's
hard to get them all, and you know as a
As a game-making team,
the whole team kind of
have to figure out where they
want to fall on that line.
- On a difficult topic, you dedicated
the book to your mom and dad.
And in particular, you wrote, "To my
father, who died while I was finishing the
book." What have you learned
about life from your dad?
- To show up. To be present. To
go to work every day. To love

[2:14:05]
creative things. He was a lawyer,
but he was also a jazz musician,
and he did both to the best of
his abilities. To value family as
more important than either of those
things. He was a present guy,
I think. And, you know, he loved books,
always loved books, always loved films,
loved music. He wasn't into video games,
but liked that we were doing weird things.
- Was he proud of you?
- Yeah, I think so. I hope
so. He was, for a lawyer...
He really venerated at some
level, giving "the man" the
finger. Like, whenever life goes crazy—
he was always on the side of the
underdog and the ridiculous. And I

[2:15:00]
think that, you know, he
always wanted to answer
people back, always give the silly
comment. I certainly have taken
that from him, to my detriment
probably, but it makes life more fun.
He always would just say the obnoxious
thing and just didn't give a fuck.
And that was, I think that
was probably quite inspiring.
- So you have a bit of that in you?
- Unfortunately so, yes. Not good at
shutting up, not good at toeing the line.
- I think I speak for most
of human civilization that
fortunately you have
that as part of who you
are, because it comes
through your stories.
- I think it made school difficult. They
sent me to this very formal school—
that was like, it might as well
have been set in the 1870s, in the
1990s. And, but then, I
always got in trouble
just for... not doing anything that
wrong, just answering teachers back
all of the time. I couldn't be quiet.

[2:16:01]
- How often do you think about mortality?
Are you personally afraid of death?
- Well, my father passed away in May, so a
lot more since then, obviously. I mean, I
think about it a lot. Am I afraid of it?
I don't know. Some days intensely and some
days not at all. I would love to stay
alive long enough to see my kids
properly grow up and settled, of
course, for them. Aside
from that, some days I
feel, you know, spiritually connected
to the universe and not afraid of
death at all. And other
days I feel like a sort of
random piece of good luck
who's gonna get struck down by
an angry fate and turn to
nothingness, and that terrifies me.
- What do you think about the nothingness? I
mean, that- that in itself is terrifying.
- Yeah, that is terrifying.
I mean, I tend to,

[2:17:00]
I tend to, you know, I've spent long
periods of my life tormented by that stuff.
The last few years, I tend to
believe there is a purpose and a
point to life, and that
we have some kind of
spiritual or soul-based existence. I'm
not quite sure if it matters if there
is a God or not, we should probably
live our lives the same way either way.
But I tend to think that, you
know, there is a metaphysical
purpose to life and part of the,
that purpose is to, you know,
search for the purpose. But at
other points you know, if you
read too much science, you get wrapped
up in the nothingness of it all.
- Also, there's a component to
your brain. When talking about
Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë,
you said that you have been, by
fortune, struck with a
bit of a capacity for the
grandiosity of feeling. So you
feel the world deeply, sometimes
romantic, sometimes overly
romantic. You've said, I like this
line, "Feelings may destroy you, but
they're the best thing we have." So that

[2:18:03]
ability to feel the world, is that a gift
or a curse for you? What do you think?
- That's a really interesting question because
it's obviously both. At times it's both,
or at times it's one or the other. When
things are going well, when you feel
alive, when you feel like you're
connected to things, when you're seeing
beauty in people and joy in
experiences, of course it's
it's wonderful. When you're
feeling like, you know, bereft and
set adrift by the world and that you can't
connect to it in some way and you're lost
and abandoned by
God or consciousness or fate or whatever
it is, it's awful. You know, when I feel
like
a dreadful hack, which is most of the time,
you know, it's terrible. You'd rather not
be doing this rubbish. And then sometimes you're working
creatively and it feels good and you feel like you're doing
the right thing and it feels
fantastic, but that's not very often.
- Do you think it's possible to
have one without the other?
- No. No, of course not. When I think
about growing up to the extent that

[2:19:04]
I am capable of growing up
it is about accepting the bad
with the good from any situation
or any aspect of myself. You know, going,
"Okay, it's not perfect. I'm not perfect."
- You said you often feel
like a hack. Is that that
self-critical part of your brain,
is that a feature or a bug?
- That's an, I think it's that new thing that
we're gonna lean into, the bug feature.
It's both, isn't it? I mean,
it cannot lead... That
self-critical brain, I think lots of
people suffer from it, and I think
the internet is designed to induce, if you
didn't have it before, you will have it after
being online. It clearly can become a bug
but it also can give you drive
and a lack of complacency,
so it can also become a feature.
- I had a pretty intense argument
with Paul Conti, who's a
legendary psychiatrist, student of the
mind, about this. He worked with many

[2:20:06]
famous creative people and
he thinks that that negative
voice is not at all needed for creative
genius. And I thought,
"I know awfully a lot of
creative people that have that voice."
- I'd rather not have it, but I certainly
have lived with it this far. There's a
danger that negativity... For me, that
negativity and consciousness become
the same thing, you know? Sometimes I
have to fight to not just
be perpetually negative,
and that can be part of the human struggle
for lots of people and certainly has been for
me. I think if you're trying
to do, you know, good
stuff and you're reflective,
inevitably, and, you know,
you live in this world of constant,
constant criticisms by the
internet. Of course, you know, everyone
who ever puts something on the internet,
be it a picture of themselves or any
kind of work they've made or whatever it

[2:21:02]
is, is going to get 50 good comments
and one bad comment. Remember the bad
comment. So that, and that, that becomes
fuel for the negative voice. I don't know
anyone that's strong enough not to. You know,
we all, you know, at some level you should
just measure that stuff in weight, not in
quality. But of course we just focus on the
- And I do think in general, as you get older,
that's the real challenge for people. You
can see the different trajectories
people choose to take. But it's
easy to slip into cynicism
and negativity, into this,
Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground,
nihilistic kind of worldview.
I think the heroic action to
take with time is to become more
optimistic, to see more good. I think that-
- I agree.
- There's probably a hero's journey of
being extremely self-critical at first,
for the first, maybe half of your
life or two-thirds, and then,
while maintaining some self-critical
aspects just so you stay

[2:22:01]
humble, start to see the
good in everything around
you, in other people, in the world,
and even maybe every once in a
while on a weekend, in yourself.
- I hope so. I mean, that's what
I've been, I could not be more
cynical. I think you put that beautifully.
- Yeah.
- I could not be more cynical than
I was as a child. You know, I
could not see goodness anywhere. I
couldn't see, you know, I don't think
late 1970s to early 1990s
England was a great,
was a place of great, you know,
optimism and naiveté. It was
brutal. And I was brutal, I
was brutal within it. And I
think I've become much more naive,
and tried to become more innocent
in some ways, and always try to
see the flawed good in people.
You know, I've tried to, or I've
had to force myself to be like that because,
you know, the other way is not fun,
it's not nice. It's not
nice to not be nice.
- As a brief aside, you had a
wonderful conversation with Ryan

[2:23:03]
McCaffrey at LA Comic-Con.
I've been a big fan of
his for a long time. He writes amazing
stuff at IGN and he has a great
podcast. Everybody should go listen to it.
I really enjoyed it. Plus I get to attend a
Comic-Con and just be there in the
audience. And like we were saying offline,
the LA Comic-Con, it's the first Comic-Con
I've been to, there's just all kinds of
real genuine nerds, good-hearted-
- Oh, it's fascinating. Yeah, brilliant.
- It's just so much kindness and goodness
and just simple joy in being
a fan of a thing was there.
- Yeah, which is what those
things are all about.
- Yeah. Okay, so let's talk about some
of the greatest books of all time.
And I should also give a shout-out to
an excellent podcast he did with Sonia
Walger, who's a friend of yours,
but she had a great podcast.
She has guests pick their five favorite,
most impactful books and so on.
You picked five fiction books,
one for each decade of your life.
For the audience, they should
go listen to that conversation.
But you picked Winter
Holiday by Arthur Ransome.

[2:24:00]
Second one was Wuthering
Heights by Emily Brontë.
Then Tender Is the Night by F.
Scott Fitzgerald, The Thin Red
Line by James Jones, and
Middlemarch by George Eliot.
But just zooming out, reflecting back on
that conversation, what do you think,
if an alien came, what are
some candidates for books
that you would recommend to them?
- Middlemarch. It's the best
novel written in English.
War and Peace is one of the best novels
written in Russian, I would argue.
I think both of those are...
Because if you've only got one
book, you want a long book.
- Yeah, true.
- And then they're both
books that kind of...
It's something I was always trying to put
into games, and you know, that feeling
of all of life is here. You know, you've
got love, death, violence, romance,
the whole human experience in different
ways. So I think there's something amazing
about, you know, Vanity Fair, I used
to love the novel, not the magazine.

[2:25:00]
Because same thing, all of life is here.
- You also spoke highly of F.
Scott Fitzgerald and Hemingway.
- I was obsessed by them in my 20s.
- Yeah.
- Completely obsessed.
- As one must be.
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.
- At that age, and I think them
as a double act is so amazing.
You know, one helped discover the other
and then died first, and then suddenly
died in obscurity and then
was rediscovered as a genius
while the other one was still
alive and falling into decline,
I think their relationship
is itself very novelistic.
- That, by the way, is a
phenomenon of writing maybe no
longer, maybe still, you know, people
like Franz Kafka who died in obscurity.
All these writers who die in
obscurity. Nobody knows them and they
become famous later. That is just so
interesting. That's such an interesting...
You know, Franz Kafka.
Kafka in particular is fascinating because
he wanted all of his work to be burned,

[2:26:03]
like destroyed. So that,
speaking of the critical
voice, and I think he's one of the,
one of the best writers of the
20th century. Of course, the
dystopian novels are really
interesting: 1984, Brave New World.
- Love 1984. Had never listened
to it or read it, and then I
think I did it on Talking Book, or I maybe
read it, I can't remember, during COVID.
I think I did both, became obsessed by
it. And it's got the elements of that
creeping into A Bed of
Paradise. But it's so good.
I hadn't realized how good it was.
- Yes.
- And it's so of the moment.
- It's almost like because
of its fame, and...
it's almost like cliché, and
you take away the character-
- Yeah, if it were English...
And I remember the year 1984-
and you're like, "This is..." I remember
the song. You know? It's just too much.
- Yeah. Too much.
- It can't be that good. And then it was that.
I came to it completely cold, just, "Oh, I
should work my way through this 'cause it's
another classic I haven't read." And then
it's incredible.
- And the book I've read more than any other
book is Animal Farm by George Orwell.

[2:27:03]
I don't know why exactly, but the childlike
fairy tale-telling of totalitarianism.
- Well, you grew up in a communist country.
- Yeah. Maybe that's it. The roots of it.
- You know, I remember, I was
a kid in the Cold War in
London. And we were always terrified of
Eastern Europeans, "You're gonna come and kill
us all." And then I ended up marrying a
Pole. And I was... We were... And we had
Ukrainians, you know, who
worked for us and worked with
us. And I was... We were sitting,
a few years ago, sitting around a
campfire in Upstate New York,
with the campfire built by
our old nanny's husband, who's
Ukrainian, and he'd been in the Red
Army. I was like, history is so strange that you
end up... The Red Army used to be the ultimate
enemy. And like, we're now just hanging
out with... It's like, everything changes.
You think these things are
permanent, and they're really not.
You know, and we face some of that now, where you
think these structures are permanent, and they're
gonna change.
- And you also mentioned that the three
great World War II books are The Thin Red

[2:28:03]
Line, Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman.
And The End of the Affair, Graham
Greene. What makes for a great war book?
- I think World War II
is interesting because it affects everywhere,
obviously. And so you can get all these different
kinds of stories. And there's so many good...
I was just trying to come up with a range
of one American, one British, one
Eastern European just to get different
perspectives. But there's so
many amazing World War II books
around all kinds of stories. I think
the most complete one, because it
is this all of life being there,
probably is Life and
Fate, which is amazing.
- It was written by Vasily Grossman.
He experienced Stalingrad firsthand.
And there's also just a deep
philosophical component.
- And the bit in Treblinka is one of the
most harrowing sections of any book I ever
read. And it really, almost more than any
other piece of art around the Holocaust,

[2:29:02]
made me feel
what you would feel like at that moment. I
mean, it's just incredible piece of humanism.
- And also, I mean, Man's Search
for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- It seems like that context
reveals, in the most
pure way, human nature and like what
kind of... You know, in Man's Search for
Meaning is when everything is taken
from you, you know, the little
remains of love for, in
this case, his wife...
is the thing that is a
little flame that burns.
And let's say your Grossman
is small acts of kindness,
is the thing that allows the
human spirit to persist.
- I love the bit in Life and Fate when
you get... Obviously, it's in this
Stalinist period, and so they're all
losing... They all know that what
they thought was going to be
wonderful about the revolution isn't
going to happen. So everyone's
scared of being killed by Stalin 'cause it's
post the purges. But then you get these

[2:30:01]
guys and they're trapped
in a building, fighting in
Stalingrad. And so they know
at this moment they're dead
anyway. And they get to
live like pure, perfect
Marxist communists away from Stalin and
all his nonsense. And I thought that
section's incredible 'cause you realize
in some ways, in all of its horrors,
the most disappointing thing about the 20th
century, in some ways, was the absolute
failure of communism. You know? 'Cause
it was such a, you know, quote-unquote
beautiful idea and it just did
not work time and time again.
And these people who fought
for it and then saw it not
working, I think they're sort of
fascinating characters. You know,
all of the revolutionaries from
1917 that were then killed by Stalin,
which was all of them apart from
him, him and Lenin.
- And that was, you know, people in modern
day politics talk about communism
like it's trivial, it's trivial
that it would lead to atrocities.
But I don't think it's that trivial.
It's this idealism of humans.

[2:31:04]
It's like, why, you know, why
can't... Basically, why can't we all
get along? There's a real compassion behind
it. There's real love. And what you realize is
there is... It's a real study, the
20th century, of human nature.
that, unfortunately, at scale, that
kind of compassion is abused by
centralized power. So there's a
dictator always, in that context,
given that set of technologies, a
dictator arises and does the opposite
of what the promise of the
ideal is supposed to be.
- Well, I think I thought a lot about that
then because I was taught by all these
disappointed communists, you know?
After '89, all of these English communists,
you know, were all like having to
access, discovering all these atrocities
that happened. You know, so it always
fascinated me. And then you think about
complexities or where one's own values are

[2:32:01]
in the modern moment. And I say,
you know, without from every
and whether either of them, what we would
call left now or call right now, does it
have any bearing on the sort of communist
era of those words? And I would say probably
not. I think things have changed. But
fundamentally, the one value that
I would think is worth
fighting for is, whenever
either side starts to move towards
thought control, move away.
That's never the right outcome. The
never right outcome is, "Oh, you've
said the wrong thing. You should be
removed now." That should never ever be
a thing we should lean towards.
- Yeah, it does seem like freedom,
individual freedom, is a prerequisite for
- for happiness, and the
flourishing of a larger society.
So there's, like you said, 1984 is
pretty. I mean, it's a caricature.
- But it is brilliant.
- It's quite, it's actually also just
a good story. That's my criticism of
Brave New World, it's just
poorly written. But I like
Brave New World probably applies more
to the 21st century than does 1984. So,

[2:33:02]
- I don't know. I think 1984, with the
fake wars, and the way that it revealed
everything in it was a setup for him.
There's something that if he could've seen the
Internet. There's something of, it's like an
analog internet, that world they
build around the main character.
- What advice would you give
to a young person today
about, let's say, a career?
How to have a career they can
be proud of? How they can have a life to be
proud of? You've had a non-standard life.
- I've had a lucky life in which I have
fought to mess things up, and
fate has always thrown me a bone.
- You've traveled in South America and
had hobos chase you with machetes.
- Yeah. Once.
- Yeah, yeah. So that happened.
- That was a series of poor life decisions.
And I ran, I ran away. You know,
I ran away to South America.
That was a poor decision. I ran
away from the guy with a knife.

[2:34:00]
That was a good decision. I came to
America. That was a good decision.
I came to LA, that's, I
think, been a good decision.
It's been fun to see a different side
of America and be in a different
creative environment. LA is
still amazing for creativity
and entertainment, the wider entertainment
industry stuff. I think that's
been fun. What would I say? I would say,
when you get a chance, take it.
That was one thing I did do well.
When I got chances, I
was good at taking them.
I would say, do not worry
too young about your career.
I would say, worry about having a
rounded intellectual inner life,
'cause you're gonna spend your whole
life in your own head. So the more
interesting you find your own head, the
more interesting you find the world,
the less you're gonna annoy
yourself. So I would say, I would,
I would say, do not do a vocational
degree as an undergraduate.

[2:35:01]
That's been my... I would say,
do something else. Do something,
you know, random and then focus
afterwards. That would be, I think I was
advocating against the obsession that
people had about four years ago with
STEM subjects. And now AI is gonna make
them all irrelevant anyway, perhaps.
So, you know, it's interesting
to see everything changes.
Jobs are not that hard. You
know, turn up, be enthusiastic.
Be, but turn up in person, be
enthusiastic. Help people.
Say, "You'll be fine in any
job." People is, you know.
- Did you always know when the chance to take
showed up? Like this is, okay, this is
interesting, this is
new, this is different?
- Not always, no. But the big times
were the chance to move to America.
For me, that was a big moment.
My life was a mess in...
- That was weird timing. So I read that
Sam wrote you an email. What, what...
in South America?
- I literally, I was in South America...
...in Colombia where there
was a war raging there.

[2:36:03]
I was making a series of very poor life
choices and a lack of life skills, age 25.
My latest poor choice was to get up too
early, because the police didn't start
work till 9:00, but the muggers started
at 8:00. And so I was out walking along
the beach at 8:00 and these...
guys, this Rasta who turned up, who
I'd been talking to the day before,
started trying to talk to me. And
then two guys came up to talk to him,
and I couldn't tell...
if they were trying to mug him 'cause he
owed them money or he brought me to them.
But I did notice one of them had a machete
and the other had a kind of broken gun.
So I thought, "This is not good." And I ran
off, sprinted down the beach in my silly shoes.
And got the chance, for
once in my life, to run over to
a road, jump into a taxi and
scream, "Take me anywhere!" I felt
like I'm in an action movie, and a
guy's chasing after with a machete. The taxi
driver looks back, sees the dude with the machete,

[2:37:01]
and goes, "?" And I'm, "No, no,
no, they're not my friends."
"Get me out of here." He drove me
up the street into a bit where
the town was. It's kind of between the old
town and the new town in Cartagena. And
I got out of the car and then cut my
foot on a rock. That was the sum total
of my injuries. Then I went to an
internet café, cause this was probably
late '98, and got the
chance to come and work
on a game for six weeks in New York. And
I was like, "Well, if I stay in South
America much longer, I'm going to get myself
killed," 'cause this was when I was getting into
silly stuff.
And so I went to New York, and they were
just starting Rockstar. I got to sort
of write the mission statements and
whatnot there, and help set the tone for
that and just ended up
staying. I had to come and go
a bit while all visas got sorted
out. And then I just ended up
staying, "I'll stay for a year 'cause
New York's pretty fun." It actually was
not that-- this was the height of
Giuliani before he was a maniac. So

[2:38:04]
you couldn't-- when you went to bars,
you were told you couldn't dance.
'Cause they were trying to clamp
down on New York being fun.
So it was actually less fun than London, but
there's still a great energy in New York.
And I got exposed to the kind of
madness of New York capitalism.
- By the way, as we hear sirens in the background,
that always makes me think of New York.
- Yeah, of course.
- Whenever I'm in New York...
- Yeah
- ...there's always sirens.
- Steam coming out the floor, people screaming
at you. I mean, you get people screaming at
you in LA, at least.
- Yeah, but it's more
distributed, it's more, uh...
- Yeah, it's more spread out.
- ...spread out, yeah.
- You can get a bit more quiet here.
I love the energy. It was great
to work hard and then be able to
go out for dinner late. And New York was
really, really a fun experience for me.
- You worked with your brother, Sam,
for many years. What do you admire
about him as a creative
mind, as a human being?
- His drive and his vision early
on to see what video games could

[2:39:01]
become. He was the one who
understood that video games were
the next big thing. And I think
that was, you know, people would
laugh in our face about that in those
days. To have someone that was strong
and saying, "No, no, we stick, stay
the course," and then having the
confidence to push through
with these big projects.
- Are you excited for the
future of video games?
- Yeah, completely. I still look... I'm glad
you've spoken so, I mean, you've spoken
so kindly about our work, about the
stuff that I did, and the stuff the whole
teams did. It's wonderful. But I just
look at it and see problems and see things
that we can make do better. You know,
I think it was always, try each time to do it
better. And some of the stuff we're working on now
is going to do stuff that people
haven't really seen before. I
think it's just, I think that
games can get so much better.
They can feel so much more alive.
They can be better at storytelling
and feel more alive and feel

[2:40:01]
like, you know, their systems, all
the stuff, the component parts
we talked about. We can make
each of those parts better.
and tie them together better. I think the
technology still feels like it's only just
beginning. Cinema evolved from, like,
1900, 1895, whenever it was, until
they invented talking in 1930 or
whenever that was. It's not that.
Then it kind of found its modern form,
and then by '39, they're shooting in
color. Basically, a modern film
is no different from a 1939
film. But with games, I still think
we've got a long way to go. The tech...
There are so many different parts of the
tech that still have a long way to go,
and you can go in all
different fun directions.
- I just wish... and I know you said
video games take a lot less than they
could, but I just wish it was faster.
Like, you've already made me...
- Me too
- fall in love with Absurdiverse and you've
made me fall in love with The Better
Paradise, and now I'm going to sit
depressed, realizing we'll have to
wait. I could, of course, read.

[2:41:02]
- Well, we should have some little
short cartoons coming out in a while
for Absurdiverse and more
stuff coming in the next
period. But yeah, it just takes
a little bit of time. I mean,
big movies are four years
plus from start to end.
You know, with all the legal stuff at
the start. We'll be about the same.
- Yeah, and certain movies from idea
to completion, I mean, take 10 plus
years for some of the greats.
- Yeah, often. A lot of that is
just that development process.
that is really... Sometimes it feels
like it's designed to not make stuff.
- A bit more specific advice, but on the
topic of video games, what advice would
you give to maybe independent video game
creators that are dreaming
of creating great
games? They're inspired by Red
Dead. They're inspired by all the
incredible open worlds and
narratives you've created. How's it
possible to have a chance at
doing something like that?
- I mean, it's part of... There's two
ways: try and do it cheaply with
yourself and a small group, or
join a company that you think

[2:42:03]
is doing it the right way, you know? And
I think there's upsides to either of
those. I think if you want
to make something that's
cinematic... Yeah, AI is going to change
some of this. But if you want to make
something that's cinematic, you need resources. You can
still make something that's really interesting that
isn't super cinematic, but it's an interesting
experience in some ways. But the second you're
involving actors and motion capture
and one of those big experiences,
it's going to cost some money. So therefore, if
you want to do that, you've got to figure out
what companies you want to work at and
figure out how you get to work there.
- Do you have hope for AI
helping with some of the
video generation, some of the world
generation, or some of the open world
assistance in generating the world?
- Yes. Limited. Absolutely, if
used correctly, it will be a
great tool. If used incorrectly, it
will lead to loads of generic stuff.
You know, I've been in games for
29 years and all the time, the
piece of tech that's going to make making games
much easier and much cheaper is about to turn

[2:43:02]
up, and all that's happened is the games
have got much better and way more expensive.
So I'm always nervous about saying,
"Finally, we have that bit of
tech that makes our lives easier," but it looks as if
it might be able to do that when you use it in the
right way. If you use it, you know, if
you use it to try and as a substitute for
creativity, it's going
to be really generic.
- A big ridiculous question. What's the
meaning of this whole thing we have going
on here, of life, of
existence? Why are we here?
- To watch the universe.
The easiest plausible
answer is we are designed by
the universe to watch itself
and to comment on it in interesting ways.
- Consistently more and more
interesting ways. Yeah. What role
does love play as part of that?
- It's the only thing that
makes it possibly worth
doing. Everything else,
everything material is
irrelevant. So the only things of
value are these immaterial things.
You know, I do think metaphysics
always trumps physics for me.

[2:44:03]
- Well, Dan, from the bottom of my
heart, speaking of love, thank you.
- What a pleasure. Thank you, man.
- Thank you for everything you've created in
this world. Me and millions of die-hard
fans of your games are forever
grateful. I know there's a lot of
people that would like
to say thank you to you.
- Just to be clear, 'cause I always
like to make this very clear--
...it was never me.
It was always me sat alongside
people with actual real talent who
did amazing things.
- Well, I hope you keep being
self-critical and creating
awesome stuff in the world. And
we can't wait to keep exploring the worlds
you create. And thank you so much for
talking today, brother.
- Thank you for having me. What a privilege.
- Thanks for listening to this conversation

And now let me leave you
with some words from Ernest
Hemingway, one of Dan's and my
favorite writers. "The world breaks

[2:45:05]
everyone, and afterward,
many are strong at the
broken places." Thank you for
listening. I hope to see you next time.
