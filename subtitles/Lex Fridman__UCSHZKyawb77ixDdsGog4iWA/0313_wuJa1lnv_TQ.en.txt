Ilona asks how many hours of sleep do
you normally manage to get to your
schedule how do you avoid burning out
well first
heaven is nine and a half hours

[00:18]
on a day maybe there's a little bit of
rain for some reason even though you
live in the city it's quiet an
occasional car slowly driving by heaven

[00:30]
occasional car slowly driving by heaven
is getting those nine and a half no
heaven is the first cup of coffee after
the nine and a half hours of sleep yeah
optimal performance wise I like to get
seven or eight hours of sleep I don't

[00:47]
seven or eight hours of sleep I don't
often get that amount of sleep though
and I think the rest is just all mental
I still often pull nights where it's one
to three hours of sleep I frequently
pull all-nighters
maybe an average about 10 to 15

[01:03]
maybe an average about 10 to 15
all-nighters a year all have to do with
deadlines and just focus a few
occasional rare beautiful all-nighters
are sort of your soak pad I'm so

[01:16]
are sort of your soak pad I'm so
passionate about a particular idea they
just can't wait I can't wait to see it
work and I guys stay up all night you
know through noon in the afternoon and

[01:30]
know through noon in the afternoon and
then maybe go to bed early next night
you know go to bed at like 9:00 p.m. or
something like that burn out too you
know what I don't believe I'm a burnout
it's it's not like a I think I think

[01:45]
it's it's not like a I think I think
there's just a voice of laziness that
can be defeated with uh with the sword
of focus perseverance determination and
passion I think I love everything I do I

[02:00]
passion I think I love everything I do I
could wash toilets I could do manual
labor anything I just love it
I love every moment of every day the
sadness the fear all of that that's a
beautiful part of the journey I love it
so to me burnout doesn't even make sense
like what what are you burning out from

[02:15]
like what what are you burning out from
even the concept of burnout is something
that I love so like if you feel like
you're burning out that that's beautiful
too that's part of the human experience
I love that whole thing and when you're
passionate about everything what

[02:30]
passionate about everything what
hell doesn't anything the burnout kind
of says like I'm I think because I've
known close close people to me that have
suffer from depression
I think depression is the sort of
actually like clinical depression is

[02:46]
actually like clinical depression is
kind of the experience that I I see as
beyond the kind of thing that I'm
talking about which is it's really
you're in a place where nothing is
meaning but to me I have never

[03:01]
meaning but to me I have never
experienced
a moment where something is not rich of
meaning and I think David Frost for
David Foster Wallace said you know the

[03:16]
David Foster Wallace said you know the
key to life is to be unborn
meaning it's impossible to make you
bored of anything you do and I'm unborn

[03:30]
bored of anything you do and I'm unborn
is it
I got a Russian sort of sad suffering
face most of the time but I'm actually
happy on the inside I'm like a like a
Kiwi ugly on the outside sweet and

[03:49]
Kiwi ugly on the outside sweet and
glorious on the inside again that that's
one question I'm not even answering
correctly okay

[04:03]
you
