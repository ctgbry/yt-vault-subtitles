martial artists in their own way and I
look forward to training with each of

Miyamoto Musashi a Japanese swordsman
and Warrior philosopher from the 17th

[02:00]
and Warrior philosopher from the 17th
century
think lightly of yourself and deeply of
the world
that said this is a martial art and so
he also did say that the way of the
warrior is the Resolute acceptance of
death

death
