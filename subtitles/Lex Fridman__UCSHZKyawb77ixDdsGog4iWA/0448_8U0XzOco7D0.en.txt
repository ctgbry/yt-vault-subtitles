this is a review of Brazilian jiu-jitsu
memes with Ryan Hall that we did after
our podcast conversation memes are at
once the lowest and the highest form of
achievement by the collective
intelligence of human civilization I
enjoy forcing brilliant people to be
silly hence this meme review it's
brought to you by Babel betterhelp and
raycon please check out the sponsors in
the description to get a discount and to
support this channel and now here's your
Jitsu meme review with Ryan
Hall another ridiculous thing I have to
ask I printed out because I'm old school
some memes for you from uh from Reddit
it'd be nice if you uh what what do I go
through them and uh maybe what's your
favorite number 12 okay so on a scale of
1 to 12 let's let's give a ranking to
these uh to these ridiculous memes I
support I support all of these guys any
any with like the the the Mustachio you

[01:02]
any with like the the the Mustachio you
know like fisticuffs guy is always funny
so any meeme that
involves that guy's always whatever is
about to come next is usually pretty
entertaining yeah it's tough to give a
rating without understanding the
universe of other memes that exist here
but all right I'll try to do my
best yeah yeah you got to you got to
make decisions all right you're right
you're right so sobbing after Adult
class sobbing after Adult class I think
is that man holding on to a piece biting
a piece of soap yeah that's actually uh
I don't know if you've seen it's uh
what's that show it's it's um Tobias
from um oh oh you talking about Arrested
Development I think it's Arrested
Development Tobias that that's what that
looks like I don't know maybe it's not
um all right I'll give it I'll give it a
four wow that's not good no maybe four
is really high who knows it could be
you're a tough grader you move so well
practice it must be an innate gift a
gift from God it's practice I'll never
understand how some people are so
talented a mystery practice that one

[02:00]
talented a mystery practice that one
hits uh relatively close to home that's
one of those like deep philosophical
ones as opposed to funny yeah it's not
funny it's just accurate yeah it's
accurate yeah exactly would you give
good scores for accuracy or I I'm here
for I'm here for the jokes okay all
right so I'll give it a four
also do you get this by the way the this
kind of experience what's that of people
like well Ryan Hall is just talented
well I think I mean like may I just
don't think that I'm very talented you
know so I mean I just do nothing but
martial arts all day every day and have
done nothing but that at I mean do you
believe anybody can get good no yeah oh
yeah it depends I I think if if there's
the only talent that I think I have is
discipline and um and crit that's
interesting that could be genetic or
whatever I think that's a real thing
like um but uh like you you can't
convince me to quit but some a friend of
mine someone said like uh um if I can
talk you out of your dream you don't
want your dream and I think that's
that's true where people go oh my
someone so discouraged me I'm like I

[03:00]
someone so discouraged me I'm like I
hear what you're saying but if you
really really want to do any X Y or Z
you will decide to do it and I I firly
believe that and again whether that's
true or not it falls under the category
of facilitative belief and uh that will
probably make you a little bit more you
know more of a a go-getter in certain
regards so I guess uh yeah but I don't
think I don't think I'm particularly
talented I just care a lot okay I yes
he's employing a Sumo gisha Landing into
a kiss of salami hold anybody be Judo
Guy opening his book of terminology
I think they could actually expand that
to mod jiujitsu guy who now to use
Japanese for S of what's the arm lock I
even I'm a judo person iami Juju katami
do you use like Japanese terms for
techniques not when I'm speaking to
English
speakers what what do you think about
like Eddie Bravo just renaming every
technique I mean that's weird to me too
that's the full range of like yeah
exactly we're on there's the two ends of
the spectrum and you got to find what's
right for you you know um you've got
what you call an arm lock an arm lock
okay yeah you know that you know that

[04:00]
okay yeah you know that you know that
you know the one yeah yeah come on man
no not that one the other one yeah yeah
yeah right but uh yeah it's uh again I
think that there's a lot of people got
to do what's right for you but there's
also I struggle with The Branding going
on that I see in Jiu-Jitsu that's not
something I'm super stoked about and not
you know but again if if it helps you
remember then right on one to 12 what
does this ridiculous meme get oh um
again disturbingly accurate I'll say six
well you so you giving props to the
accurate all right
this I mean these memes are horrible
like the red needs to do better yeah
this one needs to be better the best
defense against a body triangle is to
get really fat that is a strong defense
let's all agree with that um I'll give
that one a two I think I only picked me
was to get like several hundred up votes
so ah so these these at least redditors
thought they're they're of value figure
this would be the best way to get rid of
Corona virus put a blue belt on there I
like that one oh okay say that that went
over my head everybody quits after they

[05:00]
over my head everybody quits after they
get a Blue Bell yeah yeah I I'm an
idiot um I was like why is why is
teaching martial arts help yeah so you
get you didn't because you don't get it
what that's like an undefined score I'll
give it a 12 because it's
way you give that one you got a
12 let's say a 10 I'll give it I would
give that one a 10 I think yeah I like
that line after two hours of hard
sparring you look good 10 minutes of
cardio you look uh yeah you look like
that that's uh no it's
you I would have to I would have to I
would have to do cardio in order to in
order to understand that
so over my head um I ran once you I like
r r running breeds cowardice I don't
want to don't want to do it but uh yeah
don't want to get too involved but uh
yeah I so yeah so maybe maybe you can
review this later once you actually try
cardio exactly yeah all

[06:00]
cardio exactly yeah all
right when you get submitted 46 times
but none of the submissions are ibjjf
legal I got to say I gotta say that got
to give that going give that a two okay
all right I thought you'll go to the
negatives but that's good yeah about say
is that was that appropriate negative
two it's trying to be trying to be
charitable all right me who got promoted
during Co waiting to actually roll in my
new
belt people thought these were funny
yeah
I'll take I'll take that as a
one yes yeah take that a one all right
how 90% of BJJ instructionals this one
also hits close to home I got to give it
a give it a six for the accuracy okay
guys that's I can't I do the same thing
by the way you're I think you're the
next your instructionals are in the next
meme so just so you know are they really
oh man okay I don't want to look at it
yet I'm sure they're saying something
funny about me that's entirely accurate
so this one 90% let's give that a

[07:01]
so this one 90% let's give that a
six so this is U like an old school meal
where you insert anything overly
expensive during overly expensive during
during economic crisis food data rent
half guard
TV utility 150 someone who good at the
economy please help me budget this my
family is all right I'm GNA give that
I'm gonna give that an 11 out on scale
of 12 that's the common is like
spendless on half DVDs and responses no
yeah no I like it that that's solid
all right what the guy who murders you
on the mat looks like outside the that's
absolutely accurate if you guys have
ever met Paul Shriner you know exactly
what's going on it's uh where I dude I
still remember my first day my first day
there was uh at Jiu-Jitsu and this is
where Jiu-Jitsu became like the coolest
thing in the universe to me um was there
was a guy named Eric Ryerson nice guy he
was at uh uh Ronin Athletics in New York
it's 2004 and um he was a white belt
he's probably 130 lbs so wet and uh it a

[08:01]
he's probably 130 lbs so wet and uh it a
white belt and again I don't I don't
don't hold the he didn't hold the banner
for tough guy certainly not at that time
but you know like I'll try to fight you
and uh just getting absolutely mollywop
by this guy and then going holy crap
this is literally the coolest thing I've
ever experienced in my life this is like
magic and it's not even like oh this
guy's a black belt something or other
and he's been at it for extra time how
long you been training for I don't know
like eight months I'm like have all my
money like you're never going to get rid
of me and uh
moment when you realize uh yeah the
technique is matters it's fascinating
yeah well he Bas I'm sure he wrote If
this if the uh bird scooter had had
existed at the time Eric would have uh
would have transported himself to the
gym and to and from the gym on that so
I'm going to give that also in 11 the
stash yeah he didn't have the he didn't
have the the stash but I don't think
that was in at the time that wasn't
essential yeah when your teammate is
losing the match but you promis you
would record the whole thing eh that I
like the old school digital camera yeah
that is that is true I remember that
that actually that was the thing before

[09:00]
that actually that was the thing before
smartphones jiujitsu ever kick your ass
so bad you drive the speed living home
with no music playing yes absolutely you
know you ever I mean how often have you
have you felt that recently like I I
remember feeling that often like just
like taking I usually would take a bus
home and I would just like sit there
like no music no podcast it was just
like this sad feeling overcoming your
body like what life is meaningless I
remember when I first met m Sana like it
was yesterday it was uh it was like the
winner cuz he has family that lives in
uh lives in the DC area and we had our
school in Arlington and Millo had has
like a beard out to here and he's
wearing like a fetel Castro looking hat
and I'd never met him he we've been ADCC
and this is right after ADCC 2009 so
this is like December 2009 and um it's
like snowing and he's standing outside
the gym I'm like who the hell is that
and uh you know I walk up like Hey man
can I help you he like hey got a trade

[10:02]
can I help you he like hey got a trade
with you I'm like are you really Santana
yeah I'm like all right and uh he comes
upstairs and and super super polite
super nice guy and um anyway so I'd done
the 66 kilos and he did 77 he says hey
you want to roll I'm like yeah and
marilla's had like the world's deepest
voice since he was like a child and
probably believe he had a beard when he
came out of the out of the womb but
anyway uh we're training and I'm like
all right not that good but I you know
like I i' done ADCC that year I got
third beaten some good guys had a really
close match with leier that I got
screwed in thank you referees DCC that
was decent at the time at least and uh
but you're getting the feeling where I'm
like I can't fully understand what's
going on here but like I feel like I'm
being let off the hook I'm like I'm not
not escaping this I'm like hey man you
you can beat me up you know it's like oh
I'm trying I'm like no come on he's like
all right maybe I'll try a little harder
and he's not being like he's not he's
just being
nice I remember I had like a thousand
yard stare like at the wall for went at
home that night forever cuz it wasn't

[11:01]
home that night forever cuz it wasn't
like oh people can't beat me up there
are plenty of people that beat me up
particularly that time but it's
like I think he passed my guard like 35
times and that was something that wasn't
happening like for the most part and I'm
like it's you wrest oh he's a little
bigger yeah that wasn't the problem it
was it was a skill thing and just going
like what was that and it wasn't like oh
I get to play we're gonna we're going to
both train and uh he's going to win I'm
like we're not training I'm just getting
like chucked around like a four-year-old
I I don't know any Jiu-Jitsu I need to I
need to reevaluate my entire life Millo
is is is a fantastic instructor and
trainer in addition to being a great
competitor and runs Unity Jiu-Jitsu in
New York City I feel lucky to have
trained with many of the very very best
guys in the world um but man milla's as
good you know as good as anyone I've
ever met as good as anyone I've ever met
absolutely fantastic just a fantastic
knowledge of Jitsu when I watched I
remember just training periodically
overtime over time over time I would get

[12:00]
overtime over time over time I would get
better the Gap would stay the same and
it was uh it was pretty cool and it was
inspiring it really taught me a lot the
only way you get better right so yes I I
know exactly about I watch other people
do the same thing we would train and
like I don't want to use them people
that everybody would know yeah we would
sit in the back of my like beater Honda
Civic that I had at that time and watch
them stare out the window like
this yeah and just like yep been there
buddy
and like a tear slowly oh yeah exactly
exactly just the one and yeah okay so
this is another one of those memes
that's just entirely accurate yeah so
I'll give that an 11 all right all right
guy watching UFC I don't get all this
ground stuff I wish I knew an expert who
could explain it to me two stripe white
belt yeah that's also accurate little
less funny but but uh I don't know I
don't know enough about SpongeBob
SquarePants to be able to like
understand what that expression means
yeah but CU usually it would involve
like you know like Roger graci is
standing right there and I'm like easy
Roger I got this
step in front of true true yeah that

[13:02]
step in front of true true yeah that
there's a I'll give that I'll give that
a seven that's a seven that's a strong
that's a strong place to end I feel that
way Ryan thanks for putting up with the
ridiculous request no thank you so much
