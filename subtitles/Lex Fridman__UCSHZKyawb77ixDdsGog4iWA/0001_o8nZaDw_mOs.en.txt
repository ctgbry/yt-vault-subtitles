[00:00]
we choose to go to the moon in this
decade and do the other things not
because they are easy but because they
are
[Music]

[00:19]
[Music]
hard in any particular Sport with well-
defined rules Mastery is achieved
through specialization taking a few
skills and perfecting them so naturally

[00:30]
skills and perfecting them so naturally
most experts and teachers of movement
are Specialists of skill sets like
gymnastics hand balancing Olympic
lifting capua Jiu-Jitsu Wrestling Judo
and other martial arts so it's rare to
come across a generalist someone who

[00:46]
come across a generalist someone who
takes a holistic approach to movement my
guest today is Ido portal he is a guru
of movement a teacher with a large and
quickly growing following as he says
movement is big bigger than any specific

[01:01]
movement is big bigger than any specific
discipline we're all human first mover
second and only then
Specialists I actually just finished
reading a biography of um Albert
Einstein by Walter isacon and the two of

[01:15]
Einstein by Walter isacon and the two of
you have something in
common a desire to uh arrive at a
unified theory in his case it was a
unified theory of physics you know like
forces of nature in your case it's a
unified theory of
movement can you um tell me me the story

[01:30]
movement can you um tell me me the story
of your journey to becoming a
generalist first I'll just say that I'm
no guru you know it's something that uh
people use but I I have a really hard
time with the word master or Guru and uh
I I didn't arrive at the gospel truth or

[01:47]
I I didn't arrive at the gospel truth or
I'm not sitting on any mountains and I'm
I'm on my way so people who join me as
students are
basically following you know in the same
Journey Maybe in C certain circumstances

[02:02]
Journey Maybe in C certain circumstances
I'm I'm a bit further ahead or sometimes
I'm a bit behind but it's definitely
walk along and not walk behind kind of
thing yeah my journey I started as
a mover first and then I became a

[02:17]
a mover first and then I became a
specialist and then I went back to
movement basically so uh it all started
in the young age and some some Chinese
martial arts developed um um into some

[02:30]
martial arts developed um um into some
physical Sports and games in school
primary school and high school and then
I met capua and I I was completely
amazed basically by this this art form
and uh pursued that for a good 15 years

[02:47]
and uh pursued that for a good 15 years
H in the middle somewhere military
service and other physical um physical
Pursuit and throughout changing and and
developing and moving between
disciplines and exploring

[03:00]
disciplines and exploring
it just kind of got the same realization
again and again that there is a some
thread through all this discipline
something that is attracting me back and
basically it was movement I realized and

[03:15]
basically it was movement I realized and
uh the next thing was okay I I want to
learn movement I want to get better as a
mover in a general way I seeked out
movement teachers and went around the
world and and looked around and read a
lot of books and there were some people

[03:31]
lot of books and there were some people
who mentioned the word movement and I
went to them and you know offered myself
as a student and they kept on teaching
me disciplines and another isolated
approach another
speciality and I was very disappointed

[03:47]
speciality and I was very disappointed
So eventually I decided okay I'm going
to become that person I'm going to
become the movement teacher and um the
next realization after years and years
of trying was it's impossible

[04:00]
of trying was it's impossible
and with that I stayed basically because
I realized if that's impossible it's a
good goal to have in life something that
will keep on moving myself and my
students and anybody involved forward
that's where I'm at right now I'm

[04:16]
that's where I'm at right now I'm
teaching and uh learning moving around
and trying to trying to gain some more
knowledge about this impossible task yes
so you're still yourself or forever a
student I'll prefer I prefer to be a
student any day of the week than a

[04:31]
student any day of the week than a
teacher um but um being a teacher is
part of human culture we are all
teachers we we teach all the time but
whether you want it or not somebody asks
you for direction in the street you

[04:45]
you for direction in the street you
become the teacher H you have a child he
looks at you you're a teacher practicing
teaching and and practicing to the
student the discipleship both of them
are extremely important for your
development as a M what is the price of

[05:02]
development as a M what is the price of
specialization what do we lose when we
specialize we lose Humanity first and
foremost as humans we we evolved to
become humans as generalist we are the
most generalist of all animals we're

[05:16]
most generalist of all animals we're
able to imitate the ape and and imitate
the tiger and and we can hold our breath
on the water and we can do everything
just a tiny bit we can't really run very
fast we can't really fight very well we

[05:33]
fast we can't really fight very well we
can't you know climb as as good as other
animals but we can do the most complex
and generalized tasks out of all animals
and no animal even come close so

[05:45]
and no animal even come close so
speciality the price is Humanity the
price is your happiness the price is
your fulfillment as a human being it's
deep it's it's philosophical but that's
that's who we are do you think there is
some beauty and fulfillment
and some value in specialization in

[06:02]
and some value in specialization in
becoming the best at a very specific
movement at a particular sport giving
your body to you know dedicating it to
that sport that's an interesting thing
because as a human race we benefited

[06:16]
because as a human race we benefited
tremendously from the work of specialist
but those specialist
suffered that's a very very important
point it's like without specialist we
would never be here we would never be
Skyping right now on this computer and

[06:30]
Skyping right now on this computer and
and you know wearing these t-shirts and
all kinds of stuff but those Specialists
those human
beings suffered the result of their
highly specialized nature and we become

[06:45]
highly specialized nature and we become
more and more specialized there is a
move towards being generalist again in
the last few years maybe the last decade
there is a bit more talk about that but
definitely we are also still uing highly

[07:00]
definitely we are also still uing highly
specialized Fields if I make a joke in
in my workshop and I say if nowadays you
go to a if you you break your you know
you break your hand you go to a hand
specialist orthopedic surgeon in five or
10 years you'll go to a

[07:16]
10 years you'll go to a
leftand specialist and the most evident
problem is also our leaders who are ex
specialist but now they're required to
be generalist leaders of a lot of stuff
and they're shitty leaders yeah we we

[07:32]
and they're shitty leaders yeah we we
keep on having the same problems again
and again because they are ex specialist
whether it's a lawyer or a military
person or an economist these are not a

[07:45]
person or an economist these are not a
specialities that allow you the full
grasp of running a country yeah I think
I think you put it beautifully that uh
in my specialization my lead to
Innovation but you lose the humanity M
what do you find is

[08:00]
what do you find is
um the most underdeveloped range of
motion in athletes like what movement uh
is most restricted in uh high level
Athletes In your experience is there one
that stands out
shoulders uh any particular other joints

[08:16]
shoulders uh any particular other joints
well it's it all depends on their
specialty of course and habits the
shoulder the glenohumeral joint is the
most hypermobile joint in the body even
when it's restricted it still offers
tremendous range of motion compared to

[08:31]
tremendous range of motion compared to
other
areas but when it's restricted even if
it's just a little bit it can cause huge
problems because we are dependent on
that range of motion and
Mobility around the glal joint and the

[08:47]
Mobility around the glal joint and the
simple reason is because with the hands
humans manipulate yes that's what we're
meant to do with our hands and we need
that complexity around the scapula it's
been a few years since I've said it

[09:00]
been a few years since I've said it
first that the scapula craves
complexity but this this complexity
around the scapula and range of motion
is so important across the board I've
read of your concept of isolate
integrate and U improvise can you

[09:16]
integrate and U improvise can you
describe the role of improvisation in
movement any profession any speciality
should arrive at improvisation in the
top uh tier the top level whether you
play the violin or or you know you box

[09:32]
play the violin or or you know you box
you you're going to reach improvisation
improvisation Above All Is The Human
Condition it's the human the human
ability the highest form of living is
improvisation you improvise basically

[09:46]
improvisation you improvise basically
life is improvisation you're born you
die and in between you improvise a
shitload of
improvisation movement is no different
the thing is people started to isolate
concept and some people went the next

[10:00]
concept and some people went the next
level and integrated them they present
themselves as improvisation but actually
they're cheating people it's just a bit
more integration yet it's just another
integration improvisation open

[10:16]
integration improvisation open
improvisation real improvisation as we
call it that's very rare and that's the
most enjoyable State it's also called
The Zone it's also called the tunnel you
just experience
this beautiful thing to be empty just to

[10:32]
this beautiful thing to be empty just to
let things happen through you as Bruce
Lee said I don't hit it
hits it just happens you know and that
is improv that's what you need to do
with movement if you Aspire for the

[10:46]
with movement if you Aspire for the
highest things I like how a guy on
Reddit described you as Ido portal may
not be the nicest guy in the world but
he's a great coach so that nicest guy
part I come from the wrestling world

[11:00]
part I come from the wrestling world
where the goal of a good coach and a
good program is to basically make you
quit to break you there's zero patience
for people who don't want to put in the
work to work hard do you find that tough
love is the best approach to coaching

[11:15]
love is the best approach to coaching
people whatever their level of ability
no not necessarily I I don't like the
term tough love because it kind of
assumes that its importance is itself
it's not an enough for me it's like

[11:30]
it's not an enough for me it's like
that's how that's the best way why
that's the best way but on the other
hand I don't think people are made of
sugar and I really believe that we've
lost a bit sight of you know how

[11:45]
lost a bit sight of you know how
resilient we are and another is H people
don't like the truth you know it's just
dishonesty is above all so when people
describe me as tough l it's not because
I believe in tough 100% of the people

[12:03]
I believe in tough 100% of the people
who has been who have had issues with me
on a personal level or through coaching
are people who couldn't
accept criticism what I offered you know

[12:15]
accept criticism what I offered you know
took it personally weren't able to deal
with it Etc I can't even you know in my
head find one example of a person I've
been working with who received the
criticism work with it and still

[12:30]
criticism work with it and still
complained but it's always these
complainers and who fucking cares
complain first and do nothing yes yeah
yeah you know it's like when you go
mainstream as we've went to a certain
level you have to deal with it because
I'm not operating my Elite unit my

[12:47]
I'm not operating my Elite unit my
special op unit anymore now it's an army
and I need to accept the fact that I'm
going to meet a lot of slackers a lot of
fucking point deers and all kinds of you
know the they don't want to work they

[13:00]
know the they don't want to work they
want to talk about it they want to do
this they want to do that they don't
want to hear the truth they don't want
to accept criticism or hear how much
they suck and I just don't do that so
you know I I'll have to accept the fact
that from now from now and again you

[13:15]
that from now from now and again you
know I'll have this issue and I'm sure
it will continue you've traveled all all
over the world you think there's a
difference in this aspect in attitudes
in the United States and Israel and
other
countries big time of course big time

[13:30]
countries big time of course big time
yeah there are many countries where I
don't have this issue or very rarely we
have a word in in Hebrew it actually it
comes from German I think or yish it it
says tless it's like down to it you know
the heart of it tless people are people

[13:46]
the heart of it tless people are people
who are like no bullshit you know
directly tell me as it is and this tless
it it exists in certain cultures in
other cultures it's a lot of chitchat
and walk around and you know I didn't
know how to cheat chat a few days ago

[14:02]
know how to cheat chat a few days ago
one of my student told me you know I
can't cheat chat it's exactly how I felt
you know when I first came out of Israel
started to teach around it was Russia
thank God and that was so similar to um
where I come from in many ways so no

[14:17]
where I come from in many ways so no
problem but then when I went to the US
or Canada I had a lot of issues with the
chi chat with politically correct and
walking around the bush and don't give
it to me too hard harly You Know cover

[14:30]
it to me too hard harly You Know cover
it with a lot of sponges around it
soften the Heat and uh yeah it's
definitely different between various
countries and I need nowadays I need
filters which are my my my student my
top students who are helping me teach

[14:47]
top students who are helping me teach
and some of them are great filters in
and in certain countries they'll they'll
do much better than me what does perfect
practice look like for you so do you
believe in the value maybe this applies
more to specialized sports but uh like I

[15:01]
more to specialized sports but uh like I
I Come From Russia actually and from the
wrestling world where repetition you
know putting in 10 50,000 100,000
repetitions on a specific movement is is
how you achieve success do you believe
in the value of that repetition even for

[15:17]
in the value of that repetition even for
a generalist framework repetition is the
mother of skill yes there have been
those that corrected and said perfect
repetition is the mother of
skill well
those who usually say it are those who

[15:32]
those who usually say it are those who
don't achieve
Heights usually usually so I'll be very
Frank again I'll be very extremely
honest a lot of people talk about
perfect perfect perfect but but life is

[15:45]
perfect perfect perfect but but life is
not perfect itself our surroundings are
not perfect and when I practice and when
I move it's never under perfect
conditions it's never with the right
optimal blood sugar level and under the

[16:00]
optimal blood sugar level and under the
the specific you
know height of I don't know what and and
riding the wave of super compensation in
the perfect way and usually when people
try to adhere to that Concept in a
perfect
way they end up falling off the wagon on

[16:19]
way they end up falling off the wagon on
the other side don't be don't be stupid
don't just drill yourself into the wall
and lose sight of everything it's not
black and white the truth is somewhere

[16:30]
black and white the truth is somewhere
in between and it varies between people
for me after 17 years teaching 18 years
now teaching moving seeing people the
hardest
workers are usually the elite performers

[16:47]
workers are usually the elite performers
of course some of them are carrying a
certain Talent or this or that but it's
always with very dedicated practice yes
they have built up that work Capac
capity through that dedicated practice

[17:01]
capity through that dedicated practice
and they can then move that ability to
other disciplines true in the grappling
world I'm not sure how much you're aware
of it but Marcel Garcia is one of the
greats and he believes boldly against
the status quo I think that you should

[17:15]
the status quo I think that you should
only train Jiu-Jitsu so his sport
Jiu-Jitsu and not do anything else so to
achieve success train only that but the
majority of other athletes in the sport
believe that you should do strength and
conditioning programs you know around
that so they at least move slightly

[17:31]
that so they at least move slightly
towards the more generalist framework
what do you think do you think there's
value for the generalist mindset for
like an elite athlete or should they
just focus on their sport to some level
to some level speciality can can reach a

[17:46]
to some level speciality can can reach a
plateau because of lack of General base
of the pyramid in some cases but it's
not a very high level of you know gen
generalism nowadays you're you're
practicing against specialist and they

[18:01]
practicing against specialist and they
devote more and more time to this
speciality when you're doing other stuff
so it's a complex riddle you know and
and to each case his own but I'll tell
you something else when you reach the
top of your field like Marcelo Garcia

[18:15]
top of your field like Marcelo Garcia
did in
BJJ you stop being inspired by your own
scene you can't gain inspiration
knowledge and motivation from your own
scene because you are the leader you're

[18:30]
scene because you are the leader you're
on top of the mountain you have nowhere
else to climb so what do you do you look
to other
scenes and that's where it's really
really valuable to become a bit more
generalized yes you mentioned an

[18:45]
generalized yes you mentioned an
interview related to that a very
interesting point that many people in
the US in particular focus on learning
more than doing so Focus too much on
acquiring knowledge versus using that
knowledge do you struggle with this
yourself like how do you approach

[19:02]
yourself like how do you approach
learning new things versus putting more
time into uh old things that you've
already mastered it's good question it's
it's not only a us thing or a North
American thing it's generally all across
the globe although there are more

[19:16]
the globe although there are more
practical people and less practical
people you know and each country has his
own orientation habits you know
characteristics but it's it's a good
question you need to be it's kind of
being super intelligent and oriented

[19:31]
being super intelligent and oriented
towards the information but then have
this dumbed down practical mind it's
like okay now I need to work you know
and having a balance across that and
that's
probably that probably means that you

[19:47]
probably that probably means that you
know a
certain IQ for example will start to
work against you in certain fields and
vice versa
so when you come too much you know as

[20:00]
so when you come too much you know as
the Chinese say the man who lives inside
his head you you you start to have this
issue you know you you have a thirst for
information great thirst but information
is toxic it's exactly like water water
is toxic as well almost all compounds

[20:16]
is toxic as well almost all compounds
are toxic and then we drink we drink we
drink we kill ourselves we kill the
process and the the knowledge it turns
against us and um that's a serious
problem and that's the problem of the

[20:31]
problem and that's the problem of the
age of misinformation that we live in
it's not only that the knowledge is
toxic even when it's good knowledge now
we also have bad knowledge mostly bad
knowledge mostly shitty advice the

[20:45]
knowledge mostly shitty advice the
combination is little and just people
become paralyzed or just you know move
from link to link to link with a you
know glazy eyes and just never actually
do anything yes I know you Advocate

[21:00]
do anything yes I know you Advocate
building a huge work capacity so how
many hours a day do you
think this is also a debate for
Specialists how many hours a day do you
think is the most a person can train
movement intelligently before it becomes

[21:16]
movement intelligently before it becomes
not sustainable before their mind
becomes uninspired maybe as you said 24
hours 24 hours 24 hours a day there is a
choreographer in Israel very known
choreog graer called doad Narin he says

[21:30]
choreog graer called doad Narin he says
when you wake up in the morning in bed
Between the Sheets you can you can
practice movement and and he's not
talking about with your partner yeah so
even there you can practice you know
breathing moving it's it's all the time

[21:46]
breathing moving it's it's all the time
around you but serious practice you know
practice oriented that you know
repetition and success and building
skill and moving from isolation to
integration to improvisation
in most

[22:01]
in most
disciplines it's around 6 to 8 hours a
day some people go more and reach even
the 10hour mark and I've done that for
periods of time in the military you go
even further than that other disciplines

[22:15]
even further than that other disciplines
require less and and it's also a highly
individual thing H so let's say even
within the sports of gymnastics you have
um a woman like an nasty who trains 8
hours a day and next to her and the same

[22:30]
hours a day and next to her and the same
team also winning gold medals in the
same level more or less you have Sean
Johnson training three hours a day and
she reached the top of her
field gold medal in the Olympics so how

[22:46]
field gold medal in the Olympics so how
highly
individual this is very rare to see this
three hour gold medal thing but
definitely it exists the difference
there be mental so the question I have

[23:00]
there be mental so the question I have
is out of the various elements like mind
breathing you developing muscular
strength or joints which is the biggest
challenge to master as a student of
movement highly individual it depends on

[23:15]
movement highly individual it depends on
the person depends on his orientation
some people never require any form of
mental training for example or
psychological training especially in
fields um like sports and and team
sports

[23:30]
sports
is so so that aspect is covered they're
winners they're oriented they're focused
you know and um other people require
help in that regard some people have
great difficulty developing mobility and

[23:45]
great difficulty developing mobility and
just the nervous system is panicked it
holds on it protects them too much other
people are hypermobile and have a
difficulty creating tonis and and
strength and that is a great challenge
for them other people are you know great

[24:03]
for them other people are you know great
complex Learners they can they can
coordinate complex actions and learn
movement very quickly While others are
highly limited so it's very individual

[24:15]
highly limited so it's very individual
so that process of learning that journey
is individual to everyone so how does
one take that Journey just listen to
your own body no no you can listen to
your body until tomorrow
but yeah you're not hearing anything you

[24:31]
but yeah you're not hearing anything you
know you're not hearing anything you
need to learn you need to create a
relationship with your body and you need
the help of of
teachers that's there is only you know a
lot of people saying know I'll do it
myself then you deny Collective

[24:47]
myself then you deny Collective
knowledge the most powerful knowledge
that mankind holds you know because we
are the only animal that have Collective
knowledge we've been able to move
knowledge across generations and that
that's how we have reached space build

[25:02]
that's how we have reached space build
the internet you know do all these crazy
surgeries and and you know solve you
know genetic issues and Etc you're not
going to do it by yourself you you are
just one small person and we have

[25:18]
just one small person and we have
collected knowledge Generations upon
Generations so listen to your body
that's nice to say most people don't
hear shit it's completely silent and um
you need to start to decipher the

[25:32]
you need to start to decipher the
signals that the body gives you and that
goes through a practice and learning
discipleship and exploring a lot of
different different stuff and it's a
highly individual thing nowadays we we

[25:45]
highly individual thing nowadays we we
don't have so much any anymore this
Mentor student or or teacher disciple
relationship but I I really believe in
that I wouldn't be here without my
mentor and my teachers the shoulders of

[26:00]
mentor and my teachers the shoulders of
giants that lifted me up I still believe
in it in in a way there is no other way
yeah on that do you think that training
and learning movement for the majority
of the time is a fundamentally solitary

[26:16]
of the time is a fundamentally solitary
activity or do we gain from like the
presence of others so when you when you
think of movement when you're training
uh is most of your training like the
repetitions done alone or with others

[26:32]
repetitions done alone or with others
both I I've trained years you know alone
and with my students and I spend large
periods of time alone just training
alone but I also spend a lot of time

[26:45]
alone but I also spend a lot of time
being in a community and movement is the
best reason for gathering around in a
community and you know people for
example nowadays they go do CrossFit or
they do yoga or whatever and then they
have they're yoga friends and they have
the real friends that that's bullshit

[27:02]
the real friends that that's bullshit
you know your yoga friends can be your
real friends because we've been
gathering around movement since the age
of time creating communities around
movement around hunting Gathering
dancing around the fire we've been

[27:15]
dancing around the fire we've been
moving together nowadays I can recommend
move with your loved ones moved with the
people around you you know you join a
BJJ Club it's a community you know you
go there you meet you you move around
you go to a Capa Club it's a tribe you

[27:32]
you go to a Capa Club it's a tribe you
go to a CrossFit gym it's a community
you go to yoga it's a community you can
move with your children you can move
with your dog in the park and it's
important to move together but it can
also be done alone and some things are

[27:47]
also be done alone and some things are
better done alone and some things are
together how do you think movement
changes from solo movement you know that
that whole p pattern of movement where
you're moving alone versus the pattern

[28:00]
you're moving alone versus the pattern
of movement where there's two people
either working together or against each
other so together is like dancing
partner dancing and against each other
is like wrestling or Jiu-Jitsu do you
think the principles of movement are
different for when it's two people

[28:17]
different for when it's two people
versus one person is this a whole
another world first they spend more time
moving W with others against others in
martial art because I spent most of my
life in martial art arts and less time
exploring stuff alone but definitely

[28:32]
exploring stuff alone but definitely
there are some Concepts that still exist
like the quality of
movement how you organize your body in
space yes not in relation to the partner
only but first a BJJ practitioner or or

[28:47]
only but first a BJJ practitioner or or
a standup fighter he needs to organize
his body in relation to space first and
then in relation to the partner as well
so some of the concepts exist in both
While others are very different and and

[29:01]
While others are very different and and
you can train alone all all your life
when somebody else is in the equation
it's going to change the game
completely a major reason why we
are under the fight laboratory we've
departed in reality from a lot of

[29:16]
departed in reality from a lot of
traditional martial arts and the
delusions of training alone and doing
forms and and repetitive you know
movements alone and then he it's a shit
storm and you you can't apply anything

[29:31]
storm and you you can't apply anything
and you you you don't have any live
practice and now we see that um
definitely in the fight game H the
practices that stayed very real stayed
very dirty in a way but very real they
are the ones who are providing tools for

[29:48]
are the ones who are providing tools for
the chaotic environment of a
fight terms of injury how do you treat
recover and work around injury
H injuries are a certainty they're not a

[30:04]
H injuries are a certainty they're not a
they're not a
probability injuries and
diseases they are also
required as Nasim Talib one of my
biggest Inspirations these days a great

[30:17]
biggest Inspirations these days a great
philosopher in order to to anti
fragilized
enjoy volatility you must be able to

[30:31]
enjoy volatility you must be able to
grow from this stuff and so first I I
said I said it before and I'll say it
again I injure my
students this happens and I can do
anything beneficial without it and

[30:46]
anything beneficial without it and
basically we all get injured constantly
on a micro level macro level it's part
of our Lives of course we don't want to
push into meaningless injury and we want
to be able to grow from it and and and

[31:03]
to be able to grow from it and and and
basically develop from it how do you
train around it how do you train around
it it's a hard question it it involves a
lot of stuff first I'm a big believer in
movement as a therapeutic tool movement

[31:17]
movement as a therapeutic tool movement
itself if it offers you adaptation and
it does it's the way out not lack of
movement rest I don't believe in rest I
believe in moving
which means when I'm resting I might

[31:32]
which means when I'm resting I might
help on the short term with certain
aspects of the injury but at the same
time I'm creating a new problem because
the ad the adapt the Adaptive process is
taking me somewhere else I'm not
recovering towards movement I'm

[31:45]
recovering towards movement I'm
recovering towards no movement yes so we
have a a problem here now in some cases
you must rest and then deal with the
consequences later but in most cases
there is a better approach than just

[32:00]
there is a better approach than just
resting and that's that requires a lot
more taking responsibility which doctors
don't believe in your ability to take
responsibility for yourself to be
intelligent and to know the amounts and

[32:15]
intelligent and to know the amounts and
the levels and that
requires some some form of knowledge and
experience and most people can't be
trusted with it so we offer them you
know this advice of like just rest rest
it stop yeah but but definitely after

[32:31]
it stop yeah but but definitely after
years and years of working with people
and and taking them through crazy
injuries you my right hand odelia she
she went through a car accident she lost
a kidney she broke her back she went
through three knee surgeries which my
sister performed by the way nowadays she

[32:47]
sister performed by the way nowadays she
she can move like few people I know on
this planet and and just the re the the
answer was always movement movement
going back into movement beautiful
continue move continue to move yeah

[33:02]
continue move continue to move yeah
don't move stupidly don't don't hurt
yourself but that's an obvious no I
guess not because when I say these
things people write a fucking comment
the butt the butt people you know yeah
but you're going to injure yourself yeah

[33:16]
but you're going to injure yourself yeah
genius don't don't go into the injury
and and again deteriorate the the
escalate the situation of course not you
must move around it and you must be
smart in the way that you allow

[33:31]
smart in the way that you allow
adaptation to take you out like a wave
you need to ride a wave of adaptation
out of the out of the problem and that's
tricky we know and that's something that
we need to educate people on and we need
to believe in people's intelligence and

[33:46]
to believe in people's intelligence and
ability to take this responsibility in
China they they still have in some areas
and they used to have bone Setters they
didn't put you in a cast you broke your
hand or they they did it through bone

[34:00]
hand or they they did it through bone
setting and yeah they didn't have x-ray
so that's a lot more complex to do and
not as successful as nowadays but having
said that they did achieve amazing rates

[34:15]
said that they did achieve amazing rates
of recovery because these reps that they
use and the process allows some form of
movement and that creates an adaptation
now take an arm a healthy arm your right
arm put it in a cast for six months take

[34:33]
arm put it in a cast for six months take
down the cast what do you see y the arm
is basically moving towards death yes
it's Gotten Good at not moving the arm
is gray you have weird hairs growing out

[34:46]
is gray you have weird hairs growing out
of it it stinks it really smells and
looks like death because movement is
life no movement death we know that we
like to just kill your arm a tiny bit so

[35:00]
like to just kill your arm a tiny bit so
the the the so the bones can reform
together and then will bring it back to
life that's one approach but in other
cases you can maintain the life and the
demands on the tissue safely enough at

[35:16]
demands on the tissue safely enough at
the same time allow the recovery to
happen yes and diet what are some Diet
principles you follow well diet is very
individual thing
I've been personally following a

[35:31]
I've been personally following a
Paleolithic a caveman diet for a long
time a long before it was called the
paleo diet and and since 1997 or even
96 I've been doing this for a long
time I feel great on it still you know

[35:48]
time I feel great on it still you know
growing older and older and functioning
only better and being able to sustain
maintain improve but is very very
individual there is a lot of exploration

[36:00]
individual there is a lot of exploration
to be done there what you can withstand
how resilient is your system yes
nowadays there is a new movement towards
not improving the fuel sources not
improving the quality and the quantities

[36:16]
improving the quality and the quantities
of the food but actually making the
system more resilient MH so it's able to
basically withstand any almost any
quality and source and that's where we

[36:30]
quality and source and that's where we
have been lacking and we've been
neglecting this area and that's
something that um I believe is the
latest
Innovation although it's still highly
misunderstood and a lot of a lot of
folks are abusing this concept and

[36:46]
folks are abusing this concept and
giving really poor advice just to be
different just to say I'm not the Paleo
guy you know so that's that's a a small
addition that will get bigger and bigger
I think so it's almost like uh how you

[37:01]
I think so it's almost like uh how you
recommend in movement to go outside of
quote unquote proper alignment this is
kind of the diet version of that is uh
going outside of some kind of proper
framework of diet to some level but

[37:15]
framework of diet to some level but
that's that was an obvious thing you
know always right the problem is it's
not enough
because it's more what I'm suggesting
with movement to to go outside of the
proper alignment it creates an

[37:30]
proper alignment it creates an
adaptation but what if that adaptation
cannot happen for example a Celiac
disease person you'll expose him to
gluten and he'll have terrible
consequences now maybe if you can

[37:45]
consequences now maybe if you can
minimize enough the amounts and the
dosages you can actually train him out
of celiac to some level but that
adaptation is not going to last very
very far down the road he's going to get
some gains and then he's going to
Plateau but what if you could take that

[38:01]
Plateau but what if you could take that
celic disease person put him in the
garage fix his mechanisms change his
tires change his engine you know oil him
up everything and then put him back on

[38:15]
up everything and then put him back on
the track as a new animal and that that
is where you a lot of stuff is happening
nowadays so the genetic part of it and
the gut biome um our digestive tract

[38:30]
the gut biome um our digestive tract
that is so so complex and and we
discover that you know we live in
symbiosis with all these microorganisms
that just are all over our skin inside
of us and we live in combination with

[38:45]
of us and we live in combination with
them and that's how you see some dudes
in Brazil and in Russia walking around
with you know 5% body fat eating one
cracker for breakfast one cracker for
dinner and you know training BJJ all day

[39:01]
dinner and you know training BJJ all day
long high performance fueling with
cocacola and then at the same time you
see people doing everything almost
perfectly and still having poor poor
performance and inability and they gain

[39:15]
performance and inability and they gain
weight with any you know extra calorie
or macronutrient that they brought in
because their system is different and
it's not only about
genetics it's more about epigenetics and
it's more

[39:30]
it's more
about what kind of system besides your
own DNA what about these organisms that
are supposed to help you and and live in
symbiosis with you what kind of a system
do you have there and that's just two

[39:45]
do you have there and that's just two
areas and I think it's going to get it's
going to expand more and more and more
and we're going to realize that there is
a lot to learn there do you think
technology and science is ultimately a
positive force
for um you know you look at um movement

[40:02]
for um you know you look at um movement
as as an element of our Humanity do you
think technology is taking Humanity away
or it's adding to it I'm not smart
enough to answer you that man yeah it's

[40:15]
enough to answer you that man yeah it's
it's a big question you know it's a I
have no idea it's it's just it's a huge
question and I think we're going to
struggle with that question for many
generations to come still
it's definitely created a lot of
positive stuff but also brought

[40:32]
positive stuff but also brought
tremendous suffering and problems and
perhaps will be the you know the end of
us so technology might have been you
know the most terrible thing that ever
happened to us who

[40:46]
happened to us who
knows yes on that beautiful note how can
people join the Ido portal movement say
do you have a website at EOP portal.com
yeah EO portal
um Facebook page we on Facebook you can

[41:02]
um Facebook page we on Facebook you can
find us on Facebook the Ido portal
methodo portal Ido p
t you you can join the movement culture
on our website and and that will lead to

[41:16]
on our website and and that will lead to
some updates coming up soon you have a
beautiful website by the way amazing
thank you very much thank you very much
I've been very fortunate to have aou
great team around me that helped me with
that so I I saw that you posted a couple

[41:32]
that so I I saw that you posted a couple
of Tom weight songs and and even a
Bukowski reference on your Facebook page
and I immediately understood something
that I think only another fan or maybe I
should say student of weights and Bowski

[41:45]
should say student of weights and Bowski
can understand you don't shy away from
the strange in the profound wherever you
can find it maybe that's how one way to
put it is there a Tom weight song that
you find yourself returning too often in
your

[42:00]
your
life so many man so many it's just Tom
way you know I I can barely listen to
anything else frankly it's been a real
issue and Tom Tom weights is his
discography is like it's a lifetime of a

[42:16]
discography is like it's a lifetime of a
of discoveries I it's been accompanying
me for years now it's not it's not you
know something you go through very
quickly and I've spent a lot of time on
Al for example
and yeah just so much stuff so much

[42:32]
and yeah just so much stuff so much
stuff you always discover also you know
I I find that this this weirdness this
this
Ecentric part of of things it's so
important it's the only thing really

[42:46]
important it's the only thing really
that can be you in many ways because as
a culture we're so blend we're becoming
this one thing you know like you walk
around in London it looks exactly like
Hong Kong it looks exactly like Tokyo it
looks exactly like you know Sydney and

[43:03]
looks exactly like you know Sydney and
we have this like huge human thing going
on which is great and we communicate
very easily but then we lost a lot on
our our own stuff there is only one Tom

[43:15]
our our own stuff there is only one Tom
weights you know because of his Ecentric
part because of his you know this this
weird genius and that's why it's so
beautiful to me and um I try not to not
to shy away from my own essent ific side
and when I was younger I I definitely

[43:30]
and when I was younger I I definitely
hit that part more and you know you know
guarded and tried tried to be to fit in
but that's definitely an important thing
I think so you recommend we cultivate
the weird yeah yeah cultivating the
weird is cultivating yourself because

[43:45]
weird is cultivating yourself because
that that's truly you you know
everybody's weird everybody there is no
Homer Simpson you know and everybody has
this part everything has everybody has
this interesting stuff that's what also
interests me when I teach I want to see

[44:02]
interests me when I teach I want to see
that weird you know I want to see that
weird in your movement I want to see
that weird than you and that then I
really met you but most people they hide
it yes and they don't allow and they put
this perfect picture but it's I'm not

[44:17]
this perfect picture but it's I'm not
stupid I know it's not perfect you know
so just allow the weirdness to come out
I think it's it's a great lesson yeah
from from weights and and bukovski as
well well so if you don't mind I'm going
to torture you with something I would

[44:31]
to torture you with something I would
like to close by reading a bukovski poem
roll the dice I'm going to force you to
listen to it go
ahead if you're going to try go all the
way otherwise don't even start this

[44:45]
way otherwise don't even start this
could mean losing girlfriends wives
relatives jobs maybe your mind it could
mean not eating for three or 4 days it
could mean freezing on a park bench it
could mean jail it could mean derision
it could mean mockery isolation

[45:00]
it could mean mockery isolation
isolation is the gift all the others are
a test of your endurance of how much you
really want to do it and you'll do it
despite rejection and the worst odds and
it will be better than anything else you
can imagine if you're going to try go

[45:15]
can imagine if you're going to try go
all the way there's no other feeling
like that you will be alone with the
gods and the Knights will flame with
fire you will ride life straight to
perfect laughter is the only good fight
there is amen thanks EO thanks for

[45:30]
there is amen thanks EO thanks for
talking today man thank you so much man
appreciate it
