[00:01]
- What about free will?
- Free will is also a nice exercise.
Free will is an illusion that we,
A.I. people are gonna solve.
- (Interviewer) So, what do you think,

[00:15]
once we solve it, that
solution will look like?
Once we've put it in the page?
- (Guest) It's going to look like...
First of all, it will look like a machine.
A machine that acts as though
it has free will.
It communicates with
other machines as though
they have free will,

[00:31]
and you wouldn't be able
to tell the difference
between a machine that does
and a machine that doesn't
have free will.
- (Interviewer) So, the
illusion, it propagates
the illusion of free will amongst
the other machines?
- (Guest) And faking it is having it.

[00:47]
Okay?
That's what true
intelligence is all about.
Faking intelligence is intelligence,
because it's not easy to fake.
It's very hard to fake, and you can only
fake if you have it.

[01:00]
- (laughs)
That's such a beautiful statement.
(laughs)
You can't fake it, if you don't have it.
(laughs)
