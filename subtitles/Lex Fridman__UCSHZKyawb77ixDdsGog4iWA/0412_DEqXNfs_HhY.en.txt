here on the left is a spinning ASCII
donut
and on the right is a donut shaped C
code by Andy Sloan that generates it
now with syntax highlighting
now I recommend you check out Andy's

now I recommend you check out Andy's
blog post on the mathematics behind a
flying spinning Taurus AKA donut the
link to the post is in the description
the basic steps are create a circle then
create a Taurus by rotating the circle
about the y-axis then using rotation

about the y-axis then using rotation
matrices spin a donut around the x and z
axes
finally project the donut onto the 2D
screen adding illumination by
calculating the surface normal after
picking a particular light source the

picking a particular light source the
cool thing is because this is ASCII
world there's different characters
associated with different levels of
luminance we can go back to the
de-africated version of the code that I
generated
adding a microsecond sleeve function to

adding a microsecond sleeve function to
Aid in the animation compiling and
running the code
we get our spinning donut
there's a lot of parameters that you can
control with this donut including the
field of view and the distance of the
donor from the viewer I spend at least

donor from the viewer I spend at least
an hour every day learning and exploring
outside my main line of work so I
thought it'd be cool to uh start
throwing together quick little videos
about things that I find beautiful
whether they're basic or advanced in the

whether they're basic or advanced in the
world of machine learning math computer
science programming psychology whatever
even biology physics history and
philosophy so
hope this is uh a value fun and
something you would enjoy
