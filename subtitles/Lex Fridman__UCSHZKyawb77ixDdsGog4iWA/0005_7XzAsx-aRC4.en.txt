[00:00]
in a class you you emphasize that we're
working with uh basic laws of physics so
uh I just read Einstein's biography he
was obsessed with finding a single
theory that would unify all the
fundamental forces of nature wow do you
think there exist a unified theory of

[00:15]
think there exist a unified theory of
grappling where you can boil everything
down to just a few
principles uh well well first off if if
Einstein wasn't able to come up with the
unified theory I I would sincerely
question my ability to go that way but
do I believe that something like that

[00:30]
do I believe that something like that
could potentially exist absolutely and I
think that even if it doesn't um a
belief in the possibility of it and the
search for it um would would leave you
better off than where you started
whereas if I was ah no no that's
bullshit that would never and then I
don't look even if I'm right because I

[00:46]
don't look even if I'm right because I
didn't look there's certain things I
won't learn so I think you know a lot of
times just let's say Alchemy the idea
that you're going to turn lead to gold
all right well that's a little bit nuts
but who knows maybe that's that kind of
nutty and you know

[01:00]
nutty and you know
highly unlikely of highly unlikely
probability of success Pursuit yielded
scientific progress elsewhere in the
search for that even though again
someone would look back and say oh
that's stupid who would who would do
that well if you spent years trying to
figure it out I guarantee you're going
to learn some other things as well proc

[01:16]
to learn some other things as well proc
so I think that they at the very least
the a principal based approach to
grappling is incredibly important so
what's your process like for learning
new details and understanding the
principles behind uh techniques I I
certainly don't believe that I have like
a a singular or perfect approach by any

[01:30]
a a singular or perfect approach by any
stretch of the imagination but um you
know I guess what I try to do is block
out extraneous nonsense like for
instance both PE a lot of people want to
talk about 55 details and reasons for
something that's going on and the
reality is is that you're clouding your
thought process for instance there was a

[01:45]
thought process for instance there was a
a reason not to get too political but
there was a recent uh issue where uh I
remember an inmate was executed and they
used a new drug and it was painful and
oh my God and he died it was horrible
again that's whether you believe that
capital punishment is valid or not I
think there plenty of arguments against

[02:01]
think there plenty of arguments against
it in fact I think most of the arguments
that make sense are against it but pain
has fuck all to do with it you know I
don't care that's like hey Lex I'm going
to kill you but don't worry it's not
going to hurt that I mean don't get me

[02:15]
going to hurt that I mean don't get me
wrong yeah it's like that doesn't make
it okay it's like believe me I prefer
again if you're going to kill me I
prefer this you don't burn me at the
steak but if someone was like don't
worry it it's not even going to sting
I'm still G to try to fight you to the
death I'm absolutely not allowing this
to happen if someone wants to say oh
okay hold on let's let's cut the

[02:30]
okay hold on let's let's cut the
bullshit like feely feelings out of here
and say look forget the pain does this
person deserve it ah well let's let's
step that back again is there a
potential for human error is there
potential for someone having this guy
behind bars for political gain like okay
these are the real reasons that you say

[02:45]
these are the real reasons that you say
hey no way on the death penalty it has
nothing to do with does it hurt or which
drug is it or blah blah or is it
inhumane it's like no if hey we're
focusing on the wrong thing so it
reminds me of Jiu-Jitsu in the same
sense and again we're fighting we're
generally speaking in my op opion

[03:00]
generally speaking in my op opion
debates that happen in the public you
know Arena always focus on the wrong
dang thing and always focus on the wrong
aspect again there's 25 good reasons or
bad reasons to do almost anything but
generally speaking people will focus on
the hundred other ones that are
extraneous and retarded so what I want I

[03:16]
extraneous and retarded so what I want I
guess what I would say is it reminds me
of Jiu-Jitsu was striking like oh man
Floyd likes to hold his hand this way or
that way or the other way and and this
guy likes to jab like this and it's
really important this person says you
land with this knuckle and that person
says you land with that knuckle and in
Jiu-Jitsu it's very very important that

[03:30]
Jiu-Jitsu it's very very important that
you Grip 3 in up on a lapel and two to
the right but Roger Gracie does it like
this but Cina says it like this clearly
they all work under the right
circumstances and don't work under the
wrong ones and it has nothing to do or
very little to do with these other

[03:45]
very little to do with these other
things like hey does it matter again I'm
going to kill you would you prefer for
it to be painless or horrifically
painful okay if it's already a foregone
conclusion death all right yeah now
we'll start to talk about the the
extreme like whether or not it's going
to sting but until we get to that point
hey let's focus on the do we is is it

[04:02]
hey let's focus on the do we is is it
even right or do I have the ability or
the capacity to do this justifiably okay
so that's where you come down to the
principles in my opinion you say all
right yeah does it matter which knuckle
you land with yeah I'm sure it does but
it's a hell of a lot less important than

[04:15]
it's a hell of a lot less important than
25 other little things that make all of
the difference and in my experience a
lot of coaches and a lot of people
particularly guys that are trying to
bullshit you um will focus on 45 little
details and oh it's there's 15 details
to this
technique okay that's true true but what

[04:30]
technique okay that's true true but what
are the two most important ones because
hey don't get me wrong I'm not saying
that these details don't matter but just
like anything else in life there's a
hierarchy because would you say that
would you say that happiness and
self-actualization is a valuable thing
in life yes I would as well and you know

[04:45]
in life yes I would as well and you know
what we have the luxury of saying that
type of thing because we're sitting at
5050 Jiu-Jitsu in false Church Virginia
and there's no one trying to kill us
rape us and we are also I know where
food is tonight yeah if you were to walk
down if you were to talk to someone like
2,000 years be like how are you feeling

[05:01]
2,000 years be like how are you feeling
they would stare at you like what are
you fucking retarded I'm starving I'm
hungry that's my issue are you are you
satisfied in your life it's like I'll be
Satisfied when you get out of my way so
I can find some food so so that's even
the deeper question is are you eating
something tonight right and so it's

[05:16]
something tonight right and so it's
masus hierarchy of needs when we take
care of the base needs first then we
start to work our way up towards
self-actualization and this and that and
but until you got your food Water
Shelter don't tell me about where you're
placing your grip it's like you're all
leaning out and you're you know your

[05:30]
leaning out and you're you know your
posture is poor and you're out of
balance and you want to tell me you're
grip that's like I'm starving to death
the you know the barbarians are at the
gates but I'm sitting here giving you a
philosophy lesson it's like this is
retarded it doesn't make any sense build
a better wall a sharper knife and get

[05:45]
a better wall a sharper knife and get
some food and then we'll cover all the
other stuff so I think that in my when
it comes to how I approach martial arts
in terms of learning as well as teaching
I really try to boil it down to what I
feel to be the most important component
parts and then if I one day reach the
level of where the these tiny Details

[06:00]
level of where the these tiny Details
Matter that's fantastic because again
the difference between you know the
ability to pass try to pass successfully
against a Cino or half Mendes and
against a regular run-of-the-mill black
belt you know it does come down to
little details but it's also
presupposing that you're in proper

[06:16]
presupposing that you're in proper
position that even allow these details
to become relevant and and I think that
a lot of times we put the car before the
horse and that's not that's problematic
are there still in your
opinion undiscovered positions
submissions or techniques in jiujitsu I

[06:30]
submissions or techniques in jiujitsu I
would say that there have to be there
absolutely are um you know I think that
what we see is Jiu-Jitsu now don't get
me wrong the core never changes because
physics doesn't change physics is the
same thing that's why I get a kick out
of people that love like self-defense
arguments it's like bullshit it has no
there's no physical difference in

[06:46]
there's no physical difference in
self-defense beyond the fact yes you can
iaz me though I've never seen anything
like that in real life that you're
crossing a pretty serious psychological
line if you're putting your knuckles too
you know your thumb two Knuckles deep
into somebody's eye forget the fact that
that you know that we're legal and moral
other things like that it's like I've

[07:00]
other things like that it's like I've
never done that before I wouldn't do it
lightly there' probably be some
hesitation there what so anyway what
makes it different is the the
psychological component and all these
other things going on but physically
there's no difference again people like
oh Jiu-Jitsu is really different than
MMA no it's not not in my opinion not in

[07:15]
MMA no it's not not in my opinion not in
my experience it is absolutely not what
are you talking about physics are
different inside of a cage than they are
on a mat and they are out in a field
it's exactly the same now if I try to
sport grapple you under a non-sport
grappling rule set then I may run myself

[07:31]
grappling rule set then I may run myself
into trouble but that had nothing to do
with jiu-jitsu Jiu-Jitsu is physics is
is proper expression of physics the same
way boxing is and the same way wrestling
is the same way all of these things are
so I would say that as long as something
adheres to the principles uh that that
allow something to be effective and uh

[07:47]
allow something to be effective and uh
you know and fundamentally sound that
you can do almost anything and I think
that people will continue particularly
in the ghee it's going to get nuts you
know just the level the amount of of
things that you can get away with and do
and and different grips that you can
make but uh I'd say what we're looking

[08:01]
make but uh I'd say what we're looking
at right now is going to look only
somewhat like what Jiu-Jitsu is going to
look like in 30 years the same way the
jiujitsu we see now is so much
fundamentally better honestly and and
more evolved and adaptive than it was 20

[08:15]
more evolved and adaptive than it was 20
years ago and people will swear up and
down like oh back in the day it's like
back in the day people didn't have to
fight very well even 20 years ago the
level of of people understanding how to
deal with jiu-jitsu was very reduced so
you could get away with all sorts of
pretty questionable

[08:30]
pretty questionable
like sitting in front of someone in
close guard and have them not completely
kick the shit out of you but um I think
you know with particularly the Advent of
the baron Bol the 50-50 position all
these different things which have always
existed there's they've always existed
and when that's I always hesitate to say
invent I don't like the word invent like

[08:46]
invent I don't like the word invent like
certain people use it a lot I'd say
discover because you could show me I
could come up with something let's say
Lex you know you've got a really good
straight foot lock I was watching a
train last night and I could be doing
that in a way that no one ever taught me
that doesn't mean I invented it because

[09:00]
that doesn't mean I invented it because
you've been doing it forever but
basically it's let's say no one showed
me the details you were using and I
managed to stumble across them I didn't
invent those details yeah I discovered
them that was neat but again none of us
have invented a dang thing people have
had two arms and two legs for certainly
as long as I can remember and probably

[09:16]
as long as I can remember and probably
longer than that that's what I hear yeah
that's that's the word so in the history
books
