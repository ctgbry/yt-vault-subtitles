the following is a conversation with
Matthew Cox a con man recently released
from federal prison where he served 13
years for bank fraud mortgage fraud
identity theft passport fraud and other
charges he has admitted guilt to all of

[01:17]
charges he has admitted guilt to all of
it he has written true crime stories of
many of his fellow prisoners and now he
continues this work by interviewing
criminals about their crimes on his
YouTube channel that I recommend called
inside true

[01:30]
inside true
crime exploring the mind of a criminal
is exploring human nature at the
extremes often in its most raw and
Illuminating form and that is something
I definitely want to do with this
podcast to understand the human mind and

[01:46]
podcast to understand the human mind and
everything it is capable
of this is Alex Freedman podcast to
support it please check out our sponsors
in the description and now dear friends
here's Matthew
Cox what was the first crime you

[02:01]
Cox what was the first crime you
committed the first mortgage I ever did
a mortgage is me borrowing money from a
bank to buy a house yeah how can you
find a way to commit crime in this how
can you do fraud in this space it's it's

[02:17]
can you do fraud in this space it's it's
very difficult for the average guy to
commit fraud because there's so many
safeguards set up um you know if you
were to go in and say um I make $300,000
a year okay well we want your W2 we want

[02:30]
a year okay well we want your W2 we want
your pay stuffs we're going to call your
employer we're going to check to make
sure your employer how long they've been
Incorporated we're going to check to
make sure they're registered we're going
it's like ah your whole plan fell apart
you know because the average guy can't
do that he can't even come up with the
with the pace7 W2 so the average person

[02:45]
with the pace7 W2 so the average person
you know or I'm going to put down this
much money but you're going to borrow
that money from the seller you know okay
well then they start asking for bank
statements where did the money come from
how long has it been in your bank like
you can't even have it put in your bank
for a day get a letter you know it's got
to have been there for 90 days or 60

[03:01]
to have been there for 90 days or 60
days depending on the bank and and so
there's all these ways for the average
person it's very difficult to commit
fraud the average guy that works at
Walmart and makes $60,000 a year and
he's been there for five years and he
saved his deposit like it's a very

[03:16]
saved his deposit like it's a very
that's really the guy that those
transactions are set up for to borrow a
mortgage from Bank of America that's the
guy they're looking for so to commit
fraud in this space you have to
misrepresent some aspect of your ident
identity of how much you're worth how

[03:31]
identity of how much you're worth how
much money you have this kind of stuff
right you have to be able to to lie to
the bank anytime you lie to the bank
you've committed fraud and it's funny
when I was you know doing it I would say
ah it's it's in the gray area there's no
gray area you're either lying in some

[03:45]
gray area you're either lying in some
capacity or you're not
so it's for instance the very first loan
I did I I wided out um my
borrower had been 30 days late on her

[04:00]
borrower had been 30 days late on her
uh on a rent so they're really looking
at the last two years so when when you
go in the bank and they most of what
they're asking is a is a two-year window
they're saying how long have you been on
their job they care about two years and
how long have you been at your um at

[04:16]
how long have you been at your um at
your residency they're looking for two
years now you could be at three places
in two years that's fine as long as you
consistent consistently paid for two
years well she had been in an apartment
complex but she'd been 30 days late now
she caught it up

[04:30]
she caught it up
but she was late Bank the bank doesn't
want to lend you money if if you've been
30 days late so I was a broker and I
whed out the 30-day late I just got rid
of it and my manager is the person that

[04:45]
of it and my manager is the person that
told me to do it she said it'll be fine
and she was right it was what did it
feel like so that was the first
fraudulent action you committed yeah I I
mean I you know I I was I was worried

[05:02]
mean I you know I I was I was worried
you know I always say you know I sweat
bullets for you know four or five days
you know but I mean I I I was concerned
and and I don't know that I was
concerned that I had broken the
law uh I was concerned because I was

[05:16]
law uh I was concerned because I was
behind on my on my truck payment I was
behind on my mortgage like I had banked
on being a mortgage broker and I'd gone
deep deep behind on all my bills to do
this so in the last minute when this

[05:30]
this so in the last minute when this
loan isn't going to close and I have to
commit fraud to make that happen and the
idea my fear was they were going to
figure it out and maybe I'd get fired
you know I didn't think I was going to
go to jail because my manager assured me
you're not going to jail like they

[05:45]
you're not going to jail like they
you'll get fired at at
best so my concern was they were going
to catch it and I get fired and I
wouldn't get paid like I needed that
money so bad so maybe paint the picture
here where were you working who was the

[06:00]
here where were you working who was the
manager the manager what it's funny cuz
I I I don't think I ever really
mentioned this it her name was uh
Gretchen Zas she eventually I don't mind
saying she eventually got ended up going
to jail for fraud her name was Gretchen
Zas and she was a manager I was working
for a company called Eagle lending and

[06:17]
for a company called Eagle lending and
it was in
Tampa and I this was like my first month
so my very first deal three or four
weeks into it into that first month and
I walk in I put the file in in front of

[06:31]
I walk in I put the file in in front of
my manager she looks through everything
you know oh great good good and put this
one piece of paper over here mhm and sat
there and then when she was done I said
uh what's what's going on she goes

[06:45]
uh what's what's going on she goes
perfect files perfect she goes but your
borrow was 30-day late on her rent and
she says that that's it's done she's
like that's a deal killer and I was like
oh my gosh you know what do I do and I
remember she pulled out a w thing a
white out the white out not the sticks

[07:00]
white out the white out not the sticks
with the one and she started going and I
was like what she goes if I was you and
she handed she I'd wi it out make a copy
stick it back in the file yeah she said
it'll be fine and I went I could I was
like that that's fraud I could go to
jail and she goes and she was like it's

[07:16]
jail and she goes and she was like it's
they're never going to catch it she said
look we do stuff I do stuff all the time
she said they're not going to catch it
and nobody's calling the FBI she say the
worst case that that worst case scenario
if underwriting catches
it then

[07:30]
it then
they'll fire you that's it nobody's
calling you're not going to jail and I
was you know I trusted her I was like
okay and so I I did what she said I
stuck it in the file and I mean look
like I said for four or five days I was
like oh my God I'm so scared how old do

[07:46]
like oh my God I'm so scared how old do
you at this point probably 29 I think it
was 29 you know like I had gone to
college and so many things had not
worked out you know I got a degree in
Fine Arts it's not it's not a there's
not a lot of people looking for anyone

[08:01]
not a lot of people looking for anyone
with a fine arts degree and uh you know
I tried my I try to be
a uh try to be a an insurance adjuster
tried that for about a year year and a
half that didn't work out uh ended up
ended up working

[08:15]
ended up working
construction for a few
years and you know so finally the girl I
was dating said you got to be a mortgage
broker you know she's just had just
started as a mortgage in the mortgage
industry and she was like you have to do
this like you were born to do this this
is perfect for you what did she see in

[08:32]
is perfect for you what did she see in
you she said just you're a Salesman and
I was like cuz I was like you know I
barely balanced my checkbook like I
don't I don't know anything about
numbers and she's like it has nothing to
do with that it's sales it's putting
together deals you know you're good at
that you're good at negotiating you're

[08:46]
that you're good at negotiating you're
you know you're a natural sales
salesman and I figured i' I need to try
something so what aspect of mortgages is
sales and deal making and what aspects
require the Charisma that you clearly

[09:01]
require the Charisma that you clearly
have well one you've got you have
clients that have lots of options they
can go to Bank of America they can go to
Sun Trust they can go to Chase they have
options if they have perfect credit I
ended up working for a company that was

[09:15]
ended up working for a company that was
a subprime lender and those people
didn't have a lot of options by Honestly
by the time they got to that to Eagle
lending their options were over so what
end ends up happening is you're
negotiating with sellers you know you

[09:30]
negotiating with sellers you know you
would think that a lot of the stuff that
in that industry that real estate
agents should do you the Brokers end up
doing because real estate agents are are
used to you meet them at the house or

[09:45]
used to you meet them at the house or
they take you to several houses they you
know they they open the door they walk
around they write up a contract that's
legit a legit contract and you already
you're already
pre-approved everything works out but

[10:01]
pre-approved everything works out but
subprime that's not the case you got
borrowers with horrific job history they
don't have enough of the down payment
they can't maybe they have the down
payment but they don't have the closing
cost so you have to go to the real
estate agent and say listen I need you
to raise the purchase price and have the

[10:17]
to raise the purchase price and have the
the seller pay the closing costs which
is legal but that's not to a degree but
that's not how they wrote up the
contract so now you're having to get
them to rewrite the contract or you're
have you're you know there's little

[10:30]
have you're you know there's little
things you're trying to do and the more
the more deals you get done and the more
you deal with certain real estate agents
the more you start to
realize that they're you know you know
which ones are completely above board

[10:45]
which ones are completely above board
and which ones are willing to twist the
rules and a lot of it works on personal
relationships right right for some
reason people tend to like me and trust
me yeah I don't know why it's it's it

[11:01]
me yeah I don't know why it's it's it
hasn't worked out for so many people but
people naturally seem to trust me and so
if I say hey I can close the loan but
you got to do this it'll be cool don't
worry we do it all the time it's like my
third loan and you know I I've been

[11:15]
third loan and you know I I've been
doing this for years and they go okay
and then they raise the purchase price
they add some money they have the seller
of the house give the borrower some
money they stick it in the bank or they
put it in the in escro at the closing
company like now you're starting to
massage deals what was the second time

[11:31]
massage deals what was the second time
you committed a crime so what how did it
start to evolve from the white out well
I mean when that went through you know
I I think a normal person probably would
have
said wow it was a onetime thing got away

[11:45]
said wow it was a onetime thing got away
with it I'm good but for me it just
emboldened me MH like I just got a chat
for like I don't know what it was 25
$3,500 I was thrilled and by that time I
was already working on another deal but
that
guy he made I forget something like he

[12:03]
guy he made I forget something like he
had made like let's say
$45,000 the year before in his
W2 if you based on his based on his
current track record or or his year-to

[12:15]
current track record or or his year-to
date of his pay St he made just enough
money but if you factored in last year's
W2 he was shy so if I change that 45,000
to 51,000

[12:30]
to 51,000
then he could the loan closes I get a
check for 3500 bucks he gets into a
house I'm doing him a favor you know I'm
doing God's work so I fix it it I kick
back I'm terrified a little bit you know

[12:46]
back I'm terrified a little bit you know
worried about it sure enough it closes
four or five days later they call me
he's ready to close a week later we
close I get a check next guy that comes
in I mean I got very very
quickly I was concerned do you have a
house do you have a deal is it ready I

[13:01]
house do you have a deal is it ready I
can get you I can get you done now if
you were in bankruptcy or something
there's some things you just you pull
their credit and you just couldn't help
them if they were if they had a 550
credit score or something and no job I
mean you know it had to be within reason
but very quickly it was changing W2s

[13:15]
but very quickly it was changing W2s
changing pay subs changing appraisals um
you know fixing verif like I said
verifications of
rent so it evolved very quickly for me
and you're essentially helping people

[13:30]
and you're essentially helping people
that's what I told myself giving him a
chance people that have been really
struggling financially in life so you've
been telling yourself that this is
you're doing a good good thing for
people I told myself that right up until

[13:46]
people I told myself that right up until
that those loans were solid and I was
helping those people out right up until
I went to prison and and I was in prison
and I had to write the government asked
me to write an ethics and fraud course
for to help teach the nation's mortgage

[14:03]
for to help teach the nation's mortgage
brokers um you know all loan officers
and Brokers have to take I think it's
nine hours of continuing education every
single year and I was approached to
write the ethics course and it was about

[14:17]
write the ethics course and it was about
that time and about the same period of
time I was writing uh writing a book my
book and that kind of you I started
reflecting on what I had done you know
and the truth is

[14:30]
and the truth is
like and this is a horrible thing to say
cuz the first time I ever heard somebody
say this I remember thinking oh that's a
horrible thing to say some people should
not own an house they shouldn't be
allowed to borrow they're not in a
position financially you know and and
there were there were many occasions
where I put someone in a house that they

[14:46]
where I put someone in a house that they
100% swore they could afford it was I
was helping them I told myself I was
helping them and a year and a half later
they're going into foreclosure their
stuff's on the corner they don't know
where to

[15:00]
where to
go and the truth is is that I I'm not
smarter than the actuaries that came up
with those underwriting
guidelines so in this whole process how
are you making money are you taking a
percentage broker fee yeah I charge a

[15:16]
percentage broker fee yeah I charge a
broker fee or you charge yield spread so
yield spread is let's say the interest
rate is 8% interest if I charge them 25
basis points over the 8% so I charge
them 8 and a quarter you know 8.25 then

[15:32]
them 8 and a quarter you know 8.25 then
I get 1% of the loan back as a fee so if
I charge them
85% I get two points back so if it's a
$100,000 piece of property and the bank
says your interest rate is going to be

[15:47]
says your interest rate is going to be
8% and I tell you
8.5 and I'm charging you a $3,500 broker
fee now I'm making
$5,500 so on even a $100,000 loan you

[16:00]
$5,500 so on even a $100,000 loan you
could make a nice chunk of change I mean
it's so how much gray area is here you
said that there really isn't when you're
lying or not but I mean you're feels
like there is it well every time I
changed something it wasn't gray area I
just committed I just committed fraud at

[16:15]
just committed I just committed fraud at
this level you're either you either meet
the guidelines or someone has massaged
it in such a way that they've committed
fraud that's it and there's now there's
there's tons of ways where you can
commit fraud
and they just can't figure it out does

[16:30]
and they just can't figure it out does
that make sense like I I mean I've
you've committed fraud and it's like
they've look at the entire they look at
all the documents and they double check
everything and they know there's fraud
in here they just can't find it just
because they can't find it doesn't mean
doesn't mean it was exactly doesn't mean
it wasn't fraud as part of this you did

[16:45]
it wasn't fraud as part of this you did
a lot of fascinating things one of the
things you did you talked about creating
synthetic
people meaning uh creating fake
identities what do what does it take to
do that to do that well so your credit
profile is made up of your you know your

[17:02]
profile is made up of your you know your
your at your name date of birth your
address and you know your social
security number and you know those are
the kind of you know and then there's
other things where you
work that sort of
thing but what people don't realize is

[17:18]
thing but what people don't realize is
there's so many people out there that
think that the credit bureau is already
know who you are right but the truth is
the first time the credit bureau has
ever heard about you was you told them
the first time you applied for a credit

[17:30]
the first time you applied for a credit
card you they created a credit profile
at that moment prior to that they had no
idea so the first time you apply you
give them your your full name date of
birth social security number and your
address and they create a credit profile

[17:47]
address and they create a credit profile
and they say hey no record found of this
person he has no credit nothing probably
got denied well what I realized through
the course of because eventually I ended
up
leaving that one company and I opened my

[18:01]
leaving that one company and I opened my
own mortgage
company when I opened that mortgage
company I
was I was on the inside does that make
sense like I wasn't a I wasn't just a
broker that was sitting out with
everybody else and would periodically

[18:15]
everybody else and would periodically
come in and ask questions or would call
underwriting and but really didn't
understand what was happening and what
exactly what the underwriting guidelines
were now I was actually talking to the
underwriters and you're you're talking
to the um to the owners of The Lending
institutions and the banks and you're

[18:31]
institutions and the banks and you're
talking to all of the account Executives
and now it wasn't just Eagle lending I
was talking to there were 40 different
account Executives coming in on a weekly
basis trying to get us to sign up with
their lender and they're on the inside

[18:46]
their lender and they're on the inside
telling you coming in showing you uh
programs and saying look if your
borrower is you know
self-employed we don't ask for this or
this we just ask for them to say they're
self-employed like liar loans You'

[19:01]
self-employed like liar loans You'
you've heard the term liar loans okay um
no doc loans where they don't ask for
any documentation if he's got over like
let's say a 700 credit score and he says
he's been a plumber and he works for
himself then he's got over a 700 credit
score he just has to say he's worked for

[19:16]
score he just has to say he's worked for
himself for over two years and they
don't ask any they don't ask for any
documentation he's got the money in the
bank he's got a 700 credit score says
he's been on the job for two years he's
self-employed we're going to raise his
insurance rate by 1%
and and he's got you know that's it he's

[19:30]
and and he's got you know that's it he's
he's got the loan so but you start to
you start to know how things work
because I hired a bunch of Brokers to
work underneath me and when they would
get
caught I would get the phone call so I
get the phone call from the owner of a

[19:47]
get the phone call from the owner of a
bank or a lending Institute you know A
lender and that lender says hey Matt we
got a problem I'm like what's up he's
like he's like listen we we caught a
fake W2 I'm like what do you what do you
mean yeah your your broker soand so sent

[20:01]
mean yeah your your broker soand so sent
us a file and this person had there's
two fake W2s and we're assuming the pay
subs are fake and I'm like are you
serious how how did you even catch that
and they go oh well here's what we did
we checked with

[20:15]
we checked with
sunbiz.com you know sunbiz.gov which is
the Secretary of State's website that
registers corporations and we checked
and the tax ID number didn't match and I
now I know every W2 has to have a
matching uh tax ID number for whatever

[20:32]
matching uh tax ID number for whatever
corporation uh issued it so there's a
sequence of checks they do to detect
fraud on different documents like W2s
and then you're slowly learning slowly
yeah exactly what's the process for
detecting I mean I had a pretty good
understanding anyway yeah but so I'm

[20:46]
understanding anyway yeah but so I'm
starting to learn that understanding
yeah so I'm putting these things
together and I remember one time I had a
woman come in and she came in and she
had perfect credit she had like 7 50
credit scores I mean it was perfect and

[21:00]
credit scores I mean it was perfect and
she came in and uh one of the Brokers
came in and said hey man he's can I show
you something I was like yeah what's up
he he goes look he said I've got this
This Woman's W2s here I said okay I
looked at him and he goes here's your
credit report and he goes here's the you

[21:15]
credit report and he goes here's the you
know application this is the this is the
social security number I went all right
and he said this is the social security
number on the W2 and I went okay keep in
mind you go to get a car loan or credit
card they ask for these things so and he

[21:30]
card they ask for these things so and he
was like and I'm really shocked he even
noticed it I probably might not have
even caught it but he they were
different and I went really and he goes
yeah he said um so I I did you know she
just brought him in you know she's here
and I was like oh bring her in here so
she came in sat down and said listen

[21:46]
she came in sat down and said listen
here's what we just found and she was
like oh okay you know what I don't want
the loan I I just I go no no no no I
said listen you're getting the loan you
got a 750 credit score like I don't care
what we have to do we're getting you the
loan I just want to know what's going on
mhm how are how did you how did you get

[22:00]
mhm how are how did you how did you get
750 credit scores under this social
security number when clearly this is
your real social security number you've
been working for this company for 10
years and your credit profile says it's
only like three years old and I was like
what happened and what she told me she
did was she had been she went through a

[22:17]
did was she had been she went through a
divorce she had been married for 10
years used her husband's I mean his
surname for 10 years so she has no
credit under her maiden name MH but when
they got divorced she switched to her

[22:31]
they got divorced she switched to her
maiden
name um because when she pulled tried to
get anything in her in her um husband's
surname it was denied bad credit so he
had bad credit their credit went bad so
he switched to her she switched to her

[22:47]
he switched to her she switched to her
name and a friend told her if she needed
to get her electric or anything turned
on she could use her name and use her
daughter's or son's Social Security
number which was like a four-year-old
kid y so she used that and it went

[23:02]
kid y so she used that and it went
through she had to put a deposit down
but it went through at least wasn't
denied so that went through then she
went and she applied for an apartment
with
that sure enough it went through she had
no credit but they said you don't have

[23:15]
no credit but they said you don't have
bad credit so she said once she moved
into the apartment she then started
getting these preapproved credit cards
so she she goes but I knew I had applied
there using my son's social security
number let's say so she started filling
those out and sure enough she got a

[23:30]
those out and sure enough she got a
credit card and then she got two and
then she got a pre-approval from Ford
Motor Credit she went and got herself a
new car got approved she'd been making
the payments ever since she has 750
credit scores she thought she'd try her
hand at buying a house in his name in
his social security number

[23:46]
his social security number
and we caught it and she got a house in
that name we we closed it I just was
like wow like this is great can I ask
you a question about that because it
seems like she's able to pay for
everything right so while this is highly

[24:03]
everything right so while this is highly
illegal is it unethical is it
like it's it's unethical in that it's
messing with the system on which a lot
of people
rely but it feels like there's some
aspect of the system that's broken in

[24:17]
aspect of the system that's broken in
that it doesn't give people like her a
second chance she could have claimed
bankruptcy and then 2 years later listen
two years out of bankruptcy you can go
into Bank of America and get a
conventional mortgage
assuming you have perfect credit outside

[24:30]
assuming you have perfect credit outside
the bankruptcy you have the down payment
you make enough money there's a whole
bunch of you know a bunch of uh
underwriting guidelines you have to meet
but that's possible but you're right for
instance she wasn't getting an apartment
using with her bad credit she wasn't
getting her utilities turned on she

[24:46]
getting her utilities turned on she
wasn't getting any of those things done
so getting your life back on track is
just harder it's extremely hard so
there's a temptation to take the
shortcut and the shortcut is often going
to be illegal right and she stumbled in
into it but she

[25:00]
into it but she
basically explained it to me and I I
mean I don't think she had walked out of
the of my brokerage office before I went
and I just started making up you know
names and I think I went I went and into
our file cabinet and grabbed some
people's uh 1040s which we had you

[25:18]
people's uh 1040s which we had you
know their tax returns and looked up
children's Social Security numbers and
just grabbed some random kid Social
Security numbers and their name and went
and pulled them and sure and you know
but I changed their date of birth to be

[25:30]
but I changed their date of birth to be
an adult pulled it and sure enough it
came up no file found you know it didn't
say fraud alert or fraud or anything
they didn't say mismatch this mismatch
that didn't say anything it just said
you know no file found well
then we went and we pulled applied for a

[25:45]
then we went and we pulled applied for a
couple credit cards using a child social
security number and then we went and
pulled Our Own Credit Report and sure
enough it didn't say no no file found it
just said that there had been two
inquiries
applying for credit cards so I was like

[26:01]
applying for credit cards so I was like
wow like that's a credit
profile so that turns into
me going to Social
Security and calling or calling Social
Security and trying to get them to issue

[26:16]
Security and trying to get them to issue
me Social Security numbers to adults
that had never had a social security
number issued to them I need to get
Social Security number to give me a
clean social security number but I
called up and of course you know I'm a
novice I don't really know what I'm

[26:30]
novice I don't really know what I'm
doing so I call up and I say hey uh yeah
I was I'm uh never had a social security
number issued and they were like how old
are you and I was like I'm 31 years old
you know and they were yeah that's not
possible do you have a driver's license
uh yeah you have a bank account yeah you

[26:46]
uh yeah you have a bank account yeah you
have a Social Security number uh bring
your driver's license in and we'll we'll
pull it up okay well that's not going to
happen hang up call back hi um my
son is seven years old or three years
old and he he had never had a social

[27:02]
old and he he had never had a social
security number issued oh okay was he
born in a hospital yes well he has one
he has one go ahead and uh get your son
come in here no I'm not doing that hang
up call back so I called back probably

[27:16]
up call back so I called back probably
times and
eventually uh someone said I I kept
altering it kept altering what I was
saying till I got to the point where I
was saying
saying my son was born with a midwife

[27:33]
saying my son was born with a midwife
not in the hospital and the pediatrician
told us that we needed to go we need to
get Social Security to issue a social
security number and they would say well
he should have issued it but that does

[27:46]
he should have issued it but that does
happen sometimes so bring your son in
and we'll you know you can fill out the
paperwork we'll have one issued you
first we'll check to see he never had
one issued and if he hasn't we'll issue
one and so then it turned into my son is

[28:01]
one and so then it turned into my son is
out of the country and I need this and
then that turned into oh I'm sorry well
how old is he I was like um you know
he's three and they go well I'm sorry if
he's over the age of 12 months old he
has to come in hang up the phone call

[28:15]
has to come in hang up the phone call
back my son is 10 months old he's out of
the country born with a midwife never
had a social security number and then
they go oh okay that's fine just get his
birth certificate and a his shot record
and you can come in fill out the

[28:30]
and you can come in fill out the
paperwork we'll get issue you a social
security number and that's what I did so
I figured out how to create a birth
certificate you know I ordered the
security paper you know when uh where
you make a copy it says you know void if
copied so I ordered had to order a bunch

[28:45]
copied so I ordered had to order a bunch
of that and I went online and figured
out how to make a a fake birth
certificate it was great too because
like the county actually they give you a
a blank form and then they actually show
you what it looks like filled out like a
handwritten one filled out so I knew if

[29:02]
handwritten one filled out so I knew if
he was born this day he got these shots
U two months later he got these shot six
months later he got these shot so I just
filled it out I even had to order a a
seal so you have to have a seal that
says like Hillsboro County vital

[29:17]
says like Hillsboro County vital
statistics or Richland County vital
statistics or something and I couldn't
get anybody to make that so I changed it
to like Richland County Office of
virtual um records and then I took like

[29:32]
virtual um records and then I took like
220 grit sandpaper and and and hit it
over and over and over again to wear it
down and then I State you know I did the
embossment on the on the corner and you
know I printed it on the security paper
embossed it nobody looks at those things

[29:46]
embossed it nobody looks at those things
you could see Richland County you know
you you could kind of see that and
really they just grab it and they go
like this this is what you realize after
you when I started getting started
getting uh driver's licenses issu issued
by uh by the State DMV right the state I

[30:02]
by uh by the State DMV right the state I
I figured out eventually it was easier
to just go into the DMV and have them
give me a a driver's license then
actually make one so but you notice they
would just grab the thing they'd feel
the form and go okay like they don't
even look at it so which is upsetting if

[30:17]
even look at it so which is upsetting if
you put as much work into these
documents as I am for them to go okay
yeah that's good sit over there I felt
like going like hey bro like take a look
at this this is artwork yeah but they're
looking for the lwh hanging fruit of
crappy fraud right yeah this stuff was

[30:32]
crappy fraud right yeah this stuff was
right through so okay so so birth
certificate gets you a uh Social
Security number so it's it's it's
interesting because you've also you
you've done a lot of different
approaches to um creating synthetic

[30:48]
approaches to um creating synthetic
people there's homeless people involved
so sometimes it's grounded in real
people or real
names and then you're right like some
part part is fake some part is real
sometimes and sometimes it's completely

[31:00]
sometimes and sometimes it's completely
all fake right cuz now I have the name I
have the social security number and
what's great is they mail you what's
even better is you get then you get to
pick whatever name you want you know
because when you pick your child's name
he doesn't even have to have your last
name you pick any name so I would pick a

[31:15]
name you pick any name so I would pick a
name and I'd just say oh my wife's last
name is this if it they question it
which they never did but you know I've
got a social security number and then I
would go apply for credit cards and i'
get denied of course but they would all
offer me a secured credit card so I I'd

[31:32]
offer me a secured credit card so I I'd
then fill out the secured credit card
and i' send them send the bank the money
and they would give me a secured credit
card for $500 $300 1,000 whatever it was
and then once you start making the
payments I pulled the credit and a

[31:46]
payments I pulled the credit and a
credit profile shows up saying that this
31y old
man with a social security number that I
know was issued you know a couple months
ago has three three credit cards they
don't even say secure they just say
there's like this credit card is $500 it

[32:01]
there's like this credit card is $500 it
was issued by Bank of America this one
was issued by Capital 1 this one would
so I've got three of them but I had no
credit
scores so at that point I kind of kicked
back and waited I just kept making
payments and I remember thinking to

[32:16]
payments and I remember thinking to
myself I'll bet you they don't that the
credit bureaus don't generate credit
scores for at least a year and I was
like God this is going to be a year-long
process and while that was happening I
started other I was starting other ones

[32:30]
started other I was starting other ones
cuz I figured at least in a year I'll
have a bunch of these secure you know
these um we call them like Phantom
borrowers but now they call them
synthetic identities so at least I would
have these synthetic identities and
maybe I could do something with them but
what happened was at six months I went

[32:46]
what happened was at six months I went
and I randomly pulled the guy's credit
you know the person's credit and
705 credit scores 705 701 695 I was like
oh my my you only needed a 620 to borrow

[33:00]
oh my my you only needed a 620 to borrow
to get a 95% loan from the bank so I was
like oh my God this is in this is
amazing sure enough a month later the
other ones I had started all of them Bam
Bam Bam so what do you do with a phantom
borrower like what how do you make money

[33:16]
borrower like what how do you make money
on this so I think most people if you
were just like a scammer a fraudster you
would you would probably just get credit
cards and maybe build up that history or

[33:30]
cards and maybe build up that history or
maybe try and borrow a personal loan uh
which is limited you know it's personal
loans are used to be you used to be you
could go
to uh an FDIC insured bank which borrows
money
those you know the personal loans they

[33:45]
those you know the personal loans they
lend out at the max $115,000 you know so
you could do that so you can go through
this whole process creating a fake
identity getting a card paying it off
building up credit and then you get
$115,000 at the end or right you get 15

[34:00]
$115,000 at the end or right you get 15
maybe you know if you want to keep
making the payments you know if you
could wait a year you could probably get
15,000 uh maybe you could maybe get 20
30,000 and a bunch of little smaller
ones you know you get 7500 cuz I did I
did there was a $7,500 from City Bank
you know $5,500 from American General so

[34:17]
you know $5,500 from American General so
you maybe get what 25,000 you know maybe
$30,000 in personal loans maybe you can
you could you could then apply for you
can maybe get another 20 or 30,000 in
regular credit cards you know 10,000

[34:30]
regular credit cards you know 10,000
here 8,000 5,000 and then you go to the
lower department store cards and you go
a Home Depot you get a th000 you get 500
so it ends up being maybe you can get 50
60,000 maybe if you really good you
could get up to 80 or $100,000 in credit
cards and personal loans if you really

[34:46]
cards and personal loans if you really
knew what you were doing but per person
per identity per identity but I had the
ability
to to leverage that perfect those
perfect credit profiles against

[35:00]
perfect credit profiles against
properties and I mean ultimately that's
what I end up doing and and so each one
of those identities was
worth you know a few million can you
explain how that works so uh to leverage
them against property so how does that
work with the mortgage so what I did

[35:15]
work with the mortgage so what I did
eventually I mean this would like is
down the road but you know I mean at
this point when things are just my whole
life had kind of gone off the The
Rails I was on federal probation and and
so what I did decided I was going to do

[35:30]
so what I did decided I was going to do
was start running a scam a much larger
scam and what I was going to do was it I
was going to start flipping properties
right like buy houses cheap fix them up
and sell them there's an area of Tampa
called eore
City so I was going to start flipping

[35:48]
City so I was going to start flipping
houses in eore city and you know I
thought okay I can I can buy these
houses for you could buy a really crappy
house at that time for 50 $60,000 let's
say 50 and then you could put $25,000

[36:01]
say 50 and then you could put $25,000
into it in renovations you could
renovate it for 25 and maybe you could
get an appraisal for a
hundred so I thought what I could do is
I

[36:15]
I
can I can buy these houses renovate them
and sell them to you know regular
people but I also had been working on
the synthetic identities
and then I thought well or I could just
sell them to synthetic identities and

[36:30]
sell them to synthetic identities and
then I wouldn't have to dump 25,000 into
it right and these guys are perfect they
have perfect credit I can provide W2s
and pay stubs because by this point I'm
manufacturing
businesses so I've got I've got I've

[36:45]
businesses so I've got I've got I've
Incorporated businesses I've got
websites for the businesses W2s payub so
these guys have these guys look perfect
so I figure I'll buy these properties
for 50,000 sell it to these guys for 100
maybe I'll pocket 40 or 50,000 I don't
really have to do
anything but that seemed shortsighted so

[37:02]
anything but that seemed shortsighted so
I thought what' be even better is that
if I did a little bit of Renovations and
then I sold it for much higher maybe I
put 10,000 clean up the outside of it
because these guys don't care what the
inside of of the property it looks like
you know they they're not they don't

[37:15]
you know they they're not they don't
exist
so and then I but I can't how am I going
to get an appraisal for
$100,000 well do you you know how
appraisals work okay so the Bank sends
an appraiser out or at that time you

[37:30]
an appraiser out or at that time you
could provide an appraisal they can
review it so they'll do what's called a
Desktop review they review it they
review it
on um on the computer they never go out
to the property or they send someone out
they they call that you know it's like a
field review they send someone out and

[37:47]
field review they send someone out and
they just look at the house they don't
go in it though so I have to clean out
the clean up the outside of the house so
what I did was but the problem is is if
your house is you're trying to sell that
house for let's say 200,000 the other

[38:00]
house for let's say 200,000 the other
houses they have to pick three
comparable sales in the area that are
also going to support a a
$200,000 sales price well there's no
other house is selling for 200,000 near
this house so I thought if I want to get

[38:17]
this house so I thought if I want to get
these things apprais for 200
250,000 I have to have comparable sales
and that appraisal is going to be
reviewed
so what I did
was I started I went out and I bought

[38:32]
was I started I went out and I bought
this house for
50,000
and I recorded the sale at
200,000 So when you buy a house for
$100,000 you pay $700 in dock

[38:45]
$100,000 you pay $700 in dock
stamps but if you pay the extra an extra
700 bucks the sale shows up for
$200,000 I'm buying these things for 50
so I'm paying $350 and I'm just paying
an an extra
$1,00

[39:00]
$1,00
50 so I'm so it ends up being you know
$1,400 but the but the sale shows up at
$ 200,000 on a house that's a a crack
house I bought for
$50,000 now I go I trim the trees we mow
the yard we clean up the porch we put

[39:15]
the yard we clean up the porch we put
the porch rail on maybe we paint it real
nice we black out all the windows you
can't see inside um but from the from
the curb it looks great and I get an
appraisal so I do that with that house I
do that with another house all within a

[39:30]
do that with another house all within a
mile so I buy four houses knowing I can
use the all there's a subject and three
comparables for all of them so the first
thing I did is I bought four houses for
50,000 60,000 40,000 and I recorded the
values at you know 210 200

[39:47]
values at you know 210 200
190 so I get an appraiser to come out
there he appraises it he said of course
he says it's horrible but there's
comparables here now of course it is in
bad shape and he says it's in bad shape
but I I go ahead and I correct all that

[40:01]
but I I go ahead and I correct all that
so I correct it so now if you if you
review the appraisal and you're in
California or even if you drive your car
down your the appraiser comes to the
house and looks at it from the street it
looks fine but the truth is I've got

[40:16]
looks fine but the truth is I've got
$60,000 into this property and you're
appraising it for $200,000 so the bank's
ready not they're not going to lend 200
but they'll lend 190 so the bank is
ready to lend
this synthetic

[40:30]
this synthetic
borrower $190,000 on a house that I have
$60,000 in so I walk so I schedule a
closing and we close on the house and I
walk away with
$60,000 you know and and the thing is

[40:48]
$60,000 you know and and the thing is
like the problem was is by the time I
got to this point I knew so many people
in the industry I nobody had to really
at that point show up although I've had
people show up for the synthetic inds
and signed for them almost all the

[41:01]
and signed for them almost all the
closings nobody ever showed up I just
showed up and said to the title uh to
the title agency and said hey my
borrower he's at work right now he can't
make it can I just take the file and
I'll have him sign all the documents at

[41:16]
I'll have him sign all the documents at
his work and I'll bring them back he's
like an hour and a half away from here
I'll be back in two or three hours
they're like oh wow that man Matt thank
you so much and they would give it to me
and I'd go sit in the parking lot and i'
sign all the documents and i' wait an
hour or two and I'd come back in and say

[41:30]
hour or two and I'd come back in and say
here you go how how are you able to keep
all this in your mind because you have
to not slip up in any of these
conversations it's pretty easy for me to
for me to keep
them everything in the correct category

[41:47]
them everything in the correct category
does that make sense like it's it's I'm
not great at a lot of things but this I
was very good at but well there's these
Phantom people that exist and they were
becoming real people in your mind is

[42:01]
becoming real people in your mind is
then like you're able to tell good
stories with with those people right
like because if you're talking to the
appraiser if you're talking to the
everybody in involved well keep in mind
the appraiser almost never meets the
borrower never not even like 99.99 99%

[42:15]
borrower never not even like 99.99 99%
of the time they never meet him but you
have to talk about them yeah so I guess
what I'm asking is you're able to
converse fluently about these synthetic
identities yeah they they all had
different jobs they all had all the jobs

[42:30]
different jobs they all had all the jobs
were basically they were all on the job
for 5 years they were all was a lot of
there's a template yeah
exactly but I got it yeah listen all
matter of fact almost every one of them
had the same birth date you know so
because I you know who knows um there's

[42:47]
because I you know who knows um there's
so it it yeah it wasn't difficult and
keep in mind the a lot of the the
Brokers barely ever meet um meet the bar
they call in on the phone but it didn't
matter anyway cuz I'm walking and saying
I got a slam dunk deal for you and
they're like oh wow Matt you got the W2s

[43:01]
they're like oh wow Matt you got the W2s
the pay dubs you've got all the you got
all their uh their rental history you
have everything done it's perfect thank
you so much they're happy to do it hey I
print up the docs and I'll have them go
sign it great wow thank you you know
assuming they didn't already know about

[43:16]
assuming they didn't already know about
it almost everybody involved in this by
the time I was done was involved there
was probably 15 or 20 people that all
knew what was going on the full of it
they knew the full depth of it yes yeah
at yeah maybe not 100% everything but

[43:30]
at yeah maybe not 100% everything but
they definitely knew this is fraud and
they were still going along with it yeah
yeah keep in mind that even when I give
you an
example one of
my you know let's say and this happened

[43:46]
my you know let's say and this happened
with almost all of them was he would buy
five
houses so the guy but what happens the
basic design was I I buy the
houses I record the values

[44:00]
houses I record the values
higher
and this person buys all five houses
refinances them he ends up borrowing a
little bit over a million dollars in his
name uh then of course then I go and I I
get um personal loans from several Banks

[44:17]
get um personal loans from several Banks
I get credit cards I run up all of his
credit cards by this point I've got 10
$20,000 worth of credit cards in the
guy's name so the guys are all worth
like a million million and change well
once I stop paying you start getting

[44:31]
once I stop paying you start getting
letters from the collection companies
right from the banks you know then they
sell them off so after about three
months you're getting tons of letters
and what I would do
is I would take my borrower's name I
would go online and I would find or I go

[44:45]
would go online and I would find or I go
in the newspaper and I would
find I would find an article about let's
say like a 12C car pile up you know so
there's you know there a huge accident
on I4 it's very dangerous
so there's a 12C car pile up and someone
in the accident was life flighted to

[45:02]
in the accident was life flighted to
Tampa General
hospital I
would cut and paste that
article and I would just insert my
borrower's name into the article saying
that you know Brandon green was life

[45:15]
that you know Brandon green was life
flighted to Tampa General Hospital is
currently in critical condition I would
then print that article out on newsprint
I didn't make a copy of the cut it up
make copy of the newsprint highlight his
name and I would write a letter from
Brandon

[45:30]
Brandon
Green's fictional sister to the
collection companies saying several
months ago my brother was in a horrible
car accident he is currently they've got
the article they have the highlighted
name he clearly was in in this uh in

[45:45]
name he clearly was in in this uh in
this accident he is currently in a coma
and the doctors say even if he wakes up
from the coma he will never work again
that you know so you might as well just
foreclose on stop writing less letters
and take the houses back and that's all
they're looking for is is is a reason at

[46:02]
they're looking for is is is a reason at
this point even if they look into
Brandon green they can't figure out if
he's a real person or
not because he's got a social security
he's got and everything went bad at the
same time he's got multiple rental

[46:16]
same time he's got multiple rental
properties or his primary residence all
of his credit cards went bad everything
went bad we have an excuse we have a
letter that happens people get divorced
they lose their job they get an
accidents it's reasonable when they look
into it all looks legitimate even if

[46:30]
into it all looks legitimate even if
they ordered another appraisal by this
point it's not four comparable sales or
three or four comparable sales by this
point it's like 10 15 20 30 40 50 cuz I
kept making more and more of these guys
what was your just to almost like a
tangent what's your thinking process

[46:47]
tangent what's your thinking process
there's a lot of cleverness going on
here so like uh the the car pile up as a
solution newspaper and you mail it
are you sitting there alone and thinking
through this like how do you come up

[47:00]
through this like how do you come up
with that idea this a it's a very
interesting a very clever Innovative
idea so at first I I thought about
making like a a fake death certificate
he died you know but I thought I don't
know like what if you know like some of

[47:15]
know like what if you know like some of
these places had like you know uh you
know primary mortgage insurance like
what if the primary mortgage insurance
like what if they try and claim cuz he
was dead or like I don't know I don't
know that side I'm like I don't want to
do that I want to do something that's
semi- verifiable and third party it's

[47:30]
semi- verifiable and third party it's
like a third party telling you this is
what happened I thought well like the
newspaper you know and you know or do I
claim bankruptcy and I've done that I've
gone and got the bankruptcy forms right
you can go to the bankruptcy court and
they'll give you forms to mail to all of

[47:46]
they'll give you forms to mail to all of
your uh creditors and you mail them they
stop contacting they wait to be no
located by or notified by the bankruptcy
court but my fear there is you know uh
nobody's ever going to notify them like
I'm not going through bankruptcy for one

[48:00]
I'm not going through bankruptcy for one
of these guys so it was like this is a
this is a better bet than just writing a
letter saying I'm going through a
divorce my wife's keeping those houses
that's her problem you know you could do
there's lots of things you could do but
to me this was they're not going to try
and how do you how do you shut it down

[48:16]
and how do you how do you shut it down
without him dying how do you shut that
down this is how you shut it down he's
in a coma he'll never work
again he was in a car accident here's
the proof he can't even write you I'm a
sister I wrote you the letter it's a
one-time letter that seems to um tie up

[48:33]
one-time letter that seems to um tie up
all
exactly you know I can only know the ex
exactly how that you know what sparked
that is as much as there were so many
other avenues that I could have gone

[48:45]
other avenues that I could have gone
that I was I just didn't know I but you
were thinking through all those
different Avenues are you mostly
thinking
alone I mean you know I had guys that I
was bouncing ideas ideas off of there
were other guys that were involved in
the scam you know everybody I think that

[49:00]
the scam you know everybody I think that
scam ended up making like I think the
FBI said it was like 11 and a half
million or something and and you know
but but there were so many other people
that were involved in that scam that
were you know this guy's getting 50 this
guy's getting 20 you know 177,000 20,000

[49:16]
guy's getting 20 you know 177,000 20,000
25,000 and you know the we're just doing
it constantly and so the bank would
foreclose on that property they'd take
it
back they' put it back on the MLS they
put it back on the MLS for 100 for
200,000 it wouldn't sell then they drop

[49:31]
200,000 it wouldn't sell then they drop
it to you know 150 wouldn't sell then
they drop it to 125 130 wouldn't sell
they drop it to 90 and somebody buy it
for like 90 it wasn't worth 90 but by
that point that whole area had we' done
so many houses at that point the whole

[49:45]
so many houses at that point the whole
area shot up and the the FBI said uh we
did 1009 houses I don't think that's
true
but wow we we when I end up leaving
Tampa after that scam falls apart and
the FBI shows up Forbes came out with an

[50:01]
the FBI shows up Forbes came out with an
article whatever six months later and
they
said that the ebore City ZIP code was
one of the top 20 fastest growing um
appraising areas in the country and you

[50:16]
appraising areas in the country and you
know everybody was like oh that's mad
cuz this place is a dump like this is is
a horrible place like this is and I
remember one time I had talked to a guy
you know years later and he was like ah
all the comparable sales have dried up
like when you left there was just
nothing even close to

[50:32]
nothing even close to
200,000 you mentioned right before uh
telling the story of this elaborate scam
that you were on federal probation how
did that happen so I mentioned that I I
own the mortgage company yes right so I
I had started a mortgage company I had

[50:45]
I had started a mortgage company I had
maybe a dozen guys working for me and
and there was fraud you know like I
would say it wasn't all fraud but
whatever 60 70% of it was fraud that
that was going in there and from the
outside of that that business it looked

[51:00]
outside of that that business it looked
very
legitimate you know we were an FHA
approved lender we were a VA approved
lender we did conventional probably
signed up with 40 or 50 subprime
lenders
um but but there was a considerable
amount of Fraud and you know it kept

[51:16]
amount of Fraud and you know it kept
getting you know it it became a game
right you know it you start you I
started getting just more and more
creative like like I said every time I
would get away with something like you
become emboldened by it it's like nice

[51:30]
become emboldened by it it's like nice
you know like hey the underwriter's
looking for this and looking for this
and you sit there and go man so that
she's you know that's what am I gonna do
what am I you know what we could do we
could create create our own bank what
yeah here's what we're gonna do we're
going to go on like how do they know if

[51:45]
going to go on like how do they know if
this Bank exists these people are in
California or they're in New York like
they don't know so what we're going to
do is we're going to go online and keep
in mind this is 20
you know this is 2000 2001 like this is

[52:00]
you know this is 2000 2001 like this is
the
internet's in its infancy still right so
we figure out I remember GoDaddy I think
had just come up with a site where you
could build your own website like how
cool is that so I go online with a buddy
of mine and we create something called

[52:15]
of mine and we create something called
the bank of ebore you know we cut and
pasted things that we like from other
Banks and we got a 1 1800 number you
could call or a 186 whatever it was and
you could call it and it would go to a
voicemail and so we set up this bank and
then I ended up making bank statements

[52:31]
then I ended up making bank statements
which by this point I already had been
making bank statements to to prove
someone has their down payment because a
lot of times people they have good
enough credit to borrow 95% or 90% but
they don't have their down payment so
we'd raise the purchase price high

[52:46]
we'd raise the purchase price high
enough to cover their 5 or 10% down
payment and we would bring their down
payment for them or we'd have the the
owner of the house bring the down
payment for them and then we would have

[53:00]
payment for them and then we would have
a check cut out of the closing statement
to a construction
company that I owned and we get our
money back so they get into the house
for 100% financing or 110% some of them
turned into 130 we want to pay off their
car give them an incentive to

[53:17]
car give them an incentive to
sign um they don't have still don't have
the money to buy it so we're doing all
kinds of insane things well at some
point
remember Gretchen Zas my um my old

[53:31]
remember Gretchen Zas my um my old
manager yeah the original yes she came
and worked for me for a short period of
time and then she and her husband went
and opened their own mortgage company
which you should have known it was going
to be fraudulent from the bgo because it

[53:46]
to be fraudulent from the bgo because it
was called creative financing it was was
yeah create uh CFM creative Finance no
creative creative was the name yeah yeah
creative was in the name oh boy um so
it's really on the nose so she uh she's

[54:03]
it's really on the nose so she uh she's
doing very
well and and we became very close by the
way we we go on vacation went to Puerto
Rico together um I'm I got married at
the time I got I was married uh our kids

[54:16]
the time I got I was married uh our kids
you know play together we babysit we go
to each other's parties we're close
we're good friends and she's got her own
mortgage company she calls me up
periodically and ask me hey can you make
a W2 or hey can you make me a pay stop
sure no problem we're friends that's

[54:30]
sure no problem we're friends that's
what fraudulent friends do so you know
if I needed somebody to to verify rent
or verify somebody's um rental history
or employment she had cell phones she
would answer that sort of thing for me

[54:45]
would answer that sort of thing for me
well what ends up happening
is um she gets in trouble she starts
doing fraudulent loans for some guys you
know and these guys are doing what's

[55:03]
know and these guys are doing what's
called a cash back scam so they're
they're getting like a half a million
dollar
loan on a house that's
worth $300,000 so they're getting a uh

[55:16]
worth $300,000 so they're getting a uh
they're buying the house for whatever
600,000 it's really only worth 300
350 but she happened to be in an area
where she could get it the appraisal
jacked up so they they buy the house
they get2 $300,000

[55:30]
they get2 $300,000
back and um it's it's a it's a straw man
scam right it's a cashback straw man
scam so this a real person that's buying
the house he's got perfect credit but
he's willing he's willing to let to ruin
his credit to get a couple hundred
thousand in his pocket so he never has

[55:45]
thousand in his pocket so he never has
any intentions so it's not a synthetic
identity it's not a stolen identity he's
a straw man he's a fake kind of a not a
fake person but he's just a straw man
he's a standing so he stands in he signs
a paperwork he buy buys the house they
end up getting 230,000 well this guy
buys like five houses so it's a two3

[56:02]
buys like five houses so it's a two3
million they've lost five 6006
700,000 and these guys never even make
the first payment they just let them go
into forclosure so the bank immediately
investigates and realizes this is fraud

[56:15]
investigates and realizes this is fraud
so the FBI comes in they grab Pete and
Gretchen she has to hire an attorney of
course and she doesn't get thrown in
jail or anything they just come to their
office and they they tell them their
invest tigating them they know what's
going on and they they want to talk to
they're like look we want to talk to you
and you're going to be indicted okay so

[56:31]
and you're going to be indicted okay so
she comes to me well actually Pete came
to me and said look man can you
refinance our house and get a 75,000 out
to pay our attorney I said no problem
um Gretchen gives me W2s pay subs fake
the whole thing's fake I get her I

[56:46]
the whole thing's fake I get her I
refinance I get a second mortgage on her
house $75,000 they pay their attorney
their attorney immediately says you need
to wear wire on this guy like he just
got you $75,000 you know I don't know
how you got $75,000 but the attorney

[57:01]
how you got $75,000 but the attorney
knows something's wrong because the
attorney's like they just your whole
mortgage company was just shut down
there's no way you could borrow $775,000
so he's like this this guy's doing
fraudulent stuff and she says yes of
course he is and he says you need to
work with the FBI wear a wire against
this

[57:15]
this
guy so she calls me one day and says
listen I got to talk to you the FBI is
asking questions about you and I go what
and she goes yeah I was like um meet me
at the pizza place down the street so
you don't come in my office cuz
everybody knows she's been indicted like
everybody in her office quit when the

[57:30]
everybody in her office quit when the
FBI the FBI shows up and gives you a
business card they announces they're the
FBI everybody quits so I said do not
have do not don't don't come here
because they already know they're
already concerned so I go and I meet her
and Pete and we sit down at the uh at a

[57:45]
and Pete and we sit down at the uh at a
restaurant you know a little Pizzeria
and I sit down and she starts telling me
that the FBI is asking questions about
me and I'm like what are you talking
about like what are they asking she goes
look they came in they took all our
files and like I was like I didn't know
any of this I'm like when did this

[58:00]
any of this I'm like when did this
happen she's like yeah they a couple
weeks ago and they they and they have
some of your files cuz I had closed
several loans for my wife at the time we
were buying rental properties my wife

[58:16]
were buying rental properties my wife
didn't have a job so there there it's
all fraud but I couldn't CL I could not
close those loans in at my mortgage
company because I own the property so
I'm selling those properties I bought
properties renovated them and sold them

[58:31]
properties renovated them and sold them
to my wife to get around something
called seasoning seasoning says you have
to wait 6 months to a year to refinance
at the market value otherwise you if you
want to refinance that's fine but you
have to refinance at the price you
purchased the property at but I bought

[58:45]
purchased the property at but I bought
these properties for 80 or 100,000
renovated them sold them for two 300,000
to my my wife who got a very got didn't
even get a big mortgage we were just
trying to kind of get around around a a
um a guideline so but my wife was not

[59:00]
um a guideline so but my wife was not
working and I provided W2s and pay subs
so when she says all this she says yeah
they're looking at at your the loans you
gave me at at your wife's loans and I
went oh my God I said well you didn't

[59:15]
went oh my God I said well you didn't
tell them that the W2s were fake did you
you didn't tell them the pay stubs were
fake did you you didn't tell them that
the down payments were you didn't tell
them that we were married did you I mean
just absolutely buried myself and as I'm
telling her
this I was like I I I I was like I I

[59:33]
this I was like I I I I was like I I
kind of caught myself and I okay wait
wait wait a minute look okay here's what
you're going to tell them you're going
to tell them you never met her she
called on the phone like I start trying
to devise a plan that will answer their

[59:45]
to devise a plan that will answer their
questions without getting my wife in
trouble or them in trouble and if nobody
cooperates the whole thing should shut
down you know they it doesn't go
anywhere there's no way there's 's
nowhere for them to go if everybody just
kind of stonewalls
them so as I'm saying all

[1:00:01]
them so as I'm saying all
this Gretchen says Matt we can't lie to
the FBI and I go what are you talking
about you're already lying to the FBI I
mean you you you know you you've been
lying to the FBI mean I just refinanced
your house and before I can really say
anything Pete jumps up her husband
stands up and he says we've never lied

[1:00:16]
stands up and he says we've never lied
to the FBI we may not have told them
everything but we've never
lied and I thought
like what what who like who are you
talking to like I know that's not true
so you're not saying that for my

[1:00:30]
so you're not saying that for my
benefit so I was just I kind of look at
him and I'm like what and I just I
remember looking down and and this may
mean nothing but both of their cell
phones were right next to me right and I
remember they were probably just wearing
wires but I just remember thinking those

[1:00:46]
wires but I just remember thinking those
cell phones are microphones they
probably weren't but I remember thinking
oh wow and I just I looked at and I went
wow
and I said well I hope you're going to
get something for this and she
immediately starts crying and she says

[1:01:01]
immediately starts crying and she says
Mt I'm sorry I I have a kid I can't go
to jail do you have kids at that point
yeah I like I have a kid like I have a
kid and I was like wow I wow what have
you learned about friendship from that

[1:01:16]
you learned about friendship from that
like loyalty oh yeah this no there's
that's a that's it's sweet that must
have hurt it's cute I mean I love the
idea of it you don't think that no I'll
tell you why
so I go back to my I go back to my

[1:01:32]
so I go back to my I go back to my
office I remember I told her I said tell
the FBI agent to call me on the phone do
not come in my office so I go back I'm
still trying to figure out how to
weather this right I go back I sit
down phone rings uh my secretary comes

[1:01:45]
down phone rings uh my secretary comes
in and says hey agent I'll never forget
a guy's name agent Scott Gale with the
FBI and I was like okay he on the phone
and she's standing there I was like
close the door like get out and close
she's
like so get on the phone he asked me if

[1:02:00]
like so get on the phone he asked me if
I'll come down I said yeah absolutely
let's schedule it for next Tuesday you I
put it off four or five days um I go to
my brother-in-law immediately who's a
who's a uh a lawyer and he says oh yeah
yeah I don't really tell him exactly
what's going on but I tell him this is

[1:02:16]
what's going on but I tell him this is
what's happening kind of and I'm I may
be in trouble I need a I need a federal
defense attorney I don't even know what
a federal defense I don't even know the
difference but he said you need a
federal defense attorney it's the FBI so
he we go on a couple we meet a couple
lawyers I end up getting a lawyer I give
him like 75 grand um and he started to

[1:02:35]
him like 75 grand um and he started to
have me convinced initially he had me
convinced I was probably going to go to
jail for a few years but really that's
what they kind of do to justify you
giving them $775,000 right and then but

[1:02:47]
giving them $775,000 right and then but
the more I thought about it that you
know and and and read he gave me the
guidelines that that supposedly I had
I had um you know the the fraud that I
had committed and what the guy and the
guidelines that overs saw that um and I

[1:03:01]
guidelines that overs saw that um and I
read it and I was like I'm not really in
trouble here because I'm looking at a
felony but I'm not going to go to jail
because there was no potential for the
bank to lend to lose money
so because I bought the house with like

[1:03:16]
so because I bought the house with like
a hard money loan and then I renovated
it with my own cash and when I sold it
it appraised at
250,000 my my uh ex-wife borrowed like
180 so there's plenty of of equity if

[1:03:30]
180 so there's plenty of of equity if
the whole thing had gone into
foreclosure they still would have got
their money back and to be honest by the
time all of this happened there was only
like three of the three properties it
was like five but we'd already sold a
few and at this point we' just sold
another two there's like one or two
properties left so we're selling at that
moment we were selling them so I I was

[1:03:46]
moment we were selling them so I I was
like no I kind of argue with them but
then he wanted 75 grand I gave him 75
grand and then he comes back and he says
good news there was no potential fraud
so I can get you three years now here's
the thing here's here's what I always
kind of look back

[1:04:00]
kind of look back
at when I first got went into his office
he
said he said listen you haven't been
indicted yet I spoke with the FBI I
spoke with the US
attorney they believe and they've been

[1:04:15]
attorney they believe and they've been
told and he said look they didn't tell
me exactly what they have but they said
with the the evidence that they have on
you based on two confidential informants
that it's you cannot go to trial and I
was like right of course I knew that and

[1:04:30]
was like right of course I knew that and
I was like okay he said
but he said you haven't been indicted
yet and they are fairly certain that
you're running um a mill right a fraud
Mill over there and you guys are
churning out fraudulent loans now they

[1:04:46]
churning out fraudulent loans now they
can't come and they can't come and rage
your office and do anything about it yet
because so far they only have you but
here's what I'm saying is that he Saidi
can keep you from being
indicted it's called um pre-trial it's a

[1:05:00]
indicted it's called um pre-trial it's a
pre-trial
intervention where we go in and what
we'll do what we'll do is you go you
work you go in talk to the FBI you go
grab a bunch of your mortgage broker
most egregious

[1:05:15]
most egregious
files grab them bring those files to the
FBI go work with the FBI they will
indict them
and you will not be indicted and I
said which I I kick myself to this day I

[1:05:32]
said which I I kick myself to this day I
said absolutely not I'm not going to
snitch on them I'm not going to
cooperate I'm not going to you know I'd
seen The Godfather you're not supposed
to cooperate you're supposed to be loyal
I'm not going to do any of that and you

[1:05:46]
I'm not going to do any of that and you
know and and so I say all of
this where you know looking back like I
would have if I could go back back in
time I would have gone into our weekly
meeting with a dolly and I would have
walked in front of everybody and scooped

[1:06:01]
walked in front of everybody and scooped
up two or three of the file cabinets and
put them in the back of a truck and said
listen you guys are going to be talking
to the FBI soon I suggest you get
attorneys and I would have dri driven
off but I didn't I thought no be
loyal you know don't do that and and

[1:06:19]
loyal you know don't do that and and
what happened
was when my when the other thing Falls
right when the next scam falls apart
every one of these people go to the FBI
like they're not even coming to them

[1:06:30]
like they're not even coming to them
these guys are going to the FBI with
lawyers I want to cooperate I want to
tell you what Cox did I want to help I
want to and I'm think like I never had
to get indicted to begin with so you
think that most of these people from
your experience are going to uh

[1:06:45]
your experience are going to uh
sacrifice all integrity that's a funny
word sacrifice sure that applies to this
but
that's they're going to sacrifice
friendships and loyalty for just to save
their own ass yeah that I only had one

[1:07:02]
their own ass yeah that I only had one
person that did not talk to the FBI I
had one person that every time the FBI
or the Secret Service went to that
person's door she said don't come to my
house again I don't have anything to say
about about Matt I have nothing to do

[1:07:16]
about about Matt I have nothing to do
with any of this talk to my lawyer and
this happened over and over again and
that's my ex-wife she's a gangster so
are there people in this world you
trusted or you still
trust I you know the the problem

[1:07:33]
trust I you know the the problem
is eventually I
cooperate
and at the time I didn't want to
cooperate I didn't believe in
cooperation but after seeing how many

[1:07:45]
cooperation but after seeing how many
people cooperate and the way the system
is set up I think that my understanding
of loyalty
is vastly more realistic now and I think

[1:08:00]
is vastly more realistic now and I think
that if you're committing crime if if
you're absolutely like the things I did
I did a bunch of scumbag things you know
I mean I'm not killing people but I'm
doing scumbag things I'm lying cheating
stealing that I'm a thief you know you

[1:08:16]
stealing that I'm a thief you know you
boil down to it that's what I am so you
can't go around behaving like a scumbag
dealing with scumbags and then expect
those same scumbags to
suddenly abide by some kind of a street

[1:08:30]
suddenly abide by some kind of a street
code and not roll over on you you know
and it does happen but it's it's like in
the it's in the 90 percentile of people
that cooperate 90s something percent and
people cooperate when they're not even
looking at any real

[1:08:45]
looking at any real
time so if you're looking at 30 years
and and especially after going to prison
you go to prison and it's like the this
guy's a standup guy over here he got 30
years he could have cooperated against
all of his codefendants but he

[1:09:01]
all of his codefendants but he
didn't nobody comes to see him his wife
divorced him you know his kids ended up
in foster care his you know his his
friends are are are cleaning out his
house nobody puts money on his on his

[1:09:16]
house nobody puts money on his on his
his books nobody comes to see him nobody
answers his phone nothing he took 30
years most of those guys turned around
they end up getting indicted for other
things years later they
cooperate and the best thing this guy's
got going for him is that he can walk

[1:09:31]
got going for him is that he can walk
around and say well he's a stand-up guy
that guy's going to the same halfway
house as me he's probably he's going to
do 30 years where I'm going to do 10
standup guy meaning he never snitched
right and so everybody's seeing
this example and saying well I'm going

[1:09:47]
this example and saying well I'm going
to snitch then but it it sounds like
what people are doing is they're uh
signaling virtue signaling
like there are they would never snitch
and actually do secretly I mean what is

[1:10:00]
and actually do secretly I mean what is
it I I remember I talked to one of the
cosos at the prison one time and he said
uh he said I said shit I said 50% of the
guys here snitched he goes there more
than that he said but listen he go 100%
of them are lying about it he said so do

[1:10:16]
of them are lying about it he said so do
you he goes there's nobody here that's
going to tell you they they snitched
nobody so there's guys tons of tons of
them that cooperate if 8 90% of of um
defendants cooperate you know you start
doing the math and you if you you ask 10

[1:10:31]
doing the math and you if you you ask 10
guys in prison all of them say I didn't
I didn't cooperate I didn't cooperate I
didn't cooperate like okay you ask a 100
I didn't cooperate nobody's going to say
I cooperated does that break your heart
a little
bit that people backstab each other like
this it it does it does

[1:10:48]
this it it does it does
but you know I have such a low opinion
of people you know what I'm saying like
I don't expect it's not that I I don't
like people it's that I just don't
expect anything of them you know I don't
expect you to look out for me you know

[1:11:01]
expect you to look out for me you know
there was a time when I did I thought I
look out for you you should look out for
me but I just don't expect that anymore
see but I think
Humanity flourishes because there is a
lot of people out there that do the
thing that is difficult to do in terms

[1:11:15]
thing that is difficult to do in terms
of Integrity that may be but these these
aren't people with Integrity these are
criminals if these were decent human
beings and all of them will tell you
well why'd you do that oh you know I was
a drug addict or I I needed the money
well if you were if you were a decent

[1:11:30]
well if you were if you were a decent
human being you would have gotten off
the drugs you would have gone and gotten
three jobs you can work 80 hours a week
I've done it you can work 84 85 88 you
can work 90 hours a week you can do that
oh I did it for my kids no you're lazy
you could have worked three jobs for

[1:11:45]
you could have worked three jobs for
your kids instead you decided to sell
methampetamine well I was I was addicted
you could have gotten off me it wasn't
important it was the easy way out you're
not someone with Integrity so for you to
sit there and say hey I'm going to act
like a scumbag but now I got caught or

[1:12:00]
like a scumbag but now I got caught or
you got caught and I don't want you to
tell on me well you're a guy that robs
Banks you stick guns in people's faces
you kidnap people you torture people you
sell drugs you're not you're not a moral
ethical person but you want you want

[1:12:16]
ethical person but you want you want
everybody else to hold up to some
ethical code while while you're robbing
grandma that's not right like you know
so you know I I get I get the whole Omar
code you know and there was a mo there
was a time when I was you know

[1:12:31]
was a time when I was you know
delusional enough to believe
that
but you know after you go through after
going through it no and after going
through it multiple times
no I have to really think about that and

[1:12:47]
no I have to really think about that and
I deeply appreciate your honesty on
this okay
I I think
um I

[1:13:01]
mean there's all kinds of criminals in
this world and they all have all kinds
of stories and your story is one
of I don't know if it came from
desperation versus a

[1:13:16]
desperation versus a
love of this kind of
game right like it it wasn't part of it
an attraction to the the creative aspect
of this of breaking the rules when

[1:13:32]
of this of breaking the rules when
nobody else can and you figure out a way
to do
it I think I think initially it was I
needed the money like that's the first
thing you know you say oh okay well I

[1:13:45]
thing you know you say oh okay well I
need and if you ask most gu oh well man
I needed the money you need the money
but and then I I I definitely needed the
money
but then you get $50,000 in your bank
and then you get a 100 and then it's 200

[1:14:00]
and then you get a 100 and then it's 200
and then it's half a million and then
it's a million and what the hell are you
still committing fraud for you've got
half a million or a million dollars in
the bank or worth of real estate or
you've you're making $10,000 a month
just in rental income why are you still

[1:14:15]
just in rental income why are you still
committing fraud so it turn I think it
morphs
into the creativity in part for me and
and too it was a chance for me to prove
to everybody how smart I was you know I

[1:14:30]
to everybody how smart I was you know I
mean it was done out of desperation
initially and then it just turned into
pure narcissistic arrogance look at me
look at how I can do things that nobody
else can do look how smart I am I just

[1:14:45]
else can do look how smart I am I just
walked into Bank of America handed them
seven documents that were all fraudulent
and they cut me a check for
$250,000 like wow I'm amazing you know
and guess what they're never going to
get their check and they they won't know

[1:15:00]
get their check and they they won't know
even know where to start to try and find
the person because they're looking for a
phantom so you know and you feel great I
felt great I used to say I I felt like I
felt like James Bond I felt like 007 it
was amazing and you know and it did it

[1:15:15]
was amazing and you know and it did it
it feeded my need to feel important you
know even if it it it was it was even if
that was a lie cuz all that success was
just a
lie well no you were good at it it was

[1:15:31]
lie well no you were good at it it was
good at it but it was it's not it was
illegal it's not like I'm Elon Musk you
know what I'm saying like there's it's
not like you're an ex I'm an exceptional
human I'm an exceptional human being at
a horrific thing at at committing fraud

[1:15:45]
a horrific thing at at committing fraud
well the question is how many people are
getting hurt because uh initially the
thing is initially nobody got hurt
that's the thing nobody ever lost any
money directly like I didn't go and say
give me $50,000 and I ran off with your

[1:16:00]
give me $50,000 and I ran off with your
money like I wasn't doing that and that
was a great
justification but at some point and
we'll get into that you know I take off
on the run and people do lose money I I
didn't take that money directly and for
some reason in
my you

[1:16:16]
my you
know sick mind or whatever the case may
be that seems like a distinction to me
that makes me feel okay is that I never
said give me 300 give me $10,000 and I
ran off with it but I put people in a

[1:16:30]
ran off with it but I put people in a
position
where
I damaged the credit or damaged the the
title to their
house and they had to go get a lawyer to
fix that you know and and so that they

[1:16:46]
fix that you know and and so that they
had to go pay a lawyer $110,000 so I
absolutely caused that person did I said
to me to you're a victim and I owe you
that money and it was a shitty thing to
do because even at the time I was like
oh they'll make a couple phone calls
it'll be fine it wasn't fine and if I

[1:17:01]
it'll be fine it wasn't fine and if I
had really put any thought into it at
all I would have known it it's going to
it's going to really affect these people
and those people had done nothing
wrong with the exception
of trusting me they rented me their

[1:17:15]
of trusting me they rented me their
house or they owner financ their house
they made the mistake of bumping into me
and now they owe $10,000 $20,000
you know and and I'm sure a ton of
Anguish so what happened when you were

[1:17:30]
Anguish so what happened when you were
caught that first time so I was caught I
got three years probation you know I
took the probation what does that
involve initially it
was it was such a slap on the hand on

[1:17:45]
was it was such a slap on the hand on
the wrist were you allowed to still
practice okay so I wasn't I had to I
couldn't own the mortgage company
anymore mhm that was a good question cuz
like you would think you know wouldn't
it be great if I could keep on going um
but what they said was you know you you
have to forfeit your your brokerage um

[1:18:02]
have to forfeit your your brokerage um
your broker's license and your brokerage
business license and what I did was I I
transferred my brokerage business
license to a guy that essentially bought
my
business they allowed me to work as a

[1:18:16]
business they allowed me to work as a
consultant in the mortgage industry you
know cuz they went you know they go my
my lawyer goes to the judge and says
what else can he do so
um and so I have a a friend nam's Dave

[1:18:31]
um and so I have a a friend nam's Dave
Walker he was a CPA he came in and he
bought my business and he paid me like
$9,000 a month and that covered my bills
uh my wife and I got divorced so she's
my ex-wife

[1:18:46]
my ex-wife
and I I don't know what to do right like
I don't I'm I could you know and I
always say you know I could have like
you know you look back and it's like I
could have claimed
bankruptcy um I could have moved into my
parents spare room you know something

[1:19:00]
parents spare room you know something
like that but you know cuz I had I had I
lost everything in my divorce um I had
huge child support payment um you know
not that that has anything to do like
with my my ex-wife like I absolutely
signed up for that like I wanted to pay

[1:19:15]
signed up for that like I wanted to pay
that um but it was it was it was a chunk
of change you know so we're talking
about a couple thousand a month for you
know for child support um she got all of
the apartments that we had we had about
a million million and a half dollar

[1:19:31]
a million million and a half dollar
worth of Apartments which isn't a lot
now but that's probably five or6 million
now so she got all the apartments so she
got everything so now I'm sitting here
like I got I can't be a mortgage broker
I can get my $9,000 but I have to help
this guy run this company train people

[1:19:46]
this guy run this company train people
do that sort of thing so what I decided
to do was I was going to start flipping
houses legitimately or not well
initially I thought about doing it um
legitimately right but at the same time
I was also in the middle of figuring out

[1:20:02]
I was also in the middle of figuring out
how to make these synthetic
identities so I'm making the payments
every month remember two months in three
month no no credit scores no credit
scores no credit scores and I'm also
saying I'm going to go I'm going to
start buying houses renovate them sell

[1:20:16]
start buying houses renovate them sell
them so to the the truth is we actually
renovated probably one house completely
I remember it was on 26th Street we
renovated the house completely on the
outside in and the inside yeah outside
inside it's done it's good okay great um

[1:20:31]
inside it's done it's good okay great um
me and me and this guy actually Dave
Dave Walker the guy that bought my
business so we renovate it and it just
so happens at the same time I go to pull
credit one day and wow 700 Plus credit
scores and I

[1:20:45]
scores and I
went we don't have to sell this thing at
all like we just we just I can sell it
and put it in this guy name and let him
refinance it and so that's what we did
we ended up I ended up selling it to
this synthetic identity do you remember
the first synthetic identity the name

[1:21:02]
the first synthetic identity the name
the first one was a Joel cologne yeah
and then I started getting creative
because the ones after that I started
naming so I had like Joel cologne and an
Allan Duncan but then I I do you
remember the movie Reservoir

[1:21:16]
remember the movie Reservoir
Dogs so I I started naming the
characters after guys in the reservoir
dog so I I had a I had a a James red you
know I had a like a Michael White a Lee
black MH I had a um William blue David

[1:21:32]
black MH I had a um William blue David
silver uh Brandon green so then I start
developing these guys now I thought oh
forget those those normal names I'm
going with these with the reservoir dogs
and I thought I was so cute too you
think in retrospect that was a mistake

[1:21:45]
think in retrospect that was a mistake
it was so stupid that was just it's
there's so many things so many mistakes
I made I
mean within the fraud there are mistakes
I made but you know other than just the
overall committing fraud but it was just
like I thought it was so cute and then
you know you get in front of the judge

[1:22:00]
you know you get in front of the judge
and the judge is hearing about the
reservoir dogs and Mr Mr Green and Mr
Black Mr White Mr this Mr that and he's
looking at me just like you jackass like
and you know what am I saying I'm like
yeah I thought that was cute um you know
but nothing's cute so you know plus I'm

[1:22:16]
but nothing's cute so you know plus I'm
making fake Banks what's the purpose of
the fake Banks well sometimes you have
to have your down payment in the bank
right so you have they have to they want
three months worth of bank statements to
see that hey he's got his $50,000 in the
bank and then the more the more

[1:22:31]
bank and then the more the more
properties you buy they want start to
want to see what's called reserves they
want to make sure that you can pay all
your mortgage
payments if this guy loses his job can
this guy maintain all these mortgage
payments for the next six months and see

[1:22:45]
payments for the next six months and see
they do that and they think you're going
to go you know oh no he can't do it they
go well then we won't lend it well when
they do that to me I go of course I do
of course he's got it let me send you
over the bank uh bank statements oh you
want to call the bank call them so
there's a phone number there's a website

[1:23:01]
there's a phone number there's a website
yes you can call we'll get on there I'll
I'll do the
whole you know and uh hold on okay uh
what's the name again oh do you have the
account
number hold on you wait a little bit you
know you come back oh okay I got to here

[1:23:15]
know you come back oh okay I got to here
I I can't tell you the exact amount
right now but what is the what what was
his balance last month and the Daya oh
yep y That's it exactly okay thank than
you click would you do different voices
or would you be no I've done different
voices or I just have somebody else do
it you know Gretchen would have done it
or um or one of the Brokers Susan would

[1:23:32]
or um or one of the Brokers Susan would
have done one of the Brokers that worked
for me or you know Kelly or Johnny moon
I I have so many guys and you know they
just get on the phone they do it because
they're all doing something fraud and
we're all working together so hey I need
you to call this guy I need to call this

[1:23:45]
you to call this guy I need to call this
guy and verify this and say what I'm I'm
at the bank okay I'm at the bank okay
cool and they call back and do this feel
like an organized system or was it it
more improv just like dealing with the
different situations the government
would definitely say it was organized I
would say it was you know you're a bunch

[1:24:00]
would say it was you know you're a bunch
of you're just a bunch of guys you know
to you know it's you're joking around
with everybody and you're you're helping
each other and it's not like everybody's
you know kicking up the Tommy yeah you
know so so and then all these new
puzzles come up and you figure out way

[1:24:15]
puzzles come up and you figure out way
to these puzzles you go in and you say
hey I've got I've got this loan I need
to get this loan this guy's trying to
buy this house and I need loan that
looks like this where can we go and by
the way they cannot they cannot order a
copy of his tax returns so you don't

[1:24:30]
copy of his tax returns so you don't
want to have to sign What's called the
4506 so they're like okay listen so and
so's got a program that you know and you
go back and for but you have to have
this much in reserves but you got the
bank right yeah yeah I got the bank I
could do that you know so you you go in
and you throw it out there to five or
six guys and you're going to come up

[1:24:45]
six guys and you're going to come up
with an answer so you're on probation
here just uh to
self-reflect did you start start doing
this while on probation because of the
money or because it gave you
meaning God I you know I mean part a big

[1:25:02]
meaning God I you know I mean part a big
part of that the reason is I I did not
want to move back in with my parents and
I didn't want my father to see me
struggling and I didn't want him

[1:25:15]
struggling and I didn't want him
to it
was my success he had no idea My Success
had been the first time he'd ever really
been proud of me does that financial
success yes at which point when was the
first time you told him you did

[1:25:30]
first time you told him you did
something he was like you could sense
him being proud oh when I became a
mortgage broker when I when I became a
mortgage broker and I went to work for
the company and what we're talking about
within a week I got a client three days
later I got a client a week later got a
client two days later got a client like
I closed four loans my first month and

[1:25:47]
I closed four loans my first month and
my dad was like well well how much money
are you going to make and I'm like oh
I'm charging this much this I got a
point on the back I got this I boom I'm
thinking I'm going to walk home after
taxes like 10
11,000 Jesus God Almighty you know are

[1:26:02]
11,000 Jesus God Almighty you know are
you Ser well well we'll see don't start
counting your chickens before that you
know and and then you know two whatever
three weeks later four weeks later you
know boom I got a check it's like $9,000
or something or and then you know the

[1:26:15]
or something or and then you know the
next month it's 12 and the next month
it's 16 and you know then they make me a
manager and you know um it just he
didn't know any of it was illegitimate
no he thinks he thinks my son he's
brilliant you know he's great he's

[1:26:30]
brilliant you know he's great he's
wonderful I I had you know was certainly
not proud of me prior to that um but you
know my dad was athletic he was
extremely bright I mean
brilliant and I was a kid who had to be

[1:26:48]
brilliant and I was a kid who had to be
put into special schools who barely
gradu uated High
School who ended up going to college and
getting a degree in Fine Arts because I
was never going to be able to get a
degree in Business it wasn't going to

[1:27:01]
degree in Business it wasn't going to
happen so when I graduated college I
remember with the the degree in Fine
Arts he said the best you'll the best
thing you could do with that is maybe
you could draw caricatures at Disney
World you know what I'm saying which

[1:27:15]
World you know what I'm saying which
wasn't a compliment but it wasn't like
hey you could
draw um so yeah he you know and then I
turned around and I I tried to go to
work for State Farm insurance which is
who he worked for he worked for them for
like 40 something years and I failed the

[1:27:30]
like 40 something years and I failed the
aptitude test so then I went and worked
for another insurance company and I was
a an insurance adjuster but I couldn't
keep up with the workload then I end up
working construction I'm still barely
paying my bills you know that's
basically where my dad felt like that's
that's you know he was polite to me you

[1:27:47]
that's you know he was polite to me you
know we was we were you know cordial but
yeah I wasn't I I I think he felt he
deserved a better kid so well when you
when you started doing mortgages that's
when he was like of course he was like

[1:28:01]
when he was like of course he was like
this kid's got something I'm driving I'm
driving a new I got it just pulled in in
a new car and I got a I just bought a
house that was you know four or five
blocks away from his house from where I
grew up from where he lives you know
lived at that time you

[1:28:16]
lived at that time you
know six blocks away from where my
sister's married to her lawyer husband
mhm like I'm doing pretty good and then
within 3 months we bought you know we're
my new wife we buy a um a quadplex and

[1:28:33]
my new wife we buy a um a quadplex and
then we're buying a Triplex and another
quadplex and a 10 unit and a duplex and
another duplex and a quadplex and it's
like what the hell is going on this guy
is blowing up he's going on vacation
here and vacation here and you know so

[1:28:46]
here and vacation here and you know so
he you know and so when when when the
FBI comes in they indict me and I I take
the three years probation like I mean
the probably the worst thing in the
world you know other than going to
prison would have been just having to
just sell everything and go move in and
start over and sell used cars not that

[1:29:01]
start over and sell used cars not that
there's anything wrong with selling used
cars but I just felt like you know I
just didn't want to disappoint him any
more than I already had so I thought I'm
going to flip houses and then I'll start
maybe a development company so I'll buy

[1:29:15]
maybe a development company so I'll buy
some vacant lots and all this and that
the problem
is these houses I'm buy them for 50,000
if I fix them up and sell them maybe I
make 20 25,000 and then you got to find
a a a qualified borrower it's very hard
to find a qualified

[1:29:30]
to find a qualified
borrower that wants to live in ebore
City back then it's I still think it's
rough but those same houses are going
for three and 400,000 so you know I'm
buying houses I got I got to get
qualified borrowers I have do all the

[1:29:45]
qualified borrowers I have do all the
renovations it's it's a nightmare you
know and if I you know looking back back
it's like okay well then you got to bite
the bullet it's just what you have to do
I didn't want to do that I didn't want
to do it whether it was laziness or I

[1:30:00]
to do it whether it was laziness or I
don't know you know I just thought I'm
good at this I'm going to run I'm just
going to start running a scam I'm going
to figure out how to drive the prices up
buy the houses for 50 record them at
200,000 and then have these synthetic
identities buy all the properties
refinance them pull out the cash make

[1:30:17]
refinance them pull out the cash make
six months worth of payments let them
all go into foreclosure and that really
really started working
well very well I had one time where I
had a guy it was James red the synthetic

[1:30:30]
had a guy it was James red the synthetic
identity was James red and he had bought
two or three houses and there was
somebody at the office who was friends
of somebody who knew the title company
where we were closing the
loans and he called that her her name

[1:30:45]
loans and he called that her her name
was Mary and said
Mary this guy James red like Cox is
doing something Shady James red does
doesn't even exist she goes and looks at
the file her last couple files and and
she realizes of course obviously like

[1:31:00]
she realizes of course obviously like
this guy never showed up she remembers
Cox picked up the files like and he's
saying he doesn't exist so she freaks
out she calls the mortgage broker
mortgage broker calls me mortgage broker
calls me up and says listen Mary said
she's not closing the next loan unless

[1:31:16]
she's not closing the next loan unless
James red shows up and I went wow that's
a that's a tough one and she's like okay
so what do you want to do do you want to
go to another Title Company like we're
supposed to close in like three days two
three days I said well he's going to
have to show up then I said I'm I'll

[1:31:30]
have to show up then I said I'm I'll
figure it out like give me a couple days
give let me figure this out and she's
like okay well I don't know how that's
going to happen he doesn't exist keep
mind at this point I don't need IDs I
don't need a real ID I mean I I can I
figured out how to kind of make a real
ID right like I could make one I could

[1:31:46]
ID right like I could make one I could
take sandpaper and sand off the
information on a regular ID and then I
would print
the the corrected information in reverse
on a piece of um transparency and I
would glue it over there and you could

[1:32:00]
would glue it over there and you could
still see the Holograms and stuff it
actually worked pretty good I don't a
cop's not going to it's not going to
pass mustard with a cop but somebody at
the bank like I was able to go in and I
would open a bank account with
it
well
so one of the things I had done when I

[1:32:16]
so one of the things I had done when I
was closing these loans was I would go
online and I would
pick you have to pick a photo of
somebody right to put on the on the
driver's license right so I'm not making
a fake ID for all these guys because I

[1:32:31]
a fake ID for all these guys because I
don't need a fake ID for all these guys
not with my picture on it but I need a
fake I need I need a copy of an ID but I
need a picture where do I get the
picture so I go to Hillsboro County's
arrest website and I would find people

[1:32:45]
arrest website and I would find people
that I knew that had been
arrested and so I found a guy
named uh Eric tamargo who had been
arrested he had like I don't know what
it was the DUI or domestic violence I
forget what it was but there was a

[1:33:00]
forget what it was but there was a
picture of him so I print out the
picture I cut it up I paste it onto uh a
driver's license and I make a copy of it
you know for for James red that's what
I've been giving the title people when I
would close I'd sign all the documents
and I'd leave them that copy so that it

[1:33:16]
and I'd leave them that copy so that it
looked like they made a copy for of the
of it and then they would notarize all
the documents even though they never
seen this person they have a copy of his
driver's license everything's signed Cox
said he signed it it's good notorized
here's your
check so what I do is I think let me see

[1:33:30]
check so what I do is I think let me see
if I can get Eric to do this he's been
to I knew he'd been to prison before so
I call up Eric and I remember one of my
buddies like he's never gonna do this
and I was like I I think he will I think
he will so and that's how and that's

[1:33:46]
he will so and that's how and that's
really that kind of like you think what
do you think let me try let me call him

conversations you're having like it but
really looking back love to hear the the
opener few sentences that you have with
him I got I can tell you exactly what I

[1:34:01]

like he that's a big favor I said it is
a big favor I could be in a lot of
trouble and I said I I know and he goes
well wait a
minute he goes I can't go he said you

[1:35:47]
minute he goes I can't go he said you
have to give these people a driver's
license you said the driver's license is
you were you you were using mug shots
she you said she's closed a couple of
these she already she's seen this guy's

when you were arrested a couple years
ago and he jumps up and he goes you
motherfucker and I oh I said Eric I said
wait a minute I said hold on hold on I
said listen I said I only did that
because I knew if it came down to this

[1:36:16]
because I knew if it came down to this
moment you were the only person that I
knew that could pull this off that have
the balls to walk in and do it
and he sat there and he
went yeah you're right you're right and
I mean I I bro I I I couldn't believe he
fell listen this guy would beat the

[1:36:31]
fell listen this guy would beat the
breaks off me he was he's like 510 5'11
he's boxed he's a big guy yeah so you
know it's like I've weathered that part
of the storm and he sat there and he
goes right right and he goes well I'm
not doing it for free I'm not doing it

[1:36:45]
not doing it for free I'm not doing it
for nothing I said no bro of course not
I mean what you know what he's like
you're making a lot of money I said well
keep in mind a lot of that money goes
back in the prop property it's not like
we're walking away with you know I think
I said like tens of thousands we're
really walking away with hundreds of
thousands it's not like we're walking
away with a bunch of money or you know

[1:37:00]
away with a bunch of money or you know
it's you know we got to put that we got
to buy more properties we got to keep it
going we got to make the payments you I
know but still I could get in a lot of
trouble I said I understand bro I go
what do you want and I remember thinking
if he asked for more than like 10 or
15,000 like I'll just I'll do it myself
we'll just change title companies and

[1:37:17]
we'll just change title companies and
we'll go and I'll I'll do it myself and
he sat there and he went
I want
$500 and I went $500 listen I almost
started laughing I mean I was like I put
my hand over I was like $500 yeah it's

[1:37:32]
my hand over I was like $500 yeah it's
it's it's going to take you 30 minutes
and he's like he's like I don't care bro
I get in a lot of trouble I was like oh
well yeah I'm not paying you now you got
to sign first and he's like oh you know
I'll sign I'll sign I know you're good
for it I but he for 500 bucks I made a

[1:37:45]
for it I but he for 500 bucks I made a
fake ID for him he goes in to the place
he signs James red
comes out what was even you know what
was funny about that was when we walked
into the title company we're sitting in
the in the lobby and Mary comes walking

[1:38:00]
the in the lobby and Mary comes walking
out she looks at me she goes Mr Cox I
don't know why you're here she goes I
told Kelly that was the broker she goes
I I told the broker that I'm not closing
the loan unless unless um James red
shows up and Eric stands up on que and
he goes I'm James red and she was

[1:38:17]
he goes I'm James red and she was
like and she goes hold on a second she
runs in the back comes back with a file
opens it up looks at the picture and
she's like oh I'm I'm so sorry uh give
me five minutes I'll I'll uh I've got
the file I prints up the docs he goes in

[1:38:30]
the file I prints up the docs he goes in
signs and when we're there she's passing
out the checks 5,000 here 25,000 here
35,000 here 7,000 here 6,000 here so he
sees all these checks and I'm like oh I
I got that I the construction company no

[1:38:45]
I got that I the construction company no
no no I have that I'm I'll take care of
that I'll take care of that so I get all
the checks and I leave we go sit in my
Audi and uh he sits down he's like bro
there's a lot of money a lot of that
money goes back in the properties Eric
and he's like ah still bro and I said um

[1:39:00]
and he's like ah still bro and I said um
and I counted out 500 bucks but listen a
week later we had another
closing so I he comes in I said hey bro
he hey what's going on and I said uh I
need you to do the the James red thing
he goes yeah I've been thinking about

[1:39:15]
he goes yeah I've been thinking about
that I did that way too cheap I said I
get it man well how much do you want
what do you want
and I'm thinking if if it's if it's more
than 10 or 15 I'll do it myself and he
sits there and he
goes I want $1,000 I got

[1:39:31]
goes I want $1,000 I got
$1,000 like oh my God so uh I gave him
$1,000 and we he did another one and um
but by that point it was like five or
six we done five or six with that guy
and after five or six plus the credit
cards plus you know all the other things

[1:39:47]
cards plus you know all the other things
like their credit scores start dropping
you know if it was 700 now it's down to
like 600 and at 600 you couldn't really
borrow enough to make it worth it it's
like and I have other people in the
wings waiting so um you know we would

[1:40:00]
wings waiting so um you know we would
just we I'd go out and I i' run up the
credit cards and and pull as much money
pull all the money out of the out of the
banks and close the accounts and then
stop paying and you said a lot of people
knew so he was one of the people and
that he was one of the people why do you

[1:40:16]
that he was one of the people why do you
think nobody said anything I well I mean
I think everybody was making money the
appraiser at that time I had an
appraiser eventually I ordered appraisal
software and I just start doing the
appraisal of myself like why give this
guy 500 bucks um so so you were doing

[1:40:30]
guy 500 bucks um so so you were doing
the appraisal yourself how's that
possible how's that is there a check
against is there there is that's funny
nobody ever questions that you actually
have to have a license to get the
appraisal software so I get an

[1:40:45]
appraisal software so I get an
appraisers that we're working with I get
her
license and I
I I uh create a um an email address as
her uh so it was a synthetic appraiser
right it was a real person but I end up

[1:41:01]
right it was a real person but I end up
ordering the appraisal software by
by um emailing uh it was called Alamo
Alamo appraisal software so uh I end up
emailing them as her and they go well we
can't give you we can't sell you the

[1:41:15]
can't give you we can't sell you the
software unless we we need a copy of
your license boom here's your license so
I send her the I send uh then the
license and then we paid for it with a
credit card you know you could go get
like a Green Dot card you go put 500
bucks on it or a th000 the software was
like 1,500 bucks or something so you

[1:41:31]
like 1,500 bucks or something so you
pick give like back then you know a long
time ago so 1,500 bucks they mail it to
us and now I've got the software so now
I can you know I can do the appraisals
myself what stops you from appraising it
not for 200,000 but even more there's no

[1:41:45]
not for 200,000 but even more there's no
comparable sales so no matter what you
sent to the bank they're going to look
at it like they're going to to have a
their appra in-house appraiser is going
to do a a Desktop review he's going to
go online he's going to check to make
sure all the apprais all of the
comparable sales are sold for what you

[1:42:03]
comparable sales are sold for what you
said they sold for are the same square
footage were built what the pictures
look like where how far they are he's
going to double check everything but you
know he's some guy who's on salary and
he does you know whatever 40 or 50 of
these a day or something it doesn't take

[1:42:15]
these a day or something it doesn't take
them long and so it's cheaper that way
where we pay for the appraiser appraisal
the whole thing got it so everybody's
getting paid right and so at at this
point I'm I'm doing that right you know
and I'm getting caught periodically can

[1:42:30]
and I'm getting caught periodically can
you give an example what do you mean
getting caught I'm living in Tampa
Heights which is right next to ebore
city in Tampa right so this is all these
are all like little suburbs of Tampa and
they're all built back in the
1920s right 1890s 1910 1920 so I'm I've

[1:42:46]
1920s right 1890s 1910 1920 so I'm I've
I bought this 8un building I renovated
it into a Triplex I'm I mean I'm driving
an Audi I'm dating a a a woman that I
should not have been dating like I mean
I don't know what she was thinking um so

[1:43:00]
I don't know what she was thinking um so
I'm you know I'm going on vacations like
everything Life's good so but every once
in a while you know like where you know
where things happen you get a phone call
hey this is what just happened and I one
time I got a phone call from same broker
Kelly Kelly called me up and said listen

[1:43:16]
Kelly Kelly called me up and said listen
we got a problem this
was
I want to say this was Allan Duncan this
was one of the first ones that I had
done right we used him but uh and so he
so she calls me up and says

[1:43:31]
so she calls me up and says
listen
Allan Duncan never made his first
mortgage payment and I had a friend of
mine or one of my
codefendants when we

[1:43:45]
codefendants when we
closed on that
loan we both got checks for whatever 40
or 50 Grand keep in mind we're also
buying some of this money is going into
a business account we're buying property
we're bu so it's not like I'm pocketing
hundreds of thousands of dollars or even

[1:44:01]
hundreds of thousands of dollars or even
you know even 20 or $30,000 on every
closing I'm more like I'm getting 25 10
20 and this guy's getting 10 and this
guy's getting 15 and then we're to
taking 60 and we're putting it into the
business account we're buying a bunch of

[1:44:15]
business account we're buying a bunch of
vacant Lots or we're building some new
houses so we're trying to kind of take
all this and turn it into to a
development company M um but we still
have to pay our bills so you know my
buddy's got to go to he's got to go to
Amsterdam at least for two weeks you
know right he's from Belgium that's you

years and I and so I mean I'm just like
and by the way the appra uh the broker
is there MH and my buddy Rudy is there
and I mean they're he's pacing the room
she's in tears crying like there and I'm

[1:48:47]
she's in tears crying like there and I'm
like okay well fellas I said where's
this headed where's this going what are
we doing and and they so they're they're
kind of chuckling and joking about it
mhm and I remember being like thinking
what's the deal

[1:49:00]
what's the deal
like it's weird and I said look why
don't I
just let me just pay you back they said
ah we we we'll get the money we're not
worried about I said you don't seem
worried about the money about getting
any of the money back like don't why
don't you just let me I'll cut you a
check I can get you the money back like
what do I I owed him like 150 or

[1:49:16]
what do I I owed him like 150 or
something I forget exactly it was
nothing I'm like I owe you 150,000 let
me cut your check for
50,000 and they were like no no you know
that's uh uh we'll get the money back
when we foreclose on the property and
that's what I was like

[1:49:30]
that's what I was like
oh they think the property is worth like
$195,000 or something and I went oh I
said I understand okay I said do you
have the appraisal in front of you and
they were like yeah and I said open it
up I said take a look at comp number one

[1:49:46]
up I said take a look at comp number one
that's owned by a guy named you know Lee
Black M comp number two you know is
owned by you know whatever David silver
whatever the names were and I'm like you
know like black silver red I said I am

[1:50:02]
know like black silver red I said I am
all those people and I said let me tell
you what I've done and I tell them just
lay it out boom bo boom boom
boom I said so you can call the FBI but
you're not going to get all your money
back or you can let me give you your

[1:50:16]
back or you can let me give you your
money
back and we can let this we let sleeping
dogs lie the whole thing goes away I
apologize you know I had every intention
of making all the payments it's a glitch
you caught me no my bad and so these

[1:50:32]
you caught me no my bad and so these
guys are just like oh my God like now
they're they put me on hold they're
looking through the file they come back
and I remember at some point we go back
forth back forth and finally they come
back and they said listen you still have
the money I said yeah well first they

[1:50:45]
the money I said yeah well first they
come back they threaten me oh well when
the F we give us to to the FBI you and I
said that's not true I said the money
was deposited into a bank account it has
since been moved the bank account bank
account has been closed it's been
removed in cash that money is gone you
will never see that money I will be

[1:51:00]
will never see that money I will be
cutting you if I pay you back at all
it'll be from another account and so the
FBI agent ends up saying he's right even
if we caught him red-handed the
likelihood that any of these funds will
be ever be recouped is is zero like

[1:51:15]
be ever be recouped is is zero like
there's almost no money's ever recouped
and so we end up uh they put me on hold
again they come back and they go how
quickly can you get us a cashier
check and I go like that day I go get
them a cashier check overnight the

[1:51:30]
them a cashier check overnight the
cashier check they never called the FBI
they never did anything now at that
point we actually ditched that whole
that uh James or Allan Duncan I remember
at that point we went to the mall ran up
all the credit cards and just threw
everything away and walked away because

[1:51:47]
everything away and walked away because
it was shot you know that whole that guy
was shot I think we borrowed whatever
$800,000 or 900,000 in his name so with
the banks it's really really all about
the money that listen when I go on the
run I got one where I was caught so

[1:52:00]
run I got one where I was caught so
red-handed
it's it's insane how how bad it was and
and listen that's not that's nothing I I
got caught by um uh Washington Mutual
one time I was caught by Washington
Mutual where we had done six owner
occupied

[1:52:16]
occupied
duplexes so if you say you're going to
live in a house you can get about 95%
financing but if it's an investment
property you got to put down 20% you get
about 80% financing
so a buddy of mine who was a sheriff's

[1:52:31]
so a buddy of mine who was a sheriff's
deputy we had his wife
by I'm going to say six owner occupied
duplexes saying she lived in every
single one of
them well you can't owner occupy six

[1:52:46]
them well you can't owner occupy six
dwellings like it that's fraud now now
granted her W2s and pay subs were
correct but she didn't put the down
payments down even the down payments we
didn't put down we actually got cash
back but months later we the they called
the a lawyer

[1:53:01]
the a lawyer
from um Washington Mutual ends up
calling uh the mortgage broker and
saying that they ended up with two of
the owner occupied duplexes
because Washington Mutual had a credit

[1:53:18]
because Washington Mutual had a credit
line extended to one of the lenders
who'd lend the money so it actually was
Washington Mutual so it was a couple
months later when they went to sell sell
it and a you know they packaged them
together and sell them they realize we
have the same customer with two duplexes

[1:53:31]
have the same customer with two duplexes
side by side both owner occupied this is
fraud so she comes in she tells me oh my
gosh this lawyer's on the phone this is
what happened I'm like oh wow this is
horrible I end up getting on the phone
with him we have a huge we have a
conversation and I'm like you know he's

[1:53:46]
conversation and I'm like you know he's
like look you know this is a big deal we
could call the FBI I'm like look who
knows who was involved in this maybe
somebody on your side was involved maybe
somebody on my side I don't know what my
mortgage broker did I'll deal with her
on my own why don't you just let us
refinance the properties not only did we

[1:54:01]
refinance the properties not only did we
talk him into refin allowing us to
refinance the properties he gave us a
reduced um a reduced balance of what we
owed him because we couldn't we couldn't
borrow enough to pay them off so they

[1:54:17]
borrow enough to pay them off so they
took like a $20,000 hit just to
refinance those properties never called
the FBI never did any was absolutely
fraud MH I had I had a broker one time
we got called with over a million

[1:54:30]
we got called with over a million
dollars in loans that he had done that
were
fraudulent Pinnacle Bangor which was out
of Chicago the owner called me and he
was like look your mortgage broker did
this like it was a bunch of uh canceled
checks they were fake canceled checks so

[1:54:46]
checks they were fake canceled checks so
they looked like they had run through
the bank for the somebody's rent mhm
but they hadn't does that make sense
like you pay your rent they deposit it
it goes to the bank and they've got all
the numbers and everything well I had a
bunch that were blank that all you had
to do was fill out your your borrower

[1:55:01]
to do was fill out your your borrower
information and then you cut and pasted
his full his name and his address at the
upper leftand corner you make a copy of
it it looks like canceled checks we had
24 of them well my one of my Brokers was
using them for all of his files like
even if the person really had a rental

[1:55:16]
even if the person really had a rental
history he didn't want to order it he
just did this it was easier faster yeah
yeah just an idiot wow so they catch a
million dollars worth of loans they call
me up and then they caught another
million but they had already sold them
to Household Bank so while I'm on the

[1:55:32]
to Household Bank so while I'm on the
phone with the the owner his name is
Gary and we're talking he's like look
this is what we found this is this this
is what happened and I remember I said
um Gary at the end of this conversation
if you think I'm cutting you a check for
a million dollars I said I just don't
have it you don't have it this was when

[1:55:46]
have it you don't have it this was when
I owned the mortgage company and he says
uh
no I what I'm I'm asking you for your
word that if any of
these come back on us they're in Florida
they're in your area you'll help us get

[1:56:00]
they're in your area you'll help us get
rid of the properties you'll we'll
foreclose we're going to have to resell
them I don't want to be flying down
there just help us get rid of them I
said absolutely of course no problem I
said what about the I said well what are
you going to do with them he goes well
they're going to be a part of a a
package like a $3 million package we're

[1:56:15]
package like a $3 million package we're
selling to Household Bank the other ones
they had caught had already been sold
the ethical thing to
do is to contact Household Bank say we
will buy those back we are going to take
care of it's not what happened in fact
Gary flew down a couple weeks later took

[1:56:31]
Gary flew down a couple weeks later took
me and several of the Brokers not that
broker but several of the Brokers out to
dinner had a few drinks and he openly
admitted he's like look I don't care if
all the loans have fraud in them as long
as they don't come back on me that's
what I'm concerned about CU there's a a

[1:56:46]
what I'm concerned about CU there's a a
clawback clause for one year he's like
like so if they can perform for one year
I don't
care that was it how many people in the
industry do you think are operating like

[1:57:01]
industry do you think are operating like
this um and by like this I mean in the
aforementioned gray
area I would say there's probably after
like the like after the 2008 financial

[1:57:16]
like the like after the 2008 financial
crisis I would say it cleaned up
consider
ably but I would say at this point it's
it's just as bad as it ever was and and
keep in mind these a lot of the loans
that caused uh the

[1:57:30]
that caused uh the
problems were like you know they called
them liar loans or or um you know you
know no no qualification like no qual
loans right no
income um well those loans are they
exist again like there are subprime

[1:57:47]
exist again like there are subprime
companies that are doing that again they
know I don't think they call them
subprime anymore they call them so they
got some other name yeah rebranded yeah
they've rebranded a little bit but it's
it's happening all over
again it just seems the whole the whole

[1:58:00]
again it just seems the whole the whole
real estate SL banking system is very
prone to this kind of corruption I mean
but but how how can you fix it like if
if a lot of the things they fixed a lot

[1:58:15]
if a lot of the things they fixed a lot
of the manipulation they fixed but if
you tighten it too much then the average
person can't get a loan like you you you
so you you know and and the thing is
some of these loans sometimes changing a
W2 you know should that person have

[1:58:30]
W2 you know should that person have
gotten in that into that house no he
shouldn't have he didn't qualify um but
he makes all of his payments so it's
like is it a fraudin loan yeah but it
performs so you know I think that I
would say that I forget what the FBI
statistic was it was like 20% or 30%

[1:58:47]
statistic was it was like 20% or 30%
prior to the 20 prior to the the
financial crisis is like 20 or 30% of
like bank loans they were saying contain
some kind of fraud even if it was just a
lie you know if you want to cut 30% out

[1:59:00]
lie you know if you want to cut 30% out
of the out of the you know that that's a
ton that's a ton so you're on probation
and you're doing these you're almost
getting caught you're almost getting
caught and you're doing these really
large scale
scams how does it get to the point where

[1:59:15]
scams how does it get to the point where
you're on the run so doing multiple
scams right so it's not just that I'm
doing the scams with the uh the
Reservoir Dog scams right I'm not just
doing those guys I'm also
creating other

[1:59:31]
creating other
identities because I've got other people
that are involved they they want to do a
scam MH so this chick I was
dating um she wanted to uh she wanted to
run a scam so I set up a scam it's semi

[1:59:45]
run a scam so I set up a scam it's semi
complicated but the the bottom line is
she ends up stealing a real person we we
we steal a real person's identity I have
a real person's identity we get a
driver's license in her name open up
some bank accounts go rent a piece of

[2:00:00]
some bank accounts go rent a piece of
property in her
name and I transfer the deed or the deed
from the property out of the real
owner's name I transfer it into her
stolen identity mhm we then refinance

[2:00:15]
stolen identity mhm we then refinance
the house like three or four times and
so she starts going to these different
closings and she's her name is Allison
and she's pretending to be a a a Puerto
Rican woman named Rosie de

[2:00:30]
pre um Allison has brown hair and blue
eyes Rosita Perez clearly doesn't yeah
so Allison when when we make the ID she
dyes her hair
black curls it a little

[2:00:46]
black curls it a little
bit um and gets the pictures pictures
taken of herself
but before she goes to the first
closing to get a check for like
$100,000 we've got like three of these
scheduled um

[2:01:02]
scheduled um
she she changes her hair color like that
she dyes it back like like a dirty
blonde and she goes to the first closing
and she gets a check a check for 100,000
let's say I don't know what it was like

[2:01:15]
let's say I don't know what it was like
either 95 or 105 whatever roughly
$100,000 she gets a check at the closing
they give it to her we then go to the
next closing well at the next
closing the the title
person has her sign all the documents

[2:01:30]
person has her sign all the documents
but she's looking at her like
something's not right looks at her ID
makes a copy of the ID looks at it and
says this this doesn't look like you and
she's like you know you don't look
Hispanic and she's like I'm half
Hispanic what do you what and she's like

[2:01:46]
Hispanic what do you what and she's like
you don't I mean but keep in mind the
photograph was her MH so she's saying
this doesn't look like you but it's her
granted her she had you know the curly
hair a little bit but that's it so
Allison is like it's me and she's like

[2:02:01]
Allison is like it's me and she's like
look I'm not going to give cut you I'm
not gonna give you the check yeah I'm
going to let you sign the documents you
know we can get you can get the check I
I'll let you know so she goes gets in my
car she say yeah listen there's a
problem so we're driving down the road
she explains it to me I realize you know

[2:02:15]
she explains it to me I realize you know
okay that's done it's over we're not
going back she's like what about the
other closing no no no more closings
we're
done and and I you know and it was
probably more of a yell screaming and
yelling like what the hell did you do
why told you not to change your hair why

[2:02:30]
why told you not to change your hair why
would you change your hair like that
when she came in like the day before and
I was like what did you do what did you
do and she's like I change my hair
what's the big deal it's still me sure
enough you know and that's
a like it's not that I knew that that
was going to happen but why tempt fate

[2:02:47]
was going to happen but why tempt fate
how'd you meet Alison like uh she was a
mortgage broker okay and and I had done
some fraudulent she need she worked for
another mortgage company sorry I she
worked for another mortgage company she
couldn't get a loan closed the owner of
that mortgage company called me and said

then later on that night he showed up on
the the county uh website you know the
the arrest website showing he had been

[2:08:30]
the arrest website showing he had been
arrested and uh the next day he calls me

[2:08:46]
got out yeah he got out for like nothing
and here's what I should have known he
was was cooperating his it went from
like $300,000 Bond down to like $10,000
so it's 1,000 bucks so right then I
didn't know it at the time but obviously
that means we're going to let him out of
jail we're he's cooperating so they let

[2:09:02]
jail we're he's cooperating so they let
him out of jail I go and I get him a
lawyer a state this was state by the way
it wasn't Federal so um I get him a
lawyer for like
$115,000 I he come you know he comes of

[2:09:15]
$115,000 I he come you know he comes of
course he tells me look they asked me a
bunch of questions I told him that you

guy but he doesn't know the guy's name
he made up a name like a whole his this
whole kind of thing where he tells them
about me but not me and he's like and

[2:09:30]
about me but not me and he's like and
then you know the numbers none of the
numbers LED anywhere so they all Le lead
to cell phones that are only being used
for those scams so it's a dead alley or
blind alley and uh I'm like okay okay
and I mean I'm paying him like he's
coming in man I my truck's no good I

[2:09:47]
coming in man I my truck's no good I
need another truck I buy him another
truck hey man my the Electric's going to
get turned off and I don't have oh I'm I
need $1,000 of course here's $1,000 I
don't know what I was I'm embarrassed
you had to ask here's a th you know week

[2:10:00]
you had to ask here's a th you know week
later you know he needs 2,000 for this a
th000 for this 2,000 for this he wants
to start a tree trimming company he
needs to buy a tree trimmer how much are
those 5,000 of course that's 10 so I
give him another 25,000 starts like a
tree trimming business which he runs to
this day

[2:10:16]
this day
um what I don't know is that you know
the whole time he's actually working
with a a task force that's been put
together federal or this is State at
this point it's a state task force uh
because there's multiple counties

[2:10:30]
because there's multiple counties
involved at this point and it wasn't
hard for him to explain like this this
is this comes back to Reservoir Dogs I
got a much all he had to say to the
officers was listen you got to let me go
I can't do any prison time I'm going to
tell you about a much much bigger scam
and they go okay well how can you prove

[2:10:45]
and they go okay well how can you prove
that scam pull up Hillsboro County uh
Hillsboro County's tax appraiser website
okay look up the name James red look all
of these were bu bought six months ago 6
months later they're all in foreclosure
pull up Lee black all of these were

[2:11:01]
pull up Lee black all of these were
bought look 6 months later all of them
are foreclosure hey pull up James pull
up Brandon green pull up so all of these
are going in foreclose I it's it's so
it's like you know that what I thought
was so cute not cute it was just stupid

[2:11:17]
was so cute not cute it was just stupid
and so he very quickly they put together
a task force he's working with them on
the task
force
and
um we're still buying houses flipping
houses doing everything because I'm I

[2:11:30]
houses doing everything because I'm I
believe him I believe he's not you know
he's saying look if I have to go to jail
for you know a year or so like you know
and he's also paying you know he hasn't
paid them back yet but he but we're
saying he can pay them back like he's
like look if we get to the point you
know when we get to that point like

[2:11:45]
know when we get to that point like
we'll pay them back um but we haven't
paid him back yet because we have no way
to show where that money came from we
can always go to like one of his
relatives and give give his dad 40 Grand
give his mom 20 grand you know that kind
of stuff and start putting money that
way and all that money was taken out in

[2:12:00]
way and all that money was taken out in
cash too so we could always show up with
a chunk in cash
regardless you know it's still in the
process and I think it we're still in
the process and it could be six months
or a year away because it's a slow thing
I've already been through the process my
first time when I got in trouble and it
was a year but from the time that I was

[2:12:16]
was a year but from the time that I was
spoken to until I pled guil Y and was
sentenced so um I'm not concerned about
it well that's happening we're still
flipping properties and one

[2:12:30]
flipping properties and one
day I have a buddy named Steve Sutton
remember the sheriff's deputy and keep
in mind it's funny because like I've
done bad loans for police officers
sheriffs um lawyers doctors like you
know across everybody across these

[2:12:45]
know across everybody across these
aren't like all you know yeah
guys that you know these aren't all like
you know construction workers or guys
that work you know mechanics or
something these are like the legit these
are legitimate people that have credit
problems or whatever the case may be so
one day I'm sitting at

[2:13:00]
one day I'm sitting at
work and
and I'd been getting phone calls for the
prior week from people at title
companies saying hey Matt wanted to let
you know we just had some subpoenas
served on several of your

[2:13:16]
served on several of your
files and I'm concerned like that had me
concerned then a guy named Jeff
testerman starts making phone calls Jeff
testerman is a reporter for the St
Petersburg times he's

[2:13:31]
Petersburg times he's
calling people saying hey um I know
noticed that you sold a piece of
property to Lee black have you ever met
Mr Black you see like and they're like
just hanging up on him or saying no I
don't know what you're talking about I'm
not sure what that guy's name was let me

[2:13:45]
not sure what that guy's name was let me
call you back and I'm getting phone
calls from people so I know some some
things up with the newspaper now now I
know something's being looked at but
nobody's really talking I know that
there are subpoenas being um being
served and I'm I'm nervous you know I'm
I'm very concerned and then one day I'm

[2:14:02]
I'm very concerned and then one day I'm
in my office and the sheriff's deputy
walks in Steve Sutton in his uniform too
which everybody always stiffened you
know when he would walk in so he walks
in I go Steve I said what's going on

Georgia no this is Florida okay but it
was just a madeup name okay I'd gone to
like high school with a kid named David
Freeman um so I I had an ID but I can't
give that to a cop like that's enough to
get like rent a place or do something
yeah so we go

[2:25:47]
yeah so we go
go to Atlanta make an ID set it up make
some business cards set up a couple
websites set up some uh um get a a an HQ
which is that like a it's a company that
will you can do virtual you can rent

[2:26:01]
will you can do virtual you can rent
virtual you can rent offices and they'll
answer your phone for like hundred bucks
a month and they'll afford them so seems
like you have a an office they'll they
you know they give you a phone number
that you call up and they say you know

they'll answer the phone and forward
messages so we get one of those make a

[2:26:16]

business card for uh for Becky she rents
a house from a guy named um Michael
Shanahan so we rent Michael shaneah
Halen's house it's like $200,000
$200,000 house in
alfaretta

[2:26:32]
alfaretta
and I then go to Alabama wait I then
order Scott cno's birth certificate
social security
card I think I registered a vote in his
name and I think and we I made a lease

[2:26:48]
name and I think and we I made a lease
agreement in his
name and I think that's all I needed and
then I went to Alabama and got a
driver's license in his name so I went
into the DMV give them all these

[2:27:00]
into the DMV give them all these
documents and which are almost all of
them are real except for the lease M
they said sit over there I sit over
there I sit down boom 20 minutes later I
have a driver's license it's you know 20
something dollar it was nothing so I get
the driver's license now I'm driving
this I'm still driving a car that an

[2:27:15]
this I'm still driving a car that an
Audi that is in the name of Matt Cox so
I park that I then
go get Social Security to issue me a
social security number in the name Scott
cugno and I then turn around and I go
and I get a loan you put down 20 30%

[2:27:31]
and I get a loan you put down 20 30%
there's all these first-time or
first-time buyers 30%
down rent get like a Honda or something
so now we're living in a house we've got
some Furniture bedroom furniture and I
go downtown I pull the title to this guy

[2:27:45]
go downtown I pull the title to this guy
Michael Shanahan's
house and I go downtown and I satisfy
the loan on his house so he had two
loans with Bank of America and so I I
make create two satisfaction of loans

[2:28:03]
make create two satisfaction of loans
from Bank of America so Michael Shanahan
owns a house in the name Michael
Shanahan he has one mortgage with Bank
of America and a second one when you pay
your mortgage off the way public records

[2:28:17]
your mortgage off the way public records
knows it's paid off is they mail public
records a satisfaction of mortgage it's
a one-page document and it's notorized
so got two of those I filled out two I I
created two of them I I just ordered you

[2:28:32]
created two of them I I just ordered you
know you can re do research so when I
went
downtown I
researched Bank of America satisfaction
of mortgages and you know thousands show
up so I just grab a couple of them now I
know what the basic template is they're
all and they're all different by the way

[2:28:46]
all and they're all different by the way
so it's you know it's not like you even
have to be that close but whatever I
mimicked some of them uh ordered I had a
notary stamp not hard to get you know
you just you go in and you'll you go
into three
different um you know uh Office Depots

[2:29:02]
different um you know uh Office Depots
and you say hey I need a notary stamp
and you give them the information and
you come back four day or whatever a
week later and they give it to you so
I've got these notary stamps so I
notarize the satisfactions I go downtown
I file them Boom the mortgages are gone

[2:29:16]
I file them Boom the mortgages are gone
on keep in mind Bank of America he's
still paying the mortgages they don't
know that they've been satisfied in
public records they're not notified so
those are gone but it takes about a
month or two for it to show up Atlanta
was that far behind I think it was
Fulton County they were just way behind

[2:29:31]
Fulton County they were just way behind
so we just kind of have to dick around
for a while right so we're going on
little vacations we're going to New
Orleans we're going to different
places um as Scott cugno driving a car
of Scott cugno we open up sever bank

[2:29:47]
of Scott cugno we open up sever bank
accounts we have multiple bank accounts
and then um we end up going to Vegas and
we don't get we do go to Vegas but what
happened was we're driving around and I
remember thinking telling her I was like
you know this is a problem like we have

[2:30:00]
you know this is a problem like we have
to get real IDs real driver's licenses I
mean this is real but this is a real
person too and he may stumble across it
and and so what I did was I I started
running ads in um
magazines saying um home Lo available

[2:30:17]
magazines saying um home Lo available
good credit bad credit no problem call
now government loans you know government
you know VA FHA F you know whatever call
this number so people start
calling and I'm getting their
information one of the guys I got was uh

[2:30:31]
information one of the guys I got was uh
Michael eert yeah I remember Michael
eert poor Michael
eer um I actually actually legally
changed his name to Michael Johnson at
one point but at this point it was just
Michael eard so I don't I wanted to see

[2:30:47]
Michael eard so I don't I wanted to see
you know I'm bored I want to see what
the process is how much does it cost can
is this possible let me see if I can
change this guy's name it was it was
1500 bucks I changed it without him ever
showing up anywhere so you can f I have
a driver's license in his name right I

[2:31:01]
a driver's license in his name right I
am him so he did show up he showed up at
the lawyer's office he so you know right
so I'm so I do that I'm living in the
house um and we were driving along one

[2:31:15]
house um and we were driving along one
day and I'm saying we got to get real
like these people that are calling like
that one guy I I get his information but
during the course of taking the
application and I'm asking like these
these government survey questions at the
very end there like 20 questions and I'm

[2:31:30]
very end there like 20 questions and I'm
rambling them off and at some point he
was like he said he he volunteered like
I didn't used I never even asked anybody
about criminal history and he just he
ended up saying something well I do have
a felony does that matter I mean he's
like he Ian it was a DUI I've had a

[2:31:45]
like he Ian it was a DUI I've had a
couple DUIs but I got my life Li back
and that was part of the reason he had
bad credit and it was like okay uh no no
it doesn't matter don't worry I'm
thinking you're not getting alone so
this is I'm just taking your I'm just
stealing from you stealing your
information so I get all this

[2:32:00]
information so I get all this
information I'm gathering it and so one
of the things I said to Becky while we
are sitting at this stoplight is I'm
like we got to get real people's real
information and I said like for instance
I said what if I steal somebody's
identity I get a driver's license in his
name four states from where he lives and

[2:32:16]
name four states from where he lives and
he gets a DUI I could get pulled over
two years later and get arrested for a
DUI that he got in Florida and she's
like well what do you what do you what
are you thinking are you thinking like
like criminals or are you thinking like
like prisoners like mental patients like

[2:32:32]

and I went I mean I don't and I looked
over and there was a homeless guy
holding a sign and I went like that guy
and for she goes she's the hobo like I
don't know who calls them hobos and

he's he's not going to drive a car he's
not going to get a DUI he has an expired
license I just have to get his license
reinstated and I can be him so I went

[2:35:01]
reinstated and I can be him so I went
home I typed up a what I called a
federal statistical survey form and I
made a little thing I mean I went online
I you know I'm always filling out
federal documents as a mortgage broker
so it looked identical I mean I had like
this little like the the recycle symbol

[2:35:15]
this little like the the recycle symbol
and it was like you know Federal Form
17017 you know um and so I print out
these forms I get a go buy a clip board
I make a little Salvation Army ID I pin
it on me and I go out and I start um

[2:35:31]
it on me and I go out and I start um
doing a surveys I start surveying
homeless homeless people don't judge me
bro I was in a bad spot I was in a bad
spot I see the Judgment I see the
Judgment let's M let's maintain civility
here like stay neutral stay neutral so

[2:35:46]
here like stay neutral stay neutral so
these homeless guys I mean they have uh
they have a Social Security number they
have a a birth certificate I guess I
mean they're a real person right they're
real person they're just not using their
real person yeah they're not actively
engaging with the the economic system

[2:36:01]
engaging with the the economic system
the financial systems they're not
they're not employed they don't have
housing all that yeah they they don't
file taxes they don't so I one of the
questions I even asked the guy at one of
the last questions I said do you believe

[2:36:16]
the last questions I said do you believe
that you will be gainfully employed
within the next two years mhm every one
of them said no no no so you know was
like okay they're not even they're not
even trying and they all had alcohol
problems or honestly the few of them I
talked to like was pretty clear I mean

[2:36:31]
talked to like was pretty clear I mean
it takes literally five minutes less
than five minutes to fill out the form
and I filled it out Forum of course um
but even filling it out and that brief
just asking questions back and forth
half of them you could tell you've got
some mental illness like something's not

[2:36:45]
some mental illness like something's not
right right with you like these aren't
guys that are going to go out and get
are going to get jobs they're not
cleaning up so they were perfect for my
purposes as horrible as I know that
sounds so you feel bad about this little
small tangent no do I feel bad about it

[2:37:02]
small tangent no do I feel bad about it
the homeless people in society are
really it's a difficult life like
dealing with mental illness dealing with
drug addiction all that kind of stuff I
mean listen being in prison and then the
kind the people that are in prison that

[2:37:16]
kind the people that are in prison that
you know are are going to be homeless or
have been homeless or the mental illness
that I've dealt with in halfway houses
and even doing this I don't know what
you do with these people I don't even
know that you house them you can't
necessarily even house them together you

[2:37:31]
necessarily even house them together you
know they they cause such problems like
I don't know what the solution is other
than just kind of keeping them fed maybe
and keep them away from normal people
you know so they don't call caus crime

[2:37:46]
you know so they don't call caus crime
or whatever I don't know about housing
them in one area that seems like a
mistake like there is absolutely no good
solution to that problem none because
it's not like hey if if we gave you a
house and we gave you job training and
we gave you this okay you might get 5%

[2:38:03]
we gave you this okay you might get 5%
yeah 10 but most of them are on the
street because they've just messed up
over and over and over again and they
just kind of gave up but you know I
guess we still have to remember that
they're human beings and we mentioned
off Mike uh soft white underbelly and he

[2:38:17]
off Mike uh soft white underbelly and he
highlights the humanity of people who've
had a real difficult life he does it
well he's Mark Lea is amazing he's
amazing and one of the things he had
said was like these are he was like

[2:38:31]
said was like these are he was like
these are real people and he's like
their stories he's like they have
stories and they need you know but if
you also talk to Mark he'll tell you you
can't just you can't give him money you
can't like you can't like he's tried
over every time he's reached out and

[2:38:46]
over every time he's reached out and
tried to help these guys put them in
apartments fed them got them back on
their feet within 6 months they're back
on they're back on the street I mean
just it just happens over and over and
over again I mean I think the amount of

[2:39:00]
over again I mean I think the amount of
money that would have to be dumped into
correcting that
problem I don't know I mean you can say
well yeah but just you know you should
do it because it's the right thing to do
I don't know who's paying for it it's
complicated but for your purpose they

[2:39:16]
complicated but for your purpose they
they have a Social Security number they
got 20 bucks they seem very happy there
you are with a clipboard taking a survey
right took a
survey uh went home ordered their and
they you know of course they give me
everything name date of birth social

[2:39:30]
everything name date of birth social
security number um mother's made name
where they were born have they ever been
in the armed services have they ever had
a passport issued what states have they
had identification and have they ever
been arrested they ever been on
probation have they ever claimed Social
Security disability SII I mean every I I

[2:39:47]
Security disability SII I mean every I I
had like 17 questions and it absolutely
answered everything what high school did
you go to cuz high school transcripts
are great for documentation a lot of
times they'll ask you for high school
you know can you get us a copy of your
high school transcripts like that's a
good know and I'm a big believer in

[2:40:00]
good know and I'm a big believer in
Overkill so I mean I ordered a ton of
stuff if I
needed three things to get a driver's
license in your name right you know I'd
come in with like six cuz what you do is
you get in front of the the the guy at
the DMV and you kind of fumble through

[2:40:15]
the DMV and you kind of fumble through
like uh I got this uh what else do you
need uh you know I know exactly what you
need but you know they'll be like oh was
that High School transfer yeah I'll take
that and uh what oh voter's registration
card give me that yeah that's you're
perfect you're good sit down right over
there that's it you who is by the way

[2:40:30]
there that's it you who is by the way
lurking in the shadows trying to catch
you you've mentioned FBI Secret Service
you you mentioned uh I think I've heard
you mentioned US Marshals which is
interesting cops General the police CIA
I guess CIA is international only FBI is

[2:40:45]
I guess CIA is international only FBI is
internal yes okay well so who is when
you're doing
this who are you afraid of so by the
time I've gotten to Atlanta within four
or five days the FBI raided my office I
guess I kind of missed that back in

[2:41:00]
guess I kind of missed that back in
Florida back in Florida when I left and
drove to Atlanta and left remember this
FBI was going to show up a few days
later they were going to arrest me and
they did they did they showed up like I
left on a Sunday night or something
because for some reason my stupid

[2:41:16]
because for some reason my stupid
thought I thought well they won't arrest
me on the weekend like they don't work
on the weekends um so they came on like
a whatever it was like a Tuesday or
Wednesday or Thursday like within a few
days they come in the office they rate
it they're looking for me but I'm gone
nobody knows where I am and uh so now

[2:41:31]
nobody knows where I am and uh so now
I'm I'm surveying the homeless guys and
I turn around and I'm ordering their
documents and as their documents are
showing
up you know I'm I'm going to different
states and getting IDs

[2:41:46]
states and getting IDs
so I'm going to Florida so over over the
course of this whole thing I've had 27
driers licenses in like seven different
states I've had two dozen passports
because if you're going to get the
driver's license in the guy's name you

[2:42:02]
driver's license in the guy's name you
might as well get or an ID even you
might as well get a passport because a
passport is not difficult to get they
don't fingerprint you you know all they
look all they're doing is saying this is
your ID and where you're born here and
then they run a check and if it comes

[2:42:15]
then they run a check and if it comes
back or it doesn't and back then you
could do it expedited and I'd have it in
like two weeks like now it takes like 90
days or 60 to 90 days to get one but and
if you have multiple ideas for a single
identity that's more proof like right so
wait what number did you say how many

[2:42:32]
wait what number did you say how many
how many IDs how many identities so I
had well I've had over 50 identities but
I've had
27 driver's licenses issued from State
DMVs Department of Motor Vehicles so
like legit legitimately I walked into

[2:42:47]

later you go you pay your 25 bucks you
stand in front of the the screen they

it's beautiful it smells like pop
plastic it's amazing and so I I I'm

[2:43:46]
plastic it's amazing and so I I I'm
opening up
different uh different bank accounts in
these guys
names and just what you yeah sorry what
are you mostly doing with the identities
you opening up different bank accounts
you doing a credit uh starting to

[2:44:00]
you doing a credit uh starting to
establish credit or no some of them like
I might order um I might
order uh secured credit cards so I can't
get credit you know I'm building their
credit like it's not helping me in any
way I'm just sending out $500 to get a a

[2:44:15]
way I'm just sending out $500 to get a a
Capital One card or a American I'm sorry
A Bank of America secured credit card
whatever so I'm building their credits
but not all of them only a few because
I'm collect although I'm collecting
them I'm also going to be moving soon

[2:44:31]
them I'm also going to be moving soon
I'm only here to get a few hundred, and
move I need some kind of a base so I
don't want to start getting credit cards
and building up a a history in Atlanta
in anybody's name but I am getting
drivers like licenses in other states so

[2:44:47]
drivers like licenses in other states so
I've been like North Carolina South
Carolina what's the primary method of
income here when you move to a place
South Carolina how do you make 100,000
at this at this time oh well I'm right
now I'm living in this guy's house and I
satisfied his loans the house is worth

[2:45:01]
satisfied his loans the house is worth
200,000 got it so what happens is one
day we go and we check public records
remember I told you it takes months for
it to show up and it shows up M he's got
no mortgages on the house so now I'm I
turn around and I make a fake ID in the

[2:45:16]
turn around and I make a fake ID in the
name Michael Shanahan
M and I'm living in his house but I have
no credit right there's no credit so
I've got a the the ID I I've got a a
social security number and I order some

[2:45:30]
social security number and I order some
secure credit cards in his name so if
you pull that credit profile it does it
shows up saying he's got some credit
cards but it's they've only they're only
a month or two old so I can't go to like
Bank of America I mean I could

[2:45:46]
Bank of America I mean I could
but I needed to get the money as quick
as possible like I I want to get out of
Atlanta so and at this point by the way
there's multiple articles showing up in
Tampa so the St Petersburg times is is

[2:46:01]
Tampa so the St Petersburg times is is
writing multiple articles about me with
your face with my picture yeah but it's
honestly it's it's pre I me not pre-
internet but it's it's post internet but
it's it's in its infancy like no
nobody's it's not huge and and honestly
it's a it's a it's a it's a local

[2:46:16]
it's a it's a it's a it's a local
newspaper in Tampa it's not that big of
a deal like I'm not concerned about that
so much at this point what I'm concerned
about is getting a chunk of money and
just moving on and kind of
reestablishing ourselves in a better way
where we're not living in a in a

[2:46:30]
where we're not living in a in a
building that we're going to be
committing fraud in with our house so
but I'm living in this place I make a
fake ID in the name Michael Shanahan and
I call up three secured or sorry three
hard money lenders a hard money lender

[2:46:46]
hard money lenders a hard money lender
is a guy that lends his own money or
other investors money on property kind
of like a bank but he's lending his own
money so he doesn't have to really meet
the banking
requirements and he can charge a much

[2:47:00]
requirements and he can charge a much
higher interest rate these guys are
charging 12 133% interest uh simple
interest and they're only lending you a
a much lower percentage of the value of
your home so they're not lending you 90%
of the value they're lending you 65 %

[2:47:16]
of the value they're lending you 65 %
60% so I call three of these guys they
all come out to the house at different
times and each one of them says I'll
lend you 100,000 or it's like 150,000
150 like they all lend roughly
150,000 so we schedule three separate

[2:47:32]
150,000 so we schedule three separate
closings none of them know about the
other person so what I do is I
close I Clos One loan on let's say
Monday and then one on Tuesday and then
one on whatever Wednesday or Thursday or

[2:47:45]
one on whatever Wednesday or Thursday or
or they may have all been the same day
to be honest but I don't remember the
point is I go to three separate title
companies or uh real estate attorneys
and we close and I get checks for you
know after costs and everything the
total ends up being roughly

[2:48:01]
total ends up being roughly
400,000 so I've got 400,000 Becky and I
run another scam in in Tallahassee
Florida and we get like 50 Grand and
plus we the 80 the 80s dwindled down to
close to nothing we we had gone on

[2:48:15]
close to nothing we we had gone on
several vacations we went to like
Bermuda and I think we went to Jamaica
we actually stayed at the Ritz in uh in
Jamaica so it was very nice you and
Becky so Becky turned out to be pretty
good in terms of scams on the road no

[2:48:30]
good in terms of scams on the road no
she was useless she was she was she was
horrible and she just spent money all
the time and by the what I realized too
very quickly is she's
bipolar so she's bipolar and
she's absolutely you know insane she

[2:48:46]
she's absolutely you know insane she
smokes pot all the time um did that
matter for you personally or did it
actually affect the uh how good you were
able to do the these particular scams it
was that she was the type of person that
would start an argument at 1:00 in the

[2:49:03]
would start an argument at 1:00 in the
morning yeah and scream at the top of
her lungs and get the cops
called okay so I can't have the police
called I can't get taken downtown and
fingerprinted I can't have the police

[2:49:16]
fingerprinted I can't have the police
showing up I don't know who's really
who's looking we haven't had plastic
surgery at this point we're still
pulling money together
so oh Becky yeah Becky's a problem

[2:49:30]
so oh Becky yeah Becky's a problem
and at some point I actually we send her
to a like a psychiatrist and they they
give her um they put her on
Zoloft she takes it for like a month or
two and then she stops taking it she's
she she thought she was all better mhm

[2:49:46]
she she thought she was all better mhm
like you're not all better so can you
give me a timeline here how long are you
able to be on the road here successfully
three years three years this is me this
is the first few months three years well
so three
years what happens is we I we get that

[2:50:03]
years what happens is we I we get that
little chunk of money we put it
deposited into these bank accounts and
we start pulling out cash
M um and which works out fine because we
got a bunch of accounts and we're
pulling out little

[2:50:15]
pulling out little
7,000 5,000 8,000 and you know I would
cash checks against her
accounts and they would call her to
verify uh there's someone here trying to
cash a check for $99,000 you know can
you verify the pay and they go oh yeah

[2:50:31]
you verify the pay and they go oh yeah
that's Scott cugno oh okay thank you and
they cash the check you know these are
new accounts so it looks odd but you
know we're always I opened the
account so what what ends up happening
is

[2:50:45]
is
um we're cashing them and I remember
getting really frustrated because it
just taking forever and I gone into a
bank one
time and you know they have Banks where
that they they
cash they actually cash like large

[2:51:02]
cash they actually cash like large
checks like if you go into Bank of
America and you try and cash a check for
$155,000 or 25,000 they probably won't
do it they'll tell you we don't have
that much cash on hand we don't this we
don't that they have certain banks that
do that so they told me where one of

[2:51:15]
do that so they told me where one of
those was I went there I had a check for
like
29,000 that had been cut on a closing
for Michael Shanahan remember I
refinanced Michael Shanahan's I've got a
check for 29,000 that was issued to

29,000 29,000 and I st stand up and I I
mean just like I'm like shoving the

[2:55:46]

and he

[2:56:00]
and he
goes he said um excuse me Mr cugno and I

exactly he goes I I can't put my finger

[2:56:16]
exactly he goes I I can't put my finger
on it and I go it'll come to you and I
turn around I just bolt right out of
there and so keep in mind a week or so
later the Secret Service shows uph did
you cash a check for
$29,000
so um what's so funny he like that was

[2:56:30]
so um what's so funny he like that was
one of the last checks we cashed so we
ended up with like 400,000 was there a
connection between the Secret Service
and this guy no apprehension so the FBI
is looking for me kind of in in Tampa
yeah and they've put out a a fugitive
warrant for me which is how the US

[2:56:45]
warrant for me which is how the US
Marshals got involved so US Marshals
track down fugitives Yes Federal
Fugitives they track
down but everybody's after you you're on
every list right I'm on the FBI's list

[2:57:00]
every list right I'm on the FBI's list
at that point the Secret Service got
involved once I leave Atlanta so when
Becky and I pack up our bags and we
leave
Atlanta the Secret Service got involved
because of identity theft
um you know banking identity that that

[2:57:16]
um you know banking identity that that
the Secret Service doesn't just do
counterfeiting and protect the president
they also protect the financial
infrastructure of the United States and
they especially have jurisdiction when
identity theft is involved so identity

[2:57:30]
identity theft is involved so identity
theft plus bank fraud they're that's
when they they move yeah that's it
that's their their um their territory so
Marshals are just fugitives US Marshall
is just fugitives they don't do any
inves they're all kind of work okay but
they're all kind of working together
yeah yeah the the you know like the US

[2:57:46]
yeah yeah the the you know like the US
Marshals are like let's say an arm of
all of the various law enforcement
agencies federal agencies not the states
the states have their own fugitive task
forces or fugitive so when you leave

[2:58:01]
forces or fugitive so when you leave
Atlanta basically everybody's after you
everybody's after me did you know this
at that time or did you sense it no I
mean now you know we every day you're
looking up you're looking your name up
every day like I'm not cuz I'm just
trying to get a bunch of money and and

[2:58:15]
trying to get a bunch of money and and
just blend in right things were not as
interconnected at that time as they are
now yeah but they're starting to get
interconnected but of course I have no
idea how much I I barely go on the
internet for anything you know dating
that's the only thing the internet you

[2:58:30]
that's the only thing the internet you
know I'd never been on Facebook at this
point now Facebook isn't even even out

put down 11,000 so I buy these two
houses I then satisfy the loans to on
both the

[3:02:31]
both the
houses everything seems like it's going
okay although Becky's a a lunatic at
this point she's she's had so many she
she won't take her medication she's had
so many outbursts uh that
and and we've had by this time we've had

[3:02:45]
and and we've had by this time we've had
plastic surgery like she's gotten
plastic surgery she's gotten a boob job
she's gotten lipos suction I mean all
kinds of stuff so look way
different like appearance changes or

[3:03:00]
different like appearance changes or
thinner better looking you know just
tightened everything up I guess you know
she was in her she'd had a she'd had a
kid and she was 3 33 34 I don't know how
she was 20 32 33 I don't roughly my age
so yeah I thought she looked you know

[3:03:16]
so yeah I thought she looked you know
she lost like 15 lbs like she was not
because of the surgery but just in
general we're not we're just working out
we're going mountain climbing we're you
know riding bikes we're doing you know
there's Fraud's not a full-time job so
you know we have plenty of time so we're

[3:03:30]
you know we have plenty of time so we're
we're goofing off
and uh but she's also a lunatic you know
she's getting the cops called she's able
to go out and she's able to stay stoned
24 hours a day she's she's going out

[3:03:45]
24 hours a day she's she's going out
with friends drinking I never leave the
house you know uh even to this day I
really barely ever leave the house I'm
I'm very much a homebody kind of person
so like the the idea that I'm able to
make my living doing YouTube and I never
have to leave my house M I love that I

[3:04:00]
have to leave my house M I love that I
don't ever go anywhere except for the
gym and back home that's it so what
happens is uh I I've actually moved her
out of the my apartment like I had an
apartment downtown 30 storying building
actually move her into another apartment

[3:04:15]
actually move her into another apartment
she's that much of a lunatic we can't
even be in the same place multiple times
I've tried to leave her she's called me
up and begged me to come back it's
horrible so I end up buying a couple
houses in in Columbia South
Carolina I satisfy the loans on the

[3:04:30]
Carolina I satisfy the loans on the
houses I've got an ID not a driver's
license but an ID in the name of Gary
Lee
Sullivan and I refinanced I refinanced
those houses cuz keep in mind they were
owner finan in but they also had

[3:04:45]
owner finan in but they also had
mortgages so there's something called a
wraparound mortgage so these guys did
wraparound mortgages so let's say you
buy a house for $2 200
$250,000 and the bank lends you $200,000
MH and then you owner finance the house
to me so we do a I give you 50 Grand

[3:05:04]
to me so we do a I give you 50 Grand
down but I'm not I'm not able to get a
loan from the bank to pay off your
mortgage so what we do is you do a
wraparound mortgage so I'll pay you your
mortgage and you pay the bank so there

[3:05:15]
mortgage and you pay the bank so there
is a second mortgage on the property but
it's called a wrap it it's WRA it's
wrapped around your first that's legal
MH yeah so I wouldn't lie to you so it's
so there's these have wraparound
mortgages so you're always selling I and

[3:05:31]
mortgages so you're always selling I and
you're good at it so I go I satisfy yeah
the loans the owner finance loans the
wraparound mortgages and I I satisfy the
loans there the original loans that
these people took out on their own

[3:05:45]
these people took out on their own
mortgages MH one of them by the way I
sat you know you have to sign as the
president of the bank right yeah so I
sign it as SE Montgomery Burns which is
the Aging tycoon in the the the guy that
owns the power plant in The Simpsons TV

[3:06:01]
owns the power plant in The Simpsons TV
show yeah so I signed that and I
notorized it which I thought was cute I
actually wanted to sign all of them
cartoon characters and Becky was
screaming her head off and wouldn't let
me do it right like I wanted to do all
the Simpsons right but she wouldn't let
me do it she's screaming and hollering

[3:06:15]
me do it she's screaming and hollering
so I ended up you know see nobody knows
who C monmy Burns is so I sign it
notarize it all of those are satisfied I
then go to the multiple Bank Banks and I
refinance start refinancing all these uh

[3:06:30]
refinance start refinancing all these uh
these properties multiple times so I'm
applying for these loans and I'm getting
the loans and I'm closing so I've got
like five or six loans on this one house
the house is like 225,000
I think it was like 230 whatever I I I

[3:06:47]
I think it was like 230 whatever I I I
get I borrow like four or five loans on
that house so I borrow like
$190,000 like five times so I've got
like $800,000 and then I borrow another
three or 400,000 on the other house the
one the smaller one right so it ends up

[3:07:00]
one the smaller one right so it ends up
being like $1.3 million it's actually
like 1.5 million it was more but what
happened with that was so keep in mind I
you can only open up so many bank
accounts in your name you can go to Bank
of America they'll open one then you go

[3:07:15]
of America they'll open one then you go
to Sun Trust they'll open one they're
gonna they might even ask you did
you did you open another bank account
today because every time you do it
there's an inquiry into something called
check
systems um or acue check and so then
they go so then by the time you go to

[3:07:30]
they go so then by the time you go to
the Third Bank they'll say listen
something's not right you've got
multiple inquiries you know if you go to
whatever mertile Bank there might be
they might go okay we're going to open
one they're going to need an explanation
but you're not you're not opening more
than three M by the third one they're be
like absolutely not something's wrong so

[3:07:47]
like absolutely not something's wrong so
you know I've got multiple identities
but I can only open up so so many banks
the other problem is that these these
checks they'll only give you so much
money on a refi usually after $100,000
they only want to let you walk away with
let's say

[3:08:00]
let's say
$100,000 so one of the things I did was
I would I would typically record Another
mortgage and have them pay that mortgage
off so I had to open I
opened a corporation to do that so I
could then turn around and go open
corporate bank accounts cuz now it's not

[3:08:17]
corporate bank accounts cuz now it's not
going off my information it's going off
the corporation so I can open up
multiple corporate bank accounts well
these corporations are fake or real no
no I went to a real corporate bank
attorney corporate attorney and had him
open them I gave him whatever gave him
like $1,500 $2,000 and he opened up a

[3:08:31]
like $1,500 $2,000 and he opened up a
corporation for me Gary Sullivan yeah
and I then turned around and I went and
opened up multiple bank accounts in that
in those that corporation's name how how
are you keeping track of all this cuz
this is I don't so I I your head or do
you have good organiz no I have every

[3:08:45]
you have good organiz no I have every
single identity has its own file with
with um you know plastic inlays sleeves
for their passports it's nice and
organized yeah it's super organized you
open this I'm Gary now right that's
exactly what it is like you kind of go

[3:09:00]
exactly what it is like you kind of go
over boom boom boom boom you sit in your
car for a minute you put it down you
walk in MH well what happens is it went
up to like 1.5 million and I'm pulling
money out of the bank and then one day I
got a phone call on Gary Sullivan's cell
phone the guy it's a it's a lawyer they

[3:09:17]
phone the guy it's a it's a lawyer they
call up he says hey I'm lawyer with

all really close calls it seems like you
no this is the close call I have two
more close calls that my hands sweat
thinking about

[3:14:15]
thinking about
it I walk in I walk into wacovia I just
opened this account two months ago so
it's a new account so whenever I would
go in there I'd say hey I need a $7,000
$6,000 anything over $3,000 they had to
call to get permission right like author

[3:14:31]
call to get permission right like author
uh authorization so she's like okay I
got to go call I said no problem so the
the girl walks in the back I'm sitting
there waiting all of a
sudden a massive person reaches over my
hand and grabs my wrist and somebody

[3:14:46]
hand and grabs my wrist and somebody
grabs it from the other one and they
pull my hands behind my back these are
two of possibly the largest Law
Enforcement Officers I've ever seen in
my entire life and they're
massive and they they handcuff me and
they say you're um uh Mr Sullivan you're

[3:15:04]
they say you're um uh Mr Sullivan you're
being detained we're taking you into
custody and you know putting you uh
where holding you until a detective gets
here who are these guys is this US
Marshals or is this cops or what these

[3:15:15]
Marshals or is this cops or what these
are sheriff's deputies sh sheriff's
deputies and as they walk me in right as
they walk me in the back they're calling
me Mr Sullivan right they sit me down
and by now
I'm you know the Secret Service are
looking for me they're they're calling
me uh well they were calling us John and

[3:15:31]
me uh well they were calling us John and
Jane Doe but now they figured out who we
were and so now I'm on the secret
Services Most Wanted L I'm not like
number one at that right like I probably
was but I I we just found out I was on
like on that list so it it's it's

[3:15:46]
like on that list so it it's it's
getting bad so they sit me down and I'm
waiting and I remember thinking that the
FBI was coming you know I don't really
know at that point I couldn't tell you
the difference between everybody and
then five minutes go by and you know I'm
sitting there going what is going on do

[3:16:00]
sitting there going what is going on do
you guys have any idea what's going
they're like we don't know we're just
grunts we just do what we're told so
suddenly this guy walks in he's probably
in his early 30s maybe he walks in gray
suit I think he looks like he's FBI he
says hey I'm a detective with the uh I

[3:16:16]
says hey I'm a detective with the uh I
want to say Richland County you know
whatever sheriff department or police
department whatever and I was like oh
okay and he says yeah listen we've got
an issue wacovia wacovia wants this they
want us to arrest you he said that they
they're saying that you've got three

[3:16:32]
they're saying that you've got three
mortgages on on your house and I go is
that
illegal and he looked at me and he went
you know to be honest I don't know yeah
I I and I distinctly remember thinking
I'm walking out of here all I have to do

[3:16:46]
I'm walking out of here all I have to do
is convince this guy I haven't done
anything wrong he's already said he
doesn't know so he gets on the phone
with the head of wacovia fraud
department and he's tell saying this guy
is running what's called a shotgunning
scam which is absolutely right and so

[3:17:01]
scam which is absolutely right and so
what what is the shotgun it's where
you're you you close on so many loans
simultaneously they can't catch it
anyway they they start going back and
forth and he's on the phone is like um
why did you close three loans and I said

[3:17:15]
why did you close three loans and I said
I you know what why are you pull what I
said I it's not illegal I have a first
mortgage a second mortgage and a and a
home equity line of credit that's
perfectly legal and he goes and you can
hear the guy that's not they're all
first mortgages and I said I read every
one of those documents not one of them

[3:17:30]
one of those documents not one of them
said they were first mortgages and they
don't first mortgages don't say they're
first mortgages it's the placement of
the mortgage placement of the lean that
determines is their first second or
third so it's possible that I wouldn't
have known it certainly that I could
have read those documents and not known

[3:17:45]
have read those documents and not known
and he's like that's not true and he's
screaming and uh so I go yeah listen and
and he said well you're taking out all
cash why are you taking out all cash I
said well I mean I don't know if this
this sounds I said I don't know this
might be illegal I said I don't know I
said I mean I work for for a I work for

[3:18:01]
said I mean I work for for a I work for
a um a labor company labor on
demand I pull out my business card you
can call so I'm like I work for labor on
demand
and I said um we we hire a lot of guys

[3:18:15]
and I said um we we hire a lot of guys
that like they don't have bank account
so the company pays them and then
usually I'll pull out money and I'll
I'll cash their checks because they get
charge like 10% of these check cashing
companies and I feel bad I know the
checks are good so I just deposit them I
mean I don't think that but I don't I
don't know if that's illegal I don't

[3:18:30]
don't know if that's illegal I don't
think that's illegal like if if and he's
like no no no that's fine it's it's
that's that's a decent thing to do it's
not that's fine I'm like oh okay so
where're so he's talking to the guy you
know wovi is screaming hollering he says
um uh he's doing that you know he's

[3:18:45]
um uh he's doing that you know he's
going back and forth back and forth so
we're going back and forth back and I'm
just derailing everything this guy says
and at one point he says um he's
screaming he's committing fraud we want
him arrested and he's like I don't know

[3:19:00]
him arrested and he's like I don't know
what to charge him with and he's like
you know he he's
saying these aren't you know how did you
know how did you he's like hey look how
did you even do this what I go look I
didn't do this I said I came to wacovia

[3:19:15]
didn't do this I said I came to wacovia
I met with a loan officer I said I need
a first mortgage I need to pull out like
$100,000 I want to start buying houses
he goes that's right you own another
house here too don't you I said I do I
said we're putting a new roof on it
we're going to build an addition we're
putting in a pool I'm buying one right
down the street from that one I said so

[3:19:30]
down the street from that one I said so
I'm I'm obviously I'm pulling out money
MH I said so I told him I need $100,000
they said that's fine we can we they
said they could only get me $100,000
out for something about Fanny made
guidelines which is true and I and I

[3:19:45]
guidelines which is true and I and I
said so then she said I I can get you I
can send you to a friend of mine who's a
loan officer she can get you a second
mortgage which she did I said then I
told her she could only get me 100,000
or so 190,000 the other and she said you
should get an equity line of credit if
you're going to be doing like you know

[3:20:00]
you're going to be doing like you know
um renovating properties so she sent me
to somebody they got me an equity line
of credit I said I said you know I
haven't committed fraud I said I
wouldn't know how to commit fraud if you
told me I said said what sounds more
reasonable a guy that works for a labor

[3:20:17]
reasonable a guy that works for a labor
company ripped off a bunch of banks for
over half a million dollars I said or
some loan officers got together and did
something illegal I said there's a
problem at the bank and he says I think
you've got a problem with the bank and

[3:20:31]
you've got a problem with the bank and
this guy goes nuts and while he's
screaming he needs to be arrested this
is fraud my loan officers have not done
anything illegal they wouldn't do that
he says look at his ID his ID is fake
his ID starts with

[3:20:47]
0000 South Carolina ID start with 00

ran me through

[3:22:00]

ncic which means he ran a Statewide
criminal database which means he thinks
I've been arrested three times for
prostitution in Vegas ah right I listen

car so he goes and by the way my car is
is in the
name Michael eer so Michael eer he

[3:23:30]
well he said it it says he's like he
says he's 5 foot1 like it was like 5'10
5'11 I'm clearly not 510 or 5'11 and
they all look at me and I go fellas with
a good pair of shoes like that and they
all go
H follow us Gary yeah I follow them back

[3:23:46]
H follow us Gary yeah I follow them back
to the police station Becky is calling

[3:24:04]
yeah immediately go get me a lawyer the
lawyer will be able to get me out on
bond cuz it'll I'll be arrested for
something stupid M I said it'll be
something like trying to cash a check

of somebody said it won't be all my IDs

[3:24:16]
of somebody said it won't be all my IDs
are real so it won't be for for a fake
ID so my ident my ID won't be in
question and most most um police
departments and sheriffs at that time
did not run your fingerprints through
aphys so they didn't because they charge

[3:24:31]
aphys so they didn't because they charge
them for that so they don't they don't
typically do it unless your identity is
in question mine wouldn't be I have a
valid driver's license or a valid ID in
that state so I go back she's screaming
she's like oh my God you don't
understand I just checked the I just
checked the um just checked the internet

[3:24:48]
checked the um just checked the internet
the
website you are number one on the secret
Services most wanted list and I was like
I got bigger problems right now they
just held me in the bank I'm following
them right now and she was like yeah get

[3:25:01]
them right now and she was like yeah get
on the get on the interstate go go I
cannot go the detectives in front of me
the cops are behind me they're escorting
me to the police listen she's like oh my
God run run I go look not a NASCAR
driver like I'm
driving it's it's a it's a sports car

[3:25:16]
driving it's it's a it's a sports car
but it's not going to outrun a radio or
a helicopter like I I'm not that's not
going to happen I know it looks it seems
nice I'm not that guy um so I was like I
can't I said look you don't understand I
was in handcuffs 30 minutes ago I just
talked my way out of him I'm going to
get out of this and I and I said the

[3:25:30]
get out of this and I and I said the
worst that happens is I'll be
arrested as Gary solivan you can get me
a police you can get me a um an attorney
he can get me out and she goes I'm not
getting you an attorney I'm not getting

[3:25:45]
getting you an attorney I'm not getting
you out on bond I'm not risking
everything I've got for you because she
has all the money we've Got7
800,000 at this point so oh and by the
way she's not even in North Carolina at

[3:26:00]
way she's not even in North Carolina at
this point she's relocated to Houston
Texas because when this scam broke fell
apart we were going to move to Texas so
we were already moving
there so but by the way just a small

[3:26:15]
there so but by the way just a small
tangent where do you store money in
situations like this that uh like when
you talk about 800,000 you have to keep
moving accounts to make sure it's not
accessible by FBI well there's about 600
or 700,000 in accounts but keep in mind
I'm getting it out in cash like there's

[3:26:31]
I'm getting it out in cash like there's
no Bitcoin there's no none of that stuff
exists so my you know I I I probably
should have bought diamonds or bought
gold or bought like I don't know any of
that all I could think of is go in
slowly be patient mhm um don't drain the

[3:26:46]
slowly be patient mhm um don't drain the
accounts you know fluctuate them like I
was writing getting cashiers checks from
one account to another so the balances
were doing this you know they weren't
just going they were doing this and then
one day boom they're gone okay got it so

[3:27:01]
one day boom they're gone okay got it so
got it so we got out like whatever we
got we've gotten out like 6 or 700,000
there's still like 600 or 700,000 in the
bank mhm but I I'm not going back I'm
done I actually be honest with you so
well look I I go in so I go into the

[3:27:15]
well look I I go in so I go into the
police
station and well first she says if you
go in the police station I'm done if you

went back and forth yeah and uh in and
out of uh alcohol you know drug programs
uh but like I said worked for State Farm

manager and so what they would do is
they they' put him into a 30-day program

stay there and they had they were the
only ones that had that kind of control

made a lot of money for State Farm and
he hired he hired and trained a ton of

[3:36:18]
he hired he hired and trained a ton of
agents and he had one of the top
performing
agencies so he was worth a lot to them
and uh but so I I end up what ends up
happening is I'm driving through I I get

[3:36:31]
happening is I'm driving through I I get
that phone that I was telling you about
and I call so I call talk to my mom
she's you know she's crying she's like I

what else do you need and she said I

[3:38:02]
what else do you need and she said I
think that you should think about
turning yourself in I said why well what
am I looking at she said well that's not
how it
works the way it works is you turn
yourself in
and you know we take that into
consideration I said no no no no I said

[3:38:15]
consideration I said no no no no I said
that's not good enough I said I'm not
not stupid enough to turn myself in and

break she's you're not that important

[3:39:00]

and I I remember
thinking who do you think you are like
like she like right like you're you're
just some little fraudster guy running
around you know like you're not a
terrorist MH you know like and I

[3:39:17]
almost I almost was like okay here's my

hang up the phone I'm gonna turn it off
anyway I'll I'll call you back she said

[3:39:30]
anyway I'll I'll call you back she said
all right whatever I hang up I turn off
the phone it turns out I found out later
when I ordered the Freedom of
Information Act she actually immediately
called US Marshals and they immediately
called took the phone number and tracked
back the phone and immediately had two
Marshals from uh Baton Rouge or go

[3:39:47]
Marshals from uh Baton Rouge or go
immediately to the place where I had
been
mhm damn oh listen yeah I mean they were
fast yeah she's and she's good too not
just that I I made the initial calls
sitting there in that where I went and

[3:40:01]
sitting there in that where I went and
bought the phone it was like a gas
station there was also like a a subway
station I had ordered like a Subway I
was eating a Subway playing on my
computer program the phone and make
phone calls so by the time I talked to
her and they're they're driving I by

[3:40:16]
her and they're they're driving I by
that point I walked and gotten into the
vehicle my vehicle and I leave but you
know who knows I don't know if they
showed up 30 minutes late I don't know
like I could have hung out like oh I'm
just going to finish my food could have
shown up so I go I I call her back an

[3:40:30]
shown up so I go I I call her back an
hour or two later she says
listen you know the first time he wasn't
hadn't got back with her then he did
then he came back he said seven years
he's got to turn him self in here so
okay seven years that's that seems like
a lot and I was like seven years and

[3:40:46]
a lot and I was like seven years and
that's seven years for for I goes that
and I kept saying is that seven years
for everything and she goes yeah that's
for everything I was like that's
everything like everything and that
happened like in Atlanta like in some
stuff that you don't know about she said

[3:41:01]
stuff that you don't know about she said
look what's important is you turn
yourself in in Tampa and I was like okay
well I'm closer to Atlanta why wouldn't
I turn myself in in Atlanta and she's
like look you know uh you don't want to
do that you don't want to do that well
because that would have been the Secret
Service would have gotten credit if I'd

[3:41:16]
Service would have gotten credit if I'd
walked in there right so you know and I
don't know anything about rivalries and
how they work at that time I do now but
so we go back and forth back and forth
and I continually ask her does that
include Atlanta and everything and at

[3:41:30]
include Atlanta and everything and at
some point I realized like oh she's just
not answering and so finally I said
listen you keep dodging this
question and she said all I can speak
for is Tampa so if you come back to

[3:41:45]
for is Tampa so if you come back to
Tampa and you cooperate against everyone
seven
years and she's telling me she wants me
to cooperate against my ex-wife and I'm
like I'm not going to do that I said my
ex-wife didn't do anything she doesn't
know anything she didn't do anything

[3:42:01]
know anything she didn't do anything
she's never you know well that's not
what I heard then she's going on and on
um and I was like no no I was like oh
wow I was like so that's just for and
she's like that's right I said all right
we're done she no wait I can call the
Atlanta us attorney I said nah lady I

[3:42:16]
Atlanta us attorney I said nah lady I
wouldn't believe you if you told me
water was wet I don't trust you and I
hung up the phone threw it out the
window and I end up going to
Charlotte drop off the U-Haul

[3:42:30]
Charlotte drop off the U-Haul
Van go to my I I would brought it back
to the dealer it's not like ianded I
brought it back um so I I bring bring it
back I go to my old apartment in
downtown
Charlotte and I remember thinking I

[3:42:45]
Charlotte and I remember thinking I
would be okay and I know by this
point that they they knew Michael
Eckert's name they had the address in
Charlotte so I know they they by this
point it's been five six days so I know
they've tracked him back

[3:43:01]
they've tracked him back
there so I figured if I could get my car
I'm fine so I go into the apartment
complex and it you know it's like five
it's one of those four five six story
apartment you know those are parking
things that stack up so I go into this

[3:43:15]
things that stack up so I go into this
you know underground it's not
underground but whatever this parking
garage thing so I go in I'm on like the
third floor or something I I look at my
car you know and I I get in my car and I
remember as soon as I walk drove out of
the the parking garage I was like I'm
good so I can go ahead and pull across

[3:43:31]
good so I can go ahead and pull across
the street and stop at Starbucks so I
stop at Starbucks I walk into Starbucks
I order Starbucks I'm standing there
waiting for the barista I look over and
it's two people from the apartment
complex staring at

[3:43:47]
complex staring at
me like that's I'm like and they're
they're whispering and pointing and and
I remember thinking this is like the
fifth of the month I hadn't paid my rent
I hadn't been there so I thought makes
sense maybe they did they like I'm
picturing an eviction notice or a

[3:44:01]
picturing an eviction notice or a
three-day notice on my door something
and I'm like okay and then one of them
bolts out the back the woman there's a
guy and a girl the woman walk runs out
the back he standing there staring at me
I get my my my my vinty vanilla latte

[3:44:16]
I get my my my my vinty vanilla latte
all right I get my little I get my frr
drink yeah so I get my frr drink I I
walk out I get into the car he follows
me get in the car I set everything up I
put my seat belt on I'm okay he's
standing there staring at me I you know

[3:44:30]
standing there staring at me I you know
I'm thinking something's wrong like
what's up and all of and I'm I check to
see there's no traffic I'm good I'm
about to about to leave and he starts
screaming he's right here he's right
here I look in the rear of your mirrror
there's two guys running towards the
back of my

[3:44:45]
back of my
car I punch it and I take off sounds
dramatic wasn't that dramatic I'd
already there was no cars I knew there
was no cars already pulling out you know
wasn't like a TJ hooker where I jumped
over the slid across the uh the hood and
SL you know they didn't catch the car

[3:45:01]
SL you know they didn't catch the car
and hang on the back but you know I so
they're running and I boom hit it did
you spill the coffee or no cuz it was
one of those little things it was
actually but but it you're making it
sound like you were pretty calm weren
you panicking here I was terrified yeah

[3:45:15]
you panicking here I was terrified yeah
terrified So you you're under under fear
you still operate like yeah I operate
like I it's funny you say that because
the the Secret
Service when they talk to these guys
they all the people that they spoke with

[3:45:32]
they all the people that they spoke with
said the same thing over and over again
the guy was a professional he never
seemed upset he never seemed agitated he
always he was never in a hurry yeah he

[3:45:45]
always he was never in a hurry yeah he
you know like but most of the time I I
wasn't because I you know it wasn't
until the police got involved or the law
federal law enforcement got involved
that I I started really you know getting
anxious so at that point I drive I take
off I drive about a mile down the road

[3:46:02]
off I drive about a mile down the road
who are the two guys by the way was it I
thought it was FBI I ordered the Freedom
of Information Act when I got to prison
at some point you know in the future
and it was it was US
Marshals right so sounds pretty dramatic

[3:46:15]
Marshals right so sounds pretty dramatic
to me US Marshals running towards your
car you pull it I mean I mean you know
but it's all right it's hard not to tell
it like it's dramatic I understand it
was there was not much traffic it was
okay it's not like their you know their
fingers were at the back of the car
they're holding on you know but it was

[3:46:30]
they're holding on you know but it was
yeah if I had waited an an extra 20
seconds yeah they would have been on my
car they would have been right there at
the door did you consider giving up
there or
no no all I could think of was listen my
my instinct is get out is go go go go go
go you're already on the run I'm already

[3:46:46]
go you're already on the run I'm already
in trouble it's not like they're going
to be they're going to it's they're
going to add anything although to be
honest you know it only got worse
because at that point actually at that
point I drive down the road I stop at a
homeless facility I survey three guys
I'm a mile down the road like looking
back on I think what were you thinking

[3:47:02]
back on I think what were you thinking
but there were three three homeless guys
that were in their early 30s and they
were they were all Caucasian that's hard
to find so trust me I've looked spent
hours before track finding these guys so

[3:47:15]
hours before track finding these guys so
that's like the the the golden thing
you're looking for is white guys in
their 30s right cuz that's I was in my
30s that I wasn't an old man like I am
now so I I survey them I drive straight

episode going to be released in a few in

[4:05:31]
episode going to be released in a few in
a month or so so I'm terrified I've at
this point I've been on the run three
years and I'm like I there's lots of
things things I could care less about
Fortune I don't know anybody that reads
Fortune Bloomberg come on I hang out
with I'm hanging out with contractors

[4:05:45]
with I'm hanging out with contractors
and laborers and you know I'm not
hanging out with these guys so you know
local news who cares you know even even
local news channels you know I don't
care but dat line there weren't 400
channels back then you know so Dateline

[4:06:02]
channels back then you know so Dateline
comes out even if you don't see it the
first time they're going to rerun it in
3 months or 6 months or 5 year 10 years
from now they might rerun it again my
face is going to be on it so I could be
perfectly fine five years from now in
one day I the Barista that I go to every

[4:06:16]
one day I the Barista that I go to every
every other day look looks at dat line
and goes oh my God that's Mr Johnson or
that's Mr Thomas or whatever so the
point is is that I was like I got to go
I can't stay here I got to get out of
the country so I was going to go to um

[4:06:31]
the country so I was going to go to um
well we really started doing research
and Amanda ended up saying Australia
Australia at the time I don't know how
it is now but at the time if you went to
Australia with like it's like
$100,000 and a business plan you could

[4:06:46]
$100,000 and a business plan you could
become a permanent resident alien you
you you can't vote but you can buy
property you can open a business but you
can't get a job and they didn't require
a fingerprints so there's no criminal um

[4:07:01]
a fingerprints so there's no criminal um
background check now if you wanted to be
a citizen you have to get an FBI
criminal background check like I no I'm
so I was like wow I can go there and
start a business and I'm going to start
show up with a couple million so what we
do is we start refinancing houses we

[4:07:16]
do is we start refinancing houses we
start pulling out money as quick as we
can I'm asking guys laborers guys that I
work with my general contractor my real
estate agent hey man can you cash this
check for six grand you C nobody says no
everybody yeah no problem no problem no

[4:07:30]
everybody yeah no problem no problem no
few guys like yeah man if you give me
10% yeah I'll give you 10% so that's
happening we're pulling out cash
um one
day a Manda gives Trina a bunch of

[4:07:47]
day a Manda gives Trina a bunch of
checks and asks her to cash them that
Sparks a
conversation that like what it was
happening she confides
in by this point by the way Amanda knows

[4:08:00]
in by this point by the way Amanda knows
who I am MH so by this point she's
actually came across the letter that I
wrote to my parents when I left Tampa so
she's figured out who I
am she tells Trina his name's Matt Cox
dat Line's coming out we're goingon to

[4:08:16]
dat Line's coming out we're goingon to
we're leaving we got to get a bunch of
cash and Trina goes okay I'll cash the
checks what she does instead is she
calls the Secret Service they watch my
house for three days I come home one
day they pull the cars

[4:08:31]
day they pull the cars
up and they arrest
me so you know it's a little bit longer
than that but that's shorter just a
short version of me getting arrested and
you know I probably skipped over so
simple because you gotten the way with

[4:08:45]
simple because you gotten the way with
much more complex
situations it's women man it's women uh
joking they also are the thing that make
life worthwhile listen God bless Trina
she did the right thing it honestly

[4:09:00]
she did the right thing it honestly
based on there you go back to the right
thing but I mean based on what she saw
uhuh based on what the Secret Service
told her
and what in the the articles that she's
reading I'm a bad guy I mean I'm a bad
guy in general right so I don't deserve
loyalty I I don't think so um I'm

[4:09:17]
loyalty I I don't think so um I'm
ripping people off and she's thinking
that her friend is in
danger you know the FBI saying I have a
weapon he's he's dangerous he's got a
weapon you know we believe he's armed
and dangerous when I was in Florida I

[4:09:31]
and dangerous when I was in Florida I
had a concealed weapons permit but I
gotten rid of both my guns when I was
placed on probation I've never had one
since I've never touched a gun since but
they use that to say you know they said
oh he had a concealed weapon for him
okay well then he's armed in dangerous

[4:09:46]
okay well then he's armed in dangerous
like there's these little things and
think they're telling her read this
article look he forces girls to fall in
love with them then he he that's what
she's going to do your friend so she
negotiated a also I think she got 10,000
I think which is embarrassing I'm I'm
ashamed that she she got

[4:10:01]
ashamed that she she got
$110,000 and said everything yeah and
and told them this is where he is his
name is Joseph Carter you know he's uh
you know this is where he is they watch
it they grab me they arrest me they
bring me
downtown you know what what did what did

[4:10:17]
downtown you know what what did what did
you feel like when you got it didn't
feel good bro it was bad it was a bad
day it was a bad day first of
all Casina Royale was coming out on

[4:10:31]
Friday yeah it was the first Daniel
Craig as James Bond and the whole week
I'd been telling Amanda I'm want to go

thought we could go to dinner that's

they put the handcuffs on you remember
the first thing I thought of I'm not
going to fucking to see see royal I'm
not going to get to see it not going to
see and I saw it about about five six

[4:11:00]
see and I saw it about about five six
years later and when on the
institution's movie channel you know was
nice it's not the same but um yeah so I
they they bring me to Nashville then
they transport me to all over the place

[4:11:15]
they transport me to all over the place
I go on you know uh Conair they fly me
to
Oklahoma uh they fly me to
Atlanta then I I get go to Atlanta I'm
placed in the US Marshalls holdover uh I
get assigned an attorney go in front of

[4:11:31]
get assigned an attorney go in front of
the
judge plead not guilty uh meet with my
attorney you always plead not guilty you
know whenever you think people say can
you believe that he plead not guilty
that's the first thing nobody walks in
and pleads guilty you plead not guilty

[4:11:45]
and pleads guilty you plead not guilty
while you kind of figure out what you're
going to do so I plead not guilty
there's no bond uh obviously I've got
they caught me when they caught me I had
four or five
passports
so that's no good um they they charged
me with uh you know um bank fraud

[4:12:02]
me with uh you know um bank fraud
conspiracy commit bank fraud wire fraud
mail fraud um
passport fraud conspiracy or what was
the other um aggravated identity theft
money laundering use of a fraudulent

[4:12:17]
money laundering use of a fraudulent
passport uh you know and there's like
there's there's like you know 30 counts
of this 20 counts of this 20 but none of
that matters like even if you just took
the dropped all the counts to one count
and stacked them it's like 150 something

[4:12:30]
and stacked them it's like 150 something
years not so everything everything they
could and that's so they always say
you're looking at 150,000 you know your
lawyers they're like this you're not
looking at that looking at 54 years what
that's no better that's no better so uh
yeah so uh my lawyer comes in and sees

[4:12:46]
yeah so uh my lawyer comes in and sees
me one day you know like our first
meeting and I she says you know I'm uh
Millie Millie
dun and she says uh listen I've looked
at everything for first they say you're

[4:13:00]
at everything for first they say you're
responsible for it's like 25 or 20 or 30
25 or 26
million in loss and I'm like that's I've
never that's not true that's not true
and I was like you know not even I said
not even potential law there's no way I
mean there's not way and then they come

[4:13:16]
mean there's not way and then they come
back she comes back and she says well
they're
saying 19 million now it's not
possible I I didn't no so when the FBI
is saying like 40 million they're saying

[4:13:30]
is saying like 40 million they're saying
11.5 in in Tampa plus 40 million for the
mortgage company so that it ends up
being like plus what I stole on the run
it ends up being like 55 million but she
gets them to drop like the 40 like
that's that's that's his Brokers that's

[4:13:45]
that's that's that's his Brokers that's
this that's that drop it and they're
like we he's so done it doesn't matter
they Dro that so it ends up it ends up
being like 15 million and then it's down
to what is he o they said 9.5 and I got
it down to like six million so you know
which you know I'm good for so uh what

[4:14:03]
which you know I'm good for so uh what
ends up happening is they've charged me
with all these things and
and and she's like okay you know you're
like you can you can complete guilty and

[4:14:16]
like you can you can complete guilty and
you can go with the sentence and
guidelines which is going to be like
she's like I mean it depends she said it
might be whatever 54 years she was but
if they run them you know concurrent or
consecutive depending on which one they
do she said it most likely it ends up

[4:14:30]
do she said it most likely it ends up
being like 30 years you know it's like
that's not good that's not good good so
we kind of go back and forth back and
forth and figure out try and figure out
where I'm what I'm looking
at now as we go through the whole thing

[4:14:46]
at now as we go through the whole thing
we end up she ends up with she ends up
saying you
know she knocks off a bunch of stuff
that they're saying I did you know um
enhancements because you'll have a base
level en a base level of let's say uh

[4:15:01]
level en a base level of let's say uh
level eight you know that should be that
should be maybe a few years but they
start adding on enhancements you know um
did he what did what he do was it
sophisticated yes okay three levels for

[4:15:15]
sophisticated yes okay three levels for
sophisticated means um were there more
than how many victims were there more
than 50 victims yes okay that's six more
levels okay uh did he change the
jurisdiction to evade detection yes
that's four more levels okay did he they
start adding boom boom and when you
start adding up all those

[4:15:31]
start adding up all those
levels plus your criminal history and I
have a big criminal history because I
was already on Federal proam probation
and I committed a new crime on federal
probation so that was another
enhancement and this you know this case
so I'm like a category I like category

[4:15:46]
so I'm like a category I like category
two or three so they come back and
they're
saying I forget it's like 20 well they
don't come back right away but she ends
up saying you're probably looking at 14
years okay that's reasonable that's

[4:16:02]
years okay that's reasonable that's
reasonable and so she's
saying so we get the when we get the PSI
back we eventually get what's called a
precentage report they're saying 26
years well they really said 32
years and I argued and we got it down to

[4:16:17]
years and I argued and we got it down to
26 years and four months that's what it
is it's 316 months that's how they do it
in
months doesn't sting that much I guess
if you say
months yeah so she says to me Millie

[4:16:32]
months yeah so she says to me Millie
sits down with me and she says
listen you got a call cooperate and I
was like okay and she said because
you're you're you're guilty you're
extremely guilty she's like you can't go

[4:16:45]
extremely guilty she's like you can't go
to
trial and she said so you need to
cooperate I was like well what do I get
if a cooperate she said the way it works
is you
cooperate and you hope for the best and
I was like are you serious you tell them
everything you know and you hope for the

[4:17:00]
everything you know and you hope for the
best and she's like the the part of the
problem is she said everybody in Tampa
has cooperated Rebecca has
cooperated everyone across the board has
cooperated there's nobody that hasn't
cooperated by the way when you say
cooperated you mean they're an inform

[4:17:15]
cooperated you mean they're an inform
they told they AKA snitched right they
they came in they sat down with their
lawyer and they said this is what he did
he did this he did that they showed him
documents yes yes yes that's my
signature I didn't know what that was I
you know they everything was my fault
they didn't do anything it was all me so

[4:17:31]
they didn't do anything it was all me so
they've all cooperated and they haven't
been charged they've been indicted
they're all named as unnamed
co-conspiracy MERS on my indictment so
I've got like 12 people even there's
like probably 20 people that are
involved but there's like 12 of them
that are so I've got all these names you
know uh KB DL c y you know it's like I

[4:17:49]
know uh KB DL c y you know it's like I
know who that is like I know who DW

know who these people are and so there's
just a list of there's like 12 of them
you know plus
me uh
so and some of some of them walked in

[4:18:02]
so and some of some of them walked in
and said I'm guilty I just want to be
plead guilty the the the girl uh Allison
mhm she walked in said I I'm I'm too I'm
tired of waiting for you to come get me

[4:18:15]

just want to plead guilty and and they
sentenced her and she went to jail she
got like 36 months or 30
months she called the
prison the she went to the low security

[4:18:32]

it was a female prison at the time
female Camp called the camp and asked
for if she could come by for a tour
before she went and they went excuse me
she said well I'm going to be there for
about two years so I'd like to come and

[4:18:46]
about two years so I'd like to come and
is there like a tour I can take because

[4:19:00]
here you got to love that like yeah I
mean I thought I was I didn't think I
thought I wasn't uh prepared I mean
there's no tour so uh Becky Becky got 70
months but when I got caught and when I
was sentenced they reduced it to like 30
or no 40 to 40 months they reduced

[4:19:16]

right so where did the sentencing end up
so I should say first on the
cooperation yeah subject my lawyer

[4:19:47]
cooperation yeah subject my lawyer
wanted me to cooperate and by this point
I realized like you don't have a choice
you know no that's that's not true I
could have been a gangster yeah what
does it mean to be a gangster in this

[4:20:00]
does it mean to be a gangster in this
case like a standup guy I could have
said I'll just take it give me 54 years
go fuck yourself I'm not going to snitch
on nobody and I know you look at me and
you think tough guy mhm I'm not a tough
guy at all I'm not doing 50 some odd

[4:20:18]
guy at all I'm not doing 50 some odd
years like I'm not doing it I don't want
to do 30 years MH uh you know I was
hoping for you know I I knew it wasn't
possible but I would have satisfied for
another slap on the hand like I got the

[4:20:30]
another slap on the hand like I got the
first time I really thought I deserved
honestly when you if when my lawyer
asked me what do you really think you're
deserving I thought I I deserve 10 years
you know I deserve 10 years
but so she said look they want to talk
to you so the FBI well first the the

[4:20:47]
to you so the FBI well first the the
Secret Service flies in MH they come
in and uh they interview me who's more
terrifying FBI Secret Service you know
the Secret Service was so

[4:21:00]
the Secret Service was so
overwhelmingly
professional uh the FBI and really only
the one of the FBI agents that
interviewed me I don't know how he's an
agent I I don't know he was just
ineffective incompetent oh so it's the

[4:21:16]
ineffective incompetent oh so it's the
competence issue the other one was
Candace oh you met her eventually of
course I did of course she's what was
her 511 wearing 3-in heels yeah she's a
giant and in impeccable shape M

[4:21:33]
giant and in impeccable shape M
attractive one of the angriest human
beings I've ever met and every FBI agent
that I've met since then that knows her
and I mention they all say what you
think of her and I'm like what why they

[4:21:45]
think of her and I'm like what why they
go I was like kind of aggressive they
yeah yeah she's a bulldog she's a I mean
all of them are like yeah yeah she's uh
she's something else like Secret Service
is a little bit more like Prof personal
very you know it's their job it's like
hey this is just my job they're polite

[4:22:00]
hey this is just my job they're polite
professional you know that's it so it's
just this is just a this is my 9o5 so
but they they they come and they fly in
and they meet with me for 3 or 4
days one of the one of the funny things

[4:22:16]
days one of the one of the funny things
is that when I first first sat down with
them um the one guy's name was a Dan
like BR brazowski or something so he he
sits down he says look before we get
started we we need to talk about

[4:22:30]
started we we need to talk about
something and I said what he said we

we need to talk I'm like no no no no I
don't have nothing I gave you everything
I all the accounts you got everything

[4:22:47]

obstruction charge at this point I was
like I I don't have anything and he says
we know you have money we know you have
money in different IDs different
identities names and I go what are you

[4:23:00]
identities names and I go what are you
talking about and he pulls out a bank
statement and he slaps it on the counter
and he goes you've got money in southern
Exchange Bank you've got $190,000 in
southern Exchange Bank and I look at it

[4:23:15]

he goes it's a bank website and I go
yeah but it's it was well done MH and he

[4:23:47]
yeah but it's it was well done MH and he
goes oh God and I go yeah convincing and
I went I go it's all an
illusion I said the bank doesn't exist
it's a fake bank I made the bank made it
when I was in um not even in Tampa I

[4:24:00]
when I was in um not even in Tampa I
think I I got into uh Nashville when I
made it and I was like yeah it's an the
the bank statements like they're color
bank statements I'm like yeah well no
shit so you know there's no I said a
matter of fact I said who did you leave
a I haven't paid for the service in

[4:24:16]
a I haven't paid for the service in
months and he turned around and he
called it and it went you know you know
it it was disconnected and I was like
how do you not know that's a bank well
it turns out there was a southern
Exchange Bank and i' used their Bank
routing number and so I mean I always

[4:24:31]
routing number and so I mean I always
thought that was funny that they it's
like well I remember really for a split
second there I was I was kind of like
really embarrassed that they caught me I
was like I can't believe this you're the
Secret Service anyway I talked to them I
you know there's there's really as far

[4:24:45]
you know there's there's really as far
as the Secret Service is concerned
there's just not much I can tell
them there's you know like it was me
Becky's already told them everything
Amanda's already told them everything
it's not hard to track that when when
they raided my house they've got boxes

[4:25:00]
they raided my house they've got boxes
and boxes so it's laid out we still it
took forever like I still went through
everything I explained how I got the
driver's licenses how I made the the
bank statements how I made the birth
certificates how I the whole social

[4:25:15]
certificates how I the whole social
engineering of figuring out how to what
these little loopholes are it's it's
like seven days total with these guys so
you mean like like question yeah it was
like they question me for all day and
then they take me back to the Marshall's
hold over and then the next morning I

[4:25:30]
hold over and then the next morning I
wake up and they chain me up again and
bring me back what's that like what's
that process of questioning like are
they I mean you're somebody who is
exceptionally good at
conversation charismatic it was part of
uh the games you played uh are they good

[4:25:47]
uh the games you played uh are they good
at
conversation um I mean they're you know
the problem is they're not there to
shoot the shit you see what I'm saying
like they have a an agenda but they have
to use their words to get information

[4:26:00]
to use their words to get information
out of you aren't they trying to
manipulate you I'm not I'm not holding
anything back okay
I'm not it's not like I'm sparing Jim
you know it's trust me Jim's got to go I
mean you're looking at you're like 20
some odd years but Jim can do five bill

[4:26:16]
some odd years but Jim can do five bill
can do some Tom can do six I don't even
like I don't even like uh Jerry Jerry
can do 20 you know so I'm I'm I'm I'm
ready I'm ready to cut everybody's
throat but you're not guaranteed that
that you're not you're getting anything

[4:26:30]
that you're not you're getting anything
for that right in all my time I've seen
one one time where an inmate got a a
guarantee to have his sentence reduced
and it was signed uh by the head of the
FBI was Robert Muller gave it to him to
have a conversation with them that's the

[4:26:45]
have a conversation with them that's the
only time I've ever seen that document
okay so a lot of days with both the
Secret Service and the FBI so FBI was uh
Candice was uh irritated didn't like me
and I remember when I uh she un took the
Cuffs off I was like rubbing my wrist

[4:27:00]
Cuffs off I was like rubbing my wrist
she goes your wrist hurt and I go yeah
and she goes get used to it I mean she
was just an asshole yeah just all around
not that she didn't have a right to be
but everybody else was professional you
know so
uh oh cace so we uh we you know we we we

[4:27:17]
uh oh cace so we uh we you know we we we
talked for three or four days with the
uh FBI and you know they asked a ton of
questions they brought a ton of they
brought documents you know so it's like
hey who signed this you know it's like
oh that's not that's not my signature
that's so and so signature or I sign

[4:27:31]
that's so and so signature or I sign
that I sign that I signed that that's so
and so where'd this check go who is this
oh that's so and so you know
you're looking over everything one of
the things they wanted to know about was
which I never talked about because it
see seems so minor is I bribed a

[4:27:45]
see seems so minor is I bribed a
politician I got him elected because we
got him elected to the uh city council
so he could vote to get our our the Lots
we bought like a hundred vacant Lots in
eore city and I wanted them all they
were all single family we wanted them

[4:28:00]
were all single family we wanted them
own multif family and so we bribed him
and got him elected that doesn't seem
minor it's not as sexy as the rest of
the stuff that's pretty I
mean that's a whole another thing like I
I mean you know all right so what
happened is when they got all of the

[4:28:18]
happened is when they got all of the
bank accounts they see all these checks
going to Kevin White and so they're like
why did James red donate $500 to Kevin
White why did Brandon green donate why

[4:28:30]
White why did Brandon green donate why
did Allan Duncan donate why did and you
know so I had explained to oh yeah well
he was we wanted him to be city
councilman so we paid you know gave him
a bunch of money so he could run the ad
so he could get elected so he could then
get all of our stuff but because he
never did you know I took off on the run

[4:28:45]
never did you know I took off on the run
before he was able to do that um and and
then he ended up getting uh not long too
too long after that he ended up about
five six years later he ended up getting
uh um indicted for bribery but not mine
on somebody else's case can I take a

[4:29:01]
on somebody else's case can I take a
small tangent here and ask how many
politicians do you think commit crimes
are a little bit or a lot
criminals I mean I think there's some
ways that are you they're they're
they're seemingly legal the

[4:29:15]
they're seemingly legal the
forementioned gray area well that's not
gray like I I this guy was like at one
point I couldn't find anybody to write
$500 checks anymore so I just gave him
cash like I'm just handing them $7
$8,000 $10,000 in cash

[4:29:31]
$8,000 $10,000 in cash
so uh but you know I think most of them
have legal ways to make ungodly amounts
of money for you know
influence you know but is it legal no
it's they're politicians they've made it

[4:29:46]
it's they're politicians they've made it
so that it's not illegal if you really
sat down and explained it to
someone you
know the average person would say that
that's that's not right that oh no no
that's legal so okay so at the end of
these few

[4:30:00]
these few
days um what was the sentencing like
yeah I I end up uh I go to sentencing I
I get my PSI back and it's 32 years to
life
and yeah and

[4:30:15]
and yeah and
so we argue about it uh with the
prosecutor just before sentencing and
they get it down to they 26 years four
months and then Millie says listen don't
worry cuz I'm trying to backpedal at

[4:30:31]
worry cuz I'm trying to backpedal at
this point I'm like I I might as well go
to trial if I lost at trial I couldn't
get more more than 30 that you can't
well more than 32 years cuz you can
can't get life 32 was a Max it's just a
mistake he said 32 years to life you
can't get life so it was like the most I

[4:30:45]
can't get life so it was like the most I
can get is 32 years so I was like I'll
go to trial might as well go to trial
and see if I can get them to reduce some
of these enhancements she insists that
she can get the enhancements knocked
down and if you read they actually read
the enhancements some of the
enhancements they didn't apply to

[4:31:00]
enhancements they didn't apply to
me so she goes and and you know I
believed her and and I think she she
made a valid argument we get to we go to
sentencing my mom's there she's crying
my dad's there he's looks at he's
looking at me like he's
disgusted and uh crowd there's a a whole

[4:31:16]
disgusted and uh crowd there's a a whole
bunch of reporters like the whole place
is
packed and I'm I plead guilty Millie
gets up my law gets up and she argues uh
these enhancements and every single time
you know the judge is
like I

[4:31:31]
like I
disagree you know overruled it's like
boom five more years years you know bam
six more years bam because if she had
won the enhancement she argued I would
have got 14
years he now keep in mind too prior to

[4:31:47]
years he now keep in mind too prior to
this a a month or two prior to this the
pro us attorney had
called Millie and said look dat line
Date Line had already come out by the
way remember I was worried about dat
line coming out well it had come out but

[4:32:01]
line coming out well it had come out but
they wanted to do a followup because it
came out like a month or two after I got
arrested and they were saying hey we
want to recut it with interviews with
him well Gail McKenzie wants that's the
US attorney she wants me to do

[4:32:16]
US attorney she wants me to do
that and she says I'll consider that
substantial assistance now when you
cooperate with the government they
consider it substantial assistance
that's what they call it so I cooperate
with you it's substantial assistance she
says if he's interviewed by Dateline

[4:32:31]
says if he's interviewed by Dateline
we'll consider it substantial assistance
and Millie says you have to do it by the
way what's the idea behind that that
they like you serve as a warning for
others or something like that yeah
exactly it's a he you know you become a
cautionary tale like don't let this

[4:32:46]
cautionary tale like don't let this
happen to you so I go and I I'm
interviewed by dayline um I Keith Morris
or whatever his name is you know that
guy Mr cock schw you know that guy um so
he comes and he he he interviews me

[4:33:01]
he comes and he he he interviews me
Becky's interviewed I'm interviewed
Amanda's interviewed like uh Allison is
interviewed um like everybody the secret
service agent I think is interviewed
like everybody prosecutors
interviewed uh you know I it's funny at

[4:33:15]
interviewed uh you know I it's funny at
the time I would have I was when I
watched it I was like that's not true
and that's not true and that and and the
honest it's like 99% true it's like
looking back on it yeah you know I'm I'm
like you know like my Audi TT wasn't

[4:33:31]
like you know like my Audi TT wasn't
blue it was silver you know it it's just
stupid but anyway so I'm interviewed by
them and they recut it and they air the
video so I you said this was substantial
assistance and then the other thing is I

[4:33:45]
assistance and then the other thing is I
was interviewed by the FBI and the
Secret Service now my my lawyer calls
the prosecutor the night before
sentencing and says look he was
interviewed by Dateline and he he was
interviewed by the Secret Service and
the

[4:34:00]
the
FBI and if you do that you said you'd
reduce his sentence you'd consider it
stantial assistance and you would reduce
his sentence what are you going to ask
for his sentence to be tomorrow at
sentencing and she said we did consider

[4:34:15]
sentencing and she said we did consider
it substantial assistance and it's just
not
enough what do you mean nobody was
arrested yes but what about dat
line Millie I I don't know what to tell
you it just wasn't enough we considered
it we we considered it we will consider

[4:34:31]
it we we considered it we will consider
it and they did consider it so oh man
yeah that's like the that's you have to
really you know the meaning of words is
so important I'm going to use that at
some point I will consider I'll consider
it I considered it it's not so and still

[4:34:47]
it I considered it it's not so and still
feel the same she's so she calls me I'm
I'm crushed and she's like but look you
know they're still investigating they're
going to make these arrests and so when
you get a sentence reduction at
sentencing it's called a
5k1 when you get a sentence reduction

[4:35:02]
5k1 when you get a sentence reduction
after sentencing it's called a rule 35
so she said we'll file a rule 35 as soon
as the arrests are made okay so I go to
sentencing and Millie says you're going
to get 14 years I'm going to argue these
enhancements she argues the enhancements

[4:35:16]
enhancements she argues the enhancements
she loses the enhancements not that
she's not an amazing attorney she's an
amazing attorney the judge wanted to
hammer me he hammered me you know Millie
was a great attorney she was always
polite to me and by the way to this day

[4:35:31]
polite to me and by the way to this day
we'll answer my phone call most you most
public defenders you call them now you
call them after your sentence they they
don't answer your
call great person thank you Millie I
didn't give her anything to work with

[4:35:45]
didn't give her anything to work with
you know it's like I'm so overwhelmingly
guilty it's like there's no defense so I
end up getting senten 26
years um it's a lot of years I would
like to tell you that they they when
they gave me the time you know that I I

[4:36:03]
they gave me the time you know that I I
was stoic and I I stood there and I
I took it in you know but but the truth
is I cried like a baby like a small
child like you've never seen anyone cry
like this in your life I was

[4:36:16]
like this in your life I was
just how did I get 26 how what did I do
to get 26 years like murderers rapists
I've met guys that kidnapped guys that
got

[4:36:30]
156 so yeah hey I were you scared
I mean you know does a pope wear a funny
hat like of course I was SC
terrified yeah I mean you know but I
kept telling myself ah they're going to
reduce the sentent they'll reduce it

[4:36:46]
reduce the sentent they'll reduce it
they'll reduce it they'll reduce it like
okay okay okay it's going to be okay
it's going to be okay um you know but it
wasn't okay I I I got I got moved to
Coleman the
Coleman complex in Coleman Florida the

[4:37:00]
Coleman complex in Coleman Florida the
federal correctional Coleman complex in
Coleman Florida mhm which is thear
largest complex in the nation uh Federal
complex in the nation there's a there's
a at that time there was a a camp which
was a female Camp there was a medium

[4:37:16]
was a female Camp there was a medium
security a low security prison for men a
medium security prison and two
penitentiaries and so I get moved to the
medium now I'm moved to the medium not
because like that's where like real
criminals go right like I'm I'm a soft

[4:37:32]
criminals go right like I'm I'm a soft
white boy like I'm no danger to anybody
like I I Hur I hurt someone's feelings
once but other than that I'm I'm I'm not
a pro I'm not going to be a problem but
if you have more than 20 years to serve

[4:37:45]
if you have more than 20 years to serve
you have to go to a medium so even
though my security level said this guy
should be in a camp MH I had 20 years so
if you have you can't go to a camp till
you have less than 10 so as soon as I
given 26 years and and you know 26 years

[4:38:00]
given 26 years and and you know 26 years
they they knock off three but you still
have three years to get below 20 so they
go to the medium so I go to the medium
and their guy getting stabbed the very
first day people are being
stabbed I get locked into you go to my
cell meet my C they scream lock down
somebody got stabbed in the wreck yard I

[4:38:17]
somebody got stabbed in the wreck yard I
remember I asked that my C which I met
20 minutes earlier I was like what's you
know he's like hey we got to get in the
cell I was like what's going on he
somebody got stabbed in the yard and I
go somebody just got killed and he goes
nah they just stabbed him up a little
bit and I
thought you're in a place where they

[4:38:32]
thought you're in a place where they
they stabbed him up a little bit like
you're not prepared for this this bro
you got to get out of here yeah so
anyway I go to the medium I'm there like
what was the first day and night when
remember I already had been locked up in
the county and they're they're County

[4:38:45]
the county and they're they're County
jails where they call them us they're US
Marshal they're holdovers but they're
really County jails they just keep you
with the with the um Federal guys so I'm
not mixed in with like hobos and you
know people like that like I'm I'm mixed
in with the federal people so already

[4:39:00]
in with the federal people so already
felt like a like a prison yeah it's it's
it's a prison
I mean it's it's jail but it's prison
and andless you've been locked up you
don't really know the difference so it's
it's a jail jails suck jails are much
worse the whole time I was locked up in
these in the jails waiting to be

[4:39:16]
these in the jails waiting to be
sentenced guys were like I just want to
get sentenced and go go to prison bro
just and I was like why does everybody
keep saying that like prison's worse
than this like I saw shank Shaw Shank
it's horrible and they're like bro
prison listen prison I can walk the

[4:39:30]
prison listen prison I can walk the
wreck yard I could go to the movie room
watch movies I'll listen within right
after count for this 4:00 count they
count everybody at 4 so they are like
right after count I'm going to go to
commissary somebody's going to buy me an
ice cream I'm going to be eating an ice

[4:39:45]
ice cream I'm going to be eating an ice
cream walking on the wreck yard the
first day like and I'm you know it's
been months and months and months and
I've been locked up in this County jail
and I'm thinking I want to go to prison
like that sounds nice I'd love I'd like
an ice cream yeah but there was a
stabbing on the first day well you know

[4:40:00]
stabbing on the first day well you know
everybody kept telling me I was going to
go to a camp you're going to go to a
camp you're going to go to a love I see
you know and and honestly I I was very
quickly I was walking on the wyard I was
you know so I was at the medium I got
there you know it's it's a real prison

[4:40:18]
there you know it's it's a real prison
with the doors bam and they can open the
little tray thing and feed you out of
the tray and there's a a stainless steel
toilet and sink and you know they have
that in the county too but you know it's
it's exactly what you think of prison as

[4:40:30]
it's exactly what you think of prison as
being but it feels like a fundamentally
different experience when it's 26 years
and the door locks and yeah so I yeah I
have a
s and but I'm also they sent me to a
prison where guys have tons of guys have

[4:40:45]
prison where guys have tons of guys have
30 40 50 years you know life sentences
there's there's gangsters there there's
uh there's murderers there's serial
killers there's you know really bad guys
uh there's you know there's guys that

[4:41:00]
uh there's you know there's guys that
are you know trying to take advantage of
guys right you like sexually yeah um but
by the time I got there I'd heard all
the you know how you can get yourself in
trouble you know how you can like don't

[4:41:16]
trouble you know how you can like don't
go in somebody else's cell you don't
know the guy you're not 100% sure do not
go in his cell don't even go near his
cell don't go into places where you
people can close a door behind you or
they can trap you in an area don't
there's all these things that I've been

[4:41:31]
there's all these things that I've been
told not to do again for second sexual
reasons right because I'm I'm a
small guy in prison yeah you know track
away dude yeah it's a problem it's a
problem

[4:41:46]
problem
this yeah it's bad it's all bad well
it's good in the outside world but bad
in the you know yeah my fear was there
make me shave my head to make sure that
the mop wig fits correctly but there's

[4:42:00]
the mop wig fits correctly but there's
certain things that I always hate to say
this but I and it does this is the
simplest way to say it is that
if you get stabbed in prison you had it
coming you did something they're not
running around just stabbing people you
did something you and the things that
get you hurt is you argue over the TV

[4:42:18]
get you hurt is you argue over the TV
what channel you want to watch you got
50 80 guys watching One TV don't argue
about it like it's none of just not
worth it um borrowing things that and
not returning them that's a problem

[4:42:31]
not returning them that's a problem
running up debts that's a big problem
you know
gambling gossiping you know those are
the problem those things get you hurt
not being polite be respectful I'm super
respectful so I was

[4:42:46]
respectful so I was
respectful um very quickly when I got to
Coleman there are continuing education
courses one of the courses is
residential real
estate the guy that was running the
residential real estate didn't want to
do it anymore because he was doing legal

[4:43:02]
do it anymore because he was doing legal
work and it just was taking too much
time so he came to me he said listen you
just got here you got a real estate
background like nobody else does can you
take over this class and I was like um
sure so I looked at his curriculum I
kind of rewrote a little bit and I
started teaching the residential real

[4:43:16]
started teaching the residential real
estate class and at one point I was
teaching two classes like a semester or
a
quarter and these guys loved it like
everybody they all think they're going
to get out and flip houses so I started
you know from the fundamentals I talk
about credit how to borrow how hard

[4:43:30]
about credit how to borrow how hard
money lenders different types of Bor
like everything and you know guys are
walking it's the first time in my life
this was funny not that I think I was
really in ever in a position for this to
happen this was really odd though
probably the second or third class when
guys are leaving and I'm having to check

[4:43:46]
guys are leaving and I'm having to check
them off the roll multiple guys are
stopping and saying yo bro putting their
hand out and shaking my hand and going
good class was a good class bro then I
have guys coming to me telling me
hey what are you teaching these guys

[4:44:00]
hey what are you teaching these guys
what do you mean they he go my s's
telling me he's going to get out and
make millions I'm Cox's real estate
class I'm telling you I can do this I'm
going to be a millionaire and it's like
this flipping houses like this is not
yeah but the truth is if you know it is
the flipping houses was what I basically

[4:44:18]
the flipping houses was what I basically
told these guys especially the drug
dealers right you're a drug dealer and
you were raised in the projects and
you're going back to the projects like
this is this is the
one industry or you know that you will

[4:44:31]
one industry or you know that you will
Thrive at because you're a hustler mhm
you're you're not afraid a 45-year-old
divorced white woman is not going into
the hood knocking on doors to try and
flip houses but you will and you know
everybody in the neighborhood and you'll
knock on those doors and you'll hustle

[4:44:46]
knock on those doors and you'll hustle
and you'll you've been told no before
and you don't care and you're not scared
you're not this and there's tons of
money to be made in in lower income
areas and so I I and then when I go
through the whole thing and how you can
leverage uh you know leverage your
credit to borrow money to get into the

[4:45:00]
credit to borrow money to get into the
property and R do the renovations with
very little money down and I do the
whole thing
these guys like they loved it so I was
and and what that did for me was two
things one if you got to the class 40
guys show up before the class and I say
look if you don't want to go you don't
want to be here you just want it because

[4:45:15]
want to be here you just want it because
your your counselor's making you get a
certificate you don't want to be here
that's fine bring me two coffees and
like two creamers from commissary and
I'll fill out all your
paperwork and you'll pass you'll get a
certificate I don't have to see you
again I have full of coffee and creamer

[4:45:33]
again I have full of coffee and creamer
cuz at least 10 10 or 15 didn't want to
be there the other guys seriously wanted
to be there and I don't want those guys
to be there anyway they're going to be a
problem so the other guys are serious
about it and and some of these guys sat
through the class two three four
times some of these guys got out and

[4:45:47]
times some of these guys got out and
sent me
money
so uh you know which is like a huge sign
of respect you know by the way uh
because they don't owe me anything but I
I did that and I taught
GED uh because you know you have to do

[4:46:03]
GED uh because you know you have to do
something for for money
and you know I met some some I met a
bunch of cool guys and I was hanging out
and I was doing well and after about 3
years they they transferred me to

[4:46:16]
years they they transferred me to
the low security
prison at this point like the the FBI
starts showing up asking me questions
they asked me questions about the
politician I brib you know ask me
questions about him statute limitations

[4:46:31]
questions about him statute limitations
was up and they were trying to tie him
into uh the bank fraud because his name
was Kevin White and one of my guys name
was Michael Kevin White and so they were
trying to tie him in you know did you

[4:46:45]
trying to tie him in you know did you
did he know about it because if he knew
about it statue limitations is 10 years
we could no he didn't know um should
have thrown him in there but anyway
because like a couple years later he
gets indicted he ends up going to jail
anyway and it could have decreased your
sentence yeah listen listen stop stop um

[4:47:04]
sentence yeah listen listen stop stop um
listen oh my God I got all my judgment
out after the the homeless
conversation listen it's only GNA get
worse I mean I I really appreciate your

[4:47:16]
worse I mean I I really appreciate your
honesty and your Insight about like
about snitching honestly that I have a
sense that that there's
a um at least a desire for loyalty in
the world I wouldn't that be nice did

[4:47:30]
the world I wouldn't that be nice did
you ever feel in danger
and and and medium more
low it's funny I had more problems at
the probably at the low than I did the
medium but at the medium the only thing

[4:47:46]
medium but at the medium the only thing
that happened
was an article came out in the newspaper
when I was at the medium it came out and
said because they're you know they're
still investigating things so this

[4:48:01]
still investigating things so this
article comes out and I'm on the front
page of the St Petersburg times it was
about the politician big article and in
the article it says they interview
Millie my lawyer and she says well when
Mr Cox was being interviewed by the FBI

[4:48:17]
Mr Cox was being interviewed by the FBI
one of the first things they wanted to
know about was this
politician so she just said Mr Cox was
being interviewed by the FBI so I
immediately get taken into custody and

[4:48:30]
immediately get taken into custody and
they put me in the in the shoe the the
hole right for my own protection and I'm
there for like 40 days and then after 45
days they're like Cox what do what what
do you want us to do you want us to ship
you I was like no put me back on the
compound I'm like half the guys here
cooperated and he goes yeah it's more
than half he said but this is this is

[4:48:47]
than half he said but this is this is
the guy from sis which is like their
internal security so that's when he told
you that it's actually much higher
percentage he said but he goes but 90 he
said but 100% of them are lying about it
he said you just came out in the
newspaper I go man I'm not concerned if
you are concerned you got to come

[4:49:00]
you are concerned you got to come
immediately to the Lieutenant's office
and tell us we'll ship you I said okay I
get out there people are giving me like
the looking at me and what's up you know
but I don't have a lot of friends anyway
and I come there to make friends and so

[4:49:15]
and I come there to make friends and so
at one point this one guy comes to me
I'm walking in the yard probably two
days later after I get on back on the
compound I'm walking guy comes to me he
has a goatee and he's got a it comes
down here he's got a skull like a little
skull thing he had he had made whittel

[4:49:30]
skull thing he had he had made whittel
out of wood or something and uh you know
definitely looked scary but so I'm
walking and he stopped he goes hey cock
I've never talked to these guys I had
been there for a year or so and never
talked to any of these guys they're all
like bikers and you know Aryan
Brotherhood and so I'm like uh yeah

[4:49:47]
Brotherhood and so I'm like uh yeah
what's up he said Bubba Bubba's their
leader he goes he goes Bubba told me to
tell you uh not to walk the yard he
don't want to see you out in the yard
and I went okay I said well I'm going to
walk the yard tonight um I said and if I

[4:50:00]
walk the yard tonight um I said and if I
get the shit kicked out of me then I get
the shit kicked out of me did you talk
back to a guy with with a with a wooden
skull hanging off his I did but you know
what it was right in front of the guard
shack and so there's guards in the guard
shack you know they're 20 feet away
really you weren't scared I mean I I I

[4:50:15]
really you weren't scared I mean I I I
think I just got numb like I'm not
stupid but I'm all I'm walking around
I'm you know I was scared from the
moment I got there on if that makes
sense so you get to a point where you're
just numb and you're waiting for it
especially when I got out of the shoe
got out of the shoe I went straight to

[4:50:31]
got out of the shoe I went straight to
my cell laid down couple minutes later
it was lock lock down they close the
doors I wake up the next morning I go to
cow I go to my job like it starts all
over again so I was I had a very packed
routine so I didn't spend there although

[4:50:45]
routine so I didn't spend there although
there's guys everywhere and I'm I'm
thinking at some point I might just be
walking around a guy might walk up and
just smash me in the head but it didn't
happen and it's not the guys aren't
getting stabbed but they've got it
coming I didn't tell on anybody here I
didn't do anything it's not that on
other yards I might not have gotten

[4:51:01]
other yards I might not have gotten
smashed but I didn't get smashed and I'd
been there a while and I taught the real
estate class and everybody wanted to
take real estate take real estate so I
think that insulated me to a degree uh I
also had U um made a few friends there

[4:51:15]
also had U um made a few friends there
and I I think they were probably also
kind of putting out the words like bro
cut this guy a break so I'm walking
across and I tell the guy I said look
man I said you know and I wasn't rude to
him he wasn't even rude to me really he
said don't walk to the yard anymore
Bubba I didn't want you walk in the yard

[4:51:31]
Bubba I didn't want you walk in the yard
I said well listen I'm gonna go to cowo
and then I'm GNA go out there tonight
and walk the yard and if I get smashed I
get smashed I go because I got 26 years
and I cannot walk around for the next 26
years not going on the yard I said so
I'm going to be there and if that
happens and that happens and he looked

[4:51:46]
happens and that happens and he looked
at me and he goes man I don't give a
fuck what you do that's what Bubba told
me to tell you he said I told you and he
I don't give a shit what you do and he
walked off I went out there that night
with a buddy of mine named Zach um a guy
named John Gordon uh with my cousin and

[4:52:01]
named John Gordon uh with my cousin and
a couple of his buddies we walked the
track for about an hour Bubba and a
group of his guys stood there and looked
at us and as we walked probably closest
we got to was 30 or 40 feet that went on
for 30 minutes and then they kind of
broke up and went their separate ways
and you know there was a couple of times

[4:52:16]
and you know there was a couple of times
where I would go to the chow
hall and I would go and I'd be sitting
at a table and Bubba would walk up and
tell the other guys at the table I want
to let you guys know you're he didn't
even call me a snitch he said you're
sitting with a a cooperating witness he

[4:52:30]
sitting with a a cooperating witness he
said he said that's how you want to roll
he said you ain't going to be rolling
with us if there's any trouble and then
they all kind of looked at me and they
got got a got their plate and they moved
off he didn't tell me to move and he
could have walked up and said this is a
snitch motherfucker he didn't do that
Bubba was very respectful um so as

[4:52:47]
Bubba was very respectful um so as
respectful as he could be whatever you
want to say about Bubba he was a
respectful man you ever talk to him
directly never had a conversation with
him so that went on but I mean not when
I say that went on I mean like literally
like that's a couple of times he said
the same thing to a guy in line one time

[4:53:02]
the same thing to a guy in line one time
guy came up to me later and said look
man I'm sorry Matt I he was standing
next to me in line Bubba said something
to him he went like 10 or 15 people back
and stood in line later on he came up to
me man I'm sorry bro but you know blah I
said bro I said look I get it we're not

[4:53:17]
said bro I said look I get it we're not
friends don't worry about it and and

prison questioning me about my files in

[4:53:30]

[4:57:02]
named David pacau were selling Munitions
AK-47
really tons of Munitions but they got in
trouble with the this and they were
selling them to the US government for
the Afghan Security Forces mhm and there
had been an article in Rolling Stone

[4:57:15]
had been an article in Rolling Stone
magazine about him and I'd read it and
somebody points him out and says hey
that's that guy that's and I went up to
him I said hey bro you just got here
he's like yeah I said look if you want
to write a memoir or anything I'm
finishing my Memoir I can always help
you I can help you write an outline you
can get a professional writer whatever
if you need help he's like yeah all

[4:57:30]
if you need help he's like yeah all
right efim Dey was played by Jo Hill in
the movie uh wogs mhm so a few months
later he comes to me and says you know
hey they sold the movie rights I was
like oh wow that's great and I'm like

[4:57:46]
like oh wow that's great and I'm like
you and you don't want to write a memoir
and he's like yeah man it was sold to
the guys from The Hangover movie and I
was like so the guys from The Hangover
movie are going to make a movie about
you I said you understand they're going
to call it like Dude where's my hand

[4:58:01]
to call it like Dude where's my hand
grenade and you're going to be thei from
fast time at richmont high like you're
going to be a joke all because you don't
want to write a
memoir and get your your version out
there and he was like holy shit so I end
up writing an outline for him we worked

[4:58:15]
up writing an outline for him we worked
together and then he asked can I read
your book I was like sure and I give it
to him and he reads it and he comes back
and he says bro he this is the best
thing I've ever read in my life and to
be honest I later found out he'd read
about three books in his entire life but
still it was very it was very nice you

[4:58:31]
still it was very it was very nice you
the other two so uh he asked me if I'll
write his book I write his book we work
out a
deal and
uh we do that and I'm I'm I'm saying all
this because I basically settle in I'm
done I'm going to do 26 years by the way

[4:58:47]
done I'm going to do 26 years by the way
just in a small tangent how did you how
did you know you'd be good at writing
I'd kind of written a manuscript prior
to even taking off on the run I used to
listen to uh John Grisham books you know
I would listen to him in the car like I

[4:59:01]
I would listen to him in the car like I
like John Grisham books and had actually
written a manuscript about a a mortgage
broker U you know he writes about
lawyers it's like lawyer being a lawyer
is not exciting if you can make that
sound exciting I can make being a
mortgage broker uh and I wrote a I wrote
a book you know put it in my

[4:59:16]
a book you know put it in my
desk and uh you know the FBI found it
and they' you know said oh it's a
blueprint to the fraud that he's going
to commit it wasn't stop it's as much
that character was as much me as John
grisham's characters are him but it's

[4:59:31]
grisham's characters are him but it's
still kind of interesting that
John Grisham didn't right I mean you
know if John Grisham did something
similar to what one of the you know I
saw a quote somewhere
that uh the criminal is a is the true

[4:59:48]
that uh the criminal is a is the true
artist and the detective is merely a
Critic something like
that does that resonate with you or I'll
have to look that up okay so you already
knew you could write well I knew I liked
it but yeah I think I got better and

[5:00:00]
it but yeah I think I got better and
better at it I mean you know as you're
writing and they had creative writing
classes you know in prison at the low uh
you know the low was a much
different breed of animal you know like
it you know it was you could very easily
get hurt you could get hurt either place

[5:00:16]
get hurt you could get hurt either place
but there were guys that have life
sentences that been working out for 20
years and were just super angry you know
at the medium and and if you got hurt at
the medium it was probably really go bad
uh as opposed to you get hurt at the low

[5:00:30]
uh as opposed to you get hurt at the low
it's more like a a a fist fight in high
school so with knives so anyway I so I'm
there I'm writing I'm doing that
and it there was a guy on the compound

[5:00:46]
and it there was a guy on the compound
that came on the compound about that
same time his name was Frank Amadeo
Frank Amadeo is a a Rapid Cycling
bipolar with features of schizophrenia
Rapid Cycling bipol with features of
schizophrenia Rapid Cycling it's just

[5:01:02]
schizophrenia Rapid Cycling it's just
constant right and so there are moments
in in His Manic state where he his
reoccurring psychosis I guess is uh that
he believes and since he was in his
early teens has believed that he is

[5:01:17]
early teens has believed that he is
pre-ordained by God to be emperor of the
world he's a lawyer despar stole close
to $200 million from the federal
government they gave him 22 years and
they sent him to

[5:01:30]
they sent him to
Coleman but it doesn't this is the part
I love the delusions don't affect his
legal work MH it doesn't say a ton for
legal Community but how do you know he's
delusional I'm just asking questions
yeah he's he's trust me I I I mean it's

[5:01:46]
yeah he's he's trust me I I I mean it's
it's not me it's like the transcripts
the lawyers the doctors the you know
yeah there's a ton of a ton and then if
you saw him in action you'd be like oh
wow yeah you know he'd be he would be
completely normal he would be having a

[5:02:00]
completely normal he would be having a
completely normal conversation
and somebody would say something and he
was he'd go that makes me so angry I I I
I can't I'm not going to let them do
that when my Legions March on

[5:02:15]
that when my Legions March on
Washington we are going to burn the
Constitution and the president will
kneel at my
feet and he
goes I'm going to need your transcripts

[5:02:31]
goes I'm going to need your transcripts
I'm going to need a 2255 for form we're
going to file up you and it would just
like and everybody would sit there and
be like okay Frank I'll get this and
I'll get it was insane it was the most
insane he was basically running a
medium-sized Law Firm from inside of the
prison he was training people he taught

[5:02:46]
prison he was training people he taught
the he taught the um the legal research
class and was training people on how to
do legal research in prison how to put
together motions how to fight uh fight
their cases how to do the research how

[5:03:01]
their cases how to do the research how
to type them up everything he's teaching
he's teaching a law it's like a law
school right like he's teaching these
guys he he listen they made such a
mistake locking this guy up so he's a
great lawyer listen it's going to get
worse it's going to get worse because

[5:03:15]
worse it's going to get worse because
here's what happens is at this point I
don't talk to him for probably a year or
so because everybody's saying he's crazy
you know and he's and for like a year he
gets there he's drooling out of the side
of his mouth they got him on a ton of
medication it takes him about a year to
get them to take him off the medication

[5:03:31]
get them to take him off the medication
so he he gets them to take him off off
the medication and then he starts kind
of stabilizing his mood by drinking
Pepsi uh I know BR it's CRA I know it's
crazy I know how I see I see you looking
at me like this guy's delusion I know it
works whatever works so at some point

[5:03:47]

written well but honestly you don't have
much of a prayer and um they're offering
you a one level
reduction which is 30 months and I
went oh that's that's not enough and she

[5:09:00]
went oh that's that's not enough and she
said well I don't know what to tell you
um she said they're willing to bring you

I don't know I got to talk to Frank
Frank said I deserve this many levels
and know we're going back forth she she

[5:09:16]

go who's Frank and I go Frank's the guy
that's doing all my legal work she goes
he didn't write all this and I was like
no she goes who wrote and I I explain it
to her and she's like he's an inmate and
I was like yeah and and she goes why is
he here and I tell her well cuz he's he
stole a bunch of money from the federal
government cuz he's trying to take over
the world so I tell her that whole thing

[5:09:31]
the world so I tell her that whole thing
and she's like you you're letting
a a a mentally
incompetent you know person do your
legal work I was like yeah because all
the competent attorneys wouldn't do it
they said I didn't have a prayer your

[5:09:45]
they said I didn't have a prayer your
people said I didn't have a prayer and I
said Frank said he was going to he could
get this done and she's like well I
mean you know you don't like I don't
even know why they're offering you one
level I was like well Frank said you
know and I'm like Frank this Frank that
and so she I end up saying she's like

[5:10:01]
and so she I end up saying she's like
you're taking it advice from a a legally
an incompetent person I said
yeah and she said you know you really
don't have a prayer I said then why are
you here I said if they could crush me
so easily why are you
here I said they're giving me one level

[5:10:17]
here I said they're giving me one level
let me talk to Frank I'll let you know
what we're going to do so I leave I call
her a couple days later I tell her Frank
and I talk to Frank Frank said go back
go back and argue for more he said I
think the judge is going to give you
more he's going to give you at least you

[5:10:30]
more he's going to give you at least you
know between whatever he said like six
or seven s levers or something so I get
I get moved all the way back to
Atlanta the FBI agent comes to talk on
my behalf the guy that like multiple
people show up to talk on my behalf they
say you know Millie who I filed the 2255

[5:10:48]
say you know Millie who I filed the 2255
against so I'm basically saying you're
you're ineffective you're incompetent
you know but she knows the game she's
like I get it she she gets on the stand
and testifies for me so so the judge

[5:11:03]
and testifies for me so so the judge
goes H you know listen I think we were
asking for like nine levels or something
outrageous prosecutor starts arguing for
one
level and he said listen one level is

[5:11:15]
level and he said listen one level is
not nearly enough for what Mr Cox has
done he said Mr Cox I know you're
arguing for nine uh nine levels off your
sen he goes that was never going to
happen was like feel like I got slapped
and he said so I'm I'm going to go with
six levels no no I'm sorry he said three

[5:11:32]
six levels no no I'm sorry he said three
levels I'm going to go with three levels
he which is uh which is seven years
which she said for somebody who has no
arrest associated with his case he said
I think it's pretty good and that's what
that's his judgment and blah blah blah

[5:11:45]
that's his judgment and blah blah blah
blah blah and he Hammer put puts the
gavel down and walks off that's it it's
over I got seven years I was hoping for
more so I get moved back to Coleman I
get moved back to Coleman and I go to up
to Frank and I said Frank I got I got
seven years off and he's like I know I

[5:12:00]
seven years off and he's like I know I
know I said I I don't mean to sound
unappreciative I said I
just said I was hoping for more he goes
I was too he said it looks like we're
going to have to eat this elephant one
spoonful at a time and he goes something

[5:12:15]
spoonful at a time and he goes something
will come out something's going to
happen he said keep your ears open
something will happen and I said okay
and you know I Honestly by that point
I'd done you know I'd done eight years

writing
um by that point I'd i' actually written

[5:12:47]
um by that point I'd i' actually written
a
story like I got a book deal for
deoli you know um and I ended
up uh writing a synopsis of a guy's

[5:13:01]
up uh writing a synopsis of a guy's
story and I got him in Rolling Stone
magazine and I got a book deal for that
like I got an advance it's like 3,500
bucks for being in prison a prisoner to
get $3,500 Advance like I'm a
millionaire there a lot of money so and
then we optioned the film rights

[5:13:17]
then we optioned the film rights
basically the synopsis that I wrote for
this reporter journalist for Rolling
Stone he goes to Rolling Stone with my
with what I wrote and gives it to them
and they okay it they say yeah this is
great we want you to write an article

[5:13:30]

based on this okay okay he writes the
article he tells
me that the article will be from him his
name g Lawson Douglas Dodd which is the
name of the kid I wrote the Memoir about
and Matthew

[5:13:46]
and Matthew
Cox couple of weeks before it's going
the article is going to be published he
tells me rolling stone doesn't want my
name on the article because I'm in
federal prison and it doesn't look good

[5:14:00]
federal prison and it doesn't look good
but don't worry he going to put my name

um and I argue it's not just as good
it's not I'm like I would be I would be
a writer for Rolling Stone magazine like

[5:14:15]
you understand I'm trying to I'm trying
to come up with something here that I
can rebuild my life as a true crime
writer that's no
good what and that wasn't so bad that
wasn't the worst of the worst of it was
90% of the article that he published was

[5:14:31]
90% of the article that he published was
taken directly from what I sent him like
I mean sick to my stomach bro just sick
over it so but they option they option
the life rights for that and I got a

[5:14:45]
the life rights for that and I got a
piece of that so there's like $7,000 I
get a check for that so I'm I'm thrilled
I can keep writing because you have to
understand writing on the computer there
they charge you so I start write oh they
charge you for phone calls writing
comment every single thing cost money so
I start writing all these guys stories I

[5:15:01]
I start writing all these guys stories I
start writing
books I just come back from went back to
Atlanta got re got s seven years knocked
off my sentence come
back and I'm walking around the
compound now there was a guy that was

[5:15:16]
compound now there was a guy that was
there named Ron Wilson Ron Wilson
ran in if you look in the newspaper it
says it's like a a hundred million Ponzi
scheme but really was $57 million so he
had lost 57 million so it says 100 you

[5:15:30]
had lost 57 million so it says 100 you
know they you know they always EX
exaggerate cuz 57 is not enough Ron
ended up getting 19 and a half years Ron
was an old con man
mhm early 60s 62 61 I don't know and uh

[5:15:46]
mhm early 60s 62 61 I don't know and uh
Ron I and I liked
um so we're walking around the compound
and he's like so what are you going to
do I me like eight or nine more years to
go and I was like H you know I'm going
to keep writing and when I get out of

[5:16:00]
to keep writing and when I get out of
here maybe I'll have a huge body of work
and maybe I'll be able to sell it or
maybe I'll be able to option some more
stuff and if I could get together with
rolling stone or get with some of these
magazines I could start writing for them
and I could option those maybe I could
walk out of here with something so right
right right so Ron was who only been

[5:16:17]
right right so Ron was who only been
locked up like a year or so he was
cooperating with the Secret Service in
his case against some of his
codefendants so he's he's already been
debriefed and he's cooperating he's
actually thinking he might get brought
back to have to testify a

[5:16:33]
back to have to testify a
trial we're talking and we're walking
and he keeps saying you know even if I
even if they they charge those guys and
even if this happens they're not going
to reduce my sentence they're not going
to cut my
sentence you know first of all well

[5:16:46]
sentence you know first of all well
probably because you stole a bunch of
money from Pension funds and churches
that didn't help your case but I don't
say that uh so I I say oh they have to
Bro they'll have to they they you know
if you cooperate they're going to have
to and if they don't we'll have Frank

[5:17:00]
to and if they don't we'll have Frank
follow 2250 five and he's like uh ah
that crazy mother um so he says uh okay
he's like yeah yeah you don't understand
you don't understand so this goes on for
months and I and I'm like what is the
problem and he says you know they think

[5:17:15]
problem and he says you know they think
I hid Ponzi scheme
money you know and he'd actually dug up
like five or six million dollars in
Ponzi scheme proceeds that he dug he he
he buried in these oh literally
literally buried in aluminum Amun

[5:17:31]
literally buried in aluminum Amun
munition canisters mhm super interesting
guy so he actually went and dug them up
and gave them to him and I'm like well
you gave them all the money it's you
didn't hide anything relax it's not a
big deal they're not going to find
anything so don't worry about it and so
he mentions it a couple weeks later

[5:17:46]
he mentions it a couple weeks later
couple weeks later and then one day I go
bro why do you keep bringing this
up like what are you concerned about
they it's not going to happen and he
said can I trust you and I went probably

[5:18:00]
said can I trust you and I went probably
not and he
goes I did hide some money I was like
okay I said you you bury in a can
somewhere and he's like no he I I um
gave my wife like 150,000 in cash I said

[5:18:17]
gave my wife like 150,000 in cash I said
okay well she's not going to say
anything she's using no you don't
understand since then she found out I
was having an
affair and we're going to get a divorce
and she hates me and I think she'll turn

[5:18:30]
and she hates me and I think she'll turn
that money in just to make make sure
that I don't get a
reduction cuz if you lie to the FBI
they're not going to doesn't matter what
you've done for them they won't give you
anything and so he's BL I mean I'm sorry
Secret Service or anybody he is clearly
lied to the secret service at this point

[5:18:45]
lied to the secret service at this point
if she goes and says this is what he
gave me MH so he's like I was like oh
wow and he's like and I gave my my
brother's holding maybe 30,000 for
me
and at that moment I was like wow like

[5:19:02]
and at that moment I was like wow like
this poor guy no that's not what I
thought at all what I thought was is
that enough to get me a sentence
reduction you said him a
bitch and I went and I sat there and you
know what I thought I thought I I I I
thought no I thought that's not enough

[5:19:16]
thought no I thought that's not enough
that's not enough it's nothing that's
not even
$200,000 like and they didn't want to
give me a reduction my prosecutor was
pissed that I got seven years off she
wanted me to get 30 months she's not
going to give me anything it's up to her
she's not going to do it so I go I lay

[5:19:32]
she's not going to do it so I go I lay
down I go to bed like a month later I'm
on the phone with my lawyer cuz I had
written remember I wrote a man my I had
a manuscript for my book and I wanted to
put some of the stuff that was said at

[5:19:45]
put some of the stuff that was said at
my in my sentencing in the
book so I was trying to get my lawyer to
mail me my transcripts and she hadn't
done it so I called her and I said

going on in there and I this she never
wanted to talk to me like she didn't you

didn't want to talk to me and and I was
like what do you mean nothing I just

nothing's happening there's nothing you
want to talk about I was

[5:20:16]
want to talk about I was
like and I went you know
what you know what there's something
weird happened there listen to this and
I told her about Ron Wilson and she goes
hold on and she looks up on the computer
she goes oh wow this is a bad guy this

[5:20:31]
she goes oh wow this is a bad guy this
is a bad
guy and he told you then you know where
it is absolutely she and I can tell you
exactly and she goes okay okay okay she
goes uh let me look into this I go okay
so a week later a a CO comes to me and
goes hey Cox and I go what's up he goes

[5:20:46]
goes hey Cox and I go what's up he goes
listen at the next move because you know
they have controlled moves all the doors
are locked and they open them up for 10
minutes so you can run to the chow hall
or you can run to the you can't run
though there no running on the compound
but you can walk fast yes to the wck

[5:21:00]
but you can walk fast yes to the wck
yard
uh or the library whatever he says at
the next move go to
sis you know so I go to Sis on the next
move but I was used to going there by
the way because I I was constantly
ordering Freedom of Information acts and

[5:21:15]
ordering Freedom of Information acts and
they would so I'd order your your an
inmate and I'd order I'm writing a story
for you and I'd order it and they'd send
it to me and then they would catch it
and they'd be like why are you getting
Lex's information so they'd call me down
there I go no I ordered it for him and
I'm writing a story and I'd already been

[5:21:31]
I'm writing a story and I'd already been
in Rolling Stone everything they're like
what's the story and I tell them the
story they that's a pretty good story
here and so I go down there but this is
different this the guy answers the door
and his guy they call him Bulldog he was
a real asshole uh he was a lieutenant of
sis and he's like uh come in get in here

[5:21:46]
sis and he's like uh come in get in here
Cox sit down and he dials the phone he
goes here you got to talk to this guy
and I'm like what I pick up the phone
I'm like hello and the guy goes hey this
is Agent Griffin with the Secret Service
I understand you know where Ron Wilson
is has uh hidden Ponzi scheme money I
who whoa whoa whoa I want something

[5:22:01]
who whoa whoa whoa I want something
writing I want you know so I start doing
that and they go okay I get his his
email address and we start emailing each
other back and forth and he ends up S
getting a letter from the US attorney in

[5:22:16]
getting a letter from the US attorney in
South Carolina that says they will
consider it substantial assistance if
they if they make arrests or recover a
substantial amount of money MH that's
the best I'm going to get is consider so
I start talking to thisy guy and he

[5:22:31]
I start talking to thisy guy and he
starts asking me questions about Ron
Wilson like hey ask him this ask him
this so I'm like bro I got to kind of
work that into a conversation that's an
odd thing to ask this goes on for six
months so I'm asking questions and I'm
typing up little reports and I'm I'm a

[5:22:45]
typing up little reports and I'm I'm a
I'm a I'm a prison snitch now so I'm not
just like cooperating I'm now I'm a
prison snitch so I've I've moved down
I've moved down actually from being just
a cooperating witness or because you're
in prison is that what makes you a

[5:23:00]
in prison is that what makes you a
prison you can't even say um you could
say prison rat you could say prison rat
I think prison snitch I think that's
probably the closer to the term that
most guys would use what's the
difference between a snitch and a rat in
prison I'm not sure I it rolls off the

[5:23:16]
prison I'm not sure I it rolls off the
tongue better prison rat doesn't sound
as good as prison snitch I don't know I
don't spend a lot of time thinking about
this so what happens is um I'm asking
Wilson questions periodically and it

[5:23:30]
Wilson questions periodically and it
some point they contact me and they say
listen Wilson's about to get some bad
news and I go
okay um and they go he's you know like I
would want to tell you what it is let us

[5:23:45]
would want to tell you what it is let us
know what happens it's like two days go
by and one day Wilson comes up to me one
day and says cock cock and I'm like oh
shit I'm like hey what's up you know and
he's like oh my you're not going to
believe this I got indicted I was like
what what what

[5:24:02]
what what what
happened no yeah my wife they questioned
my wife and my brother and my brother my
wife walked in first she said I don't
have nothing I don't know what you're
talking about the next day the brother

[5:24:15]
talking about the next day the brother
walks in and gives them
$150,000 in cash and so the next day the
wife comes back and gives them $250,000
in cash and a bunch of uh silver like

[5:24:31]
in cash and a bunch of uh silver like
gold bullion and silver you know because
this he was a his his Ponzi scheme was
based off of
Silver you know he was going to invest
in silver for you so half a million
dollars they turn over half aill I'm
like half a million dollars I thought

[5:24:45]
like half a million dollars I thought
she was like a 100,000 or something and
he was he was like I know I didn't know
I could trust you I'm like
Ron what are you doing I thought we were
so he um so I'll tell you something just
for the icing on the cake by the way the

[5:25:00]
for the icing on the cake by the way the
icing on the cake let me explain one
more thing y there's so if you're going
to if somebody cooperates with the
federal government let's say I get
arrested and they go you want to help
yourself and you go yeah okay um look uh
Jimmy is a he lives next to me and he's

[5:25:16]
Jimmy is a he lives next to me and he's
running a meth house you know a meth lab
whatever and they go and they raid Jimmy
and he gets arrested you're going to get
something off for that not a lot but
you're going to get
something
now and they could just say we were
going to bust him anyway way we were

[5:25:31]
going to bust him anyway way we were
already on to him right now the next
level would be you wear a
wire so I wore a wire and I I was in
danger now keep in mind I'm asking this
guy questions inside federal prison I'm
in danger so whatever that's like the

[5:25:48]
in danger so whatever that's like the
next level you're active you're taking
active participate participation in the
um investigation and the third level
would be you actually get on the
stand and you cooperate you you testify

[5:26:02]
stand and you cooperate you you testify
that there's no better cooperation than
so when Wilson says to
me they're going to move me back to
South Carolina they've indicted me they

[5:26:15]
South Carolina they've indicted me they
charged me what do you think I should do
and I go I think you should go to
trial because I know they'll have to
call me as a witness yeah just to let
you know because I don't I don't want
you to I don't want to walk out of here
and have you feeling feeling like hey

[5:26:32]
and have you feeling feeling like hey
there's some there's some good to this
guy no so I'm ready I'm I'm ready to cut
Wilson like a fish so yeah but you are
putting yourself in danger if you get
understand right I'm already in danger
if if people there heard what I was
doing I probably would have been in

[5:26:46]
doing I probably would have been in
doesn't that increase the chance of them
hearing or no if you it does but it also
increases my ability to get more off my
sentence sure so what happens is couple
days later he's on What's called the
pack out right they're GNA move him

[5:27:01]
pack out right they're GNA move him
maybe a week later so they come and get
him they move him he gets back there to
South Carolina and he pleads guilty he
he they sentence him he gets six months
added on so he's now from 19 and a half
to 20
years uh and and by the way when Co hit

[5:27:18]
years uh and and by the way when Co hit
he was released so he only ended up
doing like six years on a 20-year
sentence because he was older he's by
that point he's 66 67 years old you know
he's an old any anybody older than 55

[5:27:31]
he's an old any anybody older than 55
was endangered especially in the prison
so they had a a CO thing where they were
releasing these guys and sending them
home on ankle monitors like he's an old
man he's not he he's not going to hurt
he's not he's not a
danger so they sent him home so he ended
up doing so he didn't even serve the six

[5:27:46]
up doing so he didn't even serve the six
months he even served the original
sentence whatever not that I care so I'm
just saying makes you feel like poor Ron
it's okay so his wife got like a hundred
year 100 she got like a hundred hours of

[5:28:00]
year 100 she got like a hundred hours of
community service or something or 60
hours and I think his brother got 6
months papers they they got charged with
um obstruction of justice you know and
they didn't neither one of them you know
it's like six
months probation and community service
nothing so when we I turn around I'm

[5:28:17]
nothing so when we I turn around I'm
waiting for my reduction waiting waiting
after about 90 days after this guy gets
sentenced maybe 6 months I send a letter
hey what's going on to the prosecuting
to my prosecutor their the prosecutor

[5:28:30]
to my prosecutor their the prosecutor
both districts no response then I go to
Frank I explain to Frank and Frank has
known what's going on the whole time and
Frank goes uh okay I'm going to file a
2255 so we file a
2255 government comes back and they
first thing they say is your honor we

[5:28:46]
first thing they say is your honor we
don't know about any cooperation we've
never heard about any cooperation so of
course then we submit the letter that we
have the judge comes back and the judge
ends up saying it's a little complicated

[5:29:00]
ends up saying it's a little complicated
but he ends up saying look I don't have
jurisdiction to hear this
because you're you may be time
barred but I'm going to let the the
appeals court hear it now typically you

[5:29:16]
appeals court hear it now typically you
have to you have to get what's called
like a right of cert a certification to
appeal you have to make sure that you
actually have a case he says I'm waving
the
CT and I'm waving the $500 fee to file
with them

[5:29:31]
with them
he said and I'm he's he basically
expedites it for me which is a subtle
way of telling the prosecutor I think
he's got something and I'm sending it up
there and he and the way he writes his
motion it's basically saying I don't

[5:29:45]
motion it's basically saying I don't
have the jurisdiction to hear to do
anything but they do they need to do it
and I'm Paving the way you don't have to
pay any money and you don't need that
sir so the prosecution immediately comes
back they file a a a on level

[5:30:02]
reduction and we immediately Frank files
something saying hey stop we don't want
the reduction we don't want the one
level we want to come back to court
please don't don't rule on it so the
judge says okay I'm freezing everything

[5:30:16]
judge says okay I'm freezing everything
I'm I'm putting a stay on everything I'm
going to give this guy a
lawyer to try and figure out what you're
going to do they fly down a lawyer
Leanne well

[5:30:31]
Leanne well
so she comes and and she comes and sees
me and uh she says listen I I I see that
you want to go back and fight this and
this but honestly I don't think you're
going to get anything more than one
level uh I talked to the prosecution

[5:30:45]
level uh I talked to the prosecution
they said they'll give you well she said
I can work on trying to get you two
levels but you don't have much of a
prayer you're going to get crushed and I
said well then then why are you here if
they can crush me so easy why don't they
do it why would they pay you like they

[5:31:01]
do it why would they pay you like they
pay them like 12 Grand or something just
to fly down and all your expenses to to
negotiate for me why not crush
me and she's like I I don't know I said
well Frank said four levels and she's
like who's Frank I go Frank's the guy

[5:31:15]
like who's Frank I go Frank's the guy
that wrote All This and she's like oh is
is he an attorney and I go is he in here
I'm like yeah he's in here she's like
why is he in here and I tell her he was
taking over the world yeah and she
says that's the strangest thing I've
ever heard in my entire life and I said

[5:31:31]
ever heard in my entire life and I said
I understand but Frank said and she's
like you're listening to an incompetent
you know I'm like
absolutely and she and Frank said four
level we want four levels she he said
for me to tell you we want four levels

[5:31:45]
for me to tell you we want four levels
she Sayes okay she leaves she goes to
the US attorney we argue two levels they
come back say two levels no we go back
and forth we start filing motion saying
we want to go back we want a hearing we
want to bring back all the FBI agents
the Secret Service agents so and she's

[5:32:00]
the Secret Service agents so and she's
like what do you want to turn this into
a circus exactly what do I want to do I
going to turn it into the biggest circus
cuz I've already got one level MH they
come back one day she says
listen three levels is the best you're
going to
get she said so uh I guess you'll be

[5:32:15]
get she said so uh I guess you'll be
moved back here we'll go to the hearing
I said no no no I'll take three levels
and she go what are you talking she said
you said four levels you said Frank
wouldn't take let you take anything less
than four I said no Frank said to tell
you four I was happy with three I wanted
you to argue for four I'm good with
three I'm out of here in like a year

[5:32:31]
three I'm out of here in like a year
yeah so and I don't want to be moved
back I don't have to get on that bust
you know what it's like to be moved it's
horrible so I said I just want the three
levels so then we argue about the
wording for about two three months and
then they file it and then I get five
years knocked off my sentence because

[5:32:46]
years knocked off my sentence because
three levels at this at the level I was
at now isn't seven years every level you
get a little less time so I get five
years off so now I've got 12 years
knocked off my sentence at this point
I maybe have a year and a half to go mhm

[5:33:02]
I maybe have a year and a half to go mhm
and you know that's
doable so I was super super
happy um and I'm gonna I'm going to tell
you
something uh and I'm sorry bro um but

[5:33:18]
something uh and I'm sorry bro um but
every time I think about it and I I just
feel like I have to say
it
like I'm Frank I'm insane

[5:33:32]
but I can like I didn't have a fucking
prayer without that guy and as crazy as
he is and much of a pain in the ass as
was um like I could never repay him bro

[5:33:47]
was um like I could never repay him bro
like like I'm not I shouldn't be here
I'm supposed to be in prison right now
my outdate was 30 was
2030 without that guy where no he got

I keep bothering you you mentioned that

[5:57:15]
I keep bothering you you mentioned that
earlier um what advice would you give to
young people given that you've lived
quite a non-standard life what advice
would you give them how to live a life
they can be proud
of I I mean
it's it's if I'm in a position that

[5:57:32]
it's it's if I'm in a position that
anybody would listen to me but I I
because to me and I don't have any
advice that I don't think a father would
give you and it's like work hard be
appreciative I mean things are so good
out here I hear people complain all the

[5:57:45]
out here I hear people complain all the
time and I think a huge part of just
being happy is being appreciative like I
didn't appreciate anything when I had
this is so cliche but when I had all the
money in the
world I was miserable but when I got out
with nothing I was happier in prison

[5:58:03]
with nothing I was happier in prison
with nothing than I was with2 or three
million prior to prison and driving
dating a chick I was never should have
been dating driving a sports car

[5:58:18]
vacationing all over the world
miserable I'm crying driving away from
prison because I already missed my
friends you you could have never told me
that was going to happen turns out money
in fact does not buy happiness no and I

[5:58:30]
in fact does not buy happiness no and I
know and it it is such a cliche right

away from prison yeah you know what um I
