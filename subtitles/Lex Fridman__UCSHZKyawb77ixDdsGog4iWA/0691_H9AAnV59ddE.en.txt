[00:00]
- Blink once, if when Elder
Scrolls VI is coming out,
but are not going to tell me.
The following is a conversation
with Todd Howard, one
of the greatest video game
designers of all time.
He has led the development
of the Fallout series

[00:17]
and the Elder Scrolls series,
including Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind,
Oblivion, Skyrim, and the future
Elder Scrolls VI, and a totally new world
in an upcoming game called Starfield.

[00:31]
Many of these have won
game of the year awards
and have been some
of the most celebrated and
impactful games ever made.
To me, Skyrim is quite possibly
the greatest game, ever.

[00:45]
This is Alex Friedman podcast.
To support it please

in the description.
And now, dear friends, here's Todd Howard.
Is it possible that we are
currently living inside
a video game that the future you designed,

[01:01]
can you give hints as
to how one would escape
if this was a video game?
How can a video game
character escape to outside
the video game?
Are these things you don't consider
when you design the game?

[01:15]
- Actually, we do,
'cause in the kind of games that we make,
we want it to be as open as possible.
So when you start a game,
you're always testing it.
What can I do? What would
the game allow me to do?
And you check everything.
You try to pick up the
mugs, you try every door,

[01:33]
you collide with everything.
Like, hey, what are the
rules of this world?
We try to do games where we
say yes as much as possible,
that leads to some level of chaos.

[01:45]
But if you were stuck in a video game,
you would try everything.
And usually you're gonna
find a door or a space
where the designers didn't
anticipate you piling all
those crates up and getting over a wall
that they didn't expect.
- Right, so it's not a
designed doorway out,

[02:03]
it's accidental, unintended doorway out.
And it's a happy bug.
- You could like "Truman Show,"
just get in the ocean and go until it's...
- [Lex] Just keep going and keep going...
- Right, right, right.
- But the more realistic the game becomes,

[02:16]
the harder it is to find that door.
The bigger the world, the
bigger the open world...
- And then as we do it, we
learn they're gonna find a way.
So just don't try to pen 'em in.
Usually we leave like this
developer test cell area

[02:35]
in the game that we don't
anticipate anyone will find.
And they ultimately find it,
it usually has crates of
all the weapons in the game
and things like that.

[02:45]
- The little hints you drop
now will just drive people mad,
which is something I enjoy deeply.
So Skyrim NPCs have at
times hilarious dialogue.
What does it take to
build a good NPC dialogue?

[03:01]
- The main thing is to make them reactive.
A lot of times when you
write characters for movies
or things like that,
you wanna make that character interesting
for themselves, right?
What's their story?
And there's some characters like

[03:16]
that the player definitely cares about,
but the best characters are
the ones that react to you.
So you'll find a lot of
people love our guards
and the guards are written
almost purely to be reactive.

[03:32]
Hey, nice tie, like your jacket,
do this, cool watch, hey,
what'd you do?
And so that, hey, you're
the man as you walk by,
that makes them interesting
or the way they react
to something that you do.

[03:46]
Lydia in Skyrim, who everybody loves,
"I'm sworn to carry your burdens."
That's a generic line that
all of the housecarls have
and it just kind of
lands when she says it.
- Why does it land? What do you...

[04:01]
And did you anticipate it would land?
- It's a slight snarkiness
in that particular read
of it and you're asking
her to do something
and she's reacting to you.
- What about the trade off

[04:18]
between maybe
the randomness and the scripted
nature of the dialogue?
Like is there any room for
randomness of the dialogue tree?
- Oh, absolutely.
We tend to write 'em in stacks
with, it's a very small,

[04:34]
think of it as a small state
machine that just says, okay,
this is what's happening,
here's a random list of
things I could say to that...
And then some of that plays out in ways

[04:48]
you don't anticipate.
But we look at the things,
what are the players
doing that we could have
the characters respond to
that they don't expect,
jumping on tables or
stealing stuff or sneaking

[05:00]
in in the middle of the night
or those kind of things.
The more that we can do,
the more reactive and interesting
the characters appear.
- And these state machines,
how big are these things?

[05:16]
Are these individual to
the individual characters?
That's just fascinating how
you design state machines.
Is it just a giant-
- I would think
of the AI as one big one.
Yeah.
- Oh.
- For sort of everybody.

[05:31]
- So there's an AI.
- [Todd] There's a manager
for all the people and one
of the things...
- A people manager?
- Right. Right.
- Nice.
- One of the things that makes what we do
particularly unique is...

[05:45]
And this is a trade off
for what people are seeing,
'cause a lot of it's not on the screen,
but we're using cycles to run this,
which is we're thinking
about everybody in the whole
world all the time.
The ones that are further
away, at a much less tick rate,
they go into low,

[06:00]
but we know if they wanna
walk across the world
and we're running every
quest at the same time.
Whereas in other open world
games, you start an activity,
the rest of the world's gonna shut down
so that they can really
make that as impactful.

[06:16]
We're, I really prefer that
the rest of it's going on.
It's more of a simulation
that we're building.
So when those things collide,
that's where it gets the most interesting.

[06:31]
And so we are running all of those people
and understanding where they
wanna go and their cycles
and what they wanna do,
and the ones that are closer to you,
we just update a lot more.
It's one way to think about it.
- I mean, that's really fascinating.
That's something that people had,

[06:46]
they were wondering about
to what degree it's possible
to run the world without you.
So there is a feeling
to role playing games
that you're the central,
you're the center of the world,
and the whole world rotates around you.

[07:00]
As it does in normal life. Like
when we walk around, right?
There's a, when you forget yourself,
you start to take yourself very seriously.
Like you are the center of the world.
You forget that there's 8 billion people
on Earth and you forget
that they have lives.
That's actually a sobering
realization that they all

[07:15]
have really interesting
life stories and they have
their worries, they suffer in
different complicated ways...
And yet when you play a role
playing game, there's a,
I mean, both computationally,

[07:31]
from a storytelling perspective,
you wonder if the world
goes on without you.
Like if you come back,
if you take a break and you come back,
is there still a bustling
town that now has
a history since you have last visited?
So to what degree can you
create a world that goes

[07:48]
on without you or goes on
at the same time as you do
your thing, whatever
the heck you're doing.
- We don't prioritize
the stuff you can't see.
So it's more like an amusement park.
If you study like the design
or our level designers

[08:00]
did this, how do they build
Disney World in these places?
So it still exists for you, the player.
So it is fairly, when
you're gonna come in,
this is what you're gonna see,
the shops are in the front,
you're gonna do this.
It's just for us to make
it far more believable

[08:17]
and get some more emergent behavior that,
not just make the sort
of the verisimilitude
of what you're in for that
moment, but you buy it all,

[08:30]
always say like we gotta do
the little things so
that you buy the reality
of the virtual world you're in,
so if we wanna do something
crazy, when a dragon lands,
or a death claw comes out of the wasteland
or those kind of things that you,
it has the impact to you
as the viewer that it would

[08:48]
to the people in the world.
- Okay.
But still you are simulating
stuff that's close to you.
It is a bit of a simulation going on.
- Oh, absolutely. Yes.
- And so that creates some
interesting dynamics then.

[09:02]
- And the stuff that we're
looking at in the future,
our plan is to push that even more,
to think about how these things
exist in the world first...

[09:15]
Now, we do some of this,
but even more so in the future to say,
how do these things exist?
Take like a faction in the world,
what is their role in the world as opposed
to just their role is for
the player to join it,
go through a bunch of
quests and become the head
of the faction.

[09:31]
Think a little bit deeper
about the simulation
and what would the Mages
Guild be doing in a fantasy
world or the Fighters
Guild be doing in a fantasy
world versus just sign
up, do quests, get gold.

[09:46]
- And so that when you show up
to that Mages Guild, it's
a bustling guild full
of stuff going on.
- It's not just that it's bustling,
that they feel rooted in it.
They don't feel like a storefront
for come here, do quests, get experience.

[10:02]
- Is that one of the essential components
of randomly generated worlds?
So when I think back to
Daggerfall, has a gigantic world,
when I first played it,
I thought like, I mean,
you're just struck by the immensity of it.

[10:19]
The immensity of the possibility,
when you're young and you
look into your future,
it's wide open and you can do anything.
And that's what Daggerfall felt like.
The openness was gigantic.

[10:31]
- And Daggerfall is interesting coming off
Arena, where Arena does the same thing,
but Daggerfall in many ways
is bigger despite focusing
on an area because of
how the density of, okay,

[10:47]
this is how much physical
game space we'll do
for these villages and towns.
And it does feel endless
even though you're looking
at a map that has constraints.
And Daggerfall actually was
a touchstone for us going

[11:02]
into Starfield, for how we do the planets,
because there is, there's a different kind
of gameplay experience when
you just wander outside
a city in Daggerfall,
then follow a quest line

[11:19]
and go through, go to this place
and it's completely
handcrafted and everything
around every corner we've
kind of placed like Skyrim,
Starfield's a bit more like
Daggerfall, and if you
wander outside the city,

[11:31]
we're gonna be generating
things and you kind of get
used to that game flow,
different than we've done before and fun
in a different kind of way.
- We'll talk about Starfield.
So just for people who don't know,
and how dare you for
not knowing, but we're,

[11:49]
with Daggerfall we're talking
about the Elder Scrolls
series that started,
sort of talking about the
big titles within the series.
Started with Arena in '94,
Daggerfall fall in '96...
I didn't look up the years
before this. This is depressing.

[12:01]
Or awesome.
So all of these games brought hundreds,
probably for some of them,
thousands of hours of joy for me.
So Arena, Daggerfall,
Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim.

[12:18]
So I don't remember Arena
being that open world.
- Well it's all the provinces,
it follows kind of the same pattern.
It just doesn't have all
the number of villages
and places that Daggerfall has.
While Daggerfall focuses
on the Iliac Bay area,

[12:34]
Arena does it all,
just changes the scale
in terms of one block
on the map equals this much space.
- There is something that, I mean,
I'm speaking to anecdotal experience,
but I just remember it
feeling wide open, Daggerfall.

[12:48]
- [Todd] It definitely was. Yes.
- In the way Arena didn't.
I don't remember...
Maybe because Arena, it
was so cool to have the,
just the role playing game aspect.

[13:00]
You're focused on the items
and the character development.
You...
- Daggerfall has a lot more depth,
particularly in the character system.
That's what it introduces
all of the skills
and those kind of things.
Arena...
It's actually, it's a game
I love, and it's very,

[13:17]
very elegant, if you look at the first one
where it's just an XP
based system, do this,
get XP, level up, very
classic role playing game.
Daggerfall digs deep into
who's your character,
how you gonna develop
it, what are your skills?

[13:31]
There's advantages, there's disadvantages.
And the environment going full 3D
from Arena, which is actually
like a two-and-a-half-D
Doom style engine, that I agree
with you that Daggerfall feels like

[13:45]
there's more possibilities
when you're playing it.
- Were you able to like look
up the sky in Daggerfall?
- Yep.
- My memories...
- It's full 3D, yeah.
- Yeah, it's, so that's
what full 3D means.
And then you can go outside the city?
- You can walk outside the city.
You can do that in Arena too,

[14:00]
but it looks more fakey, right?
It's all gonna be a flat plane.
Here comes things, and
then a dungeon entrance
is a 8 bit,
here comes a little flap
coming at the camera.
- So before we go to
the end, in the middle,
so from Starfield to Fallout
and the Elder Scrolls series,

[14:18]
let's go to the very beginning.
What's the origin story?
You know what, let's even go before then.
When's the first time
you remember the thing
that made you fall in
love with video games?

[14:31]
- Well, I think it's partly my age,
coming up with the arcades and playing
Space Invaders at the pizza place,
and then Pac-Man really...
What's interesting about video
games and what Pac-Man did

[14:45]
for video games where it
popularized them in a way
that was just insane at the time.
Had a song, had a cartoon,
had all of the things...
Nintendo comes along.
So it was always part of
I think if you were a kid
growing up, then it was
such a newness to playing

[15:02]
things like that.
And I remember being in
fifth grade when the TRS-80
was brought into the
classroom and there was
a Star Trek game, and
I was enamored with it.
And they were gonna start teaching

[15:15]
some rudimentary programming.
Like, okay, would you like
to know how this is made?
And I was hooked.
I was like, I need to figure
out how to make this stuff.
And so I was a self-taught
programmer and my whole
goal was to write my own video games.

[15:34]
And by sixth, seventh
grade I had written my own
much better Star Trek clone.
- Yeah, of course.
- Apple II.
And I really enjoyed programming
in the Apple II then...

[15:49]
And that I think was the
right level of like complexity
at that age where you could kind of,
you were always learning,
but you could still understand
a lot of the problem
set for like, this is what
I wanna get on the screen,

[16:02]
and I was also into art.
So I did a lot of art and
I did a lot of programming
and I was always making games.
That was my hobby from
the time I was 10 or 12.
- What was to you,
involved in making games?

[16:16]
Like how did you think of it?
Was it from a graphics perspective?
Like what shows up on screen?
Was it how it makes you feel?
Was it about the story?
Was it the text based
stuff and the dialogue
and the prompting?
like what does it mean
to create a video game

[16:32]
at that young age to you?
- Well, it was a way
of experiencing things
that I couldn't myself.
so if you're playing Dungeons
& Dragons at the time too,

[16:45]
where you really feel, even pen and paper,
these are like they feel
somewhat, in quotes, real,
to you as you're playing them.
You're very invested in your character
and what you're doing.
And then I loved the games,

[17:00]
the Wizardry and Ultima
that were able to bring
that to a computer so I
could do it on my own time.
It was very, very real to me.
I'd sit in my bedroom and
then go to bed and think
about it and then, oh no,
I have to go to school.
I wanna come home and figure
out how to do this problem
in the game.

[17:16]
And so whatever I was
creating was something
that I was excited about at the time.
I made Raiders of the Lost Ark Game.
- Like with graphics and everything?
- Yeah, it was, so it was usually...
Made a Miami Vice game, made
a Groo the Wanderer game,

[17:31]
made a Traveller game.
I made, and, but every time
I was doing it I wanted
to figure out a new method
on the Apple II of pulling
it off graphically.
Whether that was editing
character sets to get graphics
in different formats or
how can I enable the secret

[17:48]
double high res mode it had,
or just things like that
where it became kind
of this limitless, what
can I make this do?
And I had some friends who
were doing the same thing.
And then you get into, who
can impress each other?

[18:02]
And I was kind of middle
of the pack, I would say,
and that, but again,
this was the time where
they're bringing computers
into the school and the
Apples come into the school
and the teachers are
learning it because they have

[18:16]
to teach the students.
But then I was,
I would say I was part
of a group of students
that were like way past that.
And it was very much of a self-taught,
how do you make this thing dance?
- I'd like to ask a strange question.

[18:32]
So at that time, a lot of
people consider you one of,
if not the greatest game
designer, creator of all time.
You were middle of the pack then,

[18:45]
did you have a sense that
this would be your life
and you would also be creating
the greatest games ever?
- Not in the slightest, no.
I don't think anybody,
but I was very much like that
was my dream at that age.

[19:04]
But you don't think that
that's a job, you know?
And as I got older,
I was really going through college and I,
even the computer classes
then weren't where I wanted

[19:17]
them to be.
So I was still kind of doing my own stuff.
And I ended up getting a business degree
and then interviewing for
some jobs, like finance jobs,
well I guess I should do
this to make money and I can

[19:30]
keep doing this on the side.
And I remember I actually
got to like the final level
of like this corporate
finance job at Circuit City.
- [Lex] Nice.
- And they turned me down
and I was like, fuck them,
I'm just gonna go make video games.

[19:45]
So thank you, Circuit City.
- Yeah, I remember Circuit City.
I think they went bankrupt actually.
- Well they were based in Richmond.
I was going to school
close to there. And so...
- So what, what's the
origin story of you joining
Bethesda Softworks at the time?

[20:02]
- So I had gotten Wayne Gretzky Hockey 3
for Christmas from my
girlfriend at the time,
who's now my wife.
I was in college.

[20:15]
And I noticed that it was
in Rockville, Maryland, and oh,
that's on my way home
over Christmas break back
to William and Mary
where I went to college,
and I was at this point committed,

[20:30]
like this is what I wanna do,
so I'm just gonna drive
by and knock on the door,
which is what I did.
So I drove by and knocked on the doors,
Martin Luther King Day, '93.
And someone came out and
met me and said, well,

[20:47]
maybe, what...
And I, well I'm in college,
I'm talking about when I'm outta school.
I'm like, well, okay,
well, contact us then.
And I would say I was,
I would contact them
every once in a while.
I did work for a small
software company right outta

[21:02]
school down in that area
of Williamsburg and still
would contact, Bethesda,
Arena had just come out.
So then we're in '94, Arena had just come
out and I loved it.
So I was the sports games,
I like the hockey stuff.

[21:16]
They were doing a basketball,
they did a basketball game.
- Yeah, I'm just looking
at, they did a lot of,
they did like six sports games, six,
Bethesda released 10 games,
six of them sports games
and NCAA Basketball,
Hockey League Simulator.

[21:32]
- Hockey League Simulator. Yep.
So there was really
like Sports, Gridiron!,
which is like the first
kind of physics based
football game at the time.
And there's a famous story
with Electronic Arts trying
to do Madden and then hiring
Bethesda, before my time,

[21:46]
to make Madden 'cause
they were struggling.
And when I started at
Bethesda, I remember the owner
had John Madden's Oakland Raiders playbook
in his office.
Like, ooh, can I see that?
And I love sports, right?

[22:00]
So I still play Madden
to this day. I love it.
- So there's an alternate reality where...
- I made sports games?
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.
I wanted to make like the
ultimate college football game.
Well it's always, like it's like music.
You probably listen to lots type of music.
Like you don't play every type...

[22:15]
- But I think of open worlds
as fundamentally different...
- [Todd] Well, sure.
- No, like source of
happiness, entertainment,
storytelling, world, gaming than Madden.
I mean it just, 'cause I love both,

[22:31]
I love both worlds, but...
- They're two totally
different experiences.
Just like when you might watch a movie,
you might be in the mood for
"Lord of the Rings" one day
and then you want some other,
I don't know, competitive
show or game show
or something like that.
Or watch football on TV right?

[22:45]
You watch football on TV,
but then I wanna watch get
really into "Game of Thrones."
So I think all those things
have validity and actually
one of the first things
I worked on when I started at Bethesda was
NCAA Basketball: Road to the Final Four 2.

[23:03]
So that was kind of an
external project which came
in like, hey, you know sports,
get this game done and then went on to,
but they were doing everything I loved.
It was like, this is where I have to work.
They're doing like the
Terminator science fiction stuff.

[23:15]
I love that.
They're doing these open
world role playing games.
Like I love that. And
they're doing sports.
Like this... I have to work here.
So started there and...
- You loved.
- I loved it. Yeah.
So when I came in,
it had just come out and they were doing

[23:30]
the CD-ROM version.
So CD-ROMs aren't even out yet.
- Oh, it used to be floppy discs.
That's probably one of what was a...
- We would burn 'em in the basement.
We had the disc replicators.
- Right. So Arena was
not released on floppy?

[23:48]
- It was, yeah. It's, I
believe it's six floppy discs.
- Six floppy discs.
- Maybe it was eight.
- [Lex] Yeah.
- But in those days, the number
of floppy discs was very,
very important to what,
the money you were making.

[24:03]
so if you wanted to do a
big, huge game, like, well,
that's just too many discs.
So the CD-ROM became
this jumping off point
for the whole industry where,
oh, it's unlimited data.

[24:17]
- By the way, I played Arena...
So that was of course attained (laughs)
legally, as one does.

[24:30]
- [Todd] Alternate means?
- By alternate means on floppy discs.
And that was such an incredible,
as you probably have seen,
interacted with a large number of people,
it's a whole world.
It's a world that you
escaped to in the way,

[24:47]
like your favorite book
like Lord of the Rings, you,
it was just some, it was
unlike anything else.
It was incredible.
It's probably, I mean,
of course as people say
is the first game you play

[25:00]
is the most, is the one
that really sentimentally
means the most to you.
That I think the first
role playing game I played
and it was just, changed everything.
- Was Arena?
- Was Arena. Yeah.
I think Daggerfall is what I
really kinda really played.

[25:17]
Especially because, like you said,
the character development was really rich,
but just like that you can be,
feel like you travel to
this whole other world,
that's less about entertainment,
like a shooting game
and more about a world,

[25:32]
it felt like it's a world,
like you're literally there,
you can travel there, you can live there,
you actually feel like that person,
versus like a Pac-Man, like an arcade fun,

[25:45]
entertaining, adventure game.
So...
So you joined, you made it,
what did you work on first there?
- I worked, well everyone
did a bunch of stuff.

[26:01]
So I worked on the basketball
game really just to get
it out the door, and
Terminator: Future Shock.
So we were doing
Future Shock and Daggerfall
at the same time.
They were developing a new engine.

[26:15]
So it was one of the first
3D engines, the XnGine.
There were a bunch of guys
from Denmark actually.
There's like a big Danish demo scene
in those days in the PC.
And so a bunch of the top
programmers there, well, look,
this is not big, this
is not a big company.

[26:30]
Maybe there's 20 people in development.
And we were doing both Daggerfall
and the new Terminator.
And so Daggerfall was a bit more, again,
behind the Terminator game.
So I was one of the main
people on the Terminator team,

[26:46]
and I don't know, things
kind of worked out.
I very quickly, I don't know why,
like I quickly became the
producer and I was making
levels and doing all these
things, and it was awesome.
And like looking back now
I can understand it better,

[27:02]
but at the time I didn't appreciate it,
which is no one quite owned
the Terminator license.
It was in like this limbo, legally.
So there was no one to
tell us what to, like, no,
you can't do that.
So we would pick apart the movies, and oh,

[27:16]
how does he mention the gun
he wants, and the wattage
of the laser and all these things.
And so Future Shock is a
game that I still love today.
It does a lot of things that
if you go back and look at it,
we're frankly still doing,
like it's a large open
world post-apocalyptic

[27:35]
landscape height map with
instance objects all over it.
And that is still a lot of
how we build our worlds.

[27:45]
- What's an instance object?
- It's, some games every
wall or building is kind
of unique in its data.
Whereas we would just
build these little husks
of buildings and then place
them all over the place.

[28:00]
So the memory and the way you render
it is much more optimal.
- So that allows you to
build a bigger world, more...
- Allows you to build a bigger
world much faster and not
every single version of that building
is in its own unique
architecture that is gonna take

[28:16]
up memory and processing
speed, et cetera, et cetera.
- So you're there very much feeling
the computational
constraints of the system
when you're creating these open worlds.
- And you know what,
that's the thing then,
you see some of it now.
But in those times,
I do feel like every year,
the technology moved.

[28:34]
And maybe it's because
same thing where like
that my age at that time
where every year somebody
was coming up with some new
method or some new game system,
and it was every year that innovation,

[28:49]
innovation, innovation.
And then 3D acceleration
comes along and then
these things come along
and then HD comes along.
And it is true that as time goes on,
there is visually a
diminishing return in terms

[29:03]
of what you're able to do on the screen.
And it, there's a ton of work that goes
into it now because
just rendering this cup
to the perfect shine of
material and roughness
and how does the global
illumination off this wall gets...

[29:17]
It's a ton of work.
But you can pretty much
do what you want now,
if you wanna put the time in.
Whereas then, okay, you
can't do everything you want.
So pick your battles really carefully,

[29:30]
and technically you
couldn't do what you want,
if that makes sense.
- How much trade off is there now
in how much effort you put into
the realism of the
graphics versus the story?

[29:46]
And actually not even how
much effort you put in,
but is there a trade
off in the experience,
the feel of the game in
terms of realism and story?
- Usually we will start
with let the player have

[30:01]
as much agency and do as many things
as they can as possible.
And we will sacrifice some
graphic fidelity for that,
some speed for that.
We could make a game that...
Our, traditionally our games
we are okay with 30 frames

[30:17]
a second, as long as it looks really good
and the simulation's running
and all of those things.
So we'll sacrifice some of that fidelity
for the player experience in
the kind of things that I do.
But from like a manpower standpoint,

[30:32]
the graphics programmers work on graphics,
the artists work on art
and we have an awesome team
of artists and designers
and writers and programmers.
It's usually where we
find, as time goes on,
the amount of art time
that it takes to create

[30:46]
a cup compared to what it used
to be, that has increased.
So we do use, like most people
use art outsourcing as well,
so that we're not, we still relatively,
compared to our industry
and what we're doing,

[31:00]
have smaller teams.
- What about the experience
of the beauty of the graphics?
So like one of the most amazing things
about Skyrim, and maybe you
could say that about some

[31:15]
of the other games, but for
me Skyrim is the outdoor,
when you step outside,
it's the outdoor scenery.
So what does it take to
create the feeling especially
of that being outdoors,
of nature and just like
lost in the beauty...

[31:32]
Whatever it is when you go
hiking and you feel the awe
of it, how do you create that awe?
Is that graphics? What is that?
- It's a lot of graphics,
it's a lot of mood.
We just like talk about
it in terms of tone.
And those are, again, going
back to my previous comment,

[31:49]
the graphics are very, very
important to us because,
and we always push them,
because when you're doing
the kind of things we do
where you step into a virtual world,
it doesn't have to have that
moment of, wow, this is,

[32:02]
this feels real, I've
never experienced this,
and it's okay...
I think it's okay to let,
just like the time settle,
meaning you step out, just
how does the wind sound?

[32:19]
How are the trees moving?
How are the clouds moving?
I enjoy strolling and watching the sunset.
How does it land over the water?

[32:31]
Like it doesn't have to
be like, hey, let's go,
let's finish a quest,
let's go kill things.
Let's figure out the next
step. Let's level up.
Like, I like the quiet
moments a lot and I think
when you play our games,
you can tell we spend
a lot of time on them.
Then you watch like the weather roll in.

[32:47]
I think that's just part of
being, being that character,
being that person in that space.
- Yeah, the,
I saw that there's a mod
that removes all enemies.
I've been meaning to do that,

[33:01]
to just do like a live
stream where for hours walk
around Skyrim just and then
answer questions and so on.
That just feels,
that's a completely
stress-free environment.
It's just, you are, just like you said,

[33:15]
in this moment in time
and it's so incredible.
It feels as incredible as going hiking or
something like that, but in another,
in a totally different place,
like Iceland or something like that.
This whole other surreal ethereal place.

[33:32]
It's, yeah, it's incredible
how you kind of create that.
So graphics is a part of
that, but also letting it,
the temporal aspect of
that, like the wind,
the rustling sound and
look and all of that...

[33:46]
- The soundscape is really,
really important. And the sky...
We spend a lot of time on
the sky 'cause it's taking
up much more of the screen
than a lot of people
give credit for.
- What about the rendering,
the openness of it?

[34:01]
Like how do you, is that...
- There's a lot of level
of detail, streaming work
and nowadays it's getting more common.
Like frankly, the systems
are built better for it.
Hard drive speed is really prioritized.
Like they're so blazing fast.

[34:17]
You take Skyrim and Oblivion
and the Fallouts of that 360 era,
it's a, and it was a lot
of time spent on how do
we get all this data
streaming in as you move

[34:31]
and then levels of detail
so you can see all the way,
but not crush the processor.
- You know what, let's even
step back as you mentioned tone,
you mentioned tone a lot.
What do you mean by tone?
- It's all of it together.

[34:46]
If you look at, I think
you can flip through,
let's just take fantasy,
you can sort of look at
a couple images or things
and know how does "Lord
of the Rings" different
from "Game of Thrones" that is different

[35:01]
than one like Excalibur
or your Syfy channel
series of the month kind of thing.

[35:21]
And so finding that,
what's gonna make it kinda
unique and usually I lean
on something that is grounded
in reality for what it is,

[35:33]
and then have lesser kind
of fantastical things,
at least at the start.
And then they kind of build.
So even when we do Starfield, I mean

[35:45]
it's a science fiction game,
there are laser guns and
spaceships that fly around
and shoot each other and blah blah blah.
But it's grounded in, you
can look at it and say, okay,
this is kind of an extension
of things as we view
them today in space.

[36:01]
And we sort of take the same approach
with Fallout, where admittedly
things can get, admittedly,
things can get even a little
bit crazier the longer
you're developing Fallout content.
- So just to linger on
this, so tone starts at,

[36:19]
or defining the tone starts at creating
a realistic experience?
Like you feel like I could walk
into this and this feels like life.
- What's their technology level,
like even for a fantasy
world, like is magic,

[36:30]
how prevalent is it?
Or are they making weapons
and things and armor...
Is it for utility? Is it for decoration?
How do they live their lives?
Does this feel like a
place that you believe,

[36:45]
that has some grounding in our reality,
whether that's historical
or near future or...
That it's grounded in some
semblance of the reality
that you and I understand
so that it can feel,
it's also making it feel
a little bit welcoming.

[37:02]
Like, okay, I understand this.
- Is that art or science?
So like what, how do you
know when it feels welcoming
and everything fits in this ground?
- I don't know. I mean it's,
I guess it's personal taste.
Some people like things
that are weirder that have

[37:16]
more fantastical from the get-go.
Even a game like Morrowind,
where we get into some
more fantastical things,
it intentionally starts
a little more grounded.
There's a very classic
medieval-looking town

[37:30]
that you come into, but
you look just beyond it,
there're mushroom trees and giant insects
and things like that.
- So in Skyrim, when
you put a dragon in it,
what are your thoughts
about dragons and tone?
How does that fit into tone?

[37:46]
- [Todd] That's a great question. The...
- It's a ridiculous question, but yeah,
I just love dragons, I wanna bring it up.
- No, no, no. These are the
things that we debate with.
- Do we include a dragon?

[38:01]
Why didn't you include
a dragon in Daggerfall?
That's what I wanna know.
- I think there's dragon wings.
They were hard to do.
Dragons are hard to do.
So when you start Skyrim, say, hey, look,
dragons are gonna be a theme.
Start visually.
You can make the argument
that dragons existed.

[38:16]
Okay, what would they look like?
How close to dinosaurs would
they be, or what would they,
and ours are less,
I believe they're less
fantastical looking, in general,
they look like beasts that
could exist in that world.
And then how we introduce them,

[38:31]
it's kind of a little bit of a slow roll
in Skyrim and that the people
in the world are reacting
to the dragons appearing...
And that's somewhat mirrors...
You want something that
mirrors the player experience,

[38:46]
as well that says back to
you, like, hey, no, these are,
this is, have you heard this?
Someone saw a dragon.
- Well that's what Daggerfall,
isn't there mentions of
dragons or something?
'Cause I remember being
sure that there's dragons

[39:00]
in Daggerfall as I'm playing
it and I'm searching.
- I'm pretty sure, well...
- [Lex] Is there a dragon in Daggerfall?
- There's dragon wings in Daggerfall.
To my memory, look,
I guess someone will probably correct me,
like actually there is a dragon here,
but I'm pretty sure they're
sort of, they're not...
And then game I did, Redguard, which,

[39:18]
we bring back a dragon,
it takes place beforehand,
so we have a dragon there in that game.
And that was unique to that at the time.
- Yeah, just a brief tangent on that.
I thought Redguard was a
really, really good game.

[39:31]
I played it as...
I, again, you don't
just, you forget stuff.
But I remember getting,
I guess it was the first
in the Elder Scrolls series
to put it in into that world.

[39:45]
But it was like an adventure game.
You remind me of another
game I really love like
Prince of Persia.
- That was one of the inspirations,
Prince of Persia's one
of my favorite games.
- Like, okay, I apologize
if I'm forgetting,
but you can like jump in
buildings and stuff...

[40:00]
Like there's a jumping, there's a dynamic,
like airy nature,
like it's a like park type situation.
Yeah, it was an incredible game.
Why do you think, let me,
that's sort of a dark question.
Why do you think that game
was a flop? One of the few-
- Not a dark question. Yeah, it was.

[40:16]
Well, a lot of reasons.
Game that I love and really got us going
on a handcrafted world.
So we're coming off a
Daggerfall, Morrowind is sort
of in design, and then part
of our development teams

[40:32]
broke up to do different things.
The games, Battlespire
and Redguard was my game,
and I wanted to do something
a little more Ultima
feeling, handcrafted world.
I really like things that blend up genres.

[40:46]
So I know it's in the
adventure game category,
but it really does a lot of things.
It's a love letter to Prince of Persia.
There's a little Raiders
of the Lost Ark in it.
There's a lot of Ultima in it.
And really see what we
could do with the engine.

[41:01]
But it's very much, I think plays,
like it would've had a
much better home on say
PlayStation or Xbox, it
predates Xbox, right?
Where it's a much more like constantly...
Tomb Raider had come out.
So you see those influences
of Tomb Raider on that game.

[41:18]
And 3D effects cards had just come out.
And so, okay, we can
do, and it was the last,
I think it's one of
the last like DOS games
in a Windows world.
So I think it missed kind
of a technology window

[41:33]
as well as ultimately
not what people wanted
from us, you know?
And I felt, I was really kind of,

[41:45]
the company let me make that
game and it was a big flop,
Battlespire hadn't done well.
The company was in a
really bad shape and I felt
really like personally responsible.
Like they let me do this creative thing,
it didn't do what we
needed it to do and now

[42:01]
we're in a very, very bad situation.
Company almost went out business.
And that's when it got reformed
with ZeniMax Media and Robert Altman came
in and we were starting Morrowind,

[42:15]
we had just sort of started.
And it was sort of that
whole experience that made
you sort of realize,
someone says to you, okay,
you're gonna get another shot.
And that's where like, okay,
we're gonna make Morrowind
and make the biggest,

[42:30]
best RPG we can make.
We know what the audience wants from us,
we know what we could do.
Building a world...
So there's like callbacks to how we built
the world in Redguard.
Morrowind is a large scale, handcrafted,
but if you were to put it pixel per pixel
with Daggerfall, you
wouldn't even see Morrowind,

[42:46]
like 'cause Daggerfall is so big.
But the impact of playing it, I think,
is in many ways equal, but different.
- Just you personally, psychologically,
did you have doubt about yourself
from the performance of Redguard?

[43:01]
Like do I even, do I know what it is to...
- [Todd] Of course, of course.
- Where do you get the,
how do you overcome that?
- I don't know.
I would say this honestly,
I enjoy it so much,
like I'm so heads down like
that becomes for better

[43:18]
or worse like my life.
And it's just something
that I wanna play so much.
It becomes like, there's a little bit,
you get a little obsessed with it.
- No, but I mean, you
love Redguard, right?

[43:32]
So like doesn't that mean,
isn't there a kind of self doubt about,
do I know what it takes
to create a great game?
- Well, no, I think
Redguard's a great game.
- [Lex] Right? So you were
sure even if it wasn't-
- Okay, so you're gonna debate
like, do I like that game?
It's about finding an,
okay, so I love Redguard.

[43:48]
And the people who play it,
it won a bunch of awards and it, like,
critically was a pretty good game.
Did not sell.
And the reason for that, again,
like we probably made this
the wrong type of game

[44:01]
and we missed a technology window.
We also thought it was very conservative,
we're gonna do this.
So my main takeaway was I'm not gonna
be conservative again.
I'm gonna swing for the
fences. And we've had...

[44:15]
There'll be some rough edges in swinging
for the fences and shooting for the moon,
but we'd rather do that
and land where we land
than be very,
very conservative in what
we're putting out there.
- You you've mentioned,
just referencing this game,

[44:31]
on a Reddit AMA that long time ago,
during Redguard, the
lead programmer made me,
made all the buildings hop
up and down after you played
for 10 minutes just to mess with me.
Just on a curious tangent,

[44:45]
what's involved with
programming an open world game?
So we talked about, we will
talk about design and so on,
but specifically the programming,
'cause I think this
question came from what are
some interesting sticky bugs

[45:00]
that you've encountered
throughout your life
in creating these games?
And this is one of them
that you mentioned.
So what are some of the
challenges of programming
these open world games?
- I mean, there are different
flavors of them, right?

[45:16]
Your GTAs will have different issues
than the Ubisoft games versus our games.
I can sort of speak to ours,
which is you wanna build systems, right?
Because they're gonna play
the game for a very long

[45:31]
time as well, which we've learned.
And you can't go through
and touch everything
by hand, per se.
So you have to rely on some
systemic level of creation
and a lot of systems
that are robust enough

[45:47]
so that when they touch another one,
things aren't breaking apart.
- So there's like a, what
are the major systems?
Is there like the physics of the game?
The engine of how like stuff...

[46:00]
Yeah, like yeah the physics,
the motion and maybe how
light is rendered and all
that kind of stuff?
- Right.
So you have the rendering,
right, of like, okay,
this is how I'm gonna
render the data that I have.
So a lot of people confuse
engines with rendering.

[46:15]
I mean, they're combined, obviously,
but there's the data you're
gonna give to a renderer,
which is the thing, you know,
that draws the pixels on the screen.
So there's a, most of
the engine is how are
you gonna bring in that data and give
it to the renderer to draw it.

[46:32]
So you have that whole system
of walking through the world,
feeding in the data and drawing it.
You then obviously have the
physics and the interactivity.
What are the things that
are there just to be drawn
and what are the things
there that are meant

[46:46]
to be interacted with and touched?
We put a big premium
on the ones that can be
interacted with and touched,
whether it's flowers,
whether the trees move, whether
you can sleep on the sofa,
sit in this chair, pick up
all this stuff, bake bread,

[47:00]
blah blah blah.
You then have, the AI,
which loops in the stuff
we talked about earlier in
terms of processing everybody,
and combat systems,
which is a lot of what
people end up doing,
combat systems on top of that AI.

[47:17]
How do they react to
those types of things?
And then how do they look
at the things that can
be interacted with?
One of my favorite things
is when NPCs will go pick
up weapons in the world.
But you don't see in other games.

[47:30]
And the first time you
see it in one of ours,
it's like very unexpected.
You can drop like a crazy weapon,
be in a fight and an NPC runs over,
picks it up and uses it on you.
It's not something you would
expect. But I love that stuff.
- And that's integrated
into a larger system.

[47:45]
The ability to pick up
a, the NPC picking up,
so it's not like a little
quirk that's hard coded in,
it's part of a bigger system.
- They have their own AI
for scanning the environment
and that's one of the rules.
Hey, is there a weapon that
is better than the one I have?

[48:02]
I'm gonna go get it.
Now, we do lock off if it's in a chest
and that's treasure we
left for the player.
But it's in particular,
'cause what you don't want,
we actually had this problem started
in Oblivion, I believe,
which was set a level, hey,
let the enemies go pick up
the weapons if they're better.

[48:17]
So we make a level and go
in and all of the enemies
are armed to the teeth
and there's no treasure
for the player because the
enemies went and took all
the good weapons.
And you say, okay, they don't take those,
they take the ones that
are dropped by other
NPCs or the player.

[48:31]
- That's such a fascinating
world of the designing
the experience for the
NPC because in part,
that experience is, defines
the experience as a player.
So how they interact with
their environment defines

[48:45]
how the player experiences
their environment.
Is there a room for further
and further development
of the AI that controls the NPC?
- Sure, we're always iterating on it.
And again, as we look in the future,

[49:03]
it's more about us finding
those more reactivity
to the player and also
understanding their roles
in the world.
So they're not just there,
they're not just there for the player,

[49:16]
as a sign post for the player.
- But they're reacting to
the player. But what about...
Some of the richest
experiences we have with people
is like the chaos of it.
The push and pull, the unpredictability.

[49:30]
Is there something, I don't
know if you've been following,
but the quick amazing
development of language models,
the neural network,
natural language processing
systems, dialogue systems...

[49:45]
Do you think there's some
possibility of using sort
of these incredible neural nets that can
have open-ended dialogue?
Basically chat bots?
- Yep. I've seen some incredible demos.
I do think it's coming. I don't know when.

[50:02]
And there's a little
bit of a question like
what's ready for real deployment
and release, versus hey,
let's use that to generate
some things that is then

[50:15]
static that we're giving to the players,
versus it's generated on the fly,
but it's definitely coming,
it's definitely coming.
And I think you'll see it in
the types of games that we do.
It has great application.
- I love the idea though.

[50:30]
You'd be using AI to design different
NPCs and then testing
if they're good enough,
if they're like a little too crazy,
you don't want like the super...
- Right.
But if we go back to it being reactive,
some of that bot stuff, it's
pretty, it's incredible.

[50:47]
It's then translating
that into voice and then
is that being done by the client?
Is it being done on a server?
Is it baked into the game?
There's like different flavors of it.

[51:00]
- So there's still
computational challenges,
like how do you actually make that happen?
- Right.
- Well what about, oh,
in terms of creating the
feeling of an NPC, oh,
what's the role of voice actors and...
- Awesome.
Yeah, we work with a ton of
voice actors and they bring

[51:18]
so much to it.
And that's the thing,
we can write some stuff
and the best ones get
in there and make it so much
better or even ad lib things.

[51:30]
And so we do a lot of voice recording,
and we used to do it
kind of like at the end
of the project, and now
we do it throughout.
We start really early and
we just start recording.
So we're recording for
years and years, literally,

[51:46]
probably three years, four years.
- So part of the actual
experience of the recording
will help define the characters
and the tone of the game.
- Right.
And we'll go back sometimes
and, hey, we really like this,
we want more of this.
Let's write, let's do another session.
Or hey, we don't think this
character's actually working.

[52:02]
We want you to do different.
You're gonna be someone else
now. Sorry, that got cut.
- Do you ever try to sort
of imagine that people fall
in love with the
characters, with the NPCs?
- [Todd] I do.
- Like, I mean do they get
really attached to the...

[52:17]
- Oh yeah. I mean, I've done it in games.
- These are like close friends, right?
Like you can, like you miss them.
- [Todd] A hundred percent.
- Isn't that part of the thing?
- Actually, like whenever I'm
playing a game and there is,
if there's like a friendship
option or make friends
or a romance thing, I
find those moments really,

[52:33]
I enjoy them.
I find them pretty impactful emotionally
to what we're doing.
And so we've done a little bit of it.
It's one of the things
that we actually have
pushed in Starfield.
So we have a number of
companions, but for them we go,

[52:50]
I won't say super complex romantic,
but more complex relationships
than we've had in terms
of not just some state of
they like you or they don't

[53:02]
like you, but they can be in love
with you and dislike something
you did and be pissed
at you temporarily and then
come back to loving you.
- So that relationship
status, if it's complicated,
that they're existing in that
gray area, it's complicated.

[53:18]
We're not dating, we're just, we're...
- Well it's, in a lot
of games previous stuff,
you just work your way up.
They like you more, more,
more and now you're in a relationship.
And when you make 'em upset,
you drift out of like, it never happened.

[53:31]
You drift out of it.
Whereas we wanted one where, okay,
we can be in a relationship
and we've committed
to each other in some way,
but I just did something
that really made you angry,
and as opposed to just
drifting outta that status,
you're in a temporary, I
don't like what you did state.

[53:48]
- Wow.
So some greater degree of complexity
in the relationship with a companion?
- A little bit.
- A little bit?
- I don't wanna oversell
that part, but my point is,
I think those things
where you meet a character

[54:00]
in a game and you do spend time with them,
a companion in a game,
and it leads to romance,
myself and others and I
find a lot of players,
those moments are really,
really impactful and special
to them 'cause they did
put in the time.

[54:15]
That's another thing that
I always come at it with,
which is, I think people
who don't play video games,
they sometimes think like,
oh that's, I don't know,
that's a waste of time.
Or that's not real.
That's not like, you're not
getting a lot out of that.
Like, well, you haven't really experienced
it in the way that you
can because these moments

[54:31]
that I spent in games, not
the ones I made, other ones,
when I was growing up
or even now, those are,
that is important time to me.
Like, I love those moments.
I felt really like proud
of what I accomplished.

[54:45]
And we want people to
have that in our games.
And the fact that
they have had those experiences
and we hear from them
and how important it's
to them, it's like, no,
this is really, really special.
- Yeah, it's, I mean from
a game design perspective,

[55:03]
I wonder if you can honor
the time you spent together
with the game, because
sometimes there's a heartbreak
at the end of the game.
Like when you're, when you
leave a game, there's a, yeah,

[55:18]
it's a really complicated
relationship actually.
'Cause when you leave a game,
it's almost like leaving
a romantic partner,
because it's like you
spent so much meaningful
time together and there's a sense

[55:33]
in which it was ephemeral,
like it, this is not, this...
- [Todd] Did it happen?
- Yeah, it didn't really
happen. It was good.
It was like you went to Vegas,
you got drunk and stuff,

[55:46]
but like, and now life goes on.
I wonder if there's a way
to sort of always carry
that with you.
I mean, I guess with words you
can kinda share with others.
Like...
- It's weird, I don't, like,
now that we're in the age
where you have achievements

[56:00]
and you can look at your
library and see your hours
and games, like that's like,
it's almost like a scrapbook now.
Like I wish, one of my wishes was like,
I wish I had that achievement
list for everything.
Like back to the late '70s.

[56:16]
- Like every game you played?
- Right. When...
- Yeah, yeah.
Like you, I mean that's one
of the cool things with Xbox.
Like we're moving towards that direction.
It'd be cool to be, from like childhood.
The first time you play
video game it will actually

[56:30]
tell you what is the first game you...
- But you know what, kids
today, they will have that.
- They will have that. (laughs) And see...
- But you could look
back and see, oh my god,
I put 1000 hours in Daggerfall.
- What is the first-
- And my last save was 1997.

[56:46]
- Last save... Man, I
don't know, Golden X maybe.
I'm trying to think
what was the first game
I've ever played.
No, it's probably
Commodore 64 games. Yeah.
The arcade games. Okay.

[57:02]
You mentioned Starfield.
What is Starfield and what's
the origin story of this game?
- We had always wanted to do something
where you explore space,
the explore space role playing game.
So take the kinda games
that we make and give

[57:18]
it a little bit of a different spin.
And the other games that I loved,
there was a pen and paper
RPG I loved, Traveller.
It was one of the first games
I made for the Apple II.
Didn't ever, I never finished it, right,

[57:32]
I'm just doing it on my own.
And I loved this game.
Starflight was one, Star
Control II was a game
that I loved.
SunDog was a big one in the
Apple II days that a lot
of people don't know that I loved.

[57:46]
And so a lot of us in the studio felt,
it was time to do something new.
We're going between Elder Scrolls
and Fallout and going back
and forth and I mean,
we love that, but hey,
we've always wanted to do this,
explore the galaxy science fiction game.

[58:02]
Now is the time to do that.
- And that's a brave move.
So Fallout's post-apocalyptic
on a single planet.

[58:16]
Elder Scrolls series
is on a single planet.
So this is going out into
the open world of many
star systems, many planets.
I saw that it's thinking
about 100 star systems

[58:30]
and 1000 planets available to explore.
What is that world of
stars and planets like?
- Well, you mentioned Daggerfall,
we go back to some of that.
Well the first one we did
it was how are we gonna
render a planet?

[58:45]
Like pull it off for
the player? Like can we?
Or do we have to sort of
do it where you can't land
on all of 'em, where
you're landing in a very
controlled small world
space that we kind of craft
and you would have a very
limited set of those.

[59:01]
If you go back to tone like, well,
that's probably the wrong
tone and how can we say yes?
Like I wanna land on that ice ball.
So it started, we started the game
right after Fallout 4, so 2016.
And the first thing we did was,

[59:18]
how can we have a system
to generate these planets
and make them look, I'll say,
reasonable as opposed to fractally goop.

[59:31]
- What's the technical definition
of goop? Fractally goop?
- Fractally goop.
You've probably seen a
lot of like simulations,
whether they're space
things or landscape things
where they're using fractals
and just the landscape
does not look real, it's just,
this is like highs and
lows and it's muddy.

[59:47]
And so we did find a way,
we came up with a way,
had prototyped of building tiles,
like large tiles of
landscape the way we would
usually build them.
We kind of generate them offline, hand-do
some things and end up
with these very realistic

[1:00:02]
looking tiles of landscape.
And then built a system
that wraps those around
a planet and blends them all together.
And we had pretty successful
results with that.

[1:00:15]
And so we thought, yeah, we could do this.
And so there was a big design
kind of problem to solve
in terms of, well,
what's fun about landing on a planet
where there's potentially nothing?

[1:00:31]
'Cause there's a lot of planets
and moons if you kind of,
right, in reality that, well,
there's nothing on 'em except resources.
And so we spent a lot of
time figuring out, okay,
let's just lean in on, that
can, A, be a lonely experience.

[1:00:45]
As long as we tell the
player, here's what's there,
here are the resources that
are there, go find them.
But I equate it to that moment of,
we said about listening to the wind go
and watching the sunset.
And I do think there's a
certain beauty to landing

[1:01:00]
on a strange planet, being
somewhat the only person there,
building an outpost.
And we are modeling all
of the systems 'cause
that's how we like to do things.
So you can watch whatever
that gas giant or moon,
it will rotate and go and sunrise,

[1:01:16]
sunset and all of those
things that you would expect.
And it's all really happening.
And most people probably
won't notice or appreciate
all of that.
But I think it gives
them the ability to say,

[1:01:33]
I wanna go do that and
see that on that place.
As long as we tell them, hey,
the quest leads over here,
here's where the handcrafted content
is that you would expect.
And then here's more of the open
procedural planet experience.

[1:01:48]
Long answer, I dunno if
I answered your question.
- There's no, the questions
are stupid and the answers
are really, so that's how this works.
So this is the world's
most immense simulator
of the human condition of loneliness?

[1:02:01]
'Cause I can't imagine a
more lonely experience.
- I mean, you put it that way.
I don't know that was the goal, but...
- Just on a planet alone, I
just, that must be, I mean,
a deep embodiment of
what loneliness is like.

[1:02:17]
I mean it's the both the on the,
like when you hike alone, there's a,
there is a deep loneliness to that.
It's like, it's humbling
that this thing will last
much longer than you.

[1:02:30]
It's been here way before you.
- Is it the line from the moon landing?
Beautiful desolation?
It's Buzz Aldrin, is it?
- Beautiful desolation?
Is that what you said?
- I think so.
- Beautiful desolation.
Well...
- Something like that.
- But that's just words.
There's a feeling to it.

[1:02:46]
And you want that feeling to be real.
You just hear, there's
some resources here.
I just feel like it'll hit
people a certain moment like
it does for me with Skyrim.
Like, holy shit, I'm here alone.
And the, and whatever cruel nature

[1:03:01]
that's out there doesn't
really care about me.
- Exactly.
- That's the experience.
So you wanna create the
whole planet and you wanna
have many of them.
- We have, we do have many.

[1:03:15]
But once you build that system,
I think the numbers become,
I mean honestly a little bit...
We wrap it in so we can
name them all and have
a finite set even though it's
a very, very large number,
but a set that we can validate and know

[1:03:32]
about even though it's a huge number.
But once you, once you're
building a system that can
build a planet, I mean a planet
is sort of infinite space.
We go back to the
Daggerfall analogy, right?
If you have systems to
build that much space,

[1:03:45]
doing 100 planets or 1000
or 10,000 or a million
planets is not, it's just, you just press,
you just change the
number, press the button.
But you can't name them
all, you can't control,
like when you're getting
in really big numbers,
hey, what does this system
way out here feel like

[1:04:02]
if you take your ship and jump that far?
We do level the systems.
When you go to system you'll see, oh,
this is like a level 40 system.
And us being able to at
least control that scale
is how we kind of ended
up with the hundred-ish

[1:04:16]
systems we have.
- What are the levelings?
What do you mean by level?
- Maybe like when you
look at a map in a game,
it says this is the area
for low level players.
This is level one.
- Oh got it, got it.
- Yeah, yeah. So we do that on
a system basis, star system.

[1:04:32]
- I read that space travel
is considered dangerous
in this game.
Can you explain.
- That's more of, that goes
back to a tone thing, right?
When you actually play the
game, 'cause it's a game...
Like we don't really kill you
when you fly out in space,

[1:04:48]
but it has a tone of there's
some effort involved,
and we've dialed it back as
we've been making the game.
Whereas we used to run out of fuel,
you jump and get stranded,
which on paper was a great,

[1:05:00]
like, it's a great moment
when you get stranded
and you have to press this beacon,
you don't know who's gonna come.
Turns out that's not like,
it just stops your game.
We found you'd be playing
the game and ran outta fuel.
Okay, I guess I'll just
wander these planets trying

[1:05:15]
to mine for fuel so I can
get back to what I was doing.
It just, it's a fun killer.
- That's too realistic of a simulation
of the human condition.
- Yeah, no, the idea was, well,
it's, a few games do that.
If you had like a hardcore, you're right,
a hardcore survival mode,

[1:05:31]
that's the kind of thing you would do,
maybe we'll do it in the future,
but it's more of like a tone,
how they build their ships,
do they have all the
right things for safety?
We do get into environmental
things on the planets,
in your space suit,

[1:05:45]
obviously a lot of different
space suits and buffs
for the gases, the
toxicity or the temperature
on various planets.
- Are there robots?
- Yes.
- Those companions, are
they robots by chance?

[1:06:00]
Can you, can you...
- One of the companions
is the robot Vasco. Yeah.
- Okay.
So they have a name and a
personality and so on and...
- Vasco does, and then
there's a whole bunch of,
I call 'em generic robots.
So you like we use them for
utility, you know, okay,

[1:06:16]
people, we actually dialed them back.
'Cause if you think about,
well, you know a lot about this,
more than me, in terms of...
- I'm offended right now,
you calling robots generic and bad...
- No, no, no.
The ones we use, the ones we use,
we made them more generic.
- Sorry, I'm very sensitive about this.

[1:06:31]
- I understand.
If you were to chart the future,
you would say robots would
have a much bigger role
in our future than we are presenting.
But that was the tone thing.
So we, most of our robots
are there as utility robots

[1:06:47]
and there are some combat
ones as well as enemies.
- So it's the deeply human world.
- Very much. Yes.
- In terms of tone.
So have you talked to Elon about this,
about this game, is there-
- A little bit?

[1:07:02]
- How much of reality,
like the work of SpaceX is an inspiration
for the decisions made in this game?
- I wouldn't say it's for
the decisions we made,
but visiting SpaceX and
walking in there, it was,

[1:07:19]
it's like the Avengers meet NASA,
it's like the most amazing,
and here we're building the next gen,
like see the dragon stuff
before it was, other people saw,

[1:07:31]
like just I was really in awe.
This giant machine that
looks for imperfections
on the surface of these giant
fuselages, just whenever,

[1:07:48]
and because we're in DC, go
to the Air Space Museum a lot.
And so whenever I look
at those kind of things
or you'll visit the Space
Shuttle, sort of overcome
with how big it is and I go
stand back by the engines

[1:08:01]
and think about that thing leaving orbit,
and one of the things that
Elon really impresses,
like we are reaching the
edge of physics on a lot
of this stuff where, how
hard it is to leave orbit,

[1:08:16]
the gravitational pull, and like,
so the engineering that
has gone into that,
our space program, what he's
doing now, I just marvel it.
I don't understand, right?
I'm not at that level,
but I marvel at the kind of
human ingenuity and scale.

[1:08:35]
I was on the Delaware coast last month,
and I went, I was outside
for some reason, it was dark,
and I saw this crazy light in the sky,

[1:08:47]
and I thought it was like
a helicopter and then
it didn't go away.
And I'm like, someone, what is that?
And I call my, we had,
with some friends, hey,
does everybody see this?
What is that?
And we just stood dumbfounded
looking at this thing

[1:09:01]
in the sky.
And like, that is a UFO.
Nobody takes their phone out.
Everyone.
I'm with like four people,
everyone is too dumbstruck.
You would think, why
don't you take a picture
of this thing?

[1:09:15]
And the next day we found
out, it was in the news,
it was the SpaceX launch
in Florida, and I'm seeing
it from Delaware, Maryland area.
It was one of the most, it was incredible.
It's just, even just that,
I am in complete awe.

[1:09:33]
- Is there some aspect
to that you can replicate
the majestic nature of
that in the video game?
- I wish I had the answer to that.
I think some of it we were doing,

[1:09:46]
when you're standing
on a planet and you see
the other moons go by.
And then you realize I
could get my ship blast off
and land there and build myself home.
I think that's pretty cool.
There's a minor thing we do,
which is we have other ships come and go

[1:10:01]
from the star ports when you're there.
So you'll be in a city and then
you hear, (imitates engine)
this and you hear the engine,
you look up and a ship
is taken off or coming...
Like there's nothing for you to do.
But it's, I think it's awesome.
- Yeah. Yeah.

[1:10:15]
So then that's all about creating
the soundscape to feel...
- Seeing it and like, oh,
that's real, that's a ship that,
or you jump into a system
and you see these freighters
and sometimes they contact you.
Like it's not all just
like jumping and combat.

[1:10:31]
- Do you ever think about
the fact that science
fiction seems to make, it has
a way of creating reality,
not just kind of predicting
it or imagining it.

[1:10:45]
It's almost like the thing you put
out there with a video game like this,
like Starfield, that
you kind of anticipate,
it kind of fuels people's
imagination what is possible.

[1:11:01]
- Maybe, I don't know.
I can't say, you're making me think now
about other science fiction,
that movie I love, "Minority Report".
It's more of like a, not a space movie,
but more like looking at the future.

[1:11:15]
If you look at a lot of
the things in that movie,
it's almost like, I think
those are coming true.
- Yeah.
I mean, is that the one that
you do interface this like...
- It's the interfaces
and then the he way looks
as child's more like a
holographic almost AR VR kind

[1:11:32]
of thing or digital billboards or trying
to predict human behavior...
There's like, there's
just a lot of future stuff
in that movie.
As it comes to sci-fi,
to your other question,

[1:11:45]
I don't know.
I dunno.
- Well I think it does
and it's interesting.
I mean I suppose you're trying to create
the most realistic, sticking to the tone,
the most immersive, realistic world.
And almost by accident
you create the thing

[1:12:01]
that is possible, because
you want it to be realistic
in some deep sense,
so accidentally can become the possible.
And then that places that
idea in people's heads.
I mean if humans are ever to become

[1:12:15]
a multiplanetary species,
we need to play games.
We need to read sci-fi to help imagine
that that's possible.
To look outside of Earth, to look outside,
look up on the stars
and then we can actually

[1:12:30]
travel out there.
I don't know, there's
power to sci-fi to do that.
I guess you shouldn't
feel the pressure of that.
- I don't know if I'd make
the leap now, that's all,
that what we're doing might...
Now, maybe, one of our,

[1:12:47]
hopefully it might
inspire some young people
who are headed in that
direction of like, oh,
I thought about getting
into space and space
exploration and being an engineer,
doing these things and I played this game

[1:13:00]
and it really sparked that interest in me,
so I'm gonna go take
that as a field and maybe
that's the person who goes
and does some of these things.
- Yeah.
Because in the next couple of decades,
likely a human being will
step foot on Mars, which are

[1:13:17]
the first steps towards us
becoming multiplanetary.
- And then if you read some of the stuff
they're doing with the James
Webb telescope and them
being able to look for signs
of life on other planets...

[1:13:31]
It's quite fascinating.
And recent stuff I read
say they think in 20
years they will.
So it's actually quite
encouraging to think,
almost a dream of mine,
like in our lifetimes

[1:13:45]
that we discover life on another planet.
- Yeah. Especially if
it's intelligent life.
I've been talking to a lot
of biologists and a lot
of folks, I imagine there's
life everywhere out there.
- The numbers are, would say so, yes.

[1:14:00]
- The challenging question
is what it looks like
and how much of it is intelligent.
So a lot of biologists tell
me the big difficult leap
is from the prokaryotes to the eukaryotes.
So like the complex life,
it could be that a lot of our universe is

[1:14:15]
just filled with bacteria.
- Well I believe, if I'm
understanding it right,
that there's two ways they're
gonna look at planets,
when they can look at, they can read, hey,
this planet has this kind of gas,
they can now look at the
ones that are created
by potential life forms and
then the ones that are created,

[1:14:32]
the byproducts of industry.
So there's only certain
ones that are created
if you have a society there.
And that they can start
looking on these types of,
and these types of star
systems and these planets.

[1:14:45]
But it takes a lot of time
'cause you have to book time
on that telescope.
You have to like look at
that planet over a long
period of time.
But in theory, given enough time,
given the amount of space
out there, we would find one.

[1:15:01]
- That would be a cool thing
in this short life of ours
to find out definitively
that there is an industrial
intelligent civilization
out there, before you
contact them, so like die,
end your life, not knowing
the rest of the story,

[1:15:18]
but just know that it's out there.
That's a cool, and then if
you have kids be like, well,
this one's on you.
F this, I'm out.
- And I'm fascinated by
what it would do to the way,

[1:15:32]
I think in a positive way,
the way humanity thinks about itself here.
Like no, there is definitively
other life out there.
- I mean both things.
If there isn't life out there,

[1:15:46]
that's also a huge responsibility.
Both are super exciting.
If we're alone, it's super exciting
because there's a
responsibility to preserve
whatever special thing
we have going on here.
This, whether you call it
the flame of consciousness

[1:16:01]
or whether there's
consciousness or intelligence,
that's a special thing.
Preserve it, have it expand.
But if there's others out
there, I mean that, like,
that sparks that drive for exploration,

[1:16:16]
of reaching out into the
stars and meeting them.
Most of them probably
wanna kill us. (laughs)
So, but luckily we have the
military industrial complex
on Earth that builds
bigger and better weapons
all the time.
- We have Space Force.
- Space Force.

[1:16:31]
- [Todd] Right.
- It will both protect us
and destroy all our enemies.
(laughs) This is 100% a
video game we're living in.
Okay, back to dragons.

[1:16:45]
So blink once if when Elder
Scrolls VI is coming out,
but are not going to tell me.
- Okay. I have a vague idea.
- Okay. Vague idea.
So like if you have the quantum mechanical

[1:17:00]
interpretation that allows
for multiple universes,
in the universe where you didn't blink,
what would that Todd tell me
about the year it's coming up.
Would it be 2025?
- That's a trick question.
- Or '26.
- I was asked that question in many ways,

[1:17:16]
but never like that.
- Yeah. I thought I would try to sneak it.
And I mean there is of
course no answer, because...
- I wish it was soon.
Like we don't, we want
'em out too, you know.

[1:17:32]
And I wish they didn't
take as long as they did,
but they do.
And look, I mean, if I
could go back in time,
would never have been
my plan to wait as long
as it's taken for it.

[1:17:46]
- So you love that world,
the Elder Scrolls world.
- Well look, it's part of who I am,
spent more time there than anything else
in my life probably, right?
So, it's, deeply love it. We all do.
It's a part of us.

[1:18:00]
And when you aren't doing it for a while,
you really do miss it.
And when I look at what we're doing,
have planned for that game,
and I was in a meeting
yesterday, I was like,

[1:18:16]
I just wanna play all this right now.
But it, we're gonna
make sure we do it right
for everybody and we do
have to approach it...
People are playing games for a long time.
Skyrim's 11 years old, still
probably our most played game.

[1:18:35]
And so we don't see it slowing down.
And people will probably
be playing it 10 years
from now also.
So you have to think about, okay,

[1:18:45]
people are gonna play the
next Elder Scrolls game
for decades, two decades.
And that does change the way you think
about how you architect
it from the get go.
- What are some elements
that change the way...

[1:19:02]
Like how do you make a game
that's playable for 20 years?
- I know we're trying to
figure that out... (laughs)
- There is some elements,
I should pause on that.
Part of me, I'm of
course asking, jokingly,
I'm excited for it.

[1:19:15]
But I think Skyrim is
an amazing game still.
I really enjoy it still.
- Yeah.
And you know what the content, the,
even if think if you step
away from it for a while,
then play what I'll put say the vanilla
version without mods.
If you go and haven't
played it in a while,

[1:19:30]
there's always a new way to play it.
But then if you look at
the mods and what creators
are doing to it, we think
that is just awesome.
It's something that
we've always supported.
We're gonna keep supporting.
We've hired a large number of modders

[1:19:45]
that are now professionals.
We wanna support the people
who are doing on their own
so they can be professionals on their own.
- How do you create a
world that's moddable?
So you think of designing the game
from the start as that enables mods?

[1:20:03]
- Yep, absolutely.
So it starts with us, like
everything we're doing okay,
a modder, a content creator's
gonna have to do it,
use our tools...
Now we do clean them up for release,

[1:20:15]
because if you're like
a developer in house,
you can deal with some
kludginess when you're putting
stuff together, when you
put it out for people,
we do clean a lot of it up,
then there's still a lot,
obviously a learning curve there.
But we have, look,
we have people been doing
it for 20 years with us.

[1:20:30]
- What's involved with modding?
I'm actually quite noob-ish at this.
And I'm almost afraid to ask,
'cause now that you
explain to me I'll, I fear
I will spend a very large
amount of time creating mods.
- Well we have an editor,
you can download
on Steam, the Creation
Kit for our games and then

[1:20:47]
it loads up the world and you
could do something really,
really small, like change
the color of the weather,
and it creates a little
plugin file, we call it,
a modification of the game.
And then you can run your game with that.
It's on console now, that,
the mods, not the editing.

[1:21:03]
And it's just been incredible.
Our community there has
been amazing what they do
with the games...
- So a lot of it is the visuals.
- A lot of people do visual things 'cause

[1:21:15]
it's the easiest thing to do first
or they're building new space.
There's some great things with like,
I love the Khajiit
follower mod for Skyrim.
It's awesome. There
have been quest lines...
Those things just take a
really, really long time.

[1:21:32]
And so someone is gonna do that.
That's almost like, it
takes 'em a long time.
It's more than a hobby.
And we're always looking at
ways that we can make it like,
hey, they can turn a career into it 'cause

[1:21:46]
it's just awesome.
- What about, is there any
possibility in doing a mod
for the, some of the AI stuff?
- There is, and I've seen some,

[1:22:00]
but to really move it along,
if they're using the tools
that we already put out there.
So to really move the AI along,
you'd have to get in the code,
which some people have
figured out ways to hack
in and do things with script extenders.
But for the most part,
like really pushing it,

[1:22:15]
it does take us, which is why you see,
when we have a new game come along,
the palette that they have is,
there's so many more things they can do.
- Well, I've built bots
that play the driving games.
But they do that by just taking,

[1:22:31]
reading the screen and
doing basic, not basic,
it's actually pretty
complicated, but computer vision,
doing the control.
But you're basically
simulating the human player.
To do that for Skyrim or for one,
some of the open world games...
That's literally, you have
to create AGI to be able

[1:22:46]
to play the, those open, well, maybe not.
Maybe you can create a super dumb,
like just a two-handed sword and just keep
swinging until everybody...
- There, look, there's some bot stuff
out there that does it.
We have some very,

[1:23:00]
very dumb bots that we use
to run through the world
to test it, that we'll
deploy on a whole bunch
of servers just to...
We do it every day. We
run through every space.
We're doing it with Starfield.
- And them just running...
They're all out there.
- Well, it does it very quickly.
It loads up every place in
the game and runs around

[1:23:19]
a little bit and then loads
the next place and runs
around a little bit.
We're just testing like, did it crash,
what's the memory growth,
what's the, get a report,
here are all the places
where the frame rate wasn't
up to snuff.
And then we do have one
that will play on its own.

[1:23:32]
It's heavily scripted,
but it lets us test...
Every time we make a build,
there's a bot that runs
through like the first one
or two main quests.
Like it'll just play it.
That way we know, do we break anything?
'Cause you don't wanna
waste like QA's time,

[1:23:46]
like you guys broke it
again within five minutes.
So, yeah.
- So that's for like broken stuff?
- [Todd] Right.
- I wonder if you can
build a bot that estimates
the quality of the experience.
- Oh my gosh. Okay.

[1:24:00]
Can you do that?
- But just like the number,
like how boring or not boring,
the boring meter.
- How many times you die.
Death, is death boring or
exciting? That's a question.
I mean, I don't feel like
there's a balance to be

[1:24:15]
struck 'cause you always wanna be in fear
of death, against...
- Yeah we always, we have
this chart at work we use,
which is like, if you think about any game
that you've played that you've put down,
it's either about a frustration
slash confusion or boredom.

[1:24:30]
You gotta put the player
right in the middle of that.
- But I've sometimes put
down games from frustration
only to return again, stronger.
- [Todd] Dark Souls. Yeah.
- So I mean there that
that's, I mean the challenge,

[1:24:47]
that's part of it.
It's, well, I don't know,
actually Skyrim, I don't,
I'm one of those,
I mean I'm sure there's
all kinds of humans
that you've interacted
with about what they enjoy.
But to me, I could enjoy Skyrim on every,

[1:25:00]
on any difficulty at the
level, it doesn't, all of it.
So it depends, the open world nature
of it is what's really compelling,
not necessarily the challenge
of the particular quest
and so on.
But I'm not sure if that's the same
experience for everybody.

[1:25:15]
- Do you play the survival mode?
There's a survival mode in Skyrim.
Was that Creation Club thing.
It does, like, some hunger.
It does hot and cold.
It does some other systems
that make it, in our minds,
a more believable, and it was
actually a Creation Club thing

[1:25:34]
made by an external creator
who is now full-time with us.
- So can we actually,
thinking about Starfield, thinking
about Elder Scrolls VI,
go through the full life

[1:25:47]
of a video game you've created.
So what's it take to take a
game from the idea to find
the final product?
What are the different
steps along the way?
- Great question.

[1:26:01]
Well usually it starts with,
I mean honestly lunchtime
conversations with a number
of us, hey, we think we wanna do this,
this is what it's gonna be like.
I mean look, with an
Elder Scrolls, you know
you're gonna do it.
It's a matter of when.

[1:26:15]
We say, okay, what's the
tone we're going for? Right?
Where's it set? So we
usually start with the world.
And then we are always overlapping.
So while we're making one game,
as we are getting in the
throes of it or wrapping it up,

[1:26:33]
probably by the midpoint
of one game we've had
enough conversations to
understand what the next
one's gonna be.
What are the big ticket?
Like where's it set?

[1:26:46]
What's the tone?
Is there a big ticket feature too
that make it really unique.
And then when we're finishing one game,
we start prototyping, sorry,
before that we start concepting.

[1:27:01]
So we'll do concept art, and
for one reason or another,
I usually have the beginning
of the game worked out.
Like I like to think about,
okay, how's the game start?
What's the player do
first? We do music early...

[1:27:16]
So take Elder Scrolls VI, we
figured out where it's set,
what's the tone, what
are the big features,
we discuss the beginning of the game,
which we've had for a very long time.
- Where's it set again?
I'm just kidding. (laughs)
- Yep. And, in Tamriel and...

[1:27:31]
- Ah, dammit.
Well at least we know, we
narrowed it down that, yeah,
that would be epic if it was like a portal
into another dimension.
Anyway.
- Then I like to do music.
So we've already done a take on the music
for Elder Scrolls VI.

[1:27:46]
- So you can sit there with the,
with like the concept art and the music.
You can feel it?
- Music? No, no.
The music we put in the
teaser for it, this was 2018.
We've taken that further obviously.
And, again, we're working on the world.

[1:28:03]
You're then doing concepting
and design for the world.
And then once we we're
wrapping up one game,
we can really start
prototyping the new one
and you're usually building
kind of your initial spaces.
And so we do like to do
like a first playable,

[1:28:16]
a smaller section of the
game that we can sort
of prove out and show to people, hey,
this is how it feels different,
this is what it looks like,
this is what's unique about it.
Then we turn that into
a larger chunk when more
of the team comes on when
the other game is done.

[1:28:31]
And that's still what we
call a VS, vertical slice.
So you still don't have
the full team on it.
And it's a larger chunk of
the game that you can play.
And then once you feel good about that,
you're gonna bring on
the rest of the team.

[1:28:46]
And we're fortunate that
the other games we've done
are popular enough that we can be doing
DLC and content and those kind of things
while we're getting the one going.
And then we're at full
production where we're sort
of at maximum size.
We just call that production.
That's like the full production period.

[1:29:02]
And that, depending on the game,
can run a year or two years, maybe more.
And then you kind of have a finalizing,
final six months to a year
on a game, which is, okay,

[1:29:16]
we've built everything now,
and usually it needs a lot
of glue where we have a lot
of very different
elements that maybe aren't
clicking together the way you want outside
of the regular polish
for levels and features.

[1:29:31]
And we're shaving and
gluing and sticking things
together so that it's
not this schizophrenic
game experience that things
flow from one into another.
- In terms of story, like on that level?
- It's, no usually the story,
the designers have done a really good job.

[1:29:45]
It's more about game features and then
how they interact with the story or hey,
I went from this experience
to this experience
or picking flowers and
alchemy feels like a different
game than, and then how
is another character

[1:30:00]
referencing that and
how is that intersecting
with the skill system and the interface?
Like the skill system and the
interface is the party host.
If you think about a game, most games,
particularly what I like to do,

[1:30:17]
is that's your person who says,
welcome, do this, go here,
check this out.
And the skill system and the way it reacts
on the HUD, the interface of the game,
is sort of leading you to the next thing.

[1:30:31]
And once you get that
flow down and the rate
at which the game is
giving you activities,
then you're in like what
we describe as a game flow,
and it's not until
really that last year...

[1:30:46]
Before that, the game
flow was just, it's not,
it doesn't even exist
in the way that you see
it in the final game.
And that's what we're working
on a lot that last year.
- So at which point is
like the set of skills

[1:31:00]
of skill tree, the characteristics
of the roleplaying aspect
of it, when is that set?
The ideas?
- We usually have it in the
beginning, but it's just,
we know it won't be done
until that last year.
We'll have one, but we
know it's gonna get honed,
because it's not until
you really see, okay,

[1:31:19]
how impactful is that one?
How much are you doing it?
Like how much are you really...
And the main combat ones, they always win.
You always know the players will drift
toward the combat type skills.
'Cause every character
needs some amount of that.

[1:31:31]
But okay, well, how important is cooking?
How important is alchemy?
How important is these
other type of activities?
And then how do you balance
them where when you load
up the skill menu,
it isn't automatically
give me plus 10 damage.

[1:31:47]
- How do you get the, what
about the combat system?
That does seem to be an
important part of a lot of games.
- Start in the beginning every time. Yep.
So usually when we're
making that first playable,
it's an area you can go through,
some amount of dialogue,

[1:32:02]
some amount of combat.
- How do you get the combat right?
What's the secret to
a great combat system?
- Well, first, on a control side,
helping the player when
they don't realize it.

[1:32:15]
There's a lot of tricks
you can do with magnetism
in terms of the controller
and where the attacks go.
So it has to feel,
the minute to minute has to
feel really good in your hand.
So there's a lot of animation time, right?
And changing animation,
so they're impactful
and they happen at a rate
that the player feels

[1:32:33]
like they're really doing it.
And then ultimately it's the
illusion that the enemies
are smart, but they really
are there for you to kill 'em.

[1:32:45]
Right?
So they do a lot of things to just let
themselves get killed.
They're not near as smart,
near as smart as we can make them.
'Cause it turns out that is not fun.
- Right?
So there's a balance between,
but there's a, that is,

[1:33:01]
I guess, a kind of AI, and it's a very
intimate interaction with
an AI, 'cause it's like
there's a lot of stuff going on.
It's not just very kind of shallow,
like a dialogue or something like that.

[1:33:15]
It's like there's a time
critical nature of it,
a lot of stuff is
happening and if anything
feels off, it's gonna feel wrong.
- Yep. All the games do it.
It's not unique to what we do in terms
of how they handle combat scenarios.

[1:33:32]
And there's some games that
just do it extremely well
in terms of, even in multiplayer,
where you're playing bots and
most people don't know it,
or how a multiple enemy
scenario is really...

[1:33:47]
They don't all shoot you. They trade off.
They're gonna wait.
And one's like, right,
I'll just wait my turn 'cause
we don't wanna overwhelm 'em.
But it feels, like you feel
like you're overwhelmed
when there's six enemies,
but a good game will, no,

[1:34:00]
they're gonna take their time.
- Is there a science to it? Is it art?
Is it... Like how do...
- Yes, yes. I mean it's all of that.
- So it's like an iterative process
where you try different things,
you had different ideas?
- Yeah, there's a lot of-
- Animation.

[1:34:17]
- There's a lot of timing,
animation work, HUD work also,
how does the reticule change?
What are the little sound effects?
- What about like the
gamify, like that is fun?

[1:34:30]
- That goes back to the winning, you know.
- So winning is fun?
- Yes.
- Death is not?
- Yes, let the wookiee win.
- I like how you have to
dumb down the AI to make
it fun for humans.
Because if you didn't,

[1:34:45]
it would just be just slaughter
nonstop for all humans.
That's good to know.
What about things like, you
said cooking, like crafting,
making potions and poisons and smithing,

[1:35:03]
weapons and armor, cooking...
How do you get that right?
What's interesting there?
It's such an interesting, like,
a lot of games don't
have that kind of thing.
So what role does that play in-

[1:35:16]
- I think we really
cracked it in a way I like
with Fallout 4 actually,
where when you're doing
Elder Scrolls, we have like
the flowers and things
and you have alchemy.
And we took this to, okay,
if it's post-apocalyptic,

[1:35:31]
what if everything in the world was
an alchemical ingredient of some kind.
So breaking it down to their components.
So when you walk around a
world, like that, again,
we like the simulation,
we like the forks and the spoons
and the cups and all that.
Okay, how can I use those to create?

[1:35:46]
So I love how it works, starts
working in Fallout 4 where,
okay, all these things I find,
they have some value in
creating or crafting outside
of a cup is worth one
gold piece or one cap.

[1:36:04]
- By the way, I have to be honest,
I haven't played Fallout
4, I played Fallout 3.
I thought that was a legendary game.
Can you make a case with
Fallout 4 and I should,
or should I just wait till Fallout 5?

[1:36:16]
And when does that come?
- I think you should play Fallout 4.
Love to hear your thoughts.
- All right.
- It's a different game.
- Skyrim is too, I mean it's...
- We try to make them all
different. They all have...
- They are fundamentally different.
- They all have their own tone.
Yeah.
So Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 intentionally
a very different tone.
- Oh, really? Interesting.
- Yeah.

[1:36:31]
- So what's that world like?
What's the post apocalyptic
world of Fallout?
If you can just briefly take a stroll
into that world, tone-wise.
- Well there's look, in entertainment,
there's a lot of post-apocalyptic stuff,

[1:36:45]
and what makes Fallout
tick is the world that was
left behind, the world
that blew itself up,
this utopian world of nuclear
energy and it all goes wrong.
So I love the American dream of that,

[1:37:00]
like how they visioned
the future in the '50s
and that blowing itself up.
I think that's like a super
interesting place to explore,
which is why we always
wanted to play in that world.
And it does an amazing
job of sort of weaving

[1:37:17]
the drama and darkness of
a post-apocalyptic world
with B-movie humor.
It winks at the camera
sometimes, often actually.

[1:37:30]
And that when you're in that world,
it just has this, its
own unique flow and vibe,
outside of anything else
kind of in that genre.

[1:37:45]
- So the Elder Scrolls has,
or at least Skyrim has some humor.
- [Todd] Has a little bit.
- But Fallout leans into it a little more.
- A little bit more. A
little bit more, yeah.
Yeah it does. It's like ironic humor.
It's the duck and cover,
to get under your desk if the bomb comes
and everything will be fine.

[1:38:01]
It's that type of humor.
- So the funny thing is,
I do think Fallout 3 is one
of the greatest games ever.
You've said that quote,
when we started Fallout 3
in 2004, we obviously had
big ideas of what we could
do with it and I talked

[1:38:16]
to a lot of people from
ex developers to press
folks to fans.
What made it special?
What are the key things
you'd want out in a new one?
The opinions, and I'll put
the mildly, varied a lot,

[1:38:30]
but they would all end the same,
like a stern father pausing for effect,
but do not screw it up.
How do you not screw up a game?
You have not screwed up many games, yet.

[1:38:45]
- I mean back to the Fallout one.
- [Lex] Yeah.
- Yeah that was, look,
that, I remember that,
we were met with a lot of
skepticism in terms of, oh,
what are they gonna do with this?
It was a beloved kind of
isometric turn based role
playing game, you know?

[1:39:00]
Awesome for when it came out.
And actually it was announced,
we had finished Morrowind
but not announced Oblivion.
But because we'd acquired the rights,
we had to announce it.
'Cause I think Interplay
was the public company.
I don't remember.

[1:39:15]
I just remember we had to announce
it and we're thinking
there, well, you're gonna,
we're gonna piss off all the
Elder Scrolls fans 'cause
we're announcing a Fallout game.
We're probably gonna piss
off the hardcore Fallout fans
'cause we didn't make
the original and clearly
we'll probably make a
different kind of game.

[1:39:30]
So I do remember there was
a lot of concern with all
of our fans and fans
of Fallout at the time.
And so I think it was
pretty rewarding for us
that that game found the
audience and success that it did,

[1:39:50]
is one of my favorite
projects that I've ever,
ever worked on.
And because it was so fresh
for us and we had a very clear,
like even before we had the rights,

[1:40:00]
like, this is the game we're gonna make,
this is the kind of thing we're gonna do.
And we had done Morrowind, we were working
on Oblivion, and it was kind
of a breath of fresh air
to do it.
And what's kind of
remarkable is Fallout 3 comes

[1:40:16]
out just two and a half years
after Oblivion and we did
all this DLC for Oblivion.
So we were really,
really kind of prolific
in how our development,
how it was going.
So...

[1:40:31]
I just remember enjoying
making that game so much
'cause it was everything
we were doing was new.
- Which, as to the world creation,
was there some innovation like technically
that was happening to you?
- The world creation.
Like it was obviously a different look,

[1:40:46]
even though some of us,
very few of us had worked
on the Terminator things.
The VATS system, the skill system...
And we loved the original game so much,
so you felt this
responsibility to bring it back
in a big way and reintroduce
it in a way that,

[1:41:03]
as much as we could,
scratch the same itch
when you play the original
game that had the same tone.
- Are there some favorite things
to you about that world that
just kind of connect you?

[1:41:16]
- Fallout 3, I love, again,
I usually start with the beginning.
I love the beginning, I love
the character generation.
If you go, if you played it a
lot or you're developing it,
it starts to feel really long,
but the first time you play it or second,

[1:41:31]
I just think it's awesome.
And this idea, it's a
hard thing to say, okay,
we want you to feel like
your character on the screen.
Even when you play like
a Skyrim, you don't know
what you were doing before that.

[1:41:46]
But Fallout 3, you were born
in the Vault and you raised
in the Vault and you lived
in the Vault, but you
experience a part of that.
So it's a very different,
when you step out it,
I think it really, I mean
the visuals are the visuals,

[1:42:02]
but the emotional moment of stepping
out of the Vault, you feel
like you lived your whole
life in the Vault.
- That, and you feel like you
have a sense of your past.
- Right? And I need to find my father.

[1:42:16]
- We should, isn't it
possible to have that sense
with like the Elder
Scrolls, like a life story,
like childhood trauma and stuff,
back to the human condition.
- I mean you'd have to, like look,
you do some of that stuff,
but they go through menus,

[1:42:31]
pick your background...
We're doing that in Starfield.
Hey, pick your background.
What you doing before this moment?
- Can you pick your traumas and stuff?
(both laughing)
That's a mod.
- [Todd] If you wanna make
a mod, yeah, you go for it.
- That and then also make
a mod for like a therapist.
- But a lot of, you know, is in your head.

[1:42:46]
So you're gonna do that, you're
gonna pick this background,
you do these things and
you're sort of like,
this is who I was.
And we intentionally with Elder
Scrolls kind of make it a,
as much of a blank slate.
Elder Scrolls is a little
bit more of a blank slate
game to who you are,
which has a lot of positives
and Fallout for us has

[1:43:01]
been more of a, this was your life before,
here's who you were,
go be who you wanna be,
but this is the background,
it's a little more strict.
- Now, this might reveal
something about me,
and speaking of childhood trauma,

[1:43:18]
but I feel like there's
a lot of the meaningful
experience of a role playing game is not
just the development of the
character throughout the game,

[1:43:30]
but the initial character
creation, like you said.
Is there something to that
process that you found
to be powerful, like the
design of that process?
Because you think so much
about that beginning.
What, how much should be controlled,

[1:43:46]
how much should be defined?
The interface itself,
the visual appearance
of the character too.
'Cause I feel like that you're loading in,
you start to load in the world
that you're about to enter by creating
that character, right?

[1:44:02]
- Yeah, we think about it a lot.
It's a really, really
good comment and question.
And it's more than...
It has to set the whole stage,
has to like pique your
interest for the world
you're gonna enter.

[1:44:16]
And we've done it so many
different ways in terms
of when you actually go
to make your character,
when you're making the choice.

[1:44:30]
And one of the things over
time that we've wanted
to avoid is people starting over.
So there's a lot of
intentionality around the types
of choices you have that
can be undone or not undone.

[1:44:48]
'Cause what you, what
game players want to is,
I'll play it, oh, then
I'll make a new character.
But sometimes they do
that because they realize
they made the wrong type of character.
And as a designer you
don't want that to happen.

[1:45:03]
So some people, and you get this common
in Elder Scrolls like,
oh, you simplified it.
No, no, no, no.
We moved those choices into the gameplay,
so that you don't make this
character in the beginning

[1:45:17]
and then eight hours
later realize you make
a horrible mistake.
And so, okay, I'm gonna start over,
like that to me is a really,
really bad experience.
So...
- Also like life itself.
But yes, go ahead.

[1:45:30]
- (laughs) But like life
is, okay, so you can then...
- [Lex] Fix it in game.
- Right? I wish I had learned archery.
Well, I'm gonna start
tomorrow. So you can do that.
Like the Skyrim character
system, you know,
is really designed around that.

[1:45:46]
All you pick is like, what's your race?
And that gives you some things,
but there's nothing you
can't get then on your own.
It mostly, it sounds weird,
but you mostly want that
beginning character generation
to be visual, which you then
can also change in the game,

[1:46:03]
and some starting skills
that get you off to the type
of play that you want.
But if you discover you
don't like that type of play,
as you play, you can move
your character along.

[1:46:16]
So we have moved away, post Oblivion,
to a classless,
meaning you don't have a strict
character class, warrior,
mage, thief, whatever in our games.

[1:46:30]
- And that's continuing for the...
Do you, are you like thinking
of Elder Scrolls VI,
you're already thinking
about that kind of stuff?
- [Todd] Yep.
- So you think of early on, like you said,
the first few experiences in the game,
you're already thinking through them.

[1:46:45]
- Yep.
Yeah, we know what the
first few hours are like,
we know what the character
system is basically like.
And...
- So tonally, what's the difference
to you between Oblivion,
Skyrim, Morrowind,

[1:47:01]
and Oblivion, Skyrim and Elder Scrolls VI?
Like to me, I mean stuff blends together.
But Oblivion, that's when you
could make spells and stuff.
- You could do it in Morrowind as well.

[1:47:16]
Oblivion has some more guardrails on it.
Morrowind's where you can
really go. And Daggerfall.
I don't remember if you can make spells
in Arena, I think you can,
someone will correct me.
You definitely can in
Daggerfall, gets crazy,
Morrowind, you can
some, and then we start,

[1:47:32]
we started putting guardrails
on it 'cause people
started breaking the game in certain ways.
- Yeah. Why is it bad to break the game?
Like you always want it to be-
- Well there's like one people love
in Morrowind where you could
make these recall stones

[1:47:47]
and you could teleport to different areas,
which you really need in that game.
It breaks so many quests.
- [Lex] Yeah.
- And so as we, any quest we would then,
we would do this exercise
of designing a quest,

[1:48:01]
and then someone would say,
and then I recall away,
oh okay, the quest is broken.
It's like, and then one day someone says,
can we just get rid of that spell effect?
Everyone's like, yes, please.
And so it allowed us
to make better content.
- So a tangent upon a
tangent upon a tangent,

[1:48:17]
how do you create a compelling quest?
Because there's all kinds
of personalities of humans
that play these games, right?
'Cause I like the grind.
- Well there's, look,
there's multiple flavors
of a compelling quest.

[1:48:32]
Some of them have very
good upfront storytelling.
You just like the story
and the NPC that's giving
you this task, and
you'll go through a more
handcrafted experience that
the designers have done

[1:48:47]
a really, really good job on the space,
it has some twist or
surprise in the middle,
and then the ending has
some multiple options
that the player feels like

[1:49:00]
they gotta do something, they
made an interesting choice.
But the best ones for
me are actually were all
of that was far more open ended.
The how I am going to accomplish this task
is completely up to me
and I'm gonna find some

[1:49:19]
ingenious solution, a
silly, this will like,
this sounds very basic,
it's gonna sound quite
cliche and silly, it's like,
go find me five daedra hearts or whatever,

[1:49:30]
like find me X of something
that's hard to get.
That's a very simple set...
You can give a simple
story set up for that.
And we're not telling the
player where to get those.
And they think, now,
where could I get those?
And I actually find those
to be just as rewarding

[1:49:48]
as the really handcrafted, well done,
little bit more linear
with an interesting choice
at the end, if those
objects are in the world
in some believable way,

[1:50:00]
that there's usually some
challenge at getting them.
- How do you place objects in a world
in an interesting way?
'Cause it's a big part...
- We have a level design... You cannot...
People, oh, if they only
knew how much we spend on,

[1:50:16]
we have a clutter group, a
group of people who clutter,
like we, like...
- What's clutter?
- Clutter is all the stuff around,
it's like interior decorators
for treasure and stuff
and trash and...
They go through every
space and they clutter it.

[1:50:32]
Our level designers think about it a lot.
These also become
landmarks for the player,
when you're walking through a space and oh
this is the place with this.
And there is a logic to making
a good level, as they say,

[1:50:47]
with, even if you walk by
like a little T intersection,
that becomes like a decision
point in the player's head.
Like, oh, I didn't go down that way.
But the more you do that,
it looks easy on paper.
But when you're playing a game,
you actually kinda wanna limit

[1:51:00]
those because he's trying
to keep track of all
these decision points.
Then they get lost.
And yes, we have maps,
but anytime the player's
going to check a map
in a place like that,
I feel that it's more of like a backstop
for certain players.

[1:51:15]
If they need to check the map,
I feel like we've kind of failed.
- Got it.
So it's just, there's a momentum
to it, just pulls them in.
- And you know, look, you
played a lot of games,
you played a lot of levels
where you're just like,
I'm a little confused or I
don't know, I don't play...

[1:51:31]
And you play other levels
where like, man, I just, yeah,
I, it was great, I went through
it, it was well balanced,
I knew where I was going and it's not,
you don't wanna ever be
maze-y, as long as you know
where you're going,
as long as you know
you made those choices,
then it feels fine.

[1:51:46]
But as far as the treasure
and all of the loot,
it is really an art.
We will not do enough
clutter and then we will
over clutter and then
there's too much stuff
everywhere and then we
declutter every single game.

[1:52:01]
I wish we got better at it. It
would save us a lot of time.
- But you're constantly going
by feel, like this is not,
this is too much, it's not enough.
- Right.
Because the other thing
is, look, it creates,
people wanna pick everything up.
They wanna click everything.

[1:52:16]
So if you have too many things
of importance in a room,
it's like, it actually makes
you feel a little tight
as a player.
You're like, well, I need,
I'm basically an idiot if I
don't pick all the stuff up.
You probably felt this way.
- [Lex] Yeah, yeah. For sure.

[1:52:30]
- And like the moment where you decide
that you're just like,
I've clicked so many things in this room,
I actually am gonna leave
that ammo canister there.
But you feel like a dope. You've
probably experienced this.
- Yes.
But also you have a joy from,

[1:52:45]
if there's not many items
and you found the one
and you got it, and you feel good.
I got it.
- And then it's finding like, oh,
I stuck my head in this
corner and I picked this lock
and I opened this locker and, oh,
there was this thing
I've been waiting for.
- Yeah. What about like
rarer and rarer items?

[1:53:01]
- That's an art, even more so of an art.
I will say we have a ways to go there,
in terms of finding the right
drop rate for special items,
we call 'em, your epic, rare, legendary...

[1:53:16]
You look at games,
like so many games do
it and there are ones
that you just play and love
'cause they have it down.
Destiny, Destiny 2 is great at it.
Diablo, a series I love, sort of famously,

[1:53:32]
Diablo III, which I think is great.
And they did an update,
it mostly just changed the
loot drops and it's like
this whole new experience.
And there's a really real art to it.
I think that we're still learning.
We're still learning a lot and have to,

[1:53:46]
we're trying to get better
at it 'cause it's one
of those things where it
drives you through the game.
It's fun to get the treasure and...
- Diablo and Skyrim have
this interesting quality
of being extremely popular,

[1:54:01]
and there's a lore around like rare items.
So it's a, it changes the
dynamic of like you could
afford to have really rare items.
- [Todd] Yes.
- And then somebody finds it
and that becomes like a thing.

[1:54:16]
I mean, as you release a game, there's a,
I mean a lot of people
play and they start sharing
stories and so on.
It's so interesting 'cause that's part
of the game experience
is the stories of others.
Right?
- For us, 100%.
Because we've been classically,
with most of our stuff,

[1:54:31]
single player, that that water
cooler shared experience,
we would have a thing,
like where we call 'em
did you know moments?
Like we gotta have a bunch.
So you meet someone, they
do, what are you doing?
And then they say, did you know,

[1:54:45]
if you go here and do this, what?
Did you know?
And that to us is aware of
a lot of our community has
been sharing their stories
and here's what you can do.
- Has there ever been a
temptation to create not

[1:55:03]
a single player game that's gigantic?
That's...
- Well, we did Fallout 76.
We have Elder Scrolls Online.
Not game I created, but, look,
that started as more classic MMO.
Know the folks, they're
part of our company who made

[1:55:16]
that game and it's
insanely, insanely popular.
- It is? Okay.
So I should try it all.
- They do some great storytelling quests.
Like the actual mechanics aren't the same
as Skyrim, but the world is awesome...
They've just done an incredible job.

[1:55:32]
It's about to be 10 years
for that game as well.
And they, it's just great
community around that.
- Yeah, that's, I haven't
played that 'cause
there's a mobile Fallout game.

[1:55:46]
Right? I need to play that.
I was thinking of playing
Diablo mobile too.
- I mean, you can debate the
monetization, but I would not,
it's, I think they did a
phenomenal, it's really fun.
- On Fallout? What's...
- On Diablo.
- Oh, Diablo?
- On the, yeah, well,
Fallout, I definitely recommend that one.

[1:56:00]
Fallout Shelter.
Completely different game.
Diablo Immortal is, I was
very, very impressed with that.
Had a lot of fun.
- On the mobile?
- Yep.
- What's the challenge of designing a game
for mobile versus the PC and console?
- Well, obviously the screen size. Right?

[1:56:15]
- Is that what you feel first?
What's the fundamental change
in the philosophy of design?
Does it constrain? Does it
change the tone of the game?
- Well, we've done a few
things and we have a new
mobile game that we're working

[1:56:30]
on that we haven't announced
yet that I'm in love with.
There are a couple things
that you approach on mobile.
Now, I can give you sort
of the classic mobile
gaming thing and then what we do.
A classic mobile gaming is
really for short play sessions.

[1:56:52]
'Cause for the amount of
people you're gonna get,
the number that have the
amount of time to sit
there for a long time and play it,

[1:57:01]
like a console game or a PC game is lower.
'Cause people are playing mobile games
on the move or whatever.
And how it onboards you...
'Cause obviously most of 'em are free.
So the tutorial, how the tutorial works,
how it gets you into the game,

[1:57:16]
because you haven't bought it,
you haven't done this investment of buying
it and then saying,
no, I'm gonna learn it.
People don't care.
So really understanding
how they get into the game.
Those two things are really
the magic to mobile gaming.
We have found though, with our games,
typically Fallout Shelter, people will sit

[1:57:32]
there for an hour or two.
Like they will just sit there and play it.
Like large numbers of people
who play it for hours a day.
- So it's a, there is
a more, I don't know,
addicting element to the mobile?
'Cause I guess you can spend more time...

[1:57:46]
- If you look at, if you
look at kids these days,
they can stare at their phone for hours.
That's all they do. That's
where they watch everything.
So it's also like a demographic thing.
The younger audience, they
would rather sit and stare
at their phone than
play it on a big screen.

[1:58:02]
- I would just love to sort of list
out throughout human history,
the evolution of
sentences that began with,
if you look at kids these days.
- (laughs) It's true. It's true.

[1:58:15]
- The kids of the kids
these days will probably be
talking about, be doing
like virtual reality.
- Like I love mobile games
though. I play a ton of 'em.
I am like the game,
my favorite game this year is
Marvel Snap, this card game

[1:58:30]
from the folks who did Hearthstone.
You should really play it, if you like,
do you like card games?
- Yeah.
- Do you like superheroes?
- No.
- [Todd] It's genius. You
don't like superheroes?
- No, I don't like superheroes.
I never understood, listen, this never,
this is growing up in the Soviet Union.

[1:58:47]
I don't understand the, this, all right,
well I don't understand,
you're wearing a costume...
It's silly to me.
I can't, so you have to suspend,
like you have to be
able to immerse yourself

[1:59:01]
and for some reason there's
something about costumes...
- Costumes?
- Yeah, it doesn't get me,
but then again I'm like
into elves and dragons,
so I don't understand, and I'm fine.
- I think I get it.
- Yeah.
But the rest, at least the America,
the western world disagrees with me.
So...

[1:59:16]
Even Batman, you have like
little ears, but that's fine.
They just, well, back
to Elder Scrolls and Starfield.
So one thing I didn't ask you about,
when you look at the
timeline of 5, 6, 7, 8 years,

[1:59:33]
whatever it is to create a game,
what's the role of the
deadline, internally?
Not publicly announced.
- Keeps you honest.
- Do you try to keep in
your own brain a deadline,
for the team a deadline?
- [Todd] Yeah. All the time.

[1:59:46]
- And when you set that deadline
early in that development,
do you try to set deadline,
like that's really tough to reach?
- No, we try to make it like,
hey, this is our best guess.
If you make it tough
to reach, it's sort of,

[2:00:00]
you're gonna miss it.
It's arbitrary.
We really try to keep ourselves honest,
'cause it will let you
know where you're at.
Right.
Wanna have first playable,
we wanna be done with prototyping
or design by this date.
We wanna have first playable
this date. We wanna have this.
But, look, things happen,
pandemic happens, people go home,

[2:00:16]
it throws everything off or, you know,
what you needed to do,
because we're not just
like making a game and then
moving everybody on,
what you needed to do,
like Skyrim was so popular,
we kept people on that game for longer.

[2:00:30]
So it delayed a little bit,
we were doing the Fallout 4
at the time 'cause we can't,
weren't, hey, we really
shouldn't move the people
onto Fallout yet 'cause
we're doing these things
in Skyrim and we should.
So it just sort of keeps you
honest for where you're at.
- Does it get super
stressful as you get closer?

[2:00:46]
Are you trying to avoid
announcing anything?
Is there a temptation to announce it?
- Well, I've done it always. Right?
I've announced Starfield,
we're pretty loud
with a release date that
we then had to delay.
So...

[2:01:00]
- Was that tough?
- It was. It was, but it
was the right thing to do.
And...
- How do you know it's
the right thing to do,
like when you sat down
and looked at it, like,
this is not ready?
- It's not an exact science,
but you can look at what needs to be done

[2:01:15]
and the amount of time you have,
and we've done it in the past
where we can get it done.
We believe we can.
And so you're fighting
that personal belief
that you can get something done.
But there's a lot of things
that go into release date

[2:01:30]
with marketing and publishing,
and we've reached a point where,
on Starfield, where it
was pretty clear to us,
even though you wanna
say you can get it done,
that the risk involved with
that, to the fans, to the game,

[2:01:47]
to the team, to the company,
we're part of Xbox now,
to everybody it was, we should really,
we should really move it and
give it the time it needs.
- So you mentioned part of Xbox.

[2:02:02]
Microsoft bought Bethesda
and ZeniMax for $7.5 billion.
(laughs) Well, what's it
like joining the Xbox team?
You've, I think, written about it.

[2:02:17]
What are the exciting aspects of that?
- You know, when your
company goes through a change
like that, no matter what it is,
even if it's somebody that you've worked
with for a long time, you
never know what you're in for.

[2:02:31]
You hope.
And I had worked with them for,
since we started doing
console stuff with Morrowind,
was they came to us, came to me and,
hey, you should make
this game for the Xbox.
And so when they were making that console,

[2:02:46]
had a great experience with them.
And then on the 360 with Oblivion.
And so I guess the point is,
we felt that we had a
very good relationship
with everybody there.
And we understood what their culture was.

[2:03:00]
But you never really know.
And I mean this honestly,
it's been awesome,
that the culture inside
of Microsoft and Xbox that
people see from the outside
is the culture inside.
The way they talk about players,
the way they'll invest in the players,

[2:03:17]
the risks they'll take,
the thoughtfulness from Phil
Spencer on down has been,
you know, feel really, really lucky.
And then a game like
Starfield where, look,
we've had a lot of success with the games

[2:03:31]
that you talked about.
But we've never been kind
of the platform seller.
You know, The Game for a
platform for a period of time?
And so there is a lot of pressure there.
There's a lot of responsibility
there to make sure

[2:03:45]
we deliver for everybody.
- Is there a chance that
Starfield is exclusive to Xbox?
- It is exclusive.
- It's officially already?
- Yep. Yes.
- So you're, (laughs) I get it.
So extra pressure also
creating a new world.

[2:04:03]
- Yeah, it's new, but keep in mind,
for us that exclusivity is not unique.
Even though we've done
PlayStation stuff and I think
the PlayStation 5 is
just an insane machine,
they've done a great job
and we've had great success

[2:04:15]
on PlayStation, we were
traditionally a PC developers
in the beginning.
We transitioned to Xbox,
became our lead platform.
Like Morrowind's basically
exclusive to Xbox, Oblivion
was exclusive to Xbox for
a long period of time...

[2:04:30]
Skyrim DLC was exclusive...
So we've done a lot of, like,
our initial stuff is all Xbox.
So we get into development
and saying we're focused
on Xbox, and it's not
abnormal for us in any way.
It's been kind of the norm.
And from a development side,
I like the ability to focus.

[2:04:48]
So our ability to focus and
say, and have help from them,
the top engineers at Xbox to say,
we are gonna make this
look incredible on the new
systems is like, from my standpoint,

[2:05:01]
it's just awesome.
- What's the difference
in creating the console
versus the PC?
I also have to admit, I've
never, is this shameful?
Actually, you should recommend to me,
I've never played Skyrim
or any of the games

[2:05:15]
you've created on Xbox.
- Really?
- Yeah, and on console.
I play, I managed to
play very little Xbox.
- Yeah, sure.
I mean, look, there's the
obvious interface part,
between mouse and keyboard
and then a controller.
But when you're looking at hardware, PCs,
it's tough, right?

[2:05:30]
Because you're looking at, well,
what are their driver versions?
What kind of monitor do they have?
What is the actual refresh
rate of X, Y, and Z?
We're used to it.
But anyone will tell you,

[2:05:45]
give me the hardware that
I know I'm writing it for,
you know this.
And the Series X is just
an incredible machine.
And now-
- And you know what it is, you know-
- You know what it is.
And now that we're part of
Xbox, getting the people

[2:06:01]
who built it to show you
how to make it really,
really dance is just awesome.
- Is there a case to be made...
Did you get people that enjoy,
people that do both PC and
Xbox, that enjoy Xbox more?

[2:06:16]
Like that if they have
a choice, they enjoy it?
- I think that depends on, and look,
now that you can kind of cross,
you can take your save and go
between and all those things...
- [Lex] You can?
- Yeah. It depends on if...

[2:06:32]
- For which games. So for Skyrim?
- If you have the Game Pass
PC version of it versus
Steam, not via Steam
right now, not via Steam.
- Got it. And so there's the Game Pass.
So I'm like learning about this.
So there's a Microsoft, so this can be

[2:06:46]
on Game Pass, and then you can...
Yeah. If you can take it
from PC through Game Pass...
- But I think it depends
on like, like, for me,
like what's my physical mood?
Do I wanna lean back on a sofa?
- Exactly.
- Right?
My actual physicality
of it is what determines

[2:07:03]
where I wanna play.
Do I wanna be two feet
from a thing right now?
And sometimes I like that.
I am more of a console
player just because I sit
on my PC at work all day.
Like, I play a lot of video games.

[2:07:17]
So when I get home and
I wanna play something,
I am a sofa, screen, controller person.
- Let me ask you a ridiculous question.
So you've created some of
the greatest games ever.
I think there's, the question
will be what's the best

[2:07:31]
game of all time?
All right. Just gimme a second.
- Tetris.
- Tetris? All right.
Yeah, that's interesting.
- Have you read the book on Tetris?
- No.
- You should read it.
Particularly someone
who grew up in Russia.
- Yeah, that's a, I'm sure
there's an interesting story.

[2:07:45]
The fact that there's a book
about Tetris is fascinating.
Is there a book about Mario?
I would love to find out more,
but I think, I would put,
personally I would put Skyrim.
- I'll take that. Good answer.
- At number one for me. Which
is tough, however you put it.

[2:08:04]
'Cause you could also make the case
out of the Elder Scrolls series,
like what do you actually value more?
If you put Tetris and
Super Mario up there,
then like the credit goes to
Morrowind maybe over Skyrim.

[2:08:16]
I don't know where the biggest leaps are,
but overall I think it's Skyrim.
Well, for you, if you're
not allowed to pick any
of the games you were involved with,
what are some interesting
candidates for you that are

[2:08:30]
just games that inspired the world,
impacted the world,
shook the world in terms
of what video games are
able to do?
- Well first, I'm just sort of like,
hearing you say that you
think Skyrim the best game

[2:08:45]
of all time is quite, like, thank you,
and it's an incredible thing to hear.
And when I think about, well,
I have a couple answers,
there's ones that are like personal to me.

[2:09:01]
Ultima VII is probably.
- Yeah. Can you talk about Ultima?
Like you said that as an inspiration.
I never crossed that world.
- [Todd] Well...
- What kind of game is it?
- It's a role playing
game, circa 1992, '93, '94.

[2:09:16]
And it Ultima Online first
really visual online world
in that way.
But for me, that was a virtual
fantasy world, where I had,
you could break bread, you
could pick all this stuff up.
I mean anyone who's played
Ultima and plays our stuff

[2:09:31]
can see the kind of
touchstones and callbacks
to that, or inspirations.
And the other thing that
I loved about Ultima was

[2:09:45]
they were all different, right?
That they iterated and
there weren't necessarily
what I'll call a plus one sequel outside
of Ultima VII Part Two.
Clearly a plus one sequel. But
they each had their own tone.
I love like the boxes,

[2:10:02]
it's something that we get into as well.
I love this idea that a game
also is this tangible thing.
- Oh, when you buy it...
- You bought the cardboard
boxes and the way
they were designed and Ultima VII is black
and Ultima VIII's the fiery gate

[2:10:16]
and the paintings on them...
And it just does...
- Does that break your heart a little bit?
That that culture is a bit gone?
- A little bit. A little bit.
And that's also why I like,
this goes to video gaming
or any other digital

[2:10:31]
things where digital ownership
has great value to people.
So I like looking at
my collections of games
even digitally, I wanna see nice,
in the same way you
wanna see nice album art,
wanna see nice cover art for our games.

[2:10:47]
And we spend a lot of time in them,
so that take a look
at Elder Scrolls and
Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim.
We want those boxes to look
good next to each other.
Going back to the video games,
I always mention Tetris
because I think it's...

[2:11:03]
Obviously I love virtual worlds
and those kind of things,
but for the time and what an
interactive like video games,
sort of the simplest form,
and sort of think you
can put Tetris in front

[2:11:15]
of just about anybody
and they'll enjoy it,
and it's got some moment of challenge
and it's just so elegant.
It's like, to me,
like this very pure game
that only works 'cause

[2:11:33]
it's a video game.
- And I think mobile
games figured out some
of the magic of Tetris.
The simple...
- [Todd] Some of them have. Yeah.
- And, but Tetris did it
a long, long time ago.

[2:11:46]
That you can really create
that immersive experience without.
- But for me, the Ultima, Civilization.
As far as a grand strategy game.

[2:12:00]
Pac-Man I mentioned in
terms of bringing games
into the mainstream in a
way that captured people
that nothing before it had.
Super Mario, Donkey Kong,
everything Nintendo,
are probably the best game
makers in the world still.
They know who they are. They
know what they wanna do.

[2:12:17]
Always in awe of what they create.
- I gotta ask about a
game I haven't played,
but people put up there
as one of the greats,
Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

[2:12:30]
Have you gotten a chance to play...
- A lot of it? Yes.
Yes. It's fantastic.
It's fantastic.
- What do you think about,
I mean it's a very different experience.
I've played other Zeldas,
than the open worlds you've created.
But it is also an open world.
- It is.
It's my favorite Zelda 'cause obviously

[2:12:45]
I like open world stuff and the one thing
that they do really,
really well is they don't constrain you.
Some people, you know,
even some of the things we do constrain
you a little bit more.
Zelda says, here's the whole thing,

[2:13:00]
and you are constrained by
the actual player abilities
you haven't earned yet, not
some arbitrary barriers.
And so I think they just
did a phenomenal job.
It's a magical game.

[2:13:15]
- It really feels open.
- It's, 'cause it truly is. Yes.
- What about, I mean, is it,
I just like asking you
about some open world,
a very different one is the world
of either Grand Theft Auto
or Red Dead Redemption?

[2:13:30]
- Both, love. I would put GTA III,
Grand Theft Auto III up there
with the landmark kind of usher
in the open world when that comes
out on the PlayStation 2,
even though there was GTA 1
and 2, this was an all new thing
with the mobster storytelling.

[2:13:47]
- First 3D version, I guess.
- It was.
Then Vice City's kind of a fast follow,
which could be my favorite one...
I loved all the Grand Theft Autos.
Think they're really
phenomenally well made games.

[2:14:01]
Same with Red Dead.
I think Red Dead Redemption
1 could be my favorite story.
Like, highly recommend
finishing that game.
- So you like both the story,

[2:14:15]
you like the grittiness of that?
'Cause they have a bit
of the, like, I guess,
if you like the Fallout,
there's the humor, the...
I don't know what it is.
It's the lighthearted humor of it,
but also the brutality of
human nature is in there too.

[2:14:31]
But it's like, and also
some of the fun they create
with the music when you
drive and stuff like that,
they create a world.
There's a tone.
- They do.
- There's a very strong tone.
The satire on the world
is just so well done.

[2:14:48]
The game plays great.
I think they've just
done a phenomenal job.
- Is there any others that pop to mind?
- Portal.
- Portal, yeah. That's
another weird creation.

[2:15:04]
- [Todd] I could just sit
here and list games forever.
- Well, I'm enjoying this.
- Hearthstone's a game I love.
I love all time, I like
sports, college football,
NCAA Football was my favorite.
It's like, I would say this
is a great role playing-

[2:15:15]
- Oh, you would actually
keep getting role... (laughs)
- It's a roleplaying game.
'Cause I have all these characters.
I have like 60 characters,
and they're all leveling
up and then I have to play
them and then the college ones
are like college football,
they'd graduate, so you
lose your players and then
they stop making this
series and I know the folks

[2:15:31]
at EA and they will
say, I have bugged them.
When is this? And they're doing it.
So it's finally coming back.
- Nice.
What would you say is the
greatest sports game of all time?
- Hmm...
Well it's NCAA Football,
you have to pick the year.

[2:15:47]
- NCAA, versus Madden?
- Oh yeah.
Yeah, but there's more teams,
you got the college fight songs.
There's more pageantry.
And the players turn over.
They're only there for four seasons.

[2:16:00]
So you have to, so you
know, it's the, there's,
it's more dynamic.
- So you like variety versus...
- So what was the last
one? 2014 maybe it was?
- And you don't like FIFA and...

[2:16:15]
- I like, look, FIFA's incredible.
I just, look, I'm a college football fan.
They give you that fantasy...
If you like European
football slash soccer,
FIFA's incredible.
Yeah, I love that game too.
- Have you been paying
attention to the game design
of that world?

[2:16:31]
Of those worlds?
- Yeah.
And the thing people I think
with those kind of games,
it is like, or racing
games, Forza, put up there,
I love Forza.
Played them all.
When you have to recreate
something that's real

[2:16:45]
in the real world, say it's
cars or it's sports games,
everybody knows how it should work.
That's a really difficult task.
When people know how it should work.
Then you're gonna balance
it for single player,
the multiplayer parts of it.
Very, very competitive.

[2:17:01]
And in many respects you're forced to put
out a new version every year.
And I say forced in
quotes 'cause, you know,
they count them as big updates.
But it's a very,
it's a much more difficult
development process
than I think people understand.

[2:17:19]
And how hard those teams work.
I know a lot of people who do
it and I think they just do.
I've enjoyed them all.
I buy Madden every year.
- Yeah. So yeah, every single year.

[2:17:30]
Yeah, they do refresh it.
There's a feeling of freshness.
I don't know what that is.
- Yeah, look, there have
been years where it feels
like less was done and more was done.
But I enjoy it every year.
- Yeah. Yeah.
What does a perfectly
productive day in the life
of Todd Howard look like?

[2:17:46]
So, maybe not perfectly,
but just like a perfectly
average productive,
are you a morning person, evening person?
Is it chaos? Is it pretty regular?
- I'm in a good, I'm in
a good flow right now.

[2:18:02]
I'm still doing a lot of stuff.
So there's things I'm
like executive producing
and then Starfield I'm directing.
So I sort of view that as
that's an every day thing.
Fortunately I get to
do a lot of stuff from,

[2:18:16]
look at the TV show we're making
and this Indiana Jones game that's being
developed at MachineGames.
So we have to look at that.
But the best really day or
where I feel it's fulfilling is,

[2:18:33]
get to play some of a game, the game,
we'll say Starfield, get
to play some of Starfield,
look at the problem set
of what it is doing,
and then get in a room
with the other developers

[2:18:46]
that I work closely with and we solve
that problem together.
So that's the most rewarding
thing when you can say, okay,
what do we want this to do?
What's the real player experience we want?
What are all the pieces in front of us?

[2:19:00]
Where you know the actual
tangible pieces as opposed to...
The beginning, the pie in
the sky part is always fun,
but it's like anything
is possible that's fun,
but it's not rewarding
in the same way 'cause
you haven't solved something.

[2:19:15]
Whereas these are the elements
you have to play with.
How do we make this all work together?
And you come out of it at
the end of the day, like,
now that feels great.
- So brainstorming about
specific big picture,

[2:19:30]
both big picture and very
specific detail of a game
that's not working?
Something's not working, you wanna fix it,
that kind of stuff?
- And you just, because
you feel like, okay,
you've made tangible
progress on the actual build
of the game, or something
you played in the beginning
of the day, didn't feel great,

[2:19:46]
you've figured out a solution
with a group of people.
Like it's always with a group.
And then the next day
you're like, yeah, that was,
that worked out.
- Who's on the team? Is
it designers, engineers...
- All of the above.
- Artists, voice over-

[2:20:01]
- So internal to the studio,
it's a lot of programming, a lot of art...
You have design, which breaks
into some quest design,
writing, systems design
who are like doing all
the treasure and the loot
and the skill systems.

[2:20:15]
And then level design is
making the spaces like
those that you'll play through.
Production is a big part of it.
The producers who organize everything.
I can't remember if I mentioned
art, a lot of artists.
QA staff as well.
They're hugely valuable in saying, hey,

[2:20:30]
we broke your game in these magical ways,
what are you gonna do about it?
- Is the design team still
hiring? How do I apply?
That seems like the most fun job.
- [Todd] (laughs) Always. Always.
- I mean at all of this
seems like a super fun job.
- It is.
You know what, it's the
best, then you have audio...

[2:20:46]
And it by far is the greatest job
you could possibly have.
So if you're into like
technology, it's great.
If you're into storytelling,
creativity and art, it's great.
And it's really the gaming,
the combination of that.

[2:21:01]
- And like I mentioned to you offline,
I think of video games is, I mean,
to me has brought thousands
of hours of happiness.
And so when you're designing the game,
whatever you're doing,
you have a part to play
in a thing that's going
to bring like millions,

[2:21:19]
hundreds of millions of
hours of happiness to people.
- And you know-
- It's crazy. Right?
- It is.
And I'm gonna play you
saying that back to our team.
'Cause, you know, people
forget, your head's down,

[2:21:30]
you're trying to solve
these problems and then
you do forget how many people it touches.
- Like even tiny decisions you make,
tiny little things you create...
Yeah, it's weird.
I wish there was a way to like,

[2:21:45]
I would notice things in a
video game and it's like,
huh, okay.
Like it feels good, but
you don't get that signal.
The creator doesn't get that
signal. I wish they did.
I guess you could get that signal by,

[2:22:00]
why is Lex stuck in this room?
Like digging through the loot...
- We do get,
we do now get a lot of good data
on what the players are doing.
- Enjoying and not, that kind of thing?
- Well, we know where they've been
and where they've died
and how long they play
in certain sections.
And we can sort of tell,

[2:22:15]
outside of people just telling
us on forums or calling
or other things, we can tell for some data
where people are dropping
off or having a...
We can tell if there's
a key frustration point.
- Do you ever think about
making people feel like

[2:22:33]
human feelings when they play?
Like designing, like make
them feel fear or excitement,
anger, longing, loneliness-
- All of the above.

[2:22:47]
Yeah, of course.
The big one, I like to say,
is that video games give you
is pride, outside of other...
If you watch movies or
things like that. Like, yeah.
But you never think like, look what I did.

[2:23:00]
- [Lex] Yes.
- And that feeling of like
accomplishment and pride
in what you did, where you overcame...
You talked about going
back to a game that like,
those are real feelings
of like accomplishment
that I've felt in games that I've played.

[2:23:18]
And when we get to see a player feel that,
it's really, really special.
The other one is there is a,

[2:23:30]
there is an escape or to be someone else
that's more powerful in what,
in our games that you aren't
in real life that gives
you a confidence or a perspective.
We're doing one next week,

[2:23:45]
we've done a number of Make a Wish visits,
kids who could wish for
anything and they wanna come,
and I wanna see the next
game and meet the creators
and see how you do it.
And they come with their family.
And it is like the
greatest thing that we do.

[2:24:02]
And it reminds you of
like how important it is.
And the other really awesome
thing is that you can
see like the family change
by the end of the day.
Like they don't, they didn't
even realize what it meant

[2:24:17]
to their child or what went into it.
And it's just, that to me is like,
been involved with that
foundation for a number
of years and it's been
really good reminder

[2:24:31]
of how lucky we are.
- And in general, for young people,
that sense of accomplishment
is hard to find.
- I mean-
- Yeah, they don't,
not everybody has it in the outlets
that real life provides.

[2:24:46]
- Well, that's the thing, I mean,
the world is cruel to
you when you're young.
Nobody takes you seriously.
You don't get, like, that's why you,
everybody always wants to
grow up and get all this
as fast as possible.
- It's hard. It's the hardest, it's hard.

[2:25:02]
- And then video games allow you...
I mean, to build that sense of confidence,
a sense of pride in something.
That's why when people
talk down to video games,
like it's a culture and so on.
It's not, it misses out on that really

[2:25:16]
deeply meaningful thing.
- [Todd] Agreed.
- Especially with like single player,
there's some darker aspects to multiplayer
that people create
communities and it can go off
the rails a bit, but the
actual experience of the game,

[2:25:30]
especially one you stick with for a while,
that's really beautiful.
Do you have advice for
those same young folks,
given that your life
is an interesting one,
given what kind of degree
you got and up being

[2:25:46]
a legendary game designer,
do you have advice for
young folks in high school,
maybe college, how to have
a career or a life they can
be proud of?
- Well you have to find
something that you love
so much that it's never
gonna feel like a job.

[2:26:05]
And don't do it for
money, don't do it for,
find something you love and
the rest of it will come.
It won't be a straight path.

[2:26:16]
And do not ever underestimate yourself.
It's gonna take hard work,
but the worst thing that
young people do is think
they can't accomplish something

[2:26:30]
or they underestimate themselves.
And maybe those first few times
through where they do fail,
if they love it enough,
they're gonna be resilient
and push past that.
Anyone who's had success or
gotten somewhere, it's been,

[2:26:47]
they've had those times, right?
And they've stayed
resilient because they love
it so much that this
is what they wanna do.
When you do it for other reasons,
I just don't think it's
gonna work out the same.

[2:27:01]
- Did you have low points in your life?
Dark points, where your
mind went to a dark place?
Whether it's struggling to get a job
at Bethesda Softworks

[2:27:15]
or maybe with Redguard flop or...
Where you kind of start to
doubt yourself or any of that?
- Well, I think, what's
weird looking back, I was so,
I was always so like in love with doing

[2:27:31]
this that I didn't view them
as like dark, per se.
Looking back, I was like, oh
that was, I just wanted to,
okay, let me find a way to make this work.

[2:27:45]
- Even when it's hard
and it's failing and all
that kind of stuff, you just kind of like,
it's a problem before you to solve?
- Yeah.
When I started Bethesda, I don't know,
my father had moved nearby to the office.
I was moving and I slept on
a sofa. Like I didn't care.

[2:28:02]
Like I don't need a bedroom, I'll just,
I'll sleep on the sofa and work there.
That's all I wanna do.
When the company almost
went outta business, it was,
well I hope it doesn't, I
feel somewhat responsible,

[2:28:16]
but hey, let's, okay,
that's a learning lesson.
Let's go. I think I was
pretty resilient to it all.
Fallout 76, like really
bad launch, and okay,
what did we do wrong?
What can we learn? Let's go edit.

[2:28:30]
Now it's a success.
But those kind of ups
and downs for the length
of developments that we have,
people don't see 'em but
we have 'em all the time.
And so it's that sort of
belief that with the team

[2:28:46]
having done it time and time
again to know that, nah,
we're gonna make it as
good as we possibly can,
and whatever we're experiencing now,
when we solve it and we
get it out and we see
the millions of people who
love it, it's all worth it.

[2:29:02]
- And you're getting into new spaces,
first of all new worlds with
Starfield, but also new...
I saw the TV show you're working on.
- [Todd] Yep.
- On Fallout with
Amazon. What's that like?

[2:29:16]
Worlds that you created in
the digital realm becoming,
going on the screen?
- Yeah, people asked...
I can remember 10 years ago
after Fallout 3 was a hit,
the movie producers coming and hey,

[2:29:30]
we think this will make a great movie.
And taking a lot of meetings.
And I think, mostly would jump at that.
Like, sweet!
And I sort of paused
and like, I don't know,
what is this gonna do?
I feel like they're gonna like synthesize,

[2:29:45]
and met great people,
like well known creatives.
Like it's gonna get synthesized
into this two hour...
I don't know, I'm not seeing
the great thing here yet.
So I think the advent
of television in terms

[2:30:02]
of what it's become nowadays
with big budget TV series,
it kind of came up again
and met with people
and Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy who do
Westworld and I always
love the work he did

[2:30:16]
writing "Interstellar" and "the Dark,"
like movies I just love.
- Like Jonathan Nolan's
involved with this?
- Yeah, he's the EP and
he's directed the first-
- That's incredible.
- Yep. Okay.
- This is awesome.
- And he's the EP,
he's directed the first few episodes...

[2:30:32]
- [Lex] Ah, nice.
- And when I connected
with him, Jonah was like,
hey, you're my, you're the
person I want to do this.
So, and I met with people
kept saying like, can I just,

[2:30:46]
let me see if he wants to do it.
And it was to my joy,
he was like, oh yeah,
Fallout 3 is one of my, yeah, sign me up.
It was like, no, how do we get this done?
And at that time he was sorta,
he was at HBO and it was, you know...
We were trying to figure out, it was,
put a little pause on it,
and got to visit the sets,

[2:31:06]
reading scripts and things like that.
It's all new to me,
but I, they're doing
such an incredible job.
Like, I think if you like this world,

[2:31:15]
you are gonna be just blown away.
So keep mind, I've never made a TV show.
Those are all the best.
No one ever does it
wanting it to not be great.
But they've just done,
their attention to detail
and they're just obsessive
with what's on the screen

[2:31:32]
and the storytelling and how it looks.
The whole thing.
- Yeah.
I think Obsession is really
a prerequisite for greatness.
What they did, HBO did
with Chernobyl, like

[2:31:45]
the attention to detail.
It's just incredible.
- And he's doing The Last
of Us now, that showrunner.
- If you really care
and you really put a lot
of effort into the details, you can-
- I was stunned. They, I mean...

[2:32:01]
I don't wanna spoil it,
but when people see it,
I think it'll just be like, wow.
It's the...
The other thing we're
approaching it, is very
different where when it
was people would say,
wanna make a movie?
They wanted to tell the
story of Fallout 3 or then
tell the story of Fallout 4, and eh...

[2:32:15]
And for this it was, hey,
let's do something that exists
in the world of Fallout.
It's not retelling a game story,
it's basically an area
of the map, and like,
let's tell a story here
that fits in the world

[2:32:30]
that we have built, doesn't
break any of the rules,
can reference things in the games,
but isn't a retelling
of the games that exists
in the same world but
is its own unique thing.
So it adds to it, while
also people who don't,

[2:32:45]
haven't played the games,
who can't experience like how crazy cool
Fallout is can watch the series and so...
- Are there some
similarities or interesting
differences between the
creation of a game and a TV
show that you noticed from
the sort of story perspective?

[2:33:03]
- Well, for them it's much
more character driven.
Like you can do all these
things with the world
and stuff that we already have.
It's the main characters, who they are,
what their motivations are,
that really is the engine.

[2:33:20]
- [Lex] Right. There's no...
- Finding the right
actors to do those. Yeah.
- 'Cause you're not,
there's no interaction.
There's no, you don't
get to enter that world.

[2:33:30]
They have to do the work for
you. The NPCs are on the show.
Yeah. I can't wait to
see how it turns out.
You also mentioned Indiana Jones.
That's a weird, that's a different one.
How do you work with, like,
with a famous protagonist?
Like when the character's known,
how do you work with that?

[2:33:50]
- Well, it's different. It's different...
Like Indiana Jones is different
where like the name...
It is the, like it's
Indiana Jones, not a world,
it's him, right?

[2:34:00]
You can talk about the world
of Indiana Jones, but
at the end of the day
it's about this character.
And "Raiders," still my
favorite movie of all time.
No debate. It's the best movie ever.
- Best movie ever?
- Ever. Love it.
- On a tangent, what do you love about it?

[2:34:18]
- Well, I saw it,
obviously when I was
younger and I believed it.
I believed this happened,
and when they found the Ark, I literally,
I could not believe that they found it.
So, and I have found over my life,

[2:34:32]
it's still really watchable every time.
I enjoy it every single time.
Love the character, love the story.
The opening is the greatest
movie opening ever.
And I just love everything,

[2:34:48]
I love everything about it.
- What was the opening?
Is this when the...
- What?
It's the temple and then
the ball rolls and tries
to crush him.
- Oh, that's the opening.
- That's the opening of "Raiders." Yeah.
He steals the...
- I think you're deeply authentic.

[2:35:01]
- Like what's the opening of "Raiders"?
So I've always wanted to,
it's one of those things like
what's on your bucket list?
Like, oh, I wanna make
an Indiana Jones game,
and I had pitched Lucas,
I had met some people
there and pitched them back in '09

[2:35:15]
this Indiana Jones game concept.
And they wanted to publish,
it's kind of the deal fell apart.
They wanted to publish it
and we were a publisher
and so we didn't do it.
And I didn't really
have the team to do it.
I just was gonna figure that
out after we agreed to a deal.

[2:35:32]
And well, we made Skyrim so it worked out,
and then fast forward 10
years plus and Lucas, now part
of Disney and they're doing
a lot more of licensing
and working with people
and so I knew some folks

[2:35:45]
there and said, oh,
I have this idea that I
pitched a long time ago.
And they loved it.
And again, the internal team that I had
not only didn't have the time,
they probably weren't as good a fit

[2:36:00]
as MachineGames, who's done
the Wolfenstein series,
who is the perfect fit for
this game with storytelling
and how they record it.
And they are, it's awesome.
They're just doing an
incredible job with that game.
It's, people are gonna be,

[2:36:15]
if you like Indiana Jones,
it is a definite love letter
to Indiana Jones and everything with it.
- Can you say if it's a,
if it's more on the action
adventure like side,
like the actual experience of the game?

[2:36:30]
- I could go back. I would
just say it is a mashup.
It is a unique, it isn't
one thing, intentionally.
So it does a lot of different things
that we've, myself, and Eric,
and the folks at MachineGames

[2:36:46]
have wanted to do in a game.
So it's a unique thing.
- Before I forget,
who do I, how many
humans do I have to kill,
I mean dragons do I have
to kill to get myself

[2:37:01]
somehow into Elder Scrolls VI?
It's a mod, if anyone wants
to create mods of me...
And is that possible?
- Yeah.
- It's possible?
- [Todd] Of course.
- While maintaining realism somehow.
'Cause you don't want a
person in a suit and tie,

[2:37:18]
doesn't make sense.
- We could put you in
Fallout. You can wear that.
- Yeah, please, put me, so Fallout is,
there's also culture of...
- You do a mod where you
replace the Mysterious Stranger.

[2:37:31]
- There you go. That's a to-do task.
- Top mod right there.
- And you will have my
deep gratitude and more,
dear stranger, for doing so.
What's the programming language
for mods? Is it mostly...

[2:37:45]
- They use our internal scripting language
that's built into the tool.
- Okay. I'm almost afraid
to explore that world.
'Cause you'll never,
never never turn back.
How long, you've created
so many incredible games...

[2:38:02]
Is there, what does the future hold?
Do you, is there, so sort of
going through this process,
do you still have the energy,
the passion, the drive,
to keep creating?
- I cannot imagine doing anything else.

[2:38:17]
I'd like to do it as long as possible.
I will say though, as I've done it...
Soon it'll be 30 years
at Bethesda, I've learned
that to appreciate the
developments a little bit more,

[2:38:34]
that the time it takes,
I should prioritize all of us enjoying
the development process
more than I did in the past.

[2:38:45]
Was like, just wanted it to
end, that's all that mattered.
And the more you do it, you realize, no,
I'm spending the majority of my life
in Tamriel and the Wasteland of Fallout.
So the moments that we're
all doing this together,

[2:39:02]
we need to enjoy it.
Like it's a lot of work
finishing Starfield, but, hey,
we gotta enjoy this.
This is like incredible. We
don't get that many shots.
So...
- So the actual process of creating,
the struggles along the
way of stuff not working,

[2:39:16]
like you said, at this
point with Starfield
probably creating some of
the glue of how stuff feels
and going back again and
again and again to try to make
the beginning better,
all that kind of stuff?
- And I would say it
for anybody's vocation,
whatever you're doing, whatever people do,

[2:39:31]
you're gonna have harder times.
And sometimes people, it's,
you have to maybe recalibrate
yourself to like, okay,
how can we make this more
enjoyable for all of us
no matter what you're
doing, and rewarding?

[2:39:46]
- So if life is a video
game, which most likely is,
what do you think is the meaning of life?
From having created so many
games or the character has
to try to figure out?
I mean, there's bigger questions

[2:40:00]
than just solving the quest.
You're asking the big
questions of why am I here?
I feel like that's good
practice for answering
the same question for
this video game we're in.
What do you think is the
meaning of life, Todd Howard?

[2:40:16]
- That was a very...
I can say what motivates me.
- That's a good start.

[2:40:31]
- Having a curiosity,
the ability to not assume
a lot and be curious
about the world around you.
It's more, it's not the
same as just wanting

[2:40:48]
to learn everything, but
what makes other humans tick?
How do they feel? How do they love?
It might be cliche to
say the meaning of life
is to love, right?

[2:41:01]
- So that curiosity is just,
is about noticing the world?
- Noticing the world around you.
I mean, look, there's so much
to an anecdote someone says,
everybody has two lives
and the second one starts

[2:41:16]
when you realize there's only one.
And I think, I usually
preach to my children
and everything else, like,
have a curiosity to the world around
you and you'll have the
most fulfilling days.
- Are you able to be inside the worlds

[2:41:31]
that you've created and
be able to notice them,
like really enjoy them?
- It takes time. So like Skyrim
had its 10th anniversary.
It's when I went back into it.
I think I got to see it for what it is.

[2:41:45]
My younger son got really
into it a few years back
on the Switch.
That's what we notice.
People age up into it, right?
So one of the reasons it's
so popular is as people
come into, they're now becoming
teenagers and oh, okay,

[2:42:01]
I'll finally play Skyrim.
And he got obsessed with it. Not...
And he wasn't usually, I'd say, "Hey,
check out my games," and
like, "Ah, shut up, Dad."
We don't, we're playing this other stuff.
And he got like obsessed
with Skyrim, like,

[2:42:15]
we're having like deep Elder
Scrolls lore conversations
at dinner, and I saw it through his eyes
and that was pretty special.
And then the mods he was downloading
and the YouTubers he was
following, talking about stuff.
So the people who,

[2:42:30]
like the Elder Scrolls
people don't realize how much
of that I have watched with my son.
And then when the 10th
Anniversary came out, like,
oh, I'm gonna check out a build,
I have to check out the build out.
But I hadn't played it in so
long and it was like, it does,

[2:42:46]
it has this flow where like,
oh my God, I just played for four hours.
I need to turn it off. (laughs)
- Yeah, I mean there's something about
enjoying games with
the people you love too
or the water cooler
discussion, and with kids...

[2:43:02]
So I actually, I would love to have kids
and hopefully soon in the future.
So I guess the thing I need
your advice on is how do
I time it in such a way when
they're old enough right
at the age they're old enough...

[2:43:16]
Like I wanna know when to have them
so that when they're old
enough that's exactly
when Elder Scrolls VI comes out.
So I want to, can you gimme
hint, when I should have kids?
All right. Never mind.
- You're a genius at how
to ask that question.

[2:43:30]
- The number of times. Yeah.
You told the anecdote that your son asked
you the same question.
But of course it's all for good fun.
Take as much time as is needed.
It's, Skyrim is still an incredible game.
It has an impact on millions of people,

[2:43:45]
as do all of your games.
It's, thank you for everything
you've done for the world.
- [Todd] Thank you.
- It's a huge honor that
you would talk with me.
- This has been an honor,
and it has to be said.
Look, I have a huge team
of people I've worked
with for, some of them for 20 years

[2:44:03]
and it's really all of us together.
- Keep doing a great job, guys and gals.
I can't wait to see what you create next.
It really, really does have
an impact on silly kids

[2:44:16]
like me, and millions
of silly kids like me.
So I really appreciate everything.
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Todd.
