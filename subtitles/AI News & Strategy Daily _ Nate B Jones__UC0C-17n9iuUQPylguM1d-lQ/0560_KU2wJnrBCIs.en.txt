Let me give you another one. How do you
recognize intuitively when AI is
confident and incorrect? That's an
extremely high value skill. It is also a
very fuzzy skill. You have to know
enough about your domain. You have to
know enough about how AI speaks and the
utterances it uses. You have to know
enough about the relationship between AI
language and AI truth claims that you
can read a particular statement and say,
"I've seen several hundred or several
thousand AI statements before. This one
feels more like a false category AI
statement because it doesn't quite ring
true for my domain and because I've
noticed that when AI is hallucinating in
this model in this chat, it feels more
confident because it's actually
doubtful, Right.
