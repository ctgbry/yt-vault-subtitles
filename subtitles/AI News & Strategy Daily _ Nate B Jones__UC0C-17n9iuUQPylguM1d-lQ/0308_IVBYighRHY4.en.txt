On the other hand, for tasks that had
very straightforward structure, like,
hey, do a JSON extraction, Grock did
okay, Grock can sort of do tasks that
are narrowly constrained, and that's
something I found anecdotally working
with Grock for as well. I asked Grock
for to do some writing for me outside
the test environment, and what I found
was the writing is not very creative.
It's like the temperature's been turned
down on the model, but it's very fast.
The output is very consistent, and it
has a reasonably high token output. It
probably has a higher token output in
real world settings than claude. I think
the thing that bothers me is that if
you're going to call something the
number one model, you should have the
flexibility to do more than just these
narrowly defined tasks, more than just
JSON extraction.
