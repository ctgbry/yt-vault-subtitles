We're asking the AI to come back with
more in-depth analysis that it really
wasn't possible to do before. And so
instead of thinking of AI as a text
output generator, which so many teams
do, we're asking AI to think more
multimodally. We're asking AI to take
advantage of the maths and the code that
it's able to do and actually put that at
the service of our teams, even if we're
not in engineering. And that's why
training teams to think in artifacts
really helps.
