browsers have been evolving for 25 30
years. What does it look like to take
the next step in that process and what
is the direction the trajectory that is
changing? And I find that super
fascinating because I think we are at an
inflection moment. Um,
you know, when I think about the early
web, you know, a lot of the focus back
then was just, you know, helping people
understand those those links uh that are
out there and clicking on links and
going from place to place. we could go
and find like collections of links that
people had an opinion about if they were
good or not. As the web scaled that
stopped working and then you got search
and then search was transformative
because it helped you find like the
little piece of information or the
website that you wanted to go to. People
started building these rich apps and
then as you point out yeah inflection
point now we're in this new stage. We
like made the way in which we can
interact with this technology just
radically more human and we can scale up
the capabilities of the platform and the
platform will be able to do things on
your behalf. I think this is really the
third phase uh of the web.
