This is me zero. It's focused
specifically on how you can help AI
agents to remember customer success use
cases. And so this is a travel example,
but you can imagine this for a lot of
other examples, too. If you have
generative AI applications that you're
focused on, this becomes a really
powerful way to connect with your
customers. So, I don't pick these
because they paid me or anything. They
don't know they're being talked about.
I'm mentioning them because I think that
they do a good job talking about a
particular painoint and I think that
they are enabling us to talk about how
you choose tools. Well, I don't care if
you choose these tools or not. I want
you to understand how to pick tools that
work for you. If you'd like to dig in
further and understand how I think about
tools, I have the same set of questions
that I just outlined around sustainment,
around picking tools well, around
finding the pain point, around worst
case scenario planning. And I have that
for like 45 tools because I think that
we need to have honest conversations
about this and we have to start
somewhere and we have to start with
harder questions than we're asking. So

[01:00]
harder questions than we're asking. So
this is the no tools tool episode. It's
it's I want you to buy us to not buying
the tool unless it says yes to these
questions because I think too often
we're too easy like we open the wallet
too quickly. We need to be sort of
hard-nosed about what tools really
matter. So there you go. That's my take.
That's how you build a no tools tool
culture and pick AI tools that actually
matter.
