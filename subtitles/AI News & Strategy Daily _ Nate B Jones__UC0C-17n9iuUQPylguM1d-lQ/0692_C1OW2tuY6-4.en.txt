Anti-gravity goes with Gemini 3. It is a
fork of VS Code for developers where AI
agents have full execution privileges.
They can read and edit files. They can
run on your terminal. They can install
dependencies. You control the level of
autonomy they have. They can record
artifacts, plans, diffs, decisions as
they go. So you can monitor and control
what they're doing. Basically,
anti-gravity turns VS Code into a place
where agents do work. Now, this matters
because Google is trying to own the
developer environment, not just the
model. So, if anti-gravity becomes the
place where more developers write code,
Google doesn't just win model usage
here, they win the entire developer life
cycle. And so, the competitive game
shifts from whose model has the highest
eval score to whose environment is the
default place where work gets done and
where agents do real work. Google is
betting that the Aentic IDE is going to
become the AI operating systems shell.
And so we will see how this plays out.
There are obviously other players in the
mix. Cursor is a big one, but Google has

mix. Cursor is a big one, but Google has
put their stake in the ground and said
they're not just a modelmaker at this
point. They want to own the development
environment as well. So anti-gravity
could become the central surface where
agentic workflows run and the place
where ultimately you shape the code that
drives the compute experience.
