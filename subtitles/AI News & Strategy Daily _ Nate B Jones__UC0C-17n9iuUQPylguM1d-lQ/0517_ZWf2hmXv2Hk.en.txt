Imagine a world where there were five
different iPhones. And that matters
because part of what made the App Store
successful was that it was the only game
in town. That's not true for Open AAI.
It is not the only game in town. Now, I
will say anyone at OpenAI is going to
come back with a very reasonable
response. Nobody else has 800 million
users. Well, true, but Google has, I
don't know, 400 and change with Gemini
and growing fast. And Anthropic arguably
has the super premium segment that
iPhone traditionally represented because
people are choosing to lean in and pay
for it, which is part of what Anthropic
was leaning into in their marketing this
week. Put on your thinking caps. They
had popup cafes in New York and San
Francisco. People waited in line. They
got a thinking cap. And the clear
implication was if you're a thinking
person, you're picking anthropic, right?
So, I think the book has not yet been
written on where all of this is going to
end up. But developers and builders have
an unprecedented set of choices.
