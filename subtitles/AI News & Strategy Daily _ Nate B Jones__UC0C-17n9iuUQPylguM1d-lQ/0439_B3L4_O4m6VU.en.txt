I'm calling this the MACE framework.
MACE stands for modality, autonomy,
complexity, and environment. I think
those four things are all dimensions
that we need to assess agentic AI tools
on, and that we've really lacked the
language for assessing them on
previously. Let's dive into each of
these. Number one, what is the primary
modality of this tool? And there's at
least five different things you can look
at there. Text agents. Examples of that
would be Claude, Chat, GPT, Gemini. They
generate, they analyze text. Number two,
coding agents. Cursor, GitHub, Claude
artifacts. Number three, workflow
agents. NAN, Zapier, Make, Lang Chain,
etc. Number four, research agents like
Deep Research or Perplexity. And number
five, multimodal agents. Manis falls
into that category. There are probably
other primary modalities, but you get
the idea, right? It's basically what is
the primary mode of this agent becomes a
