If you use the LLM to analyze your
refinancing position, you don't get a
decision back. All you get back is a set
of options with a lot more color, a set
of options with a lot more clarity
around the details. You have given the
LLM a lot of information, maybe your
W2s, your 1099 income, whatever you
have, right? Your current rate on the
house, what you want to do, etc. And
you're going to get a lot of options
back. And the OM may have an opinion and
that may be okay and you may or may not
agree but it doesn't give you an answer
because you didn't prompt it to be an
answer completion machine. And so you
have to sit with the uncertainty and the
responsibility of the decision. This is
the part where the lens zooms back into
the wider world. We need to get a lot
more comfortable with uncertainty and
LLMs. LLMs are wonderful analysis tools.
We need to take that analysis, own the
decision and own the consequences of
that decision.
