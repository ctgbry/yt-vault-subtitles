OpenAI heated up the browser wars by
launching their browser that is AI
enabled called Atlas. It is a browser
that looks a lot like Chrome or any
other browser you might use except it
has a chat assistant in the side. In
this sense is very similar to other
smart browsers that have already
launched. The comment browser from
Perplexity comes to mind. Exactly the
same idea. You just launch it in the
sidebar and you do your task with the
chat and then you have the main browser
pane just the way it always is. I can
actually show you what that looks like.
So, here we are in the browser. I'm
actually working on a presentation about
the browser. I realize that's super
meta, but you can see I have a little
chat here, right? And you can kind of
interact with the chat. In this case,
what I had the agent do is to help me
create the PowerPoint presentation about
the agent. And just to be transparent,
it was able to lay out the styling. So,
it got this green and this blue
highlight uh really effectively. It was
able to lay out the title. It was able
to lay out the dark background. Look
very professional. It also was able to

take and expand the copy really
effectively. Where it didn't work as
well was it struggled with some of the
details of formatting. I know this
doesn't look like fancy formatting, but
just to be transparent, getting it to do
white text on background was not
something it was super good at. I wanted
to try something that was a real life
task. And I got to say, this is closer
to useful browser utility with AI than
I've had in a while. And that's what
makes me bullish on the trajectory
