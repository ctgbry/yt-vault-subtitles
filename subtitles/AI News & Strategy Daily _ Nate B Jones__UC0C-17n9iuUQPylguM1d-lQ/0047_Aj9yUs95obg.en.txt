repet AI is out and I want to talk about
it because even though cursor just came
out last week it's already making cursor
look outdated it's insane how fast
things are moving what's interesting
about repet AI is that it is both a chat
agent and a multi-step agent Problem
Solver so if you know Devon which came
out or went into beta uh a few months
back it's really an agent that solves
multi-step problems and that was the big
sort of Splash that it made like you
tell the agent to go solve a development
problem and it goes out does it it lays
out its own steps it problem solves it
comes back cursor which made a lot of
waves just last week is an llm in the
development environment that you can
chat with it at its
code and repet kind of combines those
two it puts the development environment
right there you're in repet and at the
same time you have this multi- uhep
agent problem solving uh experience and
so you can chat with just a quick
conversation to liner with repet and say
this is what I want to build and then

[01:01]
this is what I want to build and then
the AI will come up with a multi-step
plan and start to execute it
autonomously and then come back to you
and check in as needed people have
already built all kinds of things with
repet I saw people building web web
scrapers with we repet uh I've been
messing around with something with
Google Calendar with repet super easy to
get started very intuitive and I think
it's going to open up new opportunities
for developers yes I know we worry about
developers and roles and jobs
disappearing with I but one of the
interesting things is these kinds of
tools are going to democratize access to
software in a way we've never seen
they're going to 100x the number of
people building with software and that
means there's going to be 100x the
number of beginner and newbie questions
and there's going to be a huge Market
out there for senior developers who can
share their expertise with people who
are just getting started and I don't
just mean YouTube videos I mean if you
want to start a business where you are
available as a consult on demand for

[02:02]
available as a consult on demand for
beginners in building who are stuck with
their code and the llm can't help them
that is absolutely going to be a viable
service business opportunity if you are
a senior developer who wants to build a
debugging app that's going to be a
viable opportunity there's so many of
these and billions of dollars are on the
table in basically helping these
beginners get into building software and
I'll be really curious to see how that
space evolves so I'm excited I don't
know what next week will bring but
already repet has changed the game that
cursor set the table for last week well
next week will we have a new release
quite possibly uh but in the meantime
I'm curious to hear what are you
building with repet and uh what are you
running into as an issue what would you
like help with from a senior developer
