One of the crosscutting trends here is
that the companies that were funded in
2025 are going to be hitting the ground
in 2026 and they are going to be
fiercely competing for every sales
dollar. And so you want to be in a
position where you can argue that your
product is not only compliant driver
one, but driver two is able to show
agentic aligned measurable outcomes. If
you're deploying an agent in production,
if you are selling something that has an
agentic element, if you are buying
something that has agents included, you
want to make it clear why that extra
work, that extra token burn, that extra
expense is worth it. And the only way I
can think to make that really math math,
you know, to make 1 plus 1 equal three,
is to show that the agent can solve
problems that traditional LLM tooling
cannot.
