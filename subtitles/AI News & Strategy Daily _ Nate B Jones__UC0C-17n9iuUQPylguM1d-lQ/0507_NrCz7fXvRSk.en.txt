Think about the corresponding skill sets
that will emerge and map them onto this
fluency chart. Let me give you an
example of that. That can feel really
abstract. Think about AI agents. We just
had on October 6th a launch of a new
kind of agent framework from OpenAI.
Well, think about what the fluency types
map onto that, right? Like how do those
map onto it? Systems thinkers are going
to think about how you build not just
one agent but multiple agents, how you
sustain them within an org. Innovators
are going to think about new things you
can do with agents. People just
understanding LLMs are going to think
about what is an intuitive way to get a
task done that helps me to express my
understanding of LLMs and get real work
accomplished. And people who are just
starting out are going to scratch their
heads and say this this agent thing
looks really hard. But you can you can
map that whole technical launch onto
this capability assessment.
