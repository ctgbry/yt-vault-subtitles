Despite all these drawbacks, having an
AI and a note-taking system is eminently
worth it. You want to be in a position

I I have been a devoted fan of a product
from every called Sparkle for a long
time. Sparkle is very simple. All it
does is it gets rid of the filing
problem, which is a huge deal for me. I
am not a good filer. I'm not a good
organizer. my local hard drive. Every
computer until now has been a complete
mess. Sparkle makes that go away. All
Sparkle does is it automatically runs on
my downloads folder. It automatically
characterizes it into a neat series of
folders by type of data. That's it. Very
simple. Not necessarily.
