I am here to tell you that you are
missing a stage in the prompting layer.
What if we thought of our first piece
authoring and drafting as stage two not
stage one because it is because when you
think about where you want to go with
prompting it's actually intent formation
and discovery that has to happen first
and then you get into authoring. And
what I have found is that intent
formation for individuals is really
hard. And this, I'll be honest with you,
is definitely something that is more
true the earlier you are in your AI
journey and you are still trying to
figure out how how prompting actually
works. Basically, if you're trying to
write a prompt quickly and formulate
your intent quickly and you don't have
the time to do it and you may be an
advanced prompter, you still run into
the same issue because you have a fuzzy
goal. you summarize this, draft a plan,
analyze the sentiment, and now you need
to get to a structured, unambiguous,
high lever prompt that is going to
clarify the objective and the
constraints and the steps. And you know

constraints and the steps. And you know
that you should. But what I have found
is that those tools by themselves aren't
super well suited to the kind of intent
formation that we're doing at this
stage. What I'm picturing for you is the
realworld complexity that I feel that
others feel when they're trying to craft
prompts. And to be honest with you,
there hasn't been a great tool for that.
