So here's some examples that are kind of
when not to use rag. Things you can do
to avoid making those kinds of mistakes.
Number one, check if the base model
knows it or almost knows it. I mentioned
that already. Number two, this is more
for a personal rag system, but if it's
for stories or poems or creative
writing, rag just generally doesn't work
well because the semantic meaning
doesn't work the same way. Number three,
if you need it to be super super fast,
like gaming system fast, don't bother
with a rag. It's not going to work ever.
uh because you just have to go and get
the data and it takes time. If you have
highly volatile data like stock market
tickers, don't use a rag. It's not going
to ever work. If you have a high
maintenance cost and you don't have a
really clear benefit, like if it's a
small data set, don't use a rag. If you
have relatively simple transformations,
like basic calculations, basic
formatting, there's not a lot to do,
don't use a rag. It's not worth it. If
it's privacy critical, you have to
ensure you can't store user data. And if
you do, you're in trouble.
