There is a paradox with containment.
When we put export restrictions on
another country, we intend to slow
progress. But instead, because necessity
is the mother of invention, we trigger
efficiency breakthroughs. Deepseek
achieved GPT4 level performance with 90%
less compute. Innovation thrives under
pressure consistently. We have 450,000
plus open models on hugging face, open
AI models. Anybody can grab them.
Researchers from both nations routinely
publish together. That is, by the way, a
fantastic thing. That is a great thing.
Knowledge flows like water across
national borders. It flows like the
internet. And performance gaps over time
are narrowing, not widening.
