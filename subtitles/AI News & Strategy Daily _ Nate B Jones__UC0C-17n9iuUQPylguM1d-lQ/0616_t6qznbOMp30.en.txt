But if we move to seniors, the thing to
capture is that seniors have the most
grace on AI right now. You I actually
know of companies that are changing
their hiring practices to not assess for
AI because they don't want to miss
seniors. Seniors have systems
understanding. They have deep experience
10 to 15 years or more. And this is true
whether you're a very experienced PM or
an engineer or a CS lead or a sales
lead. People desperately need that
experience. And so I hear a lot from
folks who have some gray hairs like me
and they wonder what is going to happen
to me. I feel like I'm so experienced
that people won't give me a shot. I
think it's encouraging to know that
people are really reframing their hiring
practices to require less AI of seniors
so they can bring them in because they
know that seniors can learn the AI and
they'll have the wealth of domain
expertise and the problem solving
experience and everything else that goes

with being a senior and be able to apply
it to AI very very rapidly and that is
encouraging right that is encouraging if
you're someone who's trying to figure
out how to make that transition because
it means that you have a little bit more
grace and people areing Trust in you
more.
