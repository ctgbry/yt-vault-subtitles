People are using the API call to pass a
string of data in a structured prompt
query to Nano Banana Pro and retrieve a
chart or a graph that they can then
display as the past week's sales, the
past days customers, whatever it is that
they need for internal metrics, they can
just automatically query and get a nice
chart back from Nano Banana Pro. That is
generative interface driven by Agentic
software. Fundamentally, the interface
is something that is starting to morph
based on user context and it isn't
staying fixed anymore. Software is
becoming generated on demand from intent
and context. One of the most instructive
descriptions of vibecoded apps has been
a recognition from folks who've done
this over 20 30 projects that they are
finding that these apps are valuable in
the moment. And some of them they may
use again, but some of them they created
just for a single use.
