These are the things that I wish we told
employees more about AI. In other words,
there's a lot of corporate communication
going on about AI right now, but it's
not all upfront. And I think it doesn't
always help you in career growth. And
having seen a lot of juniors, a lot of
mid-career, a lot of senior folks
grappling with the realities of an AI
transition, what I'm realizing is
corporate communication is often very
formal and stilts. It doesn't give you
all the information you need. But
because I've seen so many of these
transitions at different scales, I can
give you a little bit of the
behindthe-scenes perspective to say this
is this is what should be said to you,
right? This is the reality. So with that
in mind, let me give you the straight
talk on what is really going on in the
middle of these AI transitions for each
of these job levels. I'm going to
address honest straight advice for
juniors. Things that you should be
hearing, maybe you're not, but you
should be. Same for mid-level. Same for
seniors. This is really missing right
now. I don't hear it. I don't see it.

now. I don't hear it. I don't see it.
Most of the advice is generic. I'm gonna
be really honest and really specific.
