If you're in a building or founding
space, you need to be assuming a world
next year where intelligence per dollar
continues to double every four or five
months. And therefore, your margin
opportunity is smarter routing. And so
you need to think about a core product
lever that enables you to route more
intelligent that enables you to deliver
higher quality at lesser cost with the
assumption that models will continue to
deliver more capability for cheaper
going forward. You also need to think
about how you capture distribution with
answer engine optimization. You should
assume that there the 60% AI search
share from Chad GPT the 11% retail
conversion rate those are sticking
around. You should assume that there's

against that. You should assume that if
you are not in place with AEO optimized
content like structured data, canonical
APIs, etc., Uh, you are invisible to the
fastest growing e-commerce distribution
