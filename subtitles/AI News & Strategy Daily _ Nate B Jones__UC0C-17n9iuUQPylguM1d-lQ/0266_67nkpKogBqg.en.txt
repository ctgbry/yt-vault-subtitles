And this is where I want to underline
again my thesis for where general
intelligence is falling down right now
is that AI is good at individual skills
but real jobs and real work that humans
do is not an individual skill set
question. It is a bundle secured by glue
work deeply interacted and entangled
with other people's roles. And AI does
not have enough context and does not
have enough reinforcement learning. does
not have enough training data or
anything to get at that piece of the
work, the glue work. And so my
encouragement to you if you were worried
about AGI is to remember Project Vend.
Remember Claude loses money on a vending
machine. And remember that even if
people talk a big game about AI, no one
has an answer to this kind of problem.
to why Claude went off the rails to why
memory problems are not yet solved.
