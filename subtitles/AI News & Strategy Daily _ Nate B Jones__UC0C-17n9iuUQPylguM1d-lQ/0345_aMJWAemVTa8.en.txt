Okay, pattern number three. This one is
related to tools. It is not going
anywhere. You know what the fastest tool
to $100 million is? It's not cursor
anymore. It's lovable. The vibe coding
tool. It is such a big deal that
Microsoft launched their own copycat
version for GitHub called Spark. I think
natural language driven coding or vibe
coding. It is in a sense its own
pattern. I wanted to give it its own
airtime. You prompt in natural language
for code generation. You iterate for
refinements. It's ideal for prototypes,
for scripting, for exploration, and you
can honestly build real applications. I
know people who have built CRM for small
services businesses off of Lovable. I
know people who have built small
applications that are focused on uh
crypto monitoring off of Lovable. The
strength is speed. You can get through
things very very rapidly.
