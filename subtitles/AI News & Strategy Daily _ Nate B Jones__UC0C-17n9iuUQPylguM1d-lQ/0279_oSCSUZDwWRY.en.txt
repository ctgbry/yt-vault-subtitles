I haven't talked a ton about how legal
is seeing tremendous changes with AI.
But even though legal has a very high
bar on accuracy, they cannot mess
anything up. You can still use something
like co-pilot to get an early read and
reduce the time. I think the time taken
was like 7 days to 7 hours and they got
more consistent quality because they
uploaded the contract and critically
they asked the right prompts, identify
obligations, identify deadlines, flag
unusual terms compared to our standard
which requires co-pilot to know your
standard. Create a summary in plain
English. It's all about the kinds of
prompting that you bring. And you see
how they're prompting in ways that give
the AI room to succeed here. Healthcare
is another example. You can use Copilot
for patient discharge summaries. Doctors
might spend 30 minutes writing
discharges. Now, Copilot can just pull
from patient records, create the
discharge summary, including
medications, and follow up and be done
with it. It can result in a dramatic
drop in the time spent doctors on
