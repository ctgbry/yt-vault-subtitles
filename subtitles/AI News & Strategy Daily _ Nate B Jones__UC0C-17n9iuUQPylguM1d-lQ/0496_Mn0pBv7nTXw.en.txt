This changes the economics of workloads
for entire companies. Status reports can
be automated. You can have sales decks
that are templ templatized with AI
customization. You can have board
updates that really you're just obsessed
with the right message for the people.
And you don't have to think about how
you get that message into PowerPoint.
It's just done. And you in fact have
time to take in multiple AI
perspectives, think about them, think if
they're correct, refine the deck,
iterate on the deck in ways that you
never had before. And you also have the
ability to generate decks on the fly,
which has always been a struggle for
people. This deck buy tomorrow. Well,
now I'm staying up all night, right?
Anyone who has worked in business has
had that moment. You don't have to stay
up all night anymore.
