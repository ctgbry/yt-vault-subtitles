you you are all about to have kind of
like Luke Skywalker the ability to build
your own lightsaber which is super cool
but please be careful to build it right.
Please be careful because the
consequences are an insecure agent that
generates production workloads that
nobody has monitored or nobody has
watched over, nobody's able to maintain
when you're out and that generates
ultimately organizational
vulnerabilities. And as much as Chad GPT
is going to lean on the safety
guardrails, which are cool, it's not
enough. It's organization's job to
design agentic policies that actually
scale. It's team's jobs to design
agentic policies for teams that work for
the whole team, not just the individual.
And as an individual, it is your job to
build the most scalable and sustainable
agent you can. And that is what these
principles are designed to do. Good luck
with all the power you're about to be
given.
