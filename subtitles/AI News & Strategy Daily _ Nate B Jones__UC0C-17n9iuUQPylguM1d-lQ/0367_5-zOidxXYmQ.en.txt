I'm also going to call out that they
were right that it's a better writer.
I've spent a lot of time talking about
data analysis. I've talked about coding.
The model's writing is the best I've
ever seen from Chad GPT. I loved's
writing. I thought it was a great
writer. Chad GPT5 is at least as good
and strikes me as slightly better with
cadence and pros. It's clear. It still
tends to over anchor to the recency of
the prompt. So if you give it a prompt,
it tends to like glom onto that and you
may have issues with framing when you're
trying to write. So again, it rewards
clarity of intent, but it is a really
really thoughtful writer and it writes
with pros that is not horrific to read,
which is kind of nice. I will also say
it's a good reader. actually fed it an
essay in handwriting and it was able to
quickly declode the handwriting, decode
the separate set of handwriting for
edits and generate its own coherent
thinking around the essay.
