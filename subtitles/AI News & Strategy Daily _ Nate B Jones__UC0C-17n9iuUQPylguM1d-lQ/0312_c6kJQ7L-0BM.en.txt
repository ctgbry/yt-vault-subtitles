The third thing I want to call out is
that we are going to see more and more
agents in code. And again, that is a
cutting edge tip of the spear for where
we will see them other places. The
reason code is leading the way here is
because code is easy to reward. Code
runs or it doesn't. It's easy for model
makers to figure out whether their code
worked or it didn't. And that's true for
development environments. It's true if
you launch your own agent or recently
launched their own model that codes. Uh
and it's true if you have an agent that
runs on code. All of the stuff we're
seeing in the development environment
now, this whole conversation around wind
surf is an early indicator of where the
rest of the industry is going because
it's an easier problem for AI to solve.
When you think about the next 12 to 15
to 18 months, even acquiring windsurf
means more work on agents in code. It
means the agentic agenda for lack of a
better term. Not that it's a secret
cabal, but the agentic goal of like
getting AI agents with tools and policy
and guidance to actually do important
coding work that is moving forward.
