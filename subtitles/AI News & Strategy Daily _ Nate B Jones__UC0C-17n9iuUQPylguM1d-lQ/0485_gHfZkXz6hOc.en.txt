Every department is full of those kinds
of opportunities and the gap is our
ability to understand how quickly AI is
scaling and how much capability we have
on the table. Most managers have no idea
how much AI opportunity there is in
their space. Like I look at it when I
come in and I'm like 80 or 90% of the AI
opportunity is untouched. You guys are
sitting here talking about, you know,
how Copilot can do this and that or how
chat GPT can do this and that. Great.
I'm glad you're chatting with chat GPT.
I'm glad you're using Copilot for your
emails. Have you thought in workflows?
Have you thought about the impact your
team is delivering and worked back from
that into your pain points? No. Well,
maybe we should start with that and then
get into training. And so yes, when I
build prompts, when I think about what
teams need, I think about how to build
prompts that are going to be supportive
of workflows.
