So I deliberately used Gro 4. I tested
it against 03. I tested it against Opus
4. If it was anywhere close to the
number one model in the world, it would
either be neck andneck with those two
other models or it would beat them. It
did neither. Instead, it lost. I tested
the models twice on different uh scoring
rubrics or the same scoring rubric on
different model exams. And in each case,
Grock 4 scored third. Opus 4 scored
second and 03 scored first. I'm not
saying that because 03 was perfect.
These were intentionally somewhat
difficult and none of the models came
through without flaws and defects. But
Gro 4 was consistently the lowest
performing model across the five tasks I
just described. And you might wonder,
well, what's in the box there? Frankly,
the thing that was an issue was explicit
formatting. It just could not seem to
follow the explicit formatting
instructions in the prompt.
