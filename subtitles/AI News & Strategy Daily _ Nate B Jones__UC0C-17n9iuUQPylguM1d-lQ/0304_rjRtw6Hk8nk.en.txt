And
the thing that AI enables us to do in
this world that has been hard at every
other point in human history is it
enables us to dream differently. It
gives us more flexibility on our
dreaming. It gives us the ability to
stretch our wings in new areas very
easily. It's an incredible teaching
tool. Yes. It's also a tool that enables
us to practice our skills confidently.
We can practice our interview skills if
that's what we're working on. We can
practice our coding skills if that's
what we're working on. We can get
someone to help us read a new book and
learn a new skill set from that book. If
you want to learn the why machines learn
textbook by Anneil right here, you can
do that. You can literally take a
picture of a complicated diagram that
you don't understand and you can get AI
to help you learn it. And that's just
one example. I know that Red Bull gives
you wings as trademarked. I know we
can't say AI gives you wings, but that's
the vibe.
