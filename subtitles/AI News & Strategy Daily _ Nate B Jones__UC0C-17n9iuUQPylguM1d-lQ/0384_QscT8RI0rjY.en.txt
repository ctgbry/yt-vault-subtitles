You're not just paying $200 for access
to a smarter model. You're paying for
the compute to run multiple reasoning
threads at once. And that gives you a
clue as to why it's reserved for the
smarter model. It's not cheap to run.
Every query spawns parallel processes
that take real compute resources. The
thing is you get an advance on
correctness. And so you can look at
different sort of tests that show that
you know this test 100% on advanced
mathematics, right? Or 88.4% on graduate
level reasoning, 22% fewer major errors
in the bench. Okay, fine. Right? Like I
have learned to take the test with a
grain of salt. What I'm more interested
in is the architecture that leads to
correctness because that's what actually
gets us where we need to
