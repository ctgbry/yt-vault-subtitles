Right? Let's say you're in premeating
prep. You type into co-pilot, I have a
client meeting about project X in an
hour. Give me an agenda. I want status
update. I want challenges. I want next
steps. It's going to spit out an agenda
with time limits and give you a sense of
those time limits. And then you're going
to say, "Hey, what questions should I
ask to understand the concerns that that
the client is going to uh express a
little bit better?" And it's going to
spit out questions that you can actually
dig into. You can get co-pilot with
teams in a live meeting. And so you can
say, "What have we discussed so far?" if
you joined late and co-pilot will give
you an update without you interrupting
Betty and saying hey Betty what are you
know what are we talking about you've
all been there right like somebody joins
the Zoom or somebody joins the team's
meeting you know 6 minutes 8 minutes
late and like they're a highly paid
important person and so they get the
update and everybody has to sit there
and let you know the update happen you
know you can just ask co-pilot for it
