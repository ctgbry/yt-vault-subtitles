The other core issue is that we
typically have longstanding information
architecture problems in our documents
at work that we just paper over and that
we are not going to be able to paper
over when AI is writing. Because
fundamentally what AI does is it exposes
information asymmetries,
informationational vagueness that
previously hid in a lot of our writing
because people wrote it and you just
assumed that people were doing their
best thinking. One of the good things
about the AI age is we now don't assume
that everyone's doing their best
thinking, which means we critique more,
which is actually healthy. So, if you
can't tell if this document enables
person X to make choice Y or if this
well structured information enables you
to make a big decision, if you if you
don't know what it looks like, your goal
at this point is actually to get rid of
that vagueness you tolerated in the past
in the business and define
theformational architecture of the
document. Your structure is the business

document. Your structure is the business
logic, not just a template. So many
times if someone gives you like a
product requirements document or if they
give you a business memo or a press
release, when they give it to a human,
you get a template. Templates just let
you fill in the boxes without thinking.
And when you hand AI only a template in
the prompt, that is what you get. And
that is why so often when I'm called in
to help with business writing prompts,
people say, "I don't know what I did
wrong. I gave it the template and it
filled out the template and it's
terrible. It's crap." Well, you didn't
give it the the business logic. You
didn't give it a a decision interface to
work against. That's why your writing is
terrible. If you don't give it that
intent, the business writing is going to
fail.
