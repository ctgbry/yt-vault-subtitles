It's very different from Google, right?
Because Google just finds you an answer.
But what is less understood is that it's
also very different from chat GPT. Chat
GPT is fundamentally a parametric answer
engine, which is a fancy way of saying
chat GPT's default is to go and look
inside its own training data and its
weights in the model for an answer for
your question. It does not go out and
look at the internet by default. And by
the way, that is why chat GPT doesn't
know about new chat GPT instances.
Right? If you ask chat GPT, it will
often give you the wrong answer when you
ask it what the current chat GPT model
is. It's not just chat GPT that does
this. Claude does the same thing. Gemini
has done this. The reason why it's not
some diabolical plot. It is that they
are parametric answer engines and they
look inside their weights and perplexity
looks outside. It looks at the internet
as a whole by default. It's like imagine
a world where you have an answer engine
in chat GPT that looks inside the house

in chat GPT that looks inside the house
first, inside your own weights, or you
have a choice like perplexity that looks
at the whole world first and isn't
necessarily focused on reasoning first.
That's the difference. And so that
shapes how and where we use it. And it
also profoundly shapes our prompt
strategy.
