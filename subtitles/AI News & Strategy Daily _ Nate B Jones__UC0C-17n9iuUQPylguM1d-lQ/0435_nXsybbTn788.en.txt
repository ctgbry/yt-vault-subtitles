Now, I think the thing to call out is
that if you have an agent that excels at
complex multi-dommain workflows where
the alternative is hiring expensive
specialists, what you have is still a
premium automation tool rather than a
general productivity app. We keep coming
back to this idea that there are certain
buckets in the agentic landscape that
are more specialized than others and
where you're going to be paying more as
a result. And one of the things I want
you to take away from this is that AI
agents should not be viewed as a
singular bucket anymore. You have agents
that are going to be positioned as
general productivity tools and you have
agents that are going to be positioned
as specialist tools for specialist
tasks. Manis, as it stabilizes, is
looking more and more like a specialist
tool for a specialist task. It's looking
like a surgeon scalpel versus a Swiss
Army knife. I'm sure they would like to
be a Swiss Army knife from an economics
perspective, but because of the
engineering challenges I've identified
