Sub agents enable multi- aent workflows
like opponent processors or parallel
task agents and this allows you to build
promptbased setups that are quite
complex. Now if you can get into
responsible manual orchestration of
these sub agents and give them separate
rules and give them separate tasks you
can do incredible incredible things. You
can have one agent that's expanding your
pre your your PRD. You can have another
agent architecting. You can have a third
agent building etc. It is really really
important though to follow these
principles as you apply it because sub
agents essentially just accelerate you.
They don't actually give you different
capabilities. They just enable you to go
faster if you're applying these
principles successfully. And so I want
to go through these six again and make
sure you really understand them. I don't
want you to be confused by the tool
mentioned. I want you to think about the
principles.
