Versel comes in and their focus is
entirely on how can we get practical
value out of AI agents at work. We're
not writing a 50-page white paper. We
are just trying to get to tomorrow and
get to good ROI, which is where like 99%
of businesses are. And you know what
they do? They go through their back
office operations. This is alarmingly
simple, but I love it. They go through
and they talk to the people actually
doing the work and they say, "Where are
you doing something that is completely
verifiable that is just obviously one,
two, three, four, five clicks and and
it's toil like you don't like it. It
causes suffering. Well, let's take it
away." And that's what they're doing.
They are focused on building AI agents
that let their best people in back
office operations do more stuff they
care about and less stuff they don't.
And so they tackled sort of ticket

customer service people are on higher
value tasks, things that allow them to
bring their best to the business. And
this is what I keep emphasizing is AI
agents need to weave around us as people
in the workplace. I loved the focus
Verscell had here because it reminds us
that people matter that people have to
touch the work for the work to really
have the value we can bring from long
context for from the kind of
understanding over time that people
bring that AI doesn't. And that's what
Versel did.
