Chat GPT is launching a social network
as a standalone app. This is a direct
shot across the bow at Meta and Zuck.
This product is intended to be old style
Facebook, old style Instagram. It is
about you and your friends. They are
very very sensitive to the accusation
that AI is going to produce slop on the
internet. They have seen Meta's terrible
PR experience with AI girlfriends and
boyfriends. They've seen this broad and
pervasive impression that people have
that AI is wrecking social media. And
they want two things out of that. One,
they want to make sure that they are
perceived as the good guys. And two,
they want to make sure that they can
show a path for AI being used
responsibly.
