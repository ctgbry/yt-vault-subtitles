The agentic mesh is a word salad that
has no empirical grounding. It doesn't
have the builder's touch. And that is
what makes that presentation so
concerning because I've seen over and
over again as someone in sort of the
product engineering side of things when
you have a CEO come in fresh off a
report like that and he's like this
should just work. The McKenzie guys say
that they can build an agentic mesh and
you can plug any model in without
additional work. Why don't we use uh you
know Mistl small or why don't we use GPT
3.5 Turbo because McKenzie mentioned it.
Both of those are in the presentation by
the way. And the tech teams roll their
eyes because they're like these are
ancient models. They're tiny. It relies
on this assumption of edge computing
that hasn't sustained very well because
larger models just show sustained gains
in intelligence that smaller models
aren't matching. That's one of the big
surprises of 2025 is that edge computing
for models is not working as well as
people thought it would yet. That makes
a CEO sleep well at night. It is not
true.
