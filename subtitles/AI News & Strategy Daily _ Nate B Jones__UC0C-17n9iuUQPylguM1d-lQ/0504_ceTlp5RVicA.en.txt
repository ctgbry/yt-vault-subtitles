You should not leave the LLM to make the
judgment call of which tool to use
without guidance. It can choose which
tool to use with guidance from you.
And that's really important because
you're essentially going to need to
compose a prompt for the LLM based on
the retrieval context it has, the inputs
you're giving it, any system
instructions or prompt that you have for
it, and then whatever uh tool use that
it uses, right? And so it's basically
going to go through, it's going to read
the retrieval, it's going to read the
prompt, it's going to select a tool
during the run, then it's going to come
back with a response and put it wherever
you want it to go.
It is dependent on your clarity in your
prompt and in the retrieval to know what
tool to use. If there is ambiguity, you
will get unpredictable responses.
