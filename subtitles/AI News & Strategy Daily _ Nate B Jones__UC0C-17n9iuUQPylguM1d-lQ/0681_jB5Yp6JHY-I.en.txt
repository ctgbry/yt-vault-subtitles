AI operations is becoming a fullfledged
headcount function. It is not a hobby
job. And so once you start to accept the
idea that some tasks go to Gemini, some
tasks go to Claude, some tasks go to
chat GPT, who maintains that, who
maintains the prompts, who maintains the
tools and the artifacts, who teaches
teams how to work with these different
layers. This is part software
engineering, part product management,
part platform team. We're still evolving
what the role means, but fundamentally,
if you think one staff engineer who's a
champion on AI can just do this, you're
probably underinvested. One very
reasonable 2025 move is to explicitly
charter an AI platform group and give
them a mandate around how they handle
routing, how they handle internal
