So, is Sam right? Are we in a bubble? I
would actually argue that if he means,
are there elements of unfounded hype in
AI? Yes, there are. Absolutely. Is there
froth? Yes. As a wonderful example,
again, just from this week, I could pick
any number of a dozen examples. But look
at the number of lovable copycats out
there. How many companies do you know
who have put up a little box saying,
"What do you want to build today?" The
latest one is Air Table. I would not I
would not think that Air Table should be
doing that, but they've decided to. With
any gold rush, you get people rushing in
to stake a claim where they think
there's gold. And Lovable has
demonstrated there's gold in vibe
coding. And so now there's a rush there,
right? And there's going to be a lot of
me too players. Anytime you have value,
you have me too players. That doesn't
mean it's inherently a bubble no matter
what. And I think that people sort of
overindexed on that comment and they
thought, "Oh, there's hype players. That
means it's a bubble.
