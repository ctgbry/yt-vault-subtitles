The truth is both sides are drowning. A
thousand applications per job sucks for
everybody. And the problem is both sides
right now tend to give advice that
creates more noise to cut the noise. So
yell louder. But everyone's being told
to yell louder. Everyone's being told to
put a portfolio out there. Everyone's
being told to start a social media
presence of some sort. Everyone's being
told that like you should be like
putting more and more job descriptions
out there if you're a hiring manager.
And it all adds up to this cacophony of
noise in the AI job market. And what I
want to suggest to you is that the
information equilibrium that we used to
have before 2022 is permanently gone. It
is not coming back. More noise does not
fix this. In the past, strong candidates
could afford the effort to raise the
noise level and they could break through
with signal. And weak candidates faced
issues with their ability to actually
put the effort in and generate quality
work. And so we started to have a useful

work. And so we started to have a useful
signal when people put more effort in.
LLMs have destroyed the value of effort
from good candidates and they make it
equally cheap for everyone to produce
infinite signals. And I think we have to
start by just admitting the old game
that we played before 2022 is over and
we don't know how to play the new game
Yeah.
