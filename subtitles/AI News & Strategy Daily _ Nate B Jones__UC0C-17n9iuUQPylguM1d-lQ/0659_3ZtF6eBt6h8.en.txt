If Gemini 3 is the clear
state-of-the-art, Apple can credibly
say, "We pick the best model." That
makes it not a defensive choice anymore.
Google will gain leverage versus AWS and
Microsoft when they sell cloud AI
because they can point to consumer
dominance and they can point to
state-of-the-art benchmarks and say they
have the best. Open AI will lose some of
their halo as the default synonym for AI
unless they can deliver a model that
beats. And this delivers a reset moment
where the crown of best model and the
crown of default assistant at once moves
from OpenAI Microsoft to Google/Apple,
at least in consumer. Now, if you layer
in OpenAI's current trajectory and you
look at their cash burn, this suddenly
begins to matter strategically because
if you're not obviously winning on
distribution, spending tens of billions
of dollars to stay at the frontier is
going to be less defensible. Open AI has
a strategic imperative to continue to
win at distribution and there is a real
chance with the Gemini 3 moment that
they will lose that edge. So what does
this look like over the next couple

this look like over the next couple
years? If we fast forward, let's say
Gemini 3 comes out, it's what we say
Apple is able to move quickly. These are
assumptions. They might not come true,
but if they do and they're reasonable,
then we have scenario A. Gemini is just
everywhere. It's Google's winning all
the way. Gemini 3 is the clear
state-of-the-art. And then whatever
comes after
