What are the things we can think about
with Chad GPT5 that we know from
publicly released statements that we can
then infer back into prompts that are
useful even with today's model with
claude 4 with Gro 3 with Gemini 2.5 Pro
with the 03 and 03 Pro models I'm going
to suggest a few ideas for you number
one extreme specificity is a focusing
mechanism these models are so big GPT5
will handle even more complex
constraints if you master precise
specifications now if If you can specify
word counts, if you can specify formats,
if you can specify requirements by
number, if you can use XML tags in some
cases, that specificity
does not overwhelm these models. It
actually helps you to focus them in ways
that are useful. Number two, text is
currency.
