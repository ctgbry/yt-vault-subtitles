I think that we are living through an
ongoing intelligence evolution and none
of us know where it's all going to end
up or top out. And to me, this feels
roughly in line with the ongoing
intelligence explosion. And we will see
more updates in chat GPT6. And we will
see more updates from Gemini. And we'll
see more updates from Claude. Claude
talked about it already. We'll see more
from Grock. Enjoy this step in the new
intelligence explosion. Don't overindex
on whether you personally think this is
the best model in the world or not.
Figure out if it's useful to you. Use it
well. If it's not useful to you, another
model's going to come along next week
that will be. Like, that's the world
we're living in. It's an incredible
world. and look at the overall
trajectory.
