Number one, rollouts for chat GPT5 are
going to be different from rollouts for
anything else because of the way they've
made it one model. And so when we think
about it from that frame, certain
implications fall out that are new and
different based on previous AI rollouts
for orgs. First, you have to tell people
how to prompt and access the power
behind the model. That's why I called
out think hard. Second, it can tackle
big, gnarly, data heavy problems in the
chat the way it never could before. You
have to be responsible for the data you
put in, for making it clean. You have to
be responsible for teaching people to
prompt it well. And you have to be
responsible for reminding people that it
does that work best when you invoke
those tools by demanding artifacts, by
demanding proof of work, by demanding
that it actually shows how it did the
work. Not that you tell it how to, but
that you demand the artifacts that shows
that it did the work. And that's a
that's a fine distinction, but it's
important to emphasize because telling
it how to that doesn't matter. But
saying, "I want you to show me the
greater you use." Well, that's actually
helpful.
