So, Goldilocks prompting is the idea
that you can prompt too much and you can
prompt too little. I know that might
sound funny to some of you cuz I'm the
guy who does the prompts and people
think I'm known for these long prompts.
I am here to help you prompt more
effectively. And I want to remind you
that there is an optimal level of
clarity for the goals that you set out
to accomplish with the model. And you
can be over clear. You can be over long.
And so, we're going to talk about
Goldilocks prompting and why it makes
such a difference. I'm actually going to
show you an example of the incredible
improvement in model output quality that
you can get when you actually use
Goldilocks prompting. What is Goldilocks
prompting? Very simply, it is giving the
model enough context so it doesn't
assume stuff about you that isn't true
and the problem and then giving the
model enough guidelines that it knows
the direction to go in. It also includes
giving it like clarity on what tools it
can or should use etc.
