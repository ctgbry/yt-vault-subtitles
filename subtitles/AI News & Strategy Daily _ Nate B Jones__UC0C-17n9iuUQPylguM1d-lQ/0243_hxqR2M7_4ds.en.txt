Here's cloud code. It's just another
chatbot. It happens to live in a
terminal and I can talk to it. Maybe
that gets you over the fear if you're
not an engineer. If you are an engineer,
I would encourage you when you're
sharing about your cloud code projects.
Yes, talk about how amazing Claude is
where it illustrates the token burn and
it's really smart at actually executing
what you want and it has a high follow
through. You can talk about the caveats
and the drawbacks in certain situations.
It is unfortunate that you can't see the
code that you're writing. Right? I'm not
saying it replaces everything, but also
mention if you're an engineer or you're
a regular user of claude code that this
is not just a coding agent. It is more
than that. is effectively a general
purpose agent that lives in your
terminal.
