The related story is the acquisition of
Sky by OpenAI. And that matters because
Sky is the best team on the planet at
figuring out the relationship between
natural language queries and the Mac OS
operating system. That is what they were
good at. That is what they were building
and that is why OpenAI acquired them.
And there are two possible futures here
that are both relevant from a hardware
perspective. Future number one, probably
earlier horizon is we see OpenAI launch
something that is Agentic that is tied
into the Mac operating system that
enables longerterm agentic work across
your local computer system and that
would be Mac specific and it would be
tied to M5 hardware probably. Future
number two is longer term. You can use
all your learning from that if you're
open AAI to build a native AIO OS and
that's something that is speculative.
We'd have to see what that looks like.
But the more work that's being done on
understanding how LLMs interact with the
environment, the more you see that

environment, the more you see that
direction start to emerge from major
model makers.
