There has been an implicit contract in
the valley where founders are in it for
the long haul with their companies. If
that starts to break down because the AI
salary pressures are so insane that it
is better to be an employee than to be a
founder at a major R&D firm like Google
for AI. We have cracks in the Silicon
Valley ecosystem. It does not sit well
with me that a founder would be rewarded
for walking away from their startup and
leaving their employees in the lurch.
So, as much as I agree with Gurgaly that
on paper is better than the outcome the
company could have had, I don't think it
is a good thing that builds trust in the
ecosystem long term. I think it's
negative for the ecosystem. I don't
think Google did a service to the valley
