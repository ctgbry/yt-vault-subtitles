We are figuring out which AI is able to
help us find the true best deal on
commonly discounted items. I chose a
sectional couch for this, but you can
absolutely use this for TVs or anything
else that you're looking for. What are
the contestants? Chad GPT 5.1, Claude
Opus 4.5, Gemini 3, and two smart
browsers. I went with Atlas and I went
with Comet. So, number one, the intent
has to be very clear for the model to
come back and give you what you want. I
know that's not new, but it came
through. Comet did not figure out even
though I was on a gray sectional couch
page that I wanted a gray sectional
couch. So, the color didn't come through
because I didn't specify it. Anywhere
you don't have clear intent, the model
is just going to give you its best
guess. That's why I built a prompt that
is actually designed to let you specify
as much as you want, in as much detail
as you want, so the model can go and get
it. And you'll see what happens when you

it. And you'll see what happens when you
start to get clear and how much more
powerful the search gets. Overall, the
browsers have a very different approach
architecturally than the models do. The
models can use web search tools and then
their own inference or reasoning
abilities to figure out what is the
right answer to the prompt. The web
search tools are actually equipped with
more information. They are able to look
at the web page itself along with
whatever prompt you give. What you see
is what you get here,
