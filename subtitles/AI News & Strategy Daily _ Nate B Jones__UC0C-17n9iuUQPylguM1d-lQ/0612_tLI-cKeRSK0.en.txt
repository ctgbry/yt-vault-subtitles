The first thing you have to do if you
suspect malpractice from one of these
institutions, if you suspect they are
trying to take advantage of you, have
the LLM parse the technical framework
that is built for humans to find
intimidating, have the AI read Medicare
billing rules or FDCPA statutes or IEP
regulations or insurance policy
appendices, technical documents that are
designed to be unreadable on purpose by
humans. This matters because
institutions are betting you won't use
an AI to do this. But AI is not
intimidated by jargon. They decode it
really quickly because they're trained
on it. You can audit these institutions
compliance with their own rules without
subject matter expertise. And that is
the first place that I would start if I
suspected an issue. Number two,
principle number two, use LLM to
crossreerence multiple authority
sources. So check if CPT codes were
built correctly against CMS bundling

[01:00]
built correctly against CMS bundling
rules and Medicare fee schedules and
setting requirements. The situation
matters because violations can hide in
the gaps between the documents. A
hospital can bill procedure X in setting
Y differently than in setting Z. You
have to check how bundling rules when
multiple procedures are put together.
You have to look at the fee schedule.
This kind of multi-document pattern
recognition is extremely hard for
people. We can't hold it in our heads
well, but it turns out AI is really,
really, really good at it. And so,
because it's easy to slide things in in
between documents, in the gaps between
documents, in the areas that are sort of
gray or gaps, use AI to crosscheck
multiple authority sources in the
relevant area that you're worried about,
right? Maybe it's not medical, maybe
it's something else. I have the prompts
that I'm building are across debt
collection, they're across education,
there's other things too because I think
that this is actually a wider issue and
that's what I'm trying to call out is
that fundamentally institutions are good
