Send this video to your manager. Tell
your manager, "Watch this. This is a
problem for us. I can't get the
budgeting I need to do my work." And if
you're in leadership, this has got to be
a call to action for you. You cannot
look at traditional software budgeting
the same way. This is not traditional
software. I don't care if you call it
agentic software. I don't care what the
hype term is, but you've got to shift
the way you budget for work and you've
got to invest in your best employees so
they can deliver this 2, three, four, 5x
impact over the next couple years. So
that is my challenge to you. We are we
are not in old software land anymore. We
are in new software land and there are
new rules and there are new budgets and
you have to invest in your team at a
different level. Good luck.
