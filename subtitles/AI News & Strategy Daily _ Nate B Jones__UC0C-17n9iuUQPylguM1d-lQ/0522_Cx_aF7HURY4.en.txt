agents are not particularly robust. The
most sophisticated multi-agent
implementations I've been a part of tend
to have robustness from architecture
rather than robustness from agents
themselves. And if you want reliability,
again, you go back to architecture for
reliability versus the agent itself.
This is me talking. Prevents you having
really high value use cases for agents
today. And I tend to frame the work we
have to do architecturally to make
agents work as just the price that you
pay for where agents are at. And the ROI
is there because agents are able to do
so much already. But the promise of
agents has been much bigger than this.
The promise of agents, which I think
Andre is reacting to, is that they will
do anything, that they will be anywhere,
that they will learn, they will be
useful as they stand out of the box,
that they will remember everything. And
of course, if you've ever worked with an
agent, you know that's not true. And
Andre is saying it's not true.
