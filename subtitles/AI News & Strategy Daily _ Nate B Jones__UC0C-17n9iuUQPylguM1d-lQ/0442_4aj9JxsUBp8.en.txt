We need to have the skill to know when
to stop building the product. And that
is new because AI will tell you over and
over and over and over again, you can
build more. You can add a database. You
can add a customer relationship manager.
You can add a new product. Expand,
expand, expand, expand. You need to be
able to say no. Before, because software
was so expensive, you had to cut just to
sort of find a way to make it work. Now
software is so cheap, it's very tempting
to add and add and add an ad. You are
the one that has to develop the skill to
say no. You have to say this is a night
and weekend project. This is the only
thing I need to build to show that I can
solve the problem. That discipline is
something that was imposed by external
cost controls before. Not anymore. Now
it's on you. Now it's a skill you have
to have. Know when to say no. as really
really important.
