You need to be at a point with your
teams where they know the outputs that
AI needs to write, build, demonstrate to
show that it has done the work. In other
words, with this model, with chat GPT5,
it does better if you force it to prove
its work than if you tell it to do the
work. So, in other words, when you're
asking for the output, say, "Hey, give
me the sentiment analysis. give me the
Python workbook to show how you did it
and then also give me a plain English
summary of the rubric and the scoring
assessment that you used for the
sentiment analysis along with any
personas that you developed. Something
like that, right? Like basically show me
what you did. Sure, give me the
executive summary and the report, but
show me all the artifacts along the way
as well and demand those as outputs.
