And that brings me to the infrastructure
cost of using GPT5 Pro. Success with GPT
Pro requires a fundamental data
restructuring that organizations tend to
underestimate. Instead of linear
documents that you feed, it would be
ideal to feed GPT5 Pro more
multi-dimensional data architectures. So
if you're doing financial analysis, feed
it the core data statements. These are
facts, metrics, these are calculations.
And then feed it perspectives. Here's a
risk lens, what we think could go wrong.
Here's a growth lens. What are the
opportunities in the space? Here's a
competitive lens with our market
positioning. Then feed it cross
references, temporal cross references,
how metrics change over time.
Relational, how departments interact.
Basically, you need to start thinking of
it as giving this multiple thread
reasoning agent as much context as you
can in a very structured way because
each parallel thread will need a
coherent data path to
