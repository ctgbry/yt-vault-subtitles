Number two, the transformer engine.
Every token computes relevance to all
other tokens. That's really key. Query
vectors are going to measure similarity
between different keys, create a
weighted average of values, and
different attention heads are going to
find different patterns. What all of
that adds up to is different
perspectives on the pattern making in
text mathematically and that adds
nonlinear depth. So you can stack
different layers of heads up to 60 plus
and get a very complex capture of
dependencies which is a fancy technical
way of saying a complex highfidelity
picture of a human text. You can
understand the meanings inside it which
is why if you ask an AI to read a text
and give you a sense of the literary
meanings this is why it understands it.
Transformer architecture is why Opus 4
can understand Hemingway.
