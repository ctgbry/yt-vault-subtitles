One of the things that has been
difficult for people to do with AI has
been a complicated task like figuring
out a job search strategy. So let's say
you need to identify candidate job
postings. You need to compose a resume
that fits those job postings. You need
to make sure that your search strategy
actually works for those jobs, that your
targeting strategy works for outreach.
This is complicated work. Normally it
would take a lot of prompts. It would
take many prompts in a row. Some people
sign up for tools and services for this.
What you can do with Claude is you can
make skills that refer to this
complicated work and give Claude special
instructions to do it well. Like your
job search strategy could instruct
Claude specifically what sites you
prefer, what job family and roles you
prefer, what levels you prefer, what
compensation you want. And all of that
would be stored inside this Lego brick
of context that Claude can go and call.
Not when you have to tag it. You don't
have to remember it. You just have to
say, "Hey, I'm trying to think about
what job search strategy I should use

[01:01]
what job search strategy I should use
for this week." And then give it some
context about your last few weeks, your
learnings. Help me figure it out. Claude
will look at that initial prompt,
understand you're talking about job
search, and go dig up a skill and use it
on the fly. And what this does is it
makes the whole process of doing a
difficult, complicated, multi-step piece
of work so much easier.
