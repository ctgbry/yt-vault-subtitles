I don't understand why journalists are
so interested in pedalling the narrative
that AI has already automated jobs and
that somehow we are simultaneously in a
bubble because both of those things
cannot be true at once. If we lived in a
world where AI had magically automated
away all jobs or whatever they're
claiming, well then it wouldn't be a
bubble because people would like
corporations would have demand for that,
right? They they would ask for that to
happen so they could expand their
footprint. maybe not even to fire people
but to add more like cap talent and
capability right there'd be demand for
it if we were you know in a bubble we
would not have the kind of surging
interest in AI at every level small
medium business uh commercial scale
enterprise scale the consumer like all
of us as individuals that's not the
story we see and yet we are being asked
to believe by the media simultaneously
that AI is so big and scary it is
automating jobs and also though that
somehow we are magically in a bubble and
it's all fake.
