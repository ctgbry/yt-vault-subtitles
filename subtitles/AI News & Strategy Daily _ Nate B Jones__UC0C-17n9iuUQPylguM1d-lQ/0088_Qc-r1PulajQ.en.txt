[00:00]
on November 20th I'm going to be doing a
free live 30 minute lesson on cutting
through the hype and delivering real
value with AI I'll cover things like
picking the right problem picking
problems with high leverage and I'll
also be talking about principles for
actually building in a landscape that
seems to be changing every single day
how do you build when AI is changing all
the time and last but not least I'll
talk about sort of the difference
between building for AI workflows versus
AI tools which I think is one of the CR
iCal pieces were missing so if you want
an OBS straight up look at how to build
in 2024 and headed into 2025 you can
check it out it's uh in a maven course
link which is right down under my uh
video here and I hope to see you in
class it's November 20th 30 minutes take
30 minutes learn about AI it'll be good
cheers
