So the first truth to understand if
you're in this bucket is that NAND has a
visual workflow builder that genuinely
democratizes automation. And that's part
of why people gravitate to it. For the
first time, it is really genuinely
possible and this does work for
non-programmers to build sophisticated
AI agents just by dragging and dropping
little nodes into a little tree. The
second truth, which I've already hinted
at, is that the same visual builder is a
complexity trap. It has killed so many
NADN implementations. So, ironically,
the very feature that makes you want to
use it is the feature that becomes
unmaintainable at scale. But, but worry
not, I'm going to give you a way
through. I want to map out how to get
from that honeymoon phase where you
install it. You you you start to build
your first node. You start to see data
flowing across the screen. It feels so
