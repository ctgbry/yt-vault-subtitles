I want to suggest that we have at least
six different categories, practical
categories of AI agents out there today
that sort of fit within this broader
spectrum of use cases. The first one,
it's the simplest, right? The
conversational generators. Uh, Chad,
GBT, Claude, and Gemini all come to
mind. Deep Seek comes to mind. You use
them when you need highquality text
generation back fundamentally. The
second class is coding assistance. when
you need to write code and you have a
feedback loop for it depending on how
you configure it. Cloud code is a great
example here. Cursor does this, wind
surf does this, etc. You can't use these
when you need sort of broader system
orchestration unless you're going to
configure them specially. And so I think
that the exception to a lot of this is
cloud code because it's such a malleable
tool. And so that's why it appears in a
couple of these. But I think that code
assistant is the good vanilla or generic
use case for cloud
