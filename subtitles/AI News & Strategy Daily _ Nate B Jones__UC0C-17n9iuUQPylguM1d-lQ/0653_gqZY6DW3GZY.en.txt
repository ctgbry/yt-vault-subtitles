If you're a builder, if you're a PM, the
real takeaway is assume your product may
sit on both sides of the chessboard.
Internally, if you're a CISO or a CTO,
you have to do three hard things today.
You have to put the AI into the sock
stack instead of treating it as a side
experiment. You have to think of it in
terms of triage, detection, and
response. You have to explicitly test
your own agentic systems as if they're
an attack surface via red teaming. And
you have to treat MCP and tools, not
just the model as part of the security
perimeter. So don't think about
hardening the model per se. Think about
the entire security perimeter
encompassing the agent, the tools they
use, the orchestration layer. If you're
a builder, if you're a PM, the real
takeaway is assume your product may sit
on both sides of the chessboard. It may
be something defenders will use and the
attackers may use it as well. You need
to be thinking about observability,
about abuse detection, about controls as
first class features, not bolt-ons. If
you are competing on raw model power,
that is a race to the bottom. But if
you're competing on trustworthy,

you're competing on trustworthy,
controllable, observable, agentic
systems, that may become a durable edge
because what is in jeopardy right now is
trust. This is a really, really
important topic and I think we need to
be talking about it more. This will not
unfortunately be the last time that we
have this kind of a threat and we need
to build for it
