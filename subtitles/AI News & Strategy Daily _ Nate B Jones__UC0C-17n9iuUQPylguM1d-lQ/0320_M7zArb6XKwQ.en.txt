Another thing that I think people
overlook
is that they don't think about their
brands as entities. They don't think
about aligning their brands into a
single entity. And I'll explain what I
mean by that. You want to audit your top
20 brand mention using Google's natural
language API. You want to create a
single source of truth description
document for your brand.
You need to send update requests to any
site with an outdated description
because your goal is to give a single
brand entity statement consistent
representation across the web so it
maximizes the odds you'll appear in
something like a Google summary in the
correct way.
And focus on the five highest authority
sites mentioning you. This is not new
either. Obviously, you focus on high
authority sites.
The the key is to make sure the exact
same roughly 50word company description
or brand description is everywhere
because again you are implanting that
into the LLM's parameters.
