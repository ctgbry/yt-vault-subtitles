Story number six, Adobe is buying
instead of building. Adobe has taken a
beating recently in the public markets
because their AI products are widely
perceived to be missing the mark. And so
they announced comprehensive thirdparty
model integration across Firefly,
embedding what the Luma Ray 3 model for
video and adding a bunch more
opportunities for model support from
Google, OpenAI, Ideog, and others. In
other words, Adobe is deliberately
importing best-in-class capabilities
rather than trying to compete anymore
with proprietary Firefly models. This
feels a lot like the meta story.
Adobee's basically admitting their own
AI strategy is dead in the water and
they need to bring in other models.
