It's a model that really wants to cut
through the noise and it's a model that
is able to give you some backbone and I
think that's somewhat related to its
ability to check its work. It has a
sense of rightness. It has a sense of
what works and what doesn't. And when it
doesn't feel like something is correct,
it says so. And so, one of the subtler
things that I've seen come out that you
will also see is that this model has
some opinions on what is correct and
what is incorrect, whether you're saying
it or whether the model is saying it.
And that makes the model less like a
hyperactive squirrel on aderall and more
like a thoughtful colleague. A colleague
that has opinions, a colleague that can
be persuaded, but a colleague that will
also push back sometimes and say, "I
don't think that's quite correct." And
that is a very tough balance to strike.
And if Claude has been able to strike
that balance with this new model, it is
a very good sign for us because it helps
us to have a more professional
relationship with AI. I
