They encourage the assumption that we
only need to pretend that this is
regular software we have to adopt. I can
go get the prompt pack from OpenAI. I
can roll it out as a manager to my sales

This is a case of getting onto a moving
train. You are either going to lean all
the way in and you are going to learn
fast and you are going to scale up
quickly in your skills and keep leaning
in or you're going to get left behind.
And if you learn two or three lines in a
prompt and you think you've got it,
you're in the left behind contingent.
