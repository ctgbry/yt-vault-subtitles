And so you should instead be thinking
about the kinds of pain points that
persist regardless of the intelligence
of the model. What are the things that
people struggle with where a smarter
model wouldn't fix it? So as an example,
if you are solving a painoint for
someone and it's a coordination problem
between multiple strands of software or
multiple parts of their day or physical
and digital, that is not something that
more intelligence necessarily makes go
away. Another example, if you are
solving a painoint for someone and it
bridges the uh physical world and the
digital world. So you're providing a
physical service mediated digitally or
ordered digitally. That's not
necessarily something that more
intelligence makes goes it doesn't more
intelligence doesn't fix that. Another
example, if you are focused on providing
a digital service, but the digital
service is predicated on your user
feeling like they got stuck in a way
that isn't tied to immediate answers.
That is a very powerful place to solve
