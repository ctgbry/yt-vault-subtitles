I did a survey of hundreds of AI tools
and the best AI tools out there today do
not look like chat GPT because
everybody's building AI chat interfaces
it seems like and the companies actually
starting to drive adoption, print money,
and grow fast are building something
else entirely. And here's what I
learned. The winning pattern isn't
better prompts plus smarter models
equals AI. The winning pattern is
collapsing the distance between AI and
the artifact that you need to ship. In
other words, the best tools do not look
like chat GPT because they operate where
your work already lives and they output
the exact thing that you would otherwise
produce manually. Let's look for tools
that are new, innovative, give us direct
outputs that are useful, and most
important of all, have the potential to
replace something in the budget. That
was one of my standards when I was
evaluating these tools because I don't
know about you, but for me, it is not
worth it to add yet another AI tool to
the stack if I'm having to add to the

the stack if I'm having to add to the
budget, too. I want to have the
potential to trade something out of the
software budget.
