It's not the ability to write the code
that is transformative. It's the ability
to think about the structure of the
project and how to order it that's
useful. I do not claim to be a
fantastically experienced senior
engineer. My background is different. I
am a hacky scrappy founder producty kind
of person. Definitely more of a
generalist with a strong technical bent.
But I know enough about coding and I
know enough about project management to
see that claude code is so much more
than a coding tool. And we misunderstand
it when we think about it just as a
coding tool.
