[00:00]
The one constant right now is chaos. I
hear it over and over again from folks.
The rate of change, the sheer
unpredictable chaos of AI is very
difficult to tell what's up and what's
down. So, in this video, I want to
simplify it. I want to zero in on some
of the underlying drivers that are
shifting what truly AI native working
looks like. Why most of our work habits
are now optimizing for the incorrect
thing. And I want to give you some
specific habits, eight of them in fact,
that you can break that help you start
working in a more AI native way. But
first, I want to start with two scenes
from the last month. Number one,
enthropic shipping co-work a full
product feature. It was built in 10 days
with just four people. It was written
entirely in claude code. And claude
code, mind you, is an entire product
that is less than a year old. And so
these folks have not had years working
AI natively to do this. The anthropic
team is evolving as they go. Meanwhile,
scene two at your company and many
companies I've worked at in the past,
there's a conference room where I
guarantee you a leader is asking for a

[01:03]
guarantee you a leader is asking for a
30-day implementation roadmap or a
three-month implementation roadmap for
their AI strategy with phases and
milestones and resource allocation and a
plan to protect capacity. Listen,
execution capacity isn't scarce anymore.
10 days, four people, and they're
shipping 60 to 100 releases daily.
Execution capacity is not the problem.
When we build our AI strategies, we're
frequently asking for help or asking for
guidance on the thing that is no longer
scarce and no longer requires
efficiency. We have spent so much of our
business lives assuming that execution
capacity is scarce. Anthropic and many
other organizations now are showing that
it's not scarce anymore. And yet every
organization, all of our individual work
habits, anyone who's had a career more
than three, four years in the industry,
it's all built around the implicit
answer to one question. What's expensive

[02:01]
answer to one question. What's expensive
here? And the answer has been execution.
For most of our careers, building things
required scarce hours from scarce people
with scarce skills. Finding really good
engineers was really hard. Training them
took a long time, maybe years. Every
hour of their time was precious. And so
we evolved elaborate rituals to protect
that capacity. Planning processes,
approval gates, specs, PRDs, meetings to
align before anybody built. All of it
was designed to protect the precious
engineering execution time so it
wouldn't be wasted on the wrong
problems. And that made sense. When the
meeting to discuss a feature takes much
less time than the time to build it, you
definitely want to hold the meeting so
you get it right. When gathering the
requirements costs much less time than
writing the code, you want to gather the
requirements first. When rework is
really expensive, you want to plan
really meticulously so you avoid rework.
Now I know and you know that there have
been movements in software to make this

[03:01]
been movements in software to make this
easier. Agile comes to mind. But even
then, engineering work remained
expensive and agile was a response to
the idea that you had to optimize
engineering work over time to deliver
value. AI has inverted the entire cost
ratio and changed the way we think.
We're no longer in a world where we
argue about waterfall versus agile.
We're in a world where we're talking
about a different kind of work entirely.
Agile never imagined a world where
everybody commits code in the
organization. Curser, the AI code
editor, they went from a million dollars
to $500 million in annual revenue faster
than any SAS company in history. And
they're not done yet. They are launching
Cursor for designers. And they're not
launching it as a separate product.
They're just relentlessly shipping
features inside Cursor that make it
easier and easier and easier for other
job families to use that tool. What used
to be an impossible product expansion is
now another day at cursor. What used to

[04:02]
now another day at cursor. What used to
be a new feature like claude co-work
that took months to plan and ship is now
10 days for four people. Coinbase
engineers report that single people are
now refactoring, upgrading or building
new code bases in days. Same story. So
in that world, the meeting to discuss a
feature now takes longer than building
the feature. The PRD can take longer
than the prototype. The planning process
can take longer than shipping three
version and seeing which ones work. The
bottleneck has moved, but our work
habits are still stuck in the way we've
worked most of our careers. There's a
manufacturing principle that explains a
lot of what's happening here. When you
eliminate a bottleneck in a
manufacturing system, the bottleneck
doesn't actually disappear. It moves
somewhere else downstream in the system.
you see the new crunch point in the
system. Resistance is never destroyed,
it's relocated. And so when you gain

[05:00]
it's relocated. And so when you gain
efficiency in one place, you see new
constraints. That's what's happening
now. And so for decades, the constraint
in knowledge work was execution. Now
that AI has largely removed that
constraint, the bottleneck has shifted.
It hasn't disappeared. A lot of people
will tell you it's disappeared. It's not
disappeared. is shifted to clarity, to
ambition, to distribution, and to
relationships. And we're still running
around using work habits that are
designed to protect execution capacity.
We are optimizing for the old work
constraint while the new one is
compounding. So, let's explore where
that bottleneck went. Clarity. Do you
actually know what's worth building?
That is now a billion-dollar question.
You can now build faster than you can
think. Every day now I see new startups
come out of stealth that claim they can
build a business with a prompt. In 2026
you are going to see people try that and
do that and some of them will make
money. The ones that make money are the
ones that will have clarity. The ones

[06:02]
ones that will have clarity. The ones
that know what's worth building. Because
it turns out the bottleneck was never
putting the product on the website. It's
knowing what product the customer wants.
PRDs were always a substitute for
clarity. They were a big hedge against
expensive rework. They were a way to
disambiguate and get to some clarity
when you were facing a potentially risky
investment, a six figure, seven figure
investment in engineering time to get to
a prototype. But now that can cost more.
Writing a PRD can cost more than
shipping the whole thing. And I'm not
kidding. I have seen PRD cycles in my
career at big companies take longer than
Claude took to ship all of co-work. The
second bottleneck is around ambition.
Are you swinging hard enough when
shipping requires
a quarter of engineering time? Then
small bets can make sense because I mean
that's agile style, right? You don't
want to you don't want to lock up
engineering and increase your risk. You
might have three or four shots per year.
If you can increase that a little bit

[07:00]
If you can increase that a little bit
with agile style thinking, then that's
great. But what if that's no longer a
constraint? What if you can take, you
know, every 10 days you can ship, every
week you can ship, it's 50 swings a
year. Suddenly your risk is timidity.
Your risk is lack of courage. The danger
isn't necessarily building the wrong
thing because you got 50 shots to build
the right thing. The danger is not
building enough things toward a larger
vision that is really transformative for
the customer. And so I think that we're
going to see a lot of cases where people
are using AI to build horseless
carriages, which is the old name for
cars. It's what we called cars because
we didn't have a mental model for a car
when we first got them. We called them
horseless carriages. We will see a lot
of products that are horseless carriages
floating around. And what we need to do
is have the ambition and the eyes to see
what is that 10x better product in our
particular domains and shoot for that
with multiple releases as quickly as we
can. Distribution is another bottleneck

[08:01]
can. Distribution is another bottleneck
that's becoming clear right now. When
everybody can build, product is not
really the moat that it was. Getting it
into people's hands is a mode. My
favorite example right now is Cognition
makers of the AI coding agent Devon
chose not to go and get distribution
themselves even though they have a
product that is an agentic coder that
seems very on trend for 2026. Instead,
they partnered with Infosys and they're
deploying Devon across Infosys's third
of a million person team and hitting all
of their global client base. Why?
Because Infosys has distribution.
Infosys has decades of enterprise
relationships. The technology is the
easy part. Reaching customers is hard.
And Cognition realized that an
established brand was a way to do that.
And that brings me to the last
bottleneck, relationships. When
capabilities are compounding really
quickly and platforms and channels keep
shifting and what worked last quarter
might not be the right way to do it next

[09:00]
might not be the right way to do it next
quarter, the thing that is durable is
relationships. You can't vibe code a
relationship. And this is going to be a
fractal truth. By which I mean it's true
for individuals and it's true for
companies. Companies in business
relationships are going to have durable
advantages by investing in those
relationships. And you in your career
individually will have a durable
advantage by investing in your
professional relationship so that you
are known as a trusted person to do work
with because if you have to turn to
someone and technical skills are rapidly
becoming a commodity you're going to
turn to someone that you can trust to
deliver on your work and that's a
relationship thing. So, we've taken a
tour through. We've seen how some of
these constraints are shifting. We've
seen how the AI native ways of working
are upending our assumptions about
execution. How do our habits need to
change? Right now, most of the work
habits we've embied are riskmanagement
rituals designed for a world where

[10:00]
rituals designed for a world where
execution was expensive. And they've
sort of calcified. They've they've
clotted into defaults that persist even
though all of the unit economics in our
world have flipped. You've probably felt
this. You probably felt a sense that
you're spending more time prepping for
the work than you probably should. That
there should be an easier way to do
this. That maybe you're protecting
something that doesn't need as much
protection anymore. Maybe you're
preparing for a meeting that doesn't
need the kind of ritual it needs
anymore. Let me get specific with you
then. Let me suggest to you habits that
made sense in the old model and are
probably now actively costing you so
that you can flip them and they can
become the seeds of a more AI native way
of working. Number one is the permission
loop. The old logic is that doing
something was typically expensive in
time. So check before you do. Get buy
in. Make sure you're building the right
thing before you spend precious
resources. Now we had management books
for a long time that said we need to

[11:01]
for a long time that said we need to
have more autonomy. we need to push
delegation down, but those still didn't
change the fundamental understanding
that execution was costly. And so, yeah,
you could take bias for action and write
up a proposal, but if you're going to
spend a quarter of engineering time,
someone's going to need to sign off on
that. That logic is now broken. Asking
even for relatively large things still
now takes longer than doing the email
thread to get approval can take more
time than building the prototype. Now
it's that's the world we live in. The
Slack conversation to confirm direction
can take longer than trying both
directions and just seeing what works.
We are in a world where Manis just
launched a feature that literally builds
the presentation that you talk about in
the meeting as you're having the
meeting. approval processes were
designed to reduce risk, but they don't
anymore. They just add slowness. And so
this means that our organizations need
to shift because people need to be free

[12:00]
to shift because people need to be free
to default to doing, to building the
rough version, to showing it, to asking
forgiveness when needed. we're going to
make mistakes and to committing to a
broader vision, a broader direction,
something in line with the ambition of
the business that they can reliably ship
against autonomously. We need leaders
who are able to cast that wider vision
so teams can be more independent and
ship relentlessly and autonomously
against that vision. That's how you
break the permission loop. Habit number
two, polish as procrastination. The old
logic was you get one shot so make it
count. If execution is expensive, please
don't waste it on something halfbaked.
Look, I saw this show up in the when I
was writing product requirement docs and
PR FAQs at Amazon. You had one shot with
a particular person you wanted to meet
with and do a review with. You had to
make it count. You had to polish it. You
had to go through different reviews.
Quality really mattered. And we spent a
lot of time polishing to make sure those

[13:01]
lot of time polishing to make sure those
PRFAQs were as good as they could get.
that's now broken. People are spending
80% of their time on the last 20% of
quality
when the marginal value of that polish
is dropping quickly. And I want to be
careful here. I am not saying that good
thinking is going out of style. I am
saying that polish is becoming a way to
avoid getting your ideas rapidly in
touch with reality. Because before when
you needed to polish something, yeah,
maybe you overpolished. It was still
possible to do that, but at the end of
the day, what you were trying to do is
sharpen your ideas so you could derisk
execution. And that made sense. Now,
even a directionally correct, ambitious
idea is enough to get going, which means
that the value of shipping ugly is up
and the rough version that exists is
going to beat the polished version that
doesn't. and you can always improve on

[14:01]
doesn't. and you can always improve on
it. And by the way, I'm not saying that
consumers won't value polish. I think
there's a huge amount of money to be
made in polished UI for AI products. I
think we have a lot of rough edges on a
lot of our AI products. I use them a ton
and so I don't mind them, but I have no
illusions about the fact that we're
leaving billions of dollars in market
value on the table by not fully
polishing out our products because we're
shipping so fast. So take that as a
goal, something we need to iterate on.
But if you're getting started, if you're
trying to get there quickly, you just
got to ship and then you got to
relentlessly optimize from there. And
then you can polish as quickly as you
can. Which by the way, if you're
shipping fast, that path to polish looks
really nice. I think Notebook LM is a
great example here. They shipped, they
got into market, they saw reaction, and
they've been polishing that UI ever
since. Habit number three, meetings as a
default. Look, meetings are a function
of people and one of the consequences of
AI native teams is they tend to be

[15:01]
AI native teams is they tend to be
smaller and so you get less meetings.
But regardless of the size, the old
logic was that you would get alignment
before you got action. You would get
everybody in the room so we don't waste
expensive execution time building. You
want to talk it through that now takes
longer than building the prototype. An
hour of six people's time is 6 hours of
work. And that's often enough to just
build the thing. Meetings still feel
responsible, don't they? Meetings still
distribute accountability. If the
meeting decided something and it was
wrong, it's not our fault. The meeting
decided. And the worst part is this.
Meetings about what to build often don't
resolve what to build. They don't even
answer the question. They'll surface
opinions. They'll create action items
and they'll create delays. AI is
relentless about this. AI will show the
truth here. Just build it. You have the
time. Build it and show it. It might be
bad. It might be good, but just build
it. You can replace the meeting with a
product demo. In fact, maybe the next
time you schedule a meeting, just ask
yourself, what if I built the rough
version of this and showed people
instead? That's what a lot of these AI

[16:00]
instead? That's what a lot of these AI
native companies are doing. In fact,
that's one of the foundational build
principles that is animating the culture
of cursor right now. Cursor thinks a lot
about how code is a way of getting your
your ideas into contact with reality and
software. And one of the things that
they've talked about in interviews over
and over again is that they are about
taking some of the croft, some of the
extra, some of the planning that
protected execution out of work so that
everybody can just get in and like
designers can commit and product can
commit and engineering can commit and
you can see your ideas meet the code and
that saves meetings. Meetings are no
longer a default. Number four, I call
this structured waiting. I there may be
a better word. The old logic was that
coordination was important. Waiting for
feedback was important because again
you're wanting to protect execution time
and keep it aligned. Everyone's time is
precious. So you must respect the
process. Wait for feedback. Wait for the
sync. Wait for someone to unblock you.
So much of work in older larger
corporations is waiting. Waiting for

[17:00]
corporations is waiting. Waiting for
approval. Waiting for feedback. Waiting
for the next meeting for someone else to
do their part. But most of what you're
waiting for doesn't need to be waited
for. and you end up outsourcing your
momentum to other people's calendars.
So, I'm going to suggest that you just
stop waiting. Do the next thing while
you wait for feedback on the first
thing. Assume the answer is yes. This is
another example of where leaders need to
set the tone here because leaders need
to cast a vision large enough that their
teams always have something to work
against, do not have to get stuck
waiting and where they know that there's
space to get forgiveness later when
they're working in the correct
direction. And we have tried to drill
this in, if you're a leader, you've
often tried to drill this in as a habit
even before AI came along. But the cost
here is much larger because waiting an
hour in the 2010s was waiting an hour.
Waiting an hour now is waiting a
prototype. Like it's just much more
valuable. And so if you're blocked on a
decision, make a provisional decision

[18:00]
decision, make a provisional decision
now. Let people know what you picked and
keep moving and see what happens. But
get rid of structured waiting. Number
five, we've inverted planning and doing.
The old logic was very much measure
twice, cut once. Planning is cheap.
Execution is expensive. I actually had
that drilled into me when I was coming
up in product. I've watched people spend
a week writing a plan, right? I've
watched them spend two weeks. I've
watched people spend eight weeks writing
a plan at times. The plan ends up being
a hedge and it ends up being much more
expensive than the product will ever be.
And ironically, the plan is almost
always incorrect. It almost always never
survives contact with reality. It's a
truism in business. I'm just going to
tell you, look at the planning that
you're doing and see if you can cut the
planning down. See if you can cut it. I
don't know. Set a goal 90%. Can you cut
your planning down by 90%. You probably
can. See if you can replace that with
learning through prototyping. See if you
can replace that with a bold rough
direction and aggressively shipping and
optimizing for what works. If you
haven't built something in the last

[19:01]
haven't built something in the last
couple of weeks at work or maybe at home
if you're doing a home project, then
you're probably overplanning. Let
reality inform the plan instead of
trying to predict reality with the plan.
Because prediction, ironically,
prediction has now become expensive and
luxurious because execution and doing is
cheap and execution and doing is more
accurate and more reliable. Learning
from customers directly by launching is
more reliable. And so think about how
much you're planning and see if you can
cut it by 90%. I'm not kidding. See if
you can cut it down and see if you can
spend that energy on doing instead.
Number six, the deck instead of the
demo. That's an old habit, right? We
build consensus and we create a deck and
we make sure stakeholders can weigh in
and we we have we call them a walking
around deck. Does that ring a bell for
you? The deck shows what we want to
envision. It helps us to build uh
alignment with various stakeholders.
Sometimes we workshop that deck. Some I
remember having to pick the fonts on

[20:01]
remember having to pick the fonts on
that. Forget all of that. Build the
demo. Show it. Does it does this sound
like I'm beating the same drum? It
should build a working prototype and
show that instead of the deck. In some
senses, work is getting much simpler
now. All of the rituals that we prepared
as a hedge against execution are in
question. We should be asking if we need
them. Why not just do the work? Why not
just ship to customers? Habit number
seven, consensus before action. Get
everybody aligned. This is so deadly.
And I know organizations tried to push
on this by giving individual team
leaders autonomy. Amazon had their two
pizza teams. There were other versions
of that. The difference now is that the
cost of consensus has 10xed or 100xed.
If consensus was expensive before in the
2010s, it is priceless now. And
ironically, consensus often wasn't real
anyway. People would often agree in
meetings then undermine the decisions
later. But regardless, it is too
expensive now to practice the habit of

[21:02]
expensive now to practice the habit of
consent. Let consensus come from the
results that create alignment. Just try
things. And again, this is going to be a
leadership change as well as an
individual contributor change. Nobody is
exempt here. Leaders can't just say do
this and then leave it up to people. But
at the same time, if you're starting out
on your own and you listen to this video
and you're trying to set a new way of
working, you're going to need some
support from your manager and you're
going to need to be explicit about that.
I mean, you can share this video if you
want, but lead by doing. Lead by showing
that if you set an ambitious goal, if
you set a larger vision for the
business, you don't need to get
consensus. You can just act in that
direction and let results create
alignment over time. I tried X and
here's what happened is much more
persuasive than let's agree to try X.
Run the experiment first and then
everyone will align when you get the
data because people can see what

[22:01]
data because people can see what
actually works. And the thing is it's
never been faster. It's never been
faster to try that out. The last habit I
want to call out is the habit of
hoarding until ready. People who like to
not show work until it's complete. Who
think half finished work wastes other
people's time. I was told that when I
was a junior coming up. I was told,
"Don't submit this half-finish piece of
work. This isn't good enough to show
your manager yet. You need to finish it
all the way. Come on, Nate. What are you
doing?" Well, that is reversed. Now,
you're probably sitting on ideas and
drafts and prototypes until they feel
ready, which means you're getting
feedback late after you've invested in a
direction that might be incorrect.
Again,
this is a moment when we have to realize
that the costs of things are changing.
The cost of getting to a rapid version
is so cheap now. We just have to be
willing to show it. And that takes a
little bit of ego death on our part.
There's an ego component here. We have
to be willing to show some work that's a
little bit raw and unfinished. What if
people think it's bad? What if people

[23:01]
people think it's bad? What if people
think it doesn't work? Those are the
reactions that you need. What if you
ship that prototype to the customer and
they don't like it? Well, this is why we
ship a lot and now we have that
information. Finding out that you're
wrong a week from now is better than
finding out that you're wrong a month
from now. And frankly, this puts a
primacy on thinking clearly because one
thing that doesn't go away like half
finished work that is all AI slop and
that you didn't put any thought to is
going to show. In fact, it creates
downstream work for your colleagues. But
halffinish work where you put some
thought in, you have a direction you
want to go in and you just want some
feedback on it and you want to show a
quick prototype. That's different. Now
you're putting thought into what's good
or what's not. The through line here is
pretty simple. All these eight habits
are riskmanagement rituals that made
sense when doing was expensive. And
those unit economics have all flipped.
And now the risk isn't wasting anybody's

[24:00]
And now the risk isn't wasting anybody's
execution time, engineering or
otherwise. It's wasting time on anything
that isn't doing anything that isn't
building. The permission loop is costing
you more than the thing you're asking
permission for. You get the idea, right?
The polish costs more than shipping. Let
me give you a couple examples of how
this looks in practice. The old way
might be you have an idea for improving
a process internally. You write up a
proposal. You schedule a meeting. The
meeting surfaces questions. You update
the proposal. Maybe weeks later, you get
the approval to try a pilot. The new
way, you get an idea. You spend an
afternoon building a rough version. You
show three people, two of them have
concerns that killed the idea. Good, you
found out in a day rather than a month.
Or they like it and you go ahead and
iterate and pilot and launch from there.
The whole thing took x less time. Or the
old way, you're working on a
presentation for leadership. You spend a
week on the deck. You refine the
transitions. You words smmith the
messages. You anticipate the objection.
Leadership asks questions. Now you spend
maybe two hours, maybe 20 minutes on a
rough deck. You just want to get the
alignment. You send it to your boss.

[25:00]
alignment. You send it to your boss.
This is rough. Does the direction make
sense? She flags two problems you didn't
consider. You fixed them in 10 minutes
and the final deck took maybe an hour
and a half and it's actually better
because you got the feedback early. Stop
treating process as a prerequisite and
start treating iteration and trying to
get your ideas into contact with reality
as the process. The rough version is
going to be the gold standard because we
can get to it so much more quickly. Now,
there's a counterargument here I want to
call out. In some places, you're going
to hear quality matters in my domain. My
boss expects a plan. I'm going to get in
trouble if I just do things without
asking. That's fair. The habits I'm
describing have different impacts in
fields with high legal and compliance
risks. Let's say you're in medicine and
you have very high compliance risks. But
here's what I would ask. How much of the
process you're following is actually
required? And how much is it just the
way things have always been done in that
environment? And most of us when we're

[26:00]
environment? And most of us when we're
honest realize that we probably have
more latitude than we're using. And the
habits that feel mandatory are often
just the defaults that nobody has
questioned before. And so the risk feels
significant. But if we have our eye on
quality in those fields in medicine, in
law, in finance, then we are going to be
in line with compliance even if we get
there more quickly. And if you want a
place to start, pick the habit that I
suggested, one of the eight. Pick the
one that feels lowest stakes to you,
right? And just just break that habit.
Just give it a try. Try a simpler way to
do it. Maybe it's shipping something
without the usual polish. Maybe it's
skipping a meeting and instead of a
brainstorm, you just build the thing.
Maybe it's stopping waiting. You're
blocked on a decision. Instead of
waiting, you make the decision. You say,
"This is what I'm deciding." And you do
the work. My my goal is not to get you
to break rules here. My goal is to get
you to discover that the principle of AI
native work in AI is recognizing where

[27:01]
native work in AI is recognizing where
value is really coming from in your
work. It's not coming from protecting
execution anymore. It's coming from
doing the execution quickly and doing it
within a framework where you have the
ambition, the boldness to build
something really meaningful, to solve
meaningful customer problems, to do what
you need to do to deliver value. The
people who figure this out first are
going to be operating at a velocity that
feels a lot more like Anthropic, a lot
more like cursor and a lot less like a
traditional big company, right? You name
your big company. And it won't be
because they have better tools because
almost everybody is getting the fancy
tools now. It's because they will have
stopped doing the things that are no
longer worth doing in a world where
execution is cheap. And so they'll be
shipping while other people plan.
They'll be iterating while other people
align. They'll be learning while other
people polish. If we circle back to the
beginning of this video, I talked about
this idea that we live in a world of
chaos. And we need a simplifier. The

[28:00]
chaos. And we need a simplifier. The
chaos you're feeling is not random. It's
the gap between where the bottleneck has
moved and the habits you still have
today. When you close that gap, when you
start to align your work habits to how
AI actually changes scarcity in the
business to how AI enables execution and
you recognize where where there's other
scarcity in the business that needs your
business judgment, suddenly you're going
to know where to spend your time. You're
going to know why you need to move
faster and the chaos is going to start
making sense. You're going to understand
why meetings can't be the default
anymore. You're going to understand that
the next time someone ships a vibecoded
this or that, it's not just one more
piece of AI news. It's someone who
recognized that they needed to get their
idea into contact with reality quickly.
And you're going to recognize the truly
precious resources that are good for
your career and that help businesses
thrive are still going to be true in the
age of AI and are even more true now
when execution is cheap. Things like

[29:00]
when execution is cheap. Things like
clarity, like ambition, like
distribution. the bottlenecks that are
appearing and growing more and more
scarce as execution driven by AI gets
more and more pervasive. And so in a
world where we're going to get, I
guarantee it, another major AI release
tomorrow, worry less about what
execution is enabling a company to do,
and worry more about your ability to
shift your work habits and your ability
to practice getting your ideas into
contact with reality, solving real
customer problems, and shifting your
attention to the things that are
actually difficult to do, the things
that require good human judgment. It's
hard to get clear on things. It's hard
to be ambitious. We tend to think
smaller than we should. Distribution is
a hard thing to tackle. Most
entrepreneurs actually overindex on
product and underindex on go to market.
That's not new. But distribution is
exponentially more valuable now. So
that's my challenge to you. In a world

[30:00]
that's my challenge to you. In a world
that is chaotic, recognize that so much
of the chaos comes from being out of
sync with where AI is pushing scarcity
in your business. It feels out of sync
because AI is making execution so cheap
and everything is changing because of
that. Let's get that figured out and
things are going to start to get
smoother.
