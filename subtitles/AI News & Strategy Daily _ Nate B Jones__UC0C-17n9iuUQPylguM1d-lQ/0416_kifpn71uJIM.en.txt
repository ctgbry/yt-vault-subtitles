Identify one process. It needs to be
painful. It needs to be frequent. It
needs to be really well-defined with
good edges. Automate it all the way. Run
it. Obsess over it. Learn what breaks.
Fix the breaks. Only when it's mature,
sustainable, well doumented do you move
to the next process. The typical failure
pattern I see is the opposite. Teams
don't clearly define the pain. They
don't know where the edges are. They had
a seminar and the seminar said use AI
agents and they got all excited and they
try to automate everything at once. They
build giant sprawling workflows and it
touches multiple systems and it looks
incredible and on day one it all works
and they have a CEO announcement and
they're creating dependencies they don't
understand and when something breaks and
it always breaks plan for it to break.
They can't isolate the problem because
nobody can read the map anymore. Because
everyone's on to the next project.
