I spent more than 20 hours following AI
news so that I could get you these six
stories in less than 10 minutes. These
are the ones that mattered. OpenAI
launches the Atlas browser number one.
This was an MVP in public. We see the
OpenAI team aggressively collecting
feedback and prioritizing features and
going back and improving the product
already. I expect a lot more of that in
the future. What we're seeing is a team
that does not yet have a browser that is
as good as other AI powered browsers out
there. nevertheless shipping leveraging
OpenAI's install base to get rapid
feedback from lots and lots of people
and then using their quick ship ability
to improve and build on it. They say
they're using codecs a lot to build. I
expect rapid ships from the team to
improve this browser based on the
extensive feedback that they're getting.
One thing to keep in mind, there is an
advantage that OpenAI has here that they
are leveraging for this product and
others that nobody else has. They have
your chat GPT memories and they are
bringing that in for a personalized
browser experience and they'll be
bringing that into other relevant AI

bringing that into other relevant AI
products as you go forward. Another
example of that is the inapp experiences
that they have with chat GPT where you
can launch a app within an app that is
going to carry Shad GPT memories too. So
look for them to keep leaning into the
personalization angle across the product
surface going forward.
