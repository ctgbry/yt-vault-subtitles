Lies travel faster than truth and Reddit
lies travel fastest of all. There's a
Reddit lie out there that Chad GPT
cannot help you anymore with legal and
medical advice. This is simply not true.
In fact, it never was true. The only
thing that actually happened is that
OpenAI made a minor change to their
terms of service intended to govern
liability with lawyers and with doctors.
And someone on Reddit dramatically,
perhaps intentionally, misinterpreted
that and created a viral misinformation
campaign that is spreading all over the
internet right now, falsely claiming
that Chat GPT will no longer give people
legal or medical advice. I have people
in my DMs threatening to cancel their
OpenAI subscriptions. It is completely
ridiculous. It is entirely unnecessary
and it is a good example of why anytime
you see a headline about AI if you can
test it, if you can check it because
that's what I did. I went straight to
chat GPT and I just tested it and it
turns out I get legal advice and medical
advice the same as I always did. Nothing
changed. Anyway, I actually, ironically

changed. Anyway, I actually, ironically
enough, I swear I didn't plan this. I
wrote an article about how to use chat
GPT in medical and legal situations for
today, including a prompt pack. The
prompt pack still works. It's still
super effective. It's a smart way to
approach really complicated, highstake
stuff. It can save you thousands of
dollars if you're in a nasty situation.
And I have a real story of how someone
did that and saved $160,000. Very fun.
But please just don't believe internet
rumors, especially if they come from
Reddit. Reddit is not a good place to
get your news from. And I wish the
people who reported the news would
bother to check their own AI instances
before doing so because it's really
disrespectful to the rest of us to
spread rumors like this and I'm really
tired of
