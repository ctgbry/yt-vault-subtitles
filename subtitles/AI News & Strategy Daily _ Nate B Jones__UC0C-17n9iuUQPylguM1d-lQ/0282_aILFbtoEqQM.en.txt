Something like 90% of the Fortune 500
has copilot. 90%. That's why this is
such an important video. That's why I've
taken my time on it. It's got to be
correct. Microsoft's own data though
shows that most people aren't using the
full capability set of Copilot. Now
look, if you're not using the full
capability set of Microsoft Word, which
I know I don't, that's okay. It's
Microsoft Word. It's there to help you
type stuff. But if you're not using the
full capability set of co-pilot, it's a
big deal because co-pilot is literally
intelligence on tap. And so if your
workforce isn't using it, if your teams
don't feel good about using it for
things that are more than email, you're
the ones missing out. Companies are
literally paying for a Ferrari and they
are driving it to the grocery store in
first gear. That is what is going on
with Copilot.
