The fourth way, the AI way attacks that
bottleneck, but we don't talk about it
that way. So, I want to talk about it
here. You need to separate your
expertise in whatever domain you're in
from documentation. And so, instead of
viewing it as I need to write up this
whole thing, look at it as here's an
example from the HVAC contractor, right?
Five minute voice memo on the site. You
capture the context walking through
looking at the HVAC unit. Then tell the
AI, "Turn this into a professional
estimate. no jargon. Please emphasize
comfort and energy savings because
that's what the client really emphasized
to me. And then she goes on about her
work, right? She goes drives to the next
job site and she can review the output
on a mobile phone in the car, add in any
adjustment she has to pricing, upload a
couple of photos. It takes just a few
minutes and she may multiply her ability
to generate estimates by five as a
result. That's the breakthrough. That's
the fourth way. Now, let me get to the
principles that underly this because not
everybody here is going to be an HVAC
contractor. Not everybody's a lawyer or

contractor. Not everybody's a lawyer or
a doctor. What are the principles that
we can scale to whether we work in tech
or not in tech that help us think about
expertise differently? Number one,
expertise compounds and documentation
erodess or doesn't compound.
