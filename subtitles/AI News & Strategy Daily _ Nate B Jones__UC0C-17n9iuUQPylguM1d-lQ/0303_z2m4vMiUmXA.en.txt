I got my start in a job that AI has
changed dramatically already, right? I
was doing nonprofit grant management. AI
can do a lot of the work that I was
doing at the push of a button. Then I
went over to Oracle eyes store
management and conversion optimization.
Conversion optimization doesn't exist as
a job anymore. AI took it away. And eyes
store I mean who has Oracle eyes store
anymore? I'm sure there someone's going
to come up and say I have Oracle eyesore
after this but most people don't. And
then I went and did marketing and I
looked at marketing attribution systems.
Again, another area where AI has taken a
lot of the work away. I looked at voice
of customer, almost totally automated by
AI now. And what's funny as I say all of
those things is that even though AI has
made huge strides, we still have people
who are grant fund managers.
