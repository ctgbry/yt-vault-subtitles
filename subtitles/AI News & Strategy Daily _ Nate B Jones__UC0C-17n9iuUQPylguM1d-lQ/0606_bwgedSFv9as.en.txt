The window is getting compressed.
Amplitude launched a free AI visibility
tooling that's blowing up. You can use
it as an individual. You can use it as a
brand. It's completely free. I don't
know how long it's going to be free, but
it's free for now. And most people
think, you know, that's another
analytics product. But what they're
missing is that this is the first time a
major platform has given away
measurement infrastructure for free in
an effort to define the terms of the
debate. And so what they're signaling is
GEO is going mainstream. Everybody needs
to be aware of it. We're gonna make it
free and you are going to be able to get
not only your score, but by the way, you
can look up any brand on there for free
right now. I can look up Nike for free.
And so if you want to look at any brand
in the world or you want to look at your
buddy who you think is doing very well,
fine, you can do it. And Amplitude will
write you a free report. It's a really
cool nugget. And the pattern is very
similar to when Google Analytics
launched, right? They made it free. And
once defining the measurement standard

once defining the measurement standard
became the property of that brand. So
Google Analytics effectively defined the
measurement standard and became the
Kleenex of measurement on the web.
Adoption starts to accelerate and you
find ways to monetize down the line.
That's the strategy Amplitude is is
using. They're using the Google Analytic
strategy here. The strategic implication
is that the playbook that I'm sharing is
not going to stay secret for long once
there are easy ways to measure it. And
so I do worry that this 12 to 18month
window is one that gets shorter and
shorter and shorter as more of these
tools come
