Now Grock is enabled with this new
system prompt. So toxic content appears
on X because it always does. That's not
new. The auto rag begins to pull it in
and the system rules are different now.
There's absolutely no filtering at all
going on. The system prompt is
instructing Grock to say politically
incorrect is fine. So it starts to look
at this stuff and say ah it's
politically incorrect. That must be
fine. There's a prompt engineering
failure there. There's no
pre-publication review on Grock as
anyone who's used X knows. is you can
just say at Grock please answer and
until yesterday it would it would just
automatically answer and they resorted
to deleting later as a way of dealing
with egregious examples of
misinformation. And so Grock began
direct posting to the platform and we
have a cascade failure situation.
Multiple systems failed in sequence and
each failure increased the consequences
of the subsequent failure.
