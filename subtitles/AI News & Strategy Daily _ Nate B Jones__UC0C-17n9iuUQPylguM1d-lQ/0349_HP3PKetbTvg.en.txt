We need to get a lot more comfortable
with uncertainty and LLMs. LLMs are
wonderful analysis tools. We need to
take that analysis, own the decision,
and own the consequences of that
decision. That is going to give us much,
much better results. It enables us to
harness the incredible power for
processing tokens that LLMs put at our
fingertips and not reduce all of that
power down to just one decision. You
actually want all of that power on
exploring optionality. And the prompts
that I've developed for finance as a way
of exploring this do just that. And you
can get them on the Substack and you can
run them yourself and you can see
they're designed to unlock analysis for
various specific financial scenarios.
But I didn't stop there. I thought it
really has more bite to it if I actually
run a live experiment.
