this moment you have a chance to build
software that would not be possible to
build two years ago, one year ago. And
what I mean by that is that software has
been a hammer instead of a scalpel for a
long, long time. We now have the ability
to treat software like a scalpel. And so
we can carve out these micro niches and
build really sustainable side businesses
where we are the authority on that
particular tiny corner of the universe
for that particular kind of customized
software. It has never been possible
before.
