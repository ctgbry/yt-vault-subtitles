What about web browsers? So, I am really
torn on this one. My general purpose web
browser remains Comet. So, I'm using
Comet a lot. I use it and I like the
data ins and outs it has. I'm
particularly fond of its ability to do
generative you. So, if I'm sending a
message in LinkedIn, it will literally
generate a message pane for me and let
me approve a message I send and all of
that. That's great. And it has data ins
and outs to a few places uh including
LinkedIn where it's very easy for me to
not have to go. I got to be honest, I
don't love LinkedIn. and I don't like to
be there. Having a data in and out where
I don't have to interact with the site
is fantastic for me. But beyond that,
it's very useful because it combines
perplexity search powers with an agentic
browser. And so it's easy for me to get
a chat next to the browser to understand
what the page is doing, to ask for the
to do other things off page for me,
which I find really useful, and to keep
the power of perplexity in the meantime.
And that's actually a use case that I I
don't know about you, but I like the
idea of the agent going off and doing
things for me. And comet really sort of
fulfills
