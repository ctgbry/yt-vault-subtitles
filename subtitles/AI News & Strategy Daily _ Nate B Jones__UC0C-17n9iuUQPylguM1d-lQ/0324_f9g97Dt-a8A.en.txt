Recently, in the last year or so,
they've been able to read Excel.
Outputting Excel is still sketchy. If I
go to 03 and I say, "Hey, 03, make me an
Excel." Doesn't go very well. It doesn't
know how to like write formulas down.
But the problem is this. There is a
difference between being able to build a
simple four or five tab spreadsheet, I
don't know, a dozen rows of information,
a dozen columns of information on each
tab, and being able to tackle the
multi-,000 row spreadsheet from hell
that keeps most marketing teams going.
I've had to maintain that spreadsheet. I
know what they're like. I would not give
that to this tool. It would be like the
intern ordering the cupcakes, but worse,
because then you don't know how to back
up. There is no undo function on what
operator is
