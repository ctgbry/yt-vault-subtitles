Prompts are thinking tools. They are
thinking tools that you give to a
thinking machine. They're not really
delegation tools. They structure your
thought as much as the AI's. Chad GPT5
should not replace your thinking. It
should amplify it. That's something I
emphasize over and over on this channel.
Number two, good prompts teach by
directionality. You learn how the model
thinks while you teach it how you think.
This is actually symbiosis. You are
learning how to work with the model and
the model is learning how you think.
Welcome to the weird new world we live
in. Number three, specificity is
liberating. It's counterintuitive, but
the tighter your constraints, the more
specific you are about your output, the
more you're going to be able to get what
you want in your creative vision.
