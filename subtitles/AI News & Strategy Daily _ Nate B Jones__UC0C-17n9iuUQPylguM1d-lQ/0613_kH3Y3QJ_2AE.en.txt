So if you are getting started in your
career, let's say you're in your first 3
years, maybe your first 5 years, the
thing that you need to hear that most
companies won't tell you is that you are
in one of two camps. Either you are
going to be treasured because you are
considered fresh blood and creative and
you work really hard, or you're going to
be on the chopping block. And I know a
lot of folks out there who think they're
on the chopping block already, not
because the company's told them, but
because they've heard it on TikTok. The
reality is that the chopping block
happens because the company can't see
the value that you bring to the table.
And so the non-obvious piece here, the
thing that we don't talk about is how as
a junior you were able to show
problem-olving ability that makes the
company recognize you can't just do this
with chat GPT. And the trick is you kind
of have to make it up as a junior to
earn that in a lot of companies because

earn that in a lot of companies because
most companies frame junior level tasks
as produce this document, produce this
analysis, run this cash flow statement.
They're not framing them as challenging
tasks. And so they're opening the door
for you to be thinking about your work
as if it's AI replaceable. But it's not
if you actually understand what you're
doing. If you're actually given the
chance to do problem solving, you won't
look as AI replaceable.
