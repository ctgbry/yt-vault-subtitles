If you look over at the codec side, this
is going to give you what automation
boundaries mean. Which step steps say
automatic? Where should humans get
involved? Again, this is something you
could explain to a non-technical CEO and
they would understand what you mean.
Codex is able to efficiently ladder up
strategic decisions and strategic
thinking in a way, yeah, see Claude Co
just did that, but Codex is able to lad
up in a way that's really accessible.
And Claude Co comes back and it's gosh,
it's so long, right? I asked it to write
concisely and it did ladder it up
non-technically. It's harder to read.
It's longer. It gives you its opinion on
risks in a way that's not super clear.
This is so much better. Can the system
think with me on a hard technical
problem in a way that is easy for me to
understand, that is legible, that is
intelligible, that I can share with
others? The answer is that Codeex could
absolutely keep up and I love it. And
Claude code is just not there right now.

Claude code is just not there right now.
And it's it's not close, guys.
