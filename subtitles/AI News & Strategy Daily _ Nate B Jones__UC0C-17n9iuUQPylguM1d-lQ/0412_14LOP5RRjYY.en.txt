It's dangerous in the sense that I see
time after time after time in real world
situations where I talk with people
passionate about agents that NAD is the
thing that burned them out because it
was so accessible they felt like they
could be non-programmers and not pay

principles. Please recognize that you
are building real software and follow
good principles. Make sure you emphasize
simplicity. Separate concerns. Focus on
maintainability. Focus on readability.
Get your documentation done. Work with
an LLM. Solve a problem that's well
bounded.
