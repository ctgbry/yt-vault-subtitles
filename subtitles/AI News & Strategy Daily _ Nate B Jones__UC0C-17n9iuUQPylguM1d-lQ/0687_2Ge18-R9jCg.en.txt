Okay, first what is Nano Banana Pro? It
is a visual reasoning model. It is not
your old SCA style dusion model. It is a
system that understands layout. It
understands structure. It understands
diagrams. It understands typography data
brand grammar style universes. It's
effectively it's a layout engine with a
diagram engine with a data visualization
engine and a style engine all inside one
model. It is capable of generating
finished visual artifacts in one shot.
Dashboards, diagrams, editorial spreads,
blueprints. It treats text and image and
charts as inputs and they're all
co-equal and they're all composable
elements. It can separate really dense
multiconstraint prompts into an orderly
fashion and execute on them without
collapse. It sort of functions as if
Tableau and Inesign and Figma all had a
baby. I want to lay out what I call the
key breakthroughs of Nano Banana. And
I'm going to describe them as engines
because they are driving the results

because they are driving the results
that we see. But I do not know what the
technical breakthrough is for this
