We continue to need to rethink what AI
is capable of doing every couple of
months. People wonder why I can still
find material, still be able to keep
talking about AI. Guys, today is why we
still have so much to learn about how to
use these models in practical workflows,
how to integrate these models, when do
we call multiple models, do you need the
smartest model, when do you use Gemini
3? And every time we advance the
stateofthe-art, which is what Gemini 3
did today, we expand the surface area of
possible workflows that we can cover
with AI. And today that expanded by a
really meaningful margin. And so when
you are thinking about what AI can do, I
want to encourage you to think about it
in terms of a trajectory. you are
understanding AI today as a particular
area that AI can cover of your work or
of workflows that you're trying to
build. Assume it will get better. I keep
saying this and I know you can't predict
it to the day, but it will get better.

it to the day, but it will get better.
AI will continue to cover more
workflows.
