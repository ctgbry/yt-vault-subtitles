Tenable research discovered that it is
possible for you to do a search for a
given topic for chat GPT to trigger an
internet search based on the text you
input and for that internet search to
turn up a poisoned page. What do I mean?
A page that has been deliberately played
and designed to rank highly for a
particular topic and then search GPT
which is the agent chat GPT uses to
search the internet will find that page
because you asked for that topic pull
that page's context inside chat GPT to
process it for you and suffer a prompt
injection attack. In the research
Tennibal conducted, they discovered that
that was good enough that it was able to
successfully pull all of your chat GPT
history and silently send it to an
attacker. Now, this hasn't been
documented in the wild, but it is a real
vulnerability, and we have not seen a
published fix from OpenAI yet. Story
number two, Salesforce surveyed more
than 6,000 data and analytics leaders
globally, and 84% of them say that their
data strategies need a complete

data strategies need a complete
overhaul, quote unquote, before they can
figure out how to get AI working. How do
you read that? Fundamentally, what
leaders are finally coming to is what I
have been banging the drum on for
months. You cannot have solid agentic AI
strategies at a business level if you do
not get your data architecture figured
out. There is no shortcuts. Traditional
data warehouses, for example, assume you
can copy data to a central location,
clean it, and analyze it. But Agentic AI
needs real-time access to source systems
because agents can't wait for overnight
ETL jobs. That's just one tiny example.
There's so many others. So yes, I think
they're right and there is a huge
opportunity ahead
