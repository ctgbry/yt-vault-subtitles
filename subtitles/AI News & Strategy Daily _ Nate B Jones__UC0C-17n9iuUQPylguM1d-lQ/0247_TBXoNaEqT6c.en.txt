Number four. Number four. Ha. Structured
output is a baseline. So stop asking
just for thoughts. Demand scorecards.
Ask for matrices. Ask for tables if
you're in 03. I'm just kidding. It will
give you tables anyway. Ask for phased
plans. Ask for structured outputs in
your document. Whatever it is. The more
specificity you give in the output, the
more it's going to give you what you are
looking for. I don't think this is
necessarily new. We've started to talk
about this for a while, but we haven't
put it in the context of GPT5. GPT5 is
going to reinforce the value of those
best practice prompt architectures.
Let's look at prompt designs. You need
to have an interrogative principle. The
best prompts expect the model to ask
questions. I would assume GPT5 will take
some of what OpenAI practiced in deep
research and we'll ask questions.
