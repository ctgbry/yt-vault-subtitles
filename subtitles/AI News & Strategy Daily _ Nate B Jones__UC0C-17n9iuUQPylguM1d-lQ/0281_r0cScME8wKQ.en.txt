Take take a task like a blog post. Let's
say you're you know back in Nate's
former chair. You're you're a marketer.
We need to write a blog post about
sustainable packaging. You can just say,
"Hey, give me five trends in sustainable
packaging. Give me a sentence each.
Okay, great. Now create a detailed
outline for a thousandword article.
Okay, great. Write the first paragraph.
Help me see your hook. Okay, let's twe
twe tweak it. Tweak it. Okay, now I like
it. Write section one. Write section
two." You're going to be done with that
blog post in 15 minutes versus two
hours. Traditionally, it's a huge
savings for SEO type document creation.
I will hasten to add it is extremely
good at document creation, which may
lead you to think it is extremely good
at strategy. Those are different things.
If you want a good strategic partner,
that is not the workflow to go through.
You still need to bring your brain if
you were doing strategic thinking.
