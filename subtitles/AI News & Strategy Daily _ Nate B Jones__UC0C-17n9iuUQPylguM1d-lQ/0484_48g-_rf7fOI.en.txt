Chat GPT launched an absolutely terrible
resource for prompting and I think it
deserves more attention because we need
to talk about how bad AI education is
today. They're terrible prompts, guys.
They're like one or two line prompts
that are extremely generic. We need to
help people to understand principles
that can scale. If you're going to give
people simple prompts, maybe that's all
right as long as they understand one,
this is just the start and you need to
do better. And two, this is how it ties
to your workflow and moves things
forward. And three, these are the
principles that scale with it. Like if
they had taken the time to say from
their own best practices, if OpenAI had
taken the time to say it's really
important to establish context for the
prompt, having a goal for the prompt is
important. Look how we're doing that
even in a simple prompt, right? Like
that's helpful. That helps you to
internalize these principles. If you
don't do that, you're going to be stuck
thinking that you understand prompting
and AI and you're going to get left
behind in 2026. We don't want that. We
need better prompt education.
