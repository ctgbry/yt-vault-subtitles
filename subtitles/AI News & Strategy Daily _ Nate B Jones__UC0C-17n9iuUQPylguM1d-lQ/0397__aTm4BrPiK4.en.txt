progress is demonstrabably continuing at
exponential rates. We have in any
benchmark that is not saturated is
showing continued strong gains. I think
my favorite is MER right now because it
just doesn't have a top. All it does is
it measures how long a task takes a good
human and then it says can an AI do it
50% of the time. Now, I'm the first one
to say 50% is a low bar, but at least
it's a consistent bar. And we keep
showing exponential gains on that as a
use cases get stronger. And we're not
bottoming out. That's not slowing down.
We keep doubling every few months.
Number fourth, we are still
underallocated on chips. In in the same
interviews that got blown up around the
world around AI and bubbles, Sam
admitted he could release a smarter
model, but he lacks the chips to do it.
Anthropic is also famously
underallocated on chips. Everyone's
using them for coding and they just
can't get enough chips.
