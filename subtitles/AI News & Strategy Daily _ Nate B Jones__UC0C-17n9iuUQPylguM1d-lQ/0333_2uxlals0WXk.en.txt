And I think one of the things that makes
the tech community that is too bullish
on AI unloved and incredibly annoying to
other people is the sense from the rest
of the world that they just think AI is
the way forward. I saw Flame Wars on X
which well that's where you go right
that's what you get. But I saw Flame
Wars on X where people in tech were
basically saying none of you get it.
This is the way AI is going to run the
world. None of you deserve jobs. AI is
just going to do all your jobs for you.
One, that's not a way to make friends
and that's not a way to, you know, get
your technology adopted and two, it's
not even reasonable. We are in a world
where it may be possible that AI has a
gold on the International Math Olympiad,
but also can't really play Mario Kart
properly. My kids may be better at Mario
Kart than AI right
