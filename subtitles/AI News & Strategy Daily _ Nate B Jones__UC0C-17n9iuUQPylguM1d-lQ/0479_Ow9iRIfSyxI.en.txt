Lovable provides digital leverage. It
provides the ability to code to anyone
who wants to at a simple architectural
level. It's not going to give you as
much flexibility as you would have if
you were in claude code or if you were
in codeex as an engineer, but for most
people, they don't need that. It's sort
of like the difference between cooking
at home and going to the restaurant. If
you want to go to the restaurant and you
want to order from a chef, that's great.
You don't have to cook at that level at
home. We have been missing the
equivalent of home cooking and software.
We now have it. And the reason I'm
talking about lovable specifically
instead of about the whole family of
vibe coding apps is that lovable has
distinguished itself very rapidly in a
crowded field by shipping quickly and
obsessing over value to vibe coders.
