This test is the thing that showed me
that this model cares more about how you
drive it than any other model previously
because I ran this same test on clawed
code. I ran it on 03. I ran it on 03 Pro
and I ran it on chat GPT5 and not just
one chat GPT5 either. I ran it on chat
GPT5 vanilla. I ran it on chat GPT
telling it in the prompt to think hard.
I ran it on chat GPT5 clicking the
button think hard and I even ran it on
chat GPT pro and you know what you would
not believe at GPT5 vanilla with no
think hard got the lowest score of the
lot. It was lower than 03. It was lower
than 03 pro. It was lower than cloud
code and all the other chat GPT5
responses. In other words, that GPT5 was
both the best and the worst response in
the
