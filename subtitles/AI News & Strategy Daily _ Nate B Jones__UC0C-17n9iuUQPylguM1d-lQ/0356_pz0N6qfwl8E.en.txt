They know their domain. They're not
afraid to use it and deeply wrap it into
AI. Number two, they have distribution.
They have figured out how to build
relationships in the book of business.
And this sounds self-fulfilling, but I
don't think it is. I think that
distribution is one of those things that
consultants are able to achieve when
they are able to demonstrate
disproportionate value even to one
customer to start and they generate word
of mouth and referral. So distribution
does matter as a marker of authenticity
and a marker of good work especially if
you can maintain and grow that
distribution in the age of AI. They are
clearly differentiated clearly
differentiated from other work and
having your own domain helps with that
but so does explaining how you engage
differently. Otherwise, you're just
going to wash into the background of the
hundreds of thousands of other AI
consultants.
