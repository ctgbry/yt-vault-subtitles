The reality is that we we have to
recognize that engineering is what
enables us to take this wild world where
LLMs can speak language and where
they're probabilistic and where they can
bring intelligence to bear. Engineers
help wrestle that into an operational
stable production system. They help to
bring observability to those systems.
They help to debug those systems. They
help to figure out the energy and
compute footprint that's appropriate for
those systems. And engineers ultimately
are cultural architects. They help us to
design workflows that preserve human
judgment. They help us to build
interfaces that make AI reasoning
inspectable. They help us to prevent
automation bias and skill atrophy if
they're designing systems well.
Ultimately, they help us maintain
dignity because they can build systems
that have to admit ignorance. Engineers
have more responsibility now, not
