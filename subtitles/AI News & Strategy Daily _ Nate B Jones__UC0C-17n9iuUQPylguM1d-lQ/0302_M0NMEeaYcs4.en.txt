And I share that because that feels like
that's a conversation many of us who are
interested in AI, who are passionate
about AI need to be having with those
around us. I see the poll results. I see
that AI is not trusted. There are a lot
of joshes in this world. It makes sense
that they may not trust AI. I don't
blame them. It's kind of rational. But
in that world, we have to be the ones,
we who are interested in AI have to be
the ones who are able to sit down and
invite a conversation about how all of
our dreams are changing because of AI.
That's not something that anybody is
immune to. And so besides telling Josh's
story, I'll tell my own story a little
bit. I got my start in a job that AI has
changed dramatically already, right? I
was doing nonprofit grant management.
