I've put together six different levels
of actual spectrum AI assistance here
from the very basic chatbot all the way
through to agent. I have had experience
working on projects for all of them. I'm
dividing it into six because it's easy
to remember. We've got handy little
labels for each of them so you can
remember them and I'm going to give you
real examples for each of them. The goal
here is for you to come out with a sense
of how to shape a solution with AI to a
problem so you are not overinvesting. So
when your CEO comes and says, you know,
I was reading on LinkedIn, this guy Nate
was talking about agents. We should do
agents. No, no, you should actually
think through your problem space. You
can share this video with him if he gets
if he gets too excited.
