He was part of the Alph Go project which
built at Google an AI system that could
play Go, which is a game that is harder
to play than chess. And there's an
infamous story, if you're familiar with
the history of AI, called Move 37. And
Julian talks about it because it's
important for us today. So, at the time,
Alph Go was trying to learn to beat the
best human players, and it had not done
so. And then at one point in a real life
game with a real life go master, it
played a 37th move that was considered a
mistake by all of the commentators. It
violated basic strategy and everyone
thought it was a disaster. But later as
the game progressed, the masters
realized that Alph Go understood the
game on a level they didn't and it was
something that led to the win the the
game being won. And the masters then
realized that actually the move 37 was
brilliant. And so Julian talks about
this and this idea of a move 37. And
what he suggests is that as we start to
extend the length of time agents can do

extend the length of time agents can do
work, the amount of useful work they can
do, we are going to get to a point where
there's a move 37 moment uh for AI. And
we don't know what that will be going in
where we inherently can't. But it is
something
that we need to be prepared for. We need
to expect something like maybe a Nobel
Prize scientific breakthrough in 2027,
2028, somewhere in there, where AI can
search a solution space faster and more
effectively than human intuition. And we
get something that would not have been
possible at all.
