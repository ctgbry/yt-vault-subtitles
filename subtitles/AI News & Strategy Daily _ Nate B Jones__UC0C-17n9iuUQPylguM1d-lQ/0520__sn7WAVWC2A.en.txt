I think that one of the things we're
really missing is a return to anchoring
on a steady sense of the future because
AI has felt so uncertain. And one of the
things I'm grateful for that I wish
people would talk about more is that
Andre sees a steady sense of the future.
Andre is not panicking. Andre is
actually seeing the problem of agents as
a really hard one that's going to take a
long time to think through and solve
properly. I'm looking at it as a builder
and saying for this tiny piece of the
world where we already have agents, wow,
we have a lot we have to do
architecturally to build well. But the
good news is Andre is saying you've got
runway to do that. You can build well
now. Continuity over rupture. That is a
discipline you can practice.
