Chat GPT 5.1 has two brains, instant and
thinking. Now, you might think this was
already true with chat GPT5, but it's
much more true with 5.1. So, chat GPT
5.1 comes in two main variants. Instant
is the default fast model and thinking
is the advanced reasoning model.
Thinking adapts how long it thinks,
faster for simple tasks or a much more
persistent long train of thought for
complicated tasks. I've already noticed
that just playing around with it in the
chat and it's even more prevalent in the
API. Developers are also now able to set
reasoning effort to none, which
effectively turns 5.1 into a pure
non-reasoning model for very low latency
use cases. Simple requests in practice
are going to feel snappier than full
thinking mode, but still smart. And
harder questions are going to trigger
visibly longer thinking. For non tech,
you no longer have to guess why the
model is slow. You can use the quick
model for day-to-day stuff and it will
be good. Emails, summaries, simple
exploration. And you only need to switch

exploration. And you only need to switch
to the thinking model if you want to
really wrestle with a big decision, a
complicated document, really confusing
data. You have that power and it's going
to feel more like a skateboard where you
are writing either a lot of power at the
top and there's a long thinking
parameter or it will very quickly drop
off to instant.
