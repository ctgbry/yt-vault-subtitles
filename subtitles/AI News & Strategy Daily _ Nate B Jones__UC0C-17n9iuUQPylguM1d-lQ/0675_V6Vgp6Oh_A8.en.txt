So where will AI actually reshape your
job? Keeping all of that in mind.
Fundamentally, you need to think of your
job as a stack of workflows. Your job is
going to be decomposed and you need to
take charge of what that looks like. So
don't think of it as doing marketing.
Think of it as you run campaigns, you
create briefs, you analyze performance,
you manage stakeholders. Those are
workflows. You don't do product
management. Instead, you collect
requirements, you prioritize, you write
specs, you coordinate launches.
Workflows. Again, you don't do finance.
Instead, you reconcile, you forecast,
you analyze variance, you produce
reports, again, workflows. Each of these
can be decomposed into triggers, what
starts the work, inputs, what you look
at, transformations, what do you do with
it, decisions, outputs, and checks to
know if it's correct. AI slots into a
structure like that. AI will handle the
boring and repetitive parts of those
workflows. It is up to you to figure out
how that actually shapes in your role.
Across industries, the same categories
keep getting automated or heavily
assisted. Triage tasks, routing tasks,

assisted. Triage tasks, routing tasks,
summarization tasks, synthesis tasks,
policy and rule tasks, repetitive
document workflows like pulling data
from forms, glue work across tools,
moving information from Excel into Word
or vice versa. You know, the parts that
stay human for a long time to come are
parts around negotiation, around trust
building, around politics, around
deciding which problems to solve, around
setting strategy, around being
accountable when things go wrong. So, I
don't want you to hear Nate is proposing
that I AI away my job. I want you to
hear that AI drains repetitive and
checkable work out of your role. You
should be in charge of what that looks
like or someone else will do it for you.
And your value is going to shift toward
defining workflows. Supervising them,
handling exceptions, choosing what to
build.
