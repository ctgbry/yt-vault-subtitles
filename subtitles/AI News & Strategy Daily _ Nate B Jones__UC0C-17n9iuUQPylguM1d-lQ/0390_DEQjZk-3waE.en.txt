I'm going to keep exploring how chat
GPT5 works because this is a model that
is incredibly important in the world
right now because it's now the only
model that hundreds of millions of
people are using every week and it is a
complex model to use. My early
impressions are that this takes more
effort and more thinking and more
deliberate intention to use really
really well even if the default feels
kind of smart to some people. So the
default may feel cold but it can feel
kind of smart enough to some people and
I've seen that in my comments as well.
If you want to use it for extraordinary
work, which this model is capable of,
I've tested it. It does incredible work.
And I will do some more demos later this
week that sort of show that you need to
be ready to put in extra work versus
what you would have had to do with 03 or
with 03 Pro or with Cloud4 Opus. And you
might be like, is it worth it? Is the
extra work worth it? The answer is yes.
