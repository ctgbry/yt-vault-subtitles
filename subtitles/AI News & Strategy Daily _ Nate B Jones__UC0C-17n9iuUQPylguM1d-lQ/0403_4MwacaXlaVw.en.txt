AI tools, I would argue, create a
multiplier effect for trained engineers
more more than they create
democratization of code. And I know they
democratize code. I know people who have
never coded before who are able to do
some coding. Now,
engineers can do even more. Engineers
can compress their expertise to carry
architectural intent much more easily
than non-engineers because they
understand the underlying technical
systems. Non-engineers, frankly, when
they get the chatbot and they get the
ability to vibe code, I've seen them
build stuff, but I've also seen them
very frequently get just enough rope to
hang themselves. Engineers understand
those limitations that uh coding brings.
They understand how to read code, they
understand how the system components
work together, and they're able to go
faster as a result. If the non-engineers
get rope to hang themselves, the
engineers get rocket fuel. So the
digital divide is shifting very rapidly
from who can code to who can engineer.
