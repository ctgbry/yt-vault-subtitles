July 14th, Monday, Cognition Labs, the
makers of Devon, announced an
acquisition of the remaining parts of
Windsurf. This includes their IP, their
product, their trademark, their brand,
their training data, and all remaining
250 employees. The key difference here
is there is 100% employee financial
participation, full vesting,
acceleration, and wave cliffs. In other
words, Cognition Labs saw what Google
did and said, "We have an opportunity to
step in as the good guy here. We can be
the good guy. We will acquire Windsurf.
We will bring everybody aboard. It
doesn't matter whether you vested or
not. If you've worked less than a year
or not, which by the way, when you're in
a startup and it's hiring like on a
power law like this, most of your
employees by definition are less than a
year in because you're hiring so fast.
So, I would expect for most of these
employees, waving the cliff was a big
deal. Essentially, Cognition Labs makes
them whole where Google screwed them
over. And it's a nice move for them
because they're basically saying, "We
have an agentic developer in Devon. Now
we have tools for development
environment in windsurf.
