OpenAI completed a study called GDP VAL
this week that actually tests major AI
models against economically useful work
tasks. Now, before you run away with the
wrong headline here, this is not the
same as saying it's testing major model
makers against economically useful jobs.
These are very very limited tasks where
the context is prepared by an expert in
a neat little package and then an expert
prepares a gold standard solution and
then the major model makers run their
models against the problem space and see
how their result compares to that gold
standard in a blind evaluation. Fine.
It's not real work in the sense that
it's not as messy, but it is real work
in the sense that the tasks are real and
designed by experts in the field. That
being said, OpenAI sponsored all of this
and set it up and ran it and even they
admit that Opus 4.1 from Enthropic is
better at doing that kind of
economically useful work than any of
Chat GPT's models, which is a huge

endorsement for Opus 4.1 and the
Enthropic team and one that I personally
