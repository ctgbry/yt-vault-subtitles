So when you search how to break into AI
in that world, you get one of two
extremes. You get let's learn Python in
30 days and become an ML engineer. Lots
of lots of that. Or you get a little bit
of gatekeeping like you need to be a PhD
from Stanford or you need to get into Y
Combinator, you need to found your own
startup. Both of these are suboptimal
because they only apply to a very narrow
subsegment of the overall population. If
you look at the overall number of people
interested in AI roles, not very many of
them are going to be learning Python in
30 days. And nobody talks about it as if
AI is not a single career path but a but
a wild maze of career paths that's
developing. And I want to start talking
about it like that because that's how it
actually is. Right now when people say
how do I break into AI, it's sort of
like a chef hearing, how do I break into
food? I mean that's a pretty general
statement. Do you do you want to cook?
Do you want to do front of the house?
You want to do back of the house? You
want to get into investing and owning
restaurants? Uh, do you want to just be
a taste maker?
