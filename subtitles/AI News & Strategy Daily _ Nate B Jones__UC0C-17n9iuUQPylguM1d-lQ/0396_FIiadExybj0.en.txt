We are in a power law game and power law
costs and returns show up across AI.
That means uh AI is increasing according
to a power law. So it's increasing
exponentially. I talked about that. It
also means you get power law returns
from gambling on AI as a business. And I
gambling is probably the wrong word.
Betting on AI as a business.
Essentially, if you invest in something
and there's a power law return, it's
rational to invest more than you usually
would. And we've seen that pattern play
off across companies investing in AI,
but also across model makers. model
makers investing a billion dollars in AI
talent or whatever it is as Zuck did,
model makers investing a huge amount in
chips. All of that is a way of saying we
think there's disproportionate returns
on AI and we are going to keep investing
very very heavily in order to harvest
those returns.
