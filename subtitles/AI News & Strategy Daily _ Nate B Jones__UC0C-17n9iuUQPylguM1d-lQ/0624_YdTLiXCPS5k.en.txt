Kimmy K2 is an open- source model out of
China and they have done a phenomenal
job of putting together a PowerPoint
skill that enables you to make useful
PowerPoint presentations that look
really good and I will show one with the
Substack writeup. You can see it's a
very simple prompt but you get a very
useful PowerPoint out of it. That being
said, because of the where the data is
located, you cannot really use this in
the US or the EU for corporate data.
It's just the protections aren't there.
And so if you're doing a fairly generic
presentation where you're not, you know,
you're using publicly available
information off the internet, it's
phenomenal. If you're using it for
personal use and you don't mind, it's
phenomenal. Great job. If you need
corporate data protections, I find that
Claude Sonnet 4.5 is super super useful
for PowerPoint creation. It's just a
little bit less designed. I tend to
prefer a spare, elegant, minimalist
approach with my PowerPoints. I wrote up
a whole guide on this I can link. And
it's it's going to be what you need it
to be with with Claude. It's going to be

to be with with Claude. It's going to be
usable. It's going to be presentable.
But if you have a very elaborate
PowerPoint style, got to be honest with
you, you're not going to get what you
want out of Claude. You're not going to
get what you want out of any AI right
now. The AIs that are doing the work
with PowerPoint either have fairly
strong preset styling or they're very
clean and minimalist and elegant. One
thing I will call out is I do not use
Kimmy K2 for thinking.
