One of the things that Andre Karpathy
talked about this week is he talked
about this idea that we need to be able
to imagine LLMs as nonanimal alien
intelligences at a high degree of
fidelity so that we can understand how
to work with them. Effectively what he's
saying is we are as a species having our
first contact with a new intelligence
and the better we can build a mental
model of what that intelligence looks
like and how it works the more
effectively we can partner together.
This is not a like scary doomsday first
contact movie. It's more about imagining
how the intelligence works.
