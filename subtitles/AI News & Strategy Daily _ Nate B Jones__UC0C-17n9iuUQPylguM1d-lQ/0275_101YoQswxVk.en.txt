sales to implementation. Let me give you
an example here. Sale can sales can
create a deal summary using co-pilot and
it can say extract all technical
requirements from this contract so our
engineering team can understand it.
Copilot will go through it will extract
the technical requirements. I would
recommend reading it again just to make
sure. But it's going to give you a
technical summary and engineering will
then get a clean requirements list.
Engineering can then use copilot to say
hey can you create an implementation
timeline based on these requirements?
engineering in most cases will look at
that implementation timeline, swear at
it, go to lunch, come back, have a beer,
and then write the actual one down. But
I find even if you're upset with a
co-pilot estimate, it still moves the
ball forward because it gets you off the
blank page.
