a long time. We have kitchens. We cook,
but we still go out to restaurants. We
still Door Dash. In the same way, we're
still going to buy software. But I think
knowing how to cook and knowing how to
build are equivalently useful skills.
And actually, knowing how to code is not
more difficult than knowing how to cook
now. It's it's become much simpler
thanks to artificial intelligence. And
so if you are listening to this and you
have never tried building, this is my
plea to you. I want you to not be left
behind. I want you to be able to try.
And that is why I have taken the time to

specific, durable patterns. And if you
are building, the durable patterns are
pretty helpful, too. Because one of the
