And so if you think about what's coming
up next for OpenAI, the launch of chat
JPG5, if you think about the upcoming
launch of their open weights model,
which they have delayed again, I start
to see these kinds of claims from OpenAI
in the light of their trust fingerprint.
I start to read it and I start to say
this is a model maker that values press
releases. It values public relations. it
will jump to get the PR victory ahead of
any kind of request that it gets to hold
things back. It moves fast. And so when
the International Math Olympiad said,
"Please wait for the students," Sam
didn't wait and he pushed forward
because he had an amazing story to tell
and he wanted to be the first in the
market and he wanted to beat Google to
the story.
