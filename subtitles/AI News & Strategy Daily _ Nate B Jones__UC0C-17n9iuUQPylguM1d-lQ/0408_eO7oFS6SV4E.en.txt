AI makes it so trivial to ship failure
at scale.
As I said, systems will now accept
paragraphs of instructions from the open
internet. The attack vectors are so
high.
Model rot can corrupt systems without
any warning at all. The reality is that
we we have to recognize that engineering
is what enables us to take this wild
world where LLMs can speak language and
where they're probabilistic and where
they can bring intelligence to bear.
Engineers help wrestle that into an
operational stable production system.
They help to bring observability to
those systems. They help to debug those
systems. They help to figure out the
energy and compute footprint that's
appropriate for those systems.
And engineers ultimately are cultural
architects.
They help us to design workflows that
preserve human judgment.
They help us to build interfaces that
make AI reasoning inspectable. They help

make AI reasoning inspectable. They help
us to prevent automation bias and and
skill atrophy if they're designing
systems
