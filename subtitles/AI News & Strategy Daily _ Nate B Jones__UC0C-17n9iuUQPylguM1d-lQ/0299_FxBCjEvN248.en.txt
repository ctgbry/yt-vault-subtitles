So where do you go from here? I want to
suggest that we go back to what has made
startups an attractive place to work for
people who build for a long time. It's
actually not the risk. It's a little bit
of the equity and the upside. Let's not
kid ourselves. But it's the passion for
the problem space. That is what
distinguishes people who stay in
startups. That is what distinguishes
people who stay in tech. They are
passionate about solving a particular
problem with technical leverage. And if
you don't have that, it doesn't matter
if you're an engineer, like you have to
be passionate about the problem space.
If you don't have that passion, it is
going to be difficult for you to stand
out. And I've seen over and over again,
if you do have that passion, you find a
way in a door by hook or by crook.
