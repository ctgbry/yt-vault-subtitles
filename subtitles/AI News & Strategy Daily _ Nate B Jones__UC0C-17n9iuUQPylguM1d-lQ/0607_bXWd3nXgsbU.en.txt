OpenAI has a rumored trillion dollar IPO
and Nvidia hits $5 trillion in market
cap. What's the real story here? It's
actually not the rumored IPO, although
that was news that went around the
world. The real story is that OpenAI is
unbundling the tech stack and that is
part of how they are reaching this
valuation. They have reached an appetite
for compute that exceeds even
Microsoft's cloud's capability to
deliver. And so they are unbundling and
they have dropped the Microsoft first
right of refusal on compute and they can
now get compute from anywhere from
Oracle from Google from elsewhere. That
might seem like it's strange because
some of the folks like Google make their
own models but we already see anthropic
and Google working together. The bottom
line is not who ends up in a deal with
who. The bottom line is that everybody
is in a race to build infrastructure.
And if you want to look at when the next
great model comes out from Gemini or
from OpenAI or from Anthropic, the
answer is increasingly not dependent on
researchers doing smart things with
models. It's dependent on people getting

models. It's dependent on people getting
chips into data centers with power
because researchers keep communicating
and leadership at these companies keeps
communicating we're not blocked on
progress. We're blocked on chips. We're
blocked on the ability to get enough
chips into data centers to serve demand.
As I called out earlier in the week,
that incredible appetite for AI is part
of how we know we're not in a bubble.
This is getting built out to serve a
backlog of existing demand. And that
demand has no signs of slowing down. It
turns out the world has near infinite
appetite for intelligence.
