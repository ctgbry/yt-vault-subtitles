Open AAI releases GPT 5.1 with adaptive
reasoning and personality controls. So
GPT 5.1 fixes GPT5's biggest friction
points. Rigid modes and a cold and
formal tone, bad writing. Instant now
decides when a query needs deep
reasoning and thinking adjust token use
automatically. I've already found it to
be cheap on simple tasks and much more
thorough thinking longer when complexity
spikes. The personality system was
completely rebuilt. There are eight tone
presets, plus sliders for warmth, for
brevity, for emoji use. There's other
things, too. Chad GPT 5.1 also actively
learns your preferences in a
conversation and it solves one of GPT5's
core complaints.
