So here's what changes
if Gemini 3 and Apple actually come
together. We will move from a model arms
race to a distribution duopoly on
mobile. So instead of seeing a massive
arms race across the whole spectrum, we
will suddenly be in a world where Google
powers the iOS experience by default,
Google powers the Android experience by
default, and Google wins just about no
matter what. We will also move from a
world where we ask who has the best
model all the time because they're slow,
tightly competitive to a world where we
ask who has the best UX and who has the
best data loops because increasingly as
models continue to get more effective.
We're not going to be asking ourselves
is the model smart enough to do it.
We're going to be asking is the UX easy
enough for me to use and is the data
loop in place where I can get the data I
need safely. A dumber model with better
access to data is better today than any
other model out there. It's also true
that if the UX is terrible, you don't
get the distribution. And that is
actually the primary issue right now

historic risk of Google product
thinking.
