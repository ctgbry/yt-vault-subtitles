Planning matters and Codeex is
extraordinary at planning. And I want
you to look at this especially if you
are not an engineer. Codeex is already
winning because Codeex is much more
reasonable. It is headlined properly. I
see possible approaches and there's
three options that are really easy to
scan. I can take a tool augmented
approach, an event- driven workflow or
an agentic pipeline. It gets into
confidence thresholds really fast.
Whereas codec stays really focused at
the strategic layer, right? it says okay
what are some component considerations
you want to think through I feel like
I'm talking to a more senior member of
the engineering team when I'm looking at
codeex over here whereas when I'm
looking at cloud code it just jumps
right into this specific failure table
and tries to explain what what the heck
it means by these specific failure
choices I am not ready to get into
specific failure modes that is why I
asked the system to think strategically
only codeex figured that out and codeex
is here having an earnest conversation
with me about how I should think about
the components. It's giving me ideas for

the components. It's giving me ideas for
degradation paths that are concise and
easy to understand. Classification
uncertainty is one. Model hallucination
is one. This is so easy to follow. It is
so easy to think through. It is so
clear. And then it gives me a series of
strategic questions around data, human
in the loop, tooling, scalability, etc.
And by the way, the leverage in
engineering and also non-engineering
tasks in AI right now is in planning.
