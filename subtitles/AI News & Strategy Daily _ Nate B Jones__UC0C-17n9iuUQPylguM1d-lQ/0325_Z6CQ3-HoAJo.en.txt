The assistant that I find ideal is the
one that I touch daily because it's
quick, it helps with simple tasks, it's
accurate, and I don't have to babysit
it. And this agent isn't any of those
things. In fact, it's kind of doubling
down on the framework that was
problematic about operator. You have to
babysit it. It takes a long time. It
thinks a lot. It has more arms and legs
now. It can connect to more stuff. It'll
connect to Google Drive. It'll connect
to Excel. It will do it. It legitimately
has more capabilities. But the
fundamental frame of you must babysit
it, it's going to take a while, it has a
lot of guard rail, so you have to
intervene a lot. Hasn't changed. It's
not different than it was. And I think
that those those requirements are
problematic enough that this is not
going to be a widely adopted tool
