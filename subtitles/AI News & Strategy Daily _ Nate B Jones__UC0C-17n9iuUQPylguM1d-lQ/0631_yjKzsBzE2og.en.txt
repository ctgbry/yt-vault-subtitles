Zero copy architecture is a philosophy.
It's not tooling. I'll get into what
that means. So, traditional data
warehouses copy data to central
locations. They clean it up overnight.
Then they make it available for
reporting. But depending on your needs,
Agentic AI cannot wait for overnight
batch jobs. If you want real time data
today, that won't work. So, agents need
real time data access to authoritative
source systems. If you want real-time
conversations with your data, now if you
are okay with having day, delayed or
longer data and you just you're fine
with that and most of your use cases are
with last week's data or last month's
data, this gets easier. The key shift to
think about is that the behavior of the
business user is also evolving. So part
of why in the Salesforce survey,
companies were 34% likely more likely to
succeed if they used a zerocopy

succeed if they used a zerocopy
approach, which is where you don't copy
it to a central location. You just tell
the AI to query the data where it lives
in all of your different systems. Part
of why they were more successful is
because they were able to architect the
entire system exactly the way they
wanted without trying to buy from
different vendors and cobble a system
together. And so this is in line with
other surveys we've seen of executive
leadership that have emphasized that it
is really important for executives to
invest in internal capacity for
architecting systems if you want the
ability to build and sustain AI long
term.
