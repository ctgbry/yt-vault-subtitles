If you really care about controlling
exactly which model you get every single
time, you have only a couple of options.
You can either go to the API or you can
hit the drop-down and you have you don't
have 10 models of choices. You have if
you're if you're a pro user, you have
chat GPT5 pro and you have chat GBT5
thinking and you have chat GBT5. The
options degrade from there down to plus
and free users. And so you have less and
less choice and have to rely more on the
prompting I gave you for router where
you're prompting think hard. This is an
issue that they are going to address
with more customization.
