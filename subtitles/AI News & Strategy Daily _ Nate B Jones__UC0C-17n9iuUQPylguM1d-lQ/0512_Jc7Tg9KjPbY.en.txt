You notice by the way these are not job
specific. I am not giving you the
fluency levels for engineers and then
the fluency levels for for PMS. Do you
know why? It's because I have a strong
conviction that AI is a generalist skill
set and we are probably teaching it
wrong if we dive too deep into verticals
without that generalist conceptual
foundation. And we really haven't had
that. And that's what I'm setting out to
do here. I think it's great if you
understand how to build with Langmith as
a developer, but I don't think that's
the only kind of AI learning and
grounding you need. And I think that
we're missing this piece here, this sort
of general approach to skill sets and
fluency. And I think having a common
understanding here will be helpful.
