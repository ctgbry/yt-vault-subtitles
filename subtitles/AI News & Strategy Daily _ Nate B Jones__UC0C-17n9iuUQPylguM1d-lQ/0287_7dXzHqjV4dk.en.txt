The problem is this. Fundamentally, when
the transformer reads that context, it
does not read it as a structure. It
reads it as a string of tokens. And so
larger structures within the document
within the codebase can get lost. And
that is why agentic search is picking up
versus just semantic rag for context
windows for code bases. And by context
window in this case, like rag is
obviously not the context window. Oh,
it's like part of the context
engineering that you're doing for the
codebase. The point is having a search
function can beat just semantic meaning
for code bases because there's so much
structure in code bases. And that is
just one example of where we can go
wrong when we assume that context
windows just as vanilla fill the prompt
and add the doc context windows work.
They don't necessarily work
