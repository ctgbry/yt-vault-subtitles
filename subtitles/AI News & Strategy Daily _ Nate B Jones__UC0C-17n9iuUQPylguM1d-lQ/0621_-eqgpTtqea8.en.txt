you are projecting capabilities onto the
model that the model does not have. I
see this with developers and with
non-developers both. If you're a
developer, this can look like assuming a
competency in an agent tool call that
isn't really there. If you are not a
developer, it can look like writing a
prompt and the prompt is underspecified.
The prompt lets you infer and guess. And
so for example, if you say in a casual
prompt, write me a professional update
about the migration. The model might
assume you mean an engineering audience
and that you want a deep technical
status update. But you may have meant, I
want an executive audience in 150 words.
That's a very simple example. And people
assume that they can fix this by just
writing very long prompts. That's not
correct. The correct way to fix this is
actually to specify the schema of the
output. And so what you want to do is
instead of saying I need to compose a
prompt and writing prompt forward in
your head, flip it around and say I want
an output that looks like this. And that

an output that looks like this. And that
becomes your map that you give to the
AI. And this is called schema first
prompting. It is a way to handle
situations where you are routinely
getting incorrect responses. It's not
that you have to do this every single
time. All of these prompts and prompt
tips and office hours approaches are
things that you do when things break.
That is why we're having this
conversation. So when you are getting
responses that do not work, ask yourself
if you are projecting capabilities onto
the model that it does not have. And if
you are, think about whether or not you
need to specify your output more
precisely in the prompt.
