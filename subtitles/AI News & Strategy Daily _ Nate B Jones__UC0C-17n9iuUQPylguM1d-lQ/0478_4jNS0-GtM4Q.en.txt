We talk a lot about AI automating AI
picking up work from us. But I've been
thinking a lot about this idea that the
most valuable AI is the AI that helps
you to see clearly when you as a good
human in your domain with deep
experience needs to touch the work. And
this model more than chat GPT5 more than
Opus 4.1 it's clear enough in its
narrative that you can see really
clearly what it's trying to go for. and
you can see really clearly where you
need to touch the work to make it
better. And so if you think about it
within the context of a larger say deck
preparation workflow, a spreadsheet
model preparation workflow, this model
is going to speed the time it takes to
get these important pieces of work Done.
