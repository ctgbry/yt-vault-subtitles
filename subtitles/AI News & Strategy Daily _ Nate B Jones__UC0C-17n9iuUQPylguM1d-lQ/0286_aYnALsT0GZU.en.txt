Humans are lossy compression functions
too. I'll say it again. Humans are lossy
compression functions too. Our
forgetting and compression is
fundamentally similar to what these
models do. That is the bet. I don't know
that I agree with it. The context window
problem suggests this bet might be
incorrect. Yes, we forget details, but
we maintain coherent mental models.
Sure, I can't recite page 50 of the
legal document verbatim, but I
understand how chapter 20 relates to
chapter 1, and I can tell you pretty
clearly. LLM, it's not the same, right?
research shows they're doing pattern
matching. And if they're doing pattern
matching, that's not the same as
understanding the structure. And if this
concept of quadratic complexity really
applies, it's it's not just
inconvenient.
