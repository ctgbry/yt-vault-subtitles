Let's jump into how you actually build a
skill. Okay, here we are at the top of a
tutorial on building a skill. This is a
PowerPoint chunking skill. Remember how
I promised to solve some of these meta
problems in this video? Here's how I'm
doing that. I found in practice one of
the biggest issues that people had using
skills is it was tough to create
powerpoints using skills that did not
run into Claude's context window and
generate a really frustrating experience
where you put all the data and you put
all the narrative in and you get your
fancy prompt and then you put in your
Claude skill and it runs out of space.
So, I wanted to say, is there a skill I
could build that Claude could use to
proactively help avoid that situation?
