It is critical to understand that we are
not just generating images better. We're
generating them in ways that we never
could before. And I think the Space
Needle illustration is great here. This
took an image that was just a regular
daytime shot of the Space Needle, not
from this angle, by the way. It
converted it into a top-down look with
clean, clear architectural diagrams
explaining what the Space Needle looks
like. And it is actually like this is
exactly what it looks like if you walk
up close to it. This is what I was
referring to with the earnings report.
Google's entire earnings for the quarter
in one slide. One shot. I just said,
"Here, read it and please give me an
overarching perspective." My My jaw is
on the floor. Like this is this is
insane. Just happens to be generated by
Nano Banana. The point is that this is a
breakthrough and it's a big deal. This
is why I'm excited. We have not had
this. We have dreamed of this for 2
years. It's out now. We have solved
visual reasoning.
