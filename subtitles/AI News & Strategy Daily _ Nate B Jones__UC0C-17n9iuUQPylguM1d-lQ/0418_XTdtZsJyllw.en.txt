I want to map out how to get from that
honeymoon phase where you install an you
you you start to build your first node.
You start to see data flowing across the
screen. It feels so cool. It works. You
feel like you've unlocked superpowers.
You want to build 10 more of them. I
want to get you accelerated through the
trough of disillusionment where you have
to add error handling. You have to add
conditional logic. That's even more
nodes. The edge cases pile up. You tell
yourself it's manageable, but the clean
workflow looks like, I don't know, the
subway map of Manhattan. It looks like
like ridiculous, like a pile of
spaghetti. At a certain point, if you
are serious and you are only using the
nodes and dragging and dropping, you are
going to get to a point where you have
12 workflows and 6 633 nodes and it
fails at 2 a.m. You're spending three
hours debugging it and you feel like you
are in hell.
