Anthropic launched Claude Skills. It's a
reusable agent customization platform
that packages instructions, scripts,
resources together. I did a whole video
on it. I think it's one of the biggest
releases of the year. It takes the
combination of manual orchestration and
context and prompts out of the equation
so that you can autocompose what you
need to do by assembling the context on
the fly. Simon Willis, who I read often
and really respect, called this a bigger
deal than the model context protocol
server, which we all know is all over
the ecosystem. I agree. I think it's a
huge release. Watch for how enterprises
handle permissions with this. Watch for
open AIs and Google's competitive
response. There will be one. Watch for
whether skills become a standard
abstraction for agentic workflows.
