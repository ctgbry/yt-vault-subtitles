I think that we reached a productivity
baseline with Opus 4.1 for people who
care about work. It is possible to be
productive not just in conversation but
with docs and sheets and code and deck
in Opus 4.1 which was Claude's previous
model. Now with this model we don't just
go from being productive to perfect. We
go from being productive to decisioning.
And this gets at the heart of what I've
been saying this entire time. This model
sets you up to focus your time on making
decisions that matter because the work
it produces is really clear. And that's
true in the chat as much as it's true in
any output format that you want to
select. That's what I'm excited about
because it feels like we're moving from
a worker's buddy that works alongside
you and gets you okay drafts to a more
professional colleague that is designed
to help set you up to save time and make
really smart decisions.
