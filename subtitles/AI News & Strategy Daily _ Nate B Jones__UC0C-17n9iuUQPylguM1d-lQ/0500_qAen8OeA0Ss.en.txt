So executives tend to ask me, Nate,
which model should we bet on for AI
agents? Wrong question, guys. The right
question is which architecture delivers
the workflows we're looking for. Model
advantage lasts maybe a quarter at best.
Architectural advantage is something
that persists for years. So the
principle is this. You want to build
model agnostic orchestration that isn't
dependent on particular models to
execute particular workflows. In
particular, you want to make sure that
your agents are selected, evaluated,
swapped, and combined individually. And
you do that based on the architecture
and what it demands, the workflows,
right? This comes back to your
orchestration layer being the
competitive bet, not the models. The
models are replaceable commodities. You
can build a model orchestration layer
and that is going to get you much much
farther.
