And I find that this is where a lot of
consultants, whether they're established
or whether they're new, go astray. They
tend to say, "We're going to zero in on
AI. All we do is AI." But AI is it's
hard to put your fingers on. I've talked
about that already in this video. It's a
general purpose technology. You can do
it with development. You can do it with
process change. You can do it with a
dozen other things in the consulting
world, marketing, etc. You need to pick
a particular domain that you can own.
You need to pick a particular domain
where if you have an opinion on how AI
agents should be deployed in that
domain, you you should be believed. You
have authority there. You have a decade
of experience. That is part of why when
I speak about product and AI, I tend to
have very strong opinions because I did
product management for a long long time.
When I speak about founding an AI, I
tend to have opinions because I have
found it before, etc.
