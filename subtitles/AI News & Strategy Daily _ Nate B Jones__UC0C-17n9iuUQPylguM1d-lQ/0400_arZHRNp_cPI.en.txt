Number one, the chatbot use case is
indeed getting saturated. This was
reported by Sam in like an interview
right after the one where he talked
about the bubble. In other words, if
you're in the chatbot, you're not
necessarily going to see tons of
tremendous gains anymore, no matter how
smart the model gets, because people
don't necessarily perceive the progress
in the chatbot because the AI is about
as good in the chatbot as it's going to
get. So famously what Sam said in that
conversation was chat GPT6 is coming and
memory is going to get better but really
the chat use case is kind of saturated.
I think he's right. I don't think we
have a lot more to gain from the chat
use case. Number two, I think we're
forgetting that progress is moving to
agentic and complicated use case, which
is sort of a correlary to the chatbot,
right?
