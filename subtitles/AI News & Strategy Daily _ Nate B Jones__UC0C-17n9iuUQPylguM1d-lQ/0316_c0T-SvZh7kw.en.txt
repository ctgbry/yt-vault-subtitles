Imagine an agent that allows you to
simulate various business timelines and
explore them. We often only have the
chance for a simple PowerPoint
presentation to the board with three
options and here's our preferred one. I
gives us so much more power to work with
and almost none of us are using these
agents as reality simulators to think
through different timelines in a
structured way. In that world, if we did
a little structured timeline exploration
for a business, we could turn a 10-year
market cycle into a 10-hour sim and come
back with five or six different 10-hour
sims and have a much more useful
understanding of where the business was
going. In a sense, we're taking all of
these timelines that we've had to
historically just look the next two or
three steps on. We now have the compute
to simulate a bunch of those different
lines, bring them in and make smarter
decisions.
