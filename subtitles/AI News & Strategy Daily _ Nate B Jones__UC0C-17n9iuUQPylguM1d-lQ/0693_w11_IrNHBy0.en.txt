This is a peer-reviewed preprint showing
that GPT5 is doing real scientific
works. It proves new theorems. It
discovers symmetry generators in cur
black hole physics. It proposed
biological experiments that matched
unpublished lab results. So, it couldn't
have seen it beforehand. It has academic
collaborators out of Oxford, Cambridge,
Harvard, Vanderbilt, and Jackson Lab.
And so, why does it matter? This is the
cleanest proof yet that frontier models
are starting to behave like research
collaborators not just assistants for
frontier reasoning for deep math for
physics for biology model quality is not
interchangeable and every researcher
that I have spoken to or who has spoken
publicly insists that for that kind of
research GPT5 or 5.1 pro is the gold
standard. Now, GPT5 Pro is not perfect,
but again, just as we look at the 3D
world generator with Marble, this is
enough to show a fundamental change in
role. And so, instead of thinking of

role. And so, instead of thinking of
chat bots as minions that go do jobs,
these scientists are increasingly
regarding GPT5 Pro as a thinking partner
that helps them to make novel
discoveries and that is able to propose
and prove novel theorems that they can
then validate. And that's a big step for
an LLM.
