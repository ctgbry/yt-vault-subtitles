Number one, codebase mapping and
onboarding. You might not think of that
as a development pattern, but it really
is. You can use AI to quickly understand
existing code bases. You can generate
maps or summaries or graphs for
onboarding or legacy dives. This is
especially useful if you have an
existing codebase obviously and if you
want to bring someone in on your team
quickly. You can treat AI output as sort
of a starting point for further
refinement. In this context, this can
accelerate onboarding very rapidly for
new builders. It can extract highle
context really quickly and it's very
useful uh for people who are
non-engineers to get to know a codebase.
I've actually written some prompts that
are designed to help you get to know a
particular coding pattern that you're
using. Very similar very similar
process.
