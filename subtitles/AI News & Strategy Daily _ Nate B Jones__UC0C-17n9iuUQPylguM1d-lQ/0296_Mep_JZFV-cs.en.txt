And part of why I care about this is
because what happened with Grock is a
trust breaker for AI systems everywhere.
It's not just a Grock problem. Now it's
big enough and bad enough. It's an AI
problem because people don't understand.
They don't understand the technical
decisions that led to this choice. In
fact, some of them misunderstand and
think that Grock became intentionally
malevolent. That was not what happened.
Rag systems can be incredibly powerful,
but if you implement retrieval without
proper filtering, it's like building a
water treatment plant, but forgetting to
add the treatment part. You're just
piping the sewage into people's houses.
As far as I can see, there is minimal or
no content filtering between retrieval
and generation for Grock. So if someone
posted extremist content on X and
someone else asks Grock about that
topic, Grock might treat that extremist
content as legitimate
