I've done a deep comparison here of 5.1
versus Gemini 3. What do we see overall?
The deep difference is not just Google
versus OpenAI. It is what kind of
entropy each model is best at handling.
You are looking at a world of context
entropy versus task entropy. So context
entropy is how messy, large, and
multimodal your inputs can be. They
could have lots of irrelevant details.
They can have mixed formats. They can
have timelines, screenshots, logs,
videos. Sound like Gemini 3? It is. Task
entropy is how open-ended and multi-step
the job is. Right? Vague objectives,
competing constraints, multiple
stakeholders, tool calls, planning and
writing and coding. Chat GPT 5.1 is a
little bit better there, but I want to
get into the nuance. Right? So, you get
the best results when you align the
model to the entropy it's dealing with.
Gemini 3 does well with high context
entropy. I think it does okay with task
entropy, but I would grade it about
moderate. Here's everything. can find

the signal and structure it is a great
use for Gemini 3. Chad GPT5
or 5.1 is very low to moderate on
context entropy. You have to give it
really clean signal but then you can
give it a complex task. And I want to be
precise about this because Chad GPT
5.1's docs do call out that if your
context window is uh competing, if you
are giving it instructions that are
ambiguous and try and cancel each other
out, like be descriptive and concise,
GBT 5.1 doesn't like that. It will burn
tokens trying to fix that ambiguity. I
have seen it push back on me when it
feels my prompts are inaccurate, which I
love. Assuming you have clear prompts
though, I do think it can handle a very
high complexity task and think it
through. It is sort of like a brain in a
jar in that regard. If you can give it a
really clean input, it can process it
and it can be quite a complex task and
it will come back really thoughtfully.
