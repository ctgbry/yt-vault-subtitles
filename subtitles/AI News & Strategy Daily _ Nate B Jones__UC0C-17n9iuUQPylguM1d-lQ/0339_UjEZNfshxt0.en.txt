as a personal challenge. And so what we
are going to work through today is an
actual prompt to set up your own digital
twin simulation. We have a couple of
goals as we work through this prompt. We
want to understand first how the prompt
functions. It's another one of those
system level prompts. So it actually
walks through an entire process or flow.
It creates a scenario and then it walks
you directly through it all in one
prompt. and we'll see how it works. The
second thing I want to do is I want to
show you some of how it works with
actual real conversations that I had
using that prompt and we'll walk through
them. You'll get both a salary
negotiation conversation because
sometimes we want to game those in
advance. Uh and you'll also get a
classic like product approval
conversation to give you a sense of
office politics and how it simulates
office politics.
