You have to figure out how to build AI
product. An AI product doesn't work like
any other product guys. Other products
you can just sort of say this is what
the product is and write the
requirements and that's how we were all
brought up if we were npm for a decade
but not anymore. Now the product is
probabilistic if you're building an AI
product. The product is it mostly does
this but sometimes there are edge cases.
Sometimes the product is we figured this
out. Can you help us package it? It is
not easy to build AI product especially
when you couple that with the demands
from executives where executives are
expecting really rapid ships on AI.
They're expecting deadlines and your
engineering team is like not willing to
give you deadlines on probabilistic
products so often. So there's the
product piece, there's the asset piece.
Both of those are very tricky. There's a
third piece that no other role has,
which is that PM has always been a glue
role.
