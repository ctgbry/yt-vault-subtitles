This is the beginning of an entire new
arc where we will see AI become more
proactive. This is one of the first
widely consumer available proactive AI
experiences. And I want you to keep that
in mind because a lot of the other
threads we're following over the course
of the last few months point to a 2026
that is more AI proactive versus AI
reactive and major model makers are all
building in that direction. Let's get to
story number two. Microsoft is
diversifying co-pilot with anthropic
models. And this is really fascinating
because Microsoft has been known for
leaning in on OpenAI for a while. But as
we discovered in the last couple weeks,
Microsoft and OpenAI have finalized a
new looser partnership format. And it's
not super surprising in that context to
see Microsoft go for another major model
maker as essential to their suite of
tools.
