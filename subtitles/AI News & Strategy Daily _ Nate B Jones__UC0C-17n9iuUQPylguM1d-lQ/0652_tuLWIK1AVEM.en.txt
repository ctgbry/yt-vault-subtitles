[00:00]
So, a couple of days ago, I had the
privilege of sitting down with two
members of Codeex's engineering team. I
got to talk with uh Tibo, who's pretty
well known as an engineering lead at
Codeex, and also with Ed, a design
engineer. Our focus really isn't the
code. So, if you're like not a
developer, this is still going to be
super interesting for you. Instead, what
we focused on is how does codeex change
how OpenAI works? And in particular,
when you're talking to someone from a
non-technical background like Ed and a
technical background like Tibo, how do
our workflows shift? How does what we
build change when you have codecs as
effectively a teammate? What does that
look like in practice? I think we often
talk about AI native organizations, but
I wanted to take this chance to sit down
with a truly AI native organization with
OpenAI and actually learn how they use
codeex day-to-day and how it's changing
everybody's workflows, not just the
technical team. So, jump in. This is
going to be a fun one. Well, maybe first

[01:00]
going to be a fun one. Well, maybe first
like I'd love to hear a little bit from
you guys about who you are, how you came
to open AI. Uh I know that everyone has
their own story here and I'd love to
hear a little bit about yours.
Yeah, nice story, Ed.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm a designer on Codeex. Um, been
in Open AI just over a year. I've been
on Codex for about six months. Before
that, worked worked in the research
team. And yeah, I've always worked at
the intersection of design, design,
engineering, and research. Worked on
robotics before at Google and a few
other things before that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I uh worked at Google as well uh
finally like I didn't know we shared
that piece of history. Always figuring
things out. So at Google very briefly,
moved into uh Deep Mind, worked there
for many many years.
&gt;&gt; Mh.
&gt;&gt; And then uh decided to like do the big
jump and like go to the US and come here
and work for OpenAI. That was like about
a year and a half ago. Uh that was
pre-reasoning like a year and a half
ago. That was pre
&gt;&gt; Yes. And so in typical OpenAI fashion

[02:01]
&gt;&gt; Yes. And so in typical OpenAI fashion
joined just before uh that happened like
was part of like the 01 sprint. I was
more like trying to be useful in any way
possible and then uh after that like
kind of stuck around built some tooling
for research became super obsessed late
last year around uh hey like maybe
models are going to continue to improve
and their capabilities are you know
going to continue to uh impress us and
maybe actually like we should think more
about the products the infrastructure
around it to really benefit from those
models and then uh started like
prototyping you were working on similar
things.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh and we we we were not working
together initially and then we joined
efforts
&gt;&gt; earlier this year.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And that's that was sort of like how
Codex got started.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So you guys were there from the
beginning with Codeex.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean it's had a long history,
right? Um right. Coding agents had openi
you know the name Codex is a throwback
to a model which was like you know
prejudg I believe right. So coding
agents have been around but the yeah
codeex as it is now is

[03:00]
codeex as it is now is
&gt;&gt; yeah codeex is the the product uh that
was like released what in April this
year.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Amazing. So one of the things I I'll
just ask you what I get asked about
codeex because we get to chat and we get
to find out. Uh this is like the number
one question I get asked is how do
engineers at OpenAI use codeex daytoday?
again two different patterns. Um it's
like one is everyone just doesn't have a
choice on like the code is reviewed by
codeex uh no no matter like whether
whether you want it you know reviewed or
not it's just been like so useful at
catching issues and then there's a lot
of um casual usage uh by you know even
like nontechnical staff and then what
we're also seeing is like at the
complete end of the spectrum is like
really power users of codecs that deploy
a lot of compute a lot more than know we
saw even like a couple of months ago and
this continues to increase and increase

[04:01]
this continues to increase and increase
and increase and um with increasingly uh
complex workflows some of them multi-
aent you know running like for many many
hours
&gt;&gt; and so it's a highly personal thing uh
still feel like it's very evolving
&gt;&gt; that makes a lot of sense yeah go ahead
&gt;&gt; yeah so as I say you know I'm a designer
on the team so work very closely with
engineers But I'm very much in the
codebase a lot myself. And you know, I
think the cool thing about Codeex and
these recent models over the past few
months is they really have been a step
change. And what you've seen, I think
even since we launched our most recent
product suite is
basically everyone at Open using it. You
know, I like there's one engineer that I
know who uses it for for everything for
note takingaking for like it's basically
his like primary interface to his
computer. Um, as a designer, you know,
I'm seeing more and more in our like
work in progress channel on Slack,
people posting these demos. And, you
know, I DM someone, I was like, I didn't

[05:00]
know, I DM someone, I was like, I didn't
I didn't need a code. And he's like, I I
couldn't till a few months ago.
&gt;&gt; Um, so you've got kind of, you know,
design engineers like myself hopping in
more, submitting more PRs and kind of
getting closer to the, you know, closer
to the details. And then even even new
people, nontechnical people, go to
market stuff even, you know, people are
really like hopping in and it's just
like this kind of force multiplier.
Yeah, that that's exactly where I kind
of wanted to chat because I think that
for a lot of organizations that remains
the dream, but maybe it's something
about the command line uh in the
terminal sort of scariness that comes
with that. Uh but for whatever reason
people find themselves
sort of hard limiting a lot of these
technical tools to engineering teams. Uh
sometimes that is literally at the level
of the IT policy. have been in
organizations where the IT policy only
allows engineers to use tools like this
and if they catch you doing this as a
non-technical person that's a violation
of policy and I think some of these
older ways of working and thinking are
having to evolve.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think the lines are what we're

[06:01]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think the lines are what we're
seeing is like the lines are blurring
like Ed I mean you're sort of like
everywhere like ideulating about the
future but then also like very much like
using
&gt;&gt; codecs every day and then feeling you
know does it feel right like pulling up
like you know PRs and little fixes
&gt;&gt; there's like how you know that's so
evolved very quickly right
&gt;&gt; totally yeah yeah and I think yeah you
know to your point there's there's
there's kind of one half of it which is
like how do you how do you bring
organizations along and you have you
know particular some of these large
organizations might have some more like
institutional challenges but um but you
know once you get access I feel like
it's kind of getting easier as easy as
possible um so you know you mentioned
that it might feel like a bit of a step
up for people to get in the terminal I
think the cool thing with some of our
products recently is you know we've
shipped an ID extension so we're not
just in the terminal we have a CLI
product which we've had for a little bit
&gt;&gt; but you know we could we meet people
where they code so they might be in VS
code they might be in cursor these other
kind of idees um and we also have a web
product. So you know you can uh you know

[07:02]
product. So you know you can uh you know
once you kind of connect all the
enterprise uh you know uh kind of puzzle
pieces you can just go in a web product
type in a prompt and create a fix. So
for example, you know, say you're you
want to change some UX copy, you're a
copywriter, you know, maybe you don't
even need to look at the code, you just
want to change some strings, you can
just do that yourself, right? You can go
in and you can type this prompt if your
kind of enterprise is set up. So um
yeah, I think like the number of
surfaces that people working across and
just like yeah, just makes it kind of
easy and easier to get involved.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I think that there's that that
ease of access piece you guys have done
a nice job solving for over the last few
months. I think the other piece that I
heard as you were talking is that
there's a little bit of a healthy
constraint in something like having
codeex review every PR like doesn't
matter it's getting reviewed you have to
engage with it and I I think that's also
going to be new for a lot of
organizations I talk with
&gt;&gt; and the thing we're we've been very
careful about is also optimizing for

[08:00]
careful about is also optimizing for
like signal to noise ratio and making
sure that the hit rate is very good
&gt;&gt; so that people don't actually complain
and like you want to turn it off.
&gt;&gt; And overall like as an organization
we're getting like way more value out of
it than you know potentially sometimes
the misses
&gt;&gt; and then we keep like improving you know
the system and the model over time so
that it's capable of finding more and
more gnarly and like subtle issues over
time. Uh and people are generally
impressed. It's like I hear it all the
time like it's like oh this thing is
super human. It's like it's doing
reviews I would never have done because
I don't have the time to dig like four
layers deep into the stack
&gt;&gt; and just having that always on you don't
have to think about it. You have that
safety net that's just there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Super interesting. Like I think
particularly something like code of view
as a designer I was thinking through the
user experience right it's like oh no is
everyone's just going to get loads of
emails and um you know it turns out that
like it's like one of the most loved
features that I think we've shipped and
that the one of the things that changed
for me was seeing some of our top
contributors across OpenAI not just our
team you know commenting in in our Slack

[09:01]
team you know commenting in in our Slack
saying like this is as you say super
human um and you know I look forward to
like those notifications now like it
really just like it just adds so much
value
&gt;&gt; like I think there are two things that
are emerging right So like this ambient
intelligence and code review is like one
example of that where it just happens.
You don't have to trigger it. You don't
have to think about it. Uh and you just
benefit from that intelligence being
deployed. Then the other thing is people
starting to use it as like a little
assistant in their computer. Like it's
not really about code. It's like it does
like you know CIS admin task you know
pulls like context and you know maybe
the latest news for you and
&gt;&gt; um it's just like or craft like some new
designs and new ideas. Um and then like
for that the current way that we're
doing it in the CLI and the extension
it's like you're instant
uh and so like the current interfaces
are maybe like holding things back a
little bit.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's kind it's kind of like it's
kind of both ways really like in in some
ways you know there's this throwback to
the terminal that that people are

[10:00]
the terminal that that people are
getting nostalgic about and you know
from a design perspective there are
these kind of two counts once is is one
is this it's this kind of parlor trick
it's this like transitory you know kind
of like form factor and actually you
know there's this like perhaps there are
some like new interaction paradigms that
we're like pushing towards but perhaps
aren't there yet. On the other hand, I
think like the constraint of the promp
box um you know the terminal like it
it's kind of perfect as well for a way
right it meets you where you are and
it's very cool to see the workflows that
people have built around that. So you
can literally you can just spin up your
terminal and you can yeah as you say
right you can write notes you can do all
of these different things from just like
s such a simple form factor. Yeah, I I
think one of the things that has
surprised me like I if I go back to that
idea of a non-technical use case for
codecs, uh I find that codeex is an
extraordinarily
logical model and when I'm using it for
a non-technical use case,
&gt;&gt; I find that there's a sharpness and a

[11:03]
&gt;&gt; I find that there's a sharpness and a
conciseness about how it evaluates a
particular set of inputs that feels like
I I can see where it came from. It feels
like of course you would get this from a
a model designed for code, but it turns
out that there's a there's an
extensibility to that to that emergent
property that helps with a lot of other
things. And so like I did a business
case analysis and it wasn't technical,
right? Like you're analyzing business
inputs like revenue and you're analyzing
uh sales figures, etc.
&gt;&gt; But it applies that same rigor and it
turns out that you get a response that's
really coherent. It's really clear. It's
cogent. It makes sense. It's easy to
read. And it's as a result very very
useful. And I just I love the idea that
these models end up having extensible
properties that perhaps spin off of what
they were originally designed for and
allow us to do lots of other things.
There's that element of hey this model

[12:01]
There's that element of hey this model
is trained to be like precise
uh and and correct about things and
diligent and you know double check maybe
trip trouble check its work sometimes
and not do all the math in its head
right or in its context and maybe write
a little Python script to help itself
out. I use it for data analysis like all
the time. Uh, and it's not about the
code anymore, right? It's it's about the
result and like trusting the steps and
like as you as you put it,
&gt;&gt; it's like a very cogent like legible
explanation. You can like see step by
step like what, you know, why it's doing
things? Uh, and then there's a question
of like at what point, you know, for
these kinds of tax, do you still need to
look at the code? Is the code just a
tool that you don't really care about?
And then you're using that as a stepping
stone. So then then you have like a
coding agent that's maybe evolving into
like you know a more general kind of
assistant. I guess that's an interesting
thing to think about.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. In terms of the use you know
you mentioned about kind of like you
know design showing up in different
places. Um and I you know I think the

[13:01]
places. Um and I you know I think the
same way about some of the use cases for
designers. So like on the one hand
there's like fixing the paper cuts of
you know cuz we're in these tools all
day every day like literally eight hours
a day. You know any small any small
paper cut that you get you just see and
you can fix it. And obviously, you know,
you're submitting a PR, it needs to, you
know, you need to look at the code that
you're generating and, you know, we can
go through the review process. But if
I'm in like a very different mindset and
I'm in like design, you know, idiating
mindset like, yeah, maybe I can just
make my terminal really small, don't
worry too much about the code, just have
a local host open and basically, you
know, just like narrow this gap from
like kind of, you know, thought to to
product. Um, and really just focus on
the interactions. you know, you can move
it, you can think about responsiveness
and and that kind of stuff becomes more
important and it becomes more like a
canvas. So, you know, similar to if
you're writing, very different use case,
but you know, also like a very different
way of designing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Because for so long design has
been effectively disintermediated from
engineering and like coming from a

[14:01]
engineering and like coming from a
product perspective, so much of the role
traditionally was translate design into
something that has requirements that
engineers can build against. And so
there was always this tension between
PMs and engineers and designers when I
was coming up where it's like everyone
has different incentives. Everyone and
really it's all just a function of
disintermediation. Like if you take away
the gap and you give everyone access to
the code, it's a different world.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like often it's like hey Ed it's
like you're just like an engineer on the
team right like writing PRs and just
fixing things. You don't need to go and
talk to anyone. You just do it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And I think some of these
boundaries as well as you say they're
kind of slightly artificial. Um you know
they've grown up um you know first we
had the terminal and then with you know
Mac we then were like started to think
about the guey and these kind of new new
disciplines emerged and they're kind of
just converging and and and diverging
over time. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You don't like being an engineer?
&gt;&gt; Oh no no I mean I I yeah I don't know

[15:01]
&gt;&gt; Oh no no I mean I I yeah I don't know
what I call myself now. I think that's
the cool thing.
&gt;&gt; There's an identity crisis where it's
just like what am I?
Yeah, I think that we're getting into a
world where job titles matter less and
skill sets matter more. Um, and it's
really it's exciting to see what happens
when people can wear those hats lightly
and just focus on what problems they can
solve.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's it's it's really a lot it
brings a lot of clarity. It's like it's
all about the problems,
&gt;&gt; figuring out what problems to solve,
figuring out what questions to ask
yourself. so much more is possible and
it's much more cheaper to ideate and
build and then you find yourself like
being like, "Wow, you know, I really
need to be crisp about what I want to go
and do."
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Um
it's exciting, but it's also
nerve-wracking at the same time, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Good ideas matter more.
&gt;&gt; They do. And correctly aimed ideas
matter more, I think.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The speed and velocity, right?

[16:00]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The speed and velocity, right?
like which direction you going in,
&gt;&gt; how fast you learn, like you know those
most successful like teams are that we
see emerge at open air like really small
teams that set themselves up as well to
like learn and iterate super fast. Uh
and then there's like a general sense of
like oh we're building towards this uh
but then like also changing things like
is cheaper. Yeah, it's I mean there's
the phrase right which has gone around
in engineering for a long time which is
kind of code wins and you know you can
write as many PDs as you like but until
you have the product in your hands and I
think that's the very the cool thing
that I've seen from like product team is
broadly defined whether it's you know
designers engineer it's like you know if
there's a hackathon like at the end of a
hackathon like you'll have like a fully
working product like you won't just have
like a kind of you know throwaway react
demo like you had before which I think
is like super exciting and then yeah
this you know the hard decision is then
what do you build like you know which
which you know which company do you do
Gina nar down?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Often times I mean you come up
with like a new idea feature like an
entire product and

[17:00]
entire product and
I have like to do it like a double take
because it's like it's not like a static
thing. It's just I'm like this thing is
fully functional like it's almost
chippable like how did you cook this?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, the cool thing I think about
um this is I think this is another fun
angle which probably hasn't been
explored that much a little bit in kind
of like design engineering which is like
you know the kind of old world is you're
a designer you work in or or you know
product manager for that matter you work
in a document you work in a a file and
it's this like throwaway piece and then
you throw it to the engineer and the
engineer kind of productionize it right
but now like you know some of the demos
that that Tibo was mentioning um I'll
just create a fork of the repo and it's
like it's not just demo. It's like a
fully functioning thing and like
obviously to move fast I've you know
taken some shortcuts and like there
there's going to be a you know it's
going to be a little rough around the
edges but um but yeah the fidelity that
you can get to is is amazing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's one of the pieces you just
used as a throwaway line that I want to
dig into a little bit. You talked about

[18:01]
dig into a little bit. You talked about
this idea that you like come up with an
idea and then a team forms around the
idea to get that idea to fruition. And I
feel like that's a little bit the story
of Codeex, but I think it's also an a
story of a new way of working. And so
I'd be curious for you guys to share a
little bit more about what that feels
like on the inside.
&gt;&gt; It feels
like we are co-evolving Codeex and the
way of working.
And so Codex is evolving as fast as we
have to adapt to, you know, the new
possibilities that it creates. And it's
it's it's quite a challenge like but
fortunately one thing that's become very
clear is like humans are still like the
very best at adapting quickly to things.
&gt;&gt; Uh and isn't it quite insane to think
like earlier this year none of this
really existed. Um
&gt;&gt; and like now like I it's very rare to
find someone who still codes like
without like a little agent by their
side. So I think you know we're going to

[19:00]
side. So I think you know we're going to
continue to see that. It's pretty clear
to me small nimble teams tend to like
produce incredible results and I think
that's going to continue to be true.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I'd agree. I think Yeah. I
think that the really interesting
observation that I've seen is just I've
been so surprised at how fast people get
used to used to these new step changes.
you know to Z's point I also joined like
just before our reasoning models and I
remember at the time we were talking
about it's like ah that you know going
to ship this reasoning model it's it's
obviously you know the kind of sits on
top of all of this research and it's
been this you know really huge research
project um you know for the company but
again it was this lowkey research
preview and it just it was such a step
change um you know in in so many areas
and if you think about where we are now
um and you know I just look at how fast
the different teams I've worked in over
just the past 6 months. And it does just
feel that kind of every few weeks or
every model release, you know, we kind
of like push this frontier even more and

[20:01]
of like push this frontier even more and
then a week later, you know, you'll be
in some agent loop and you'll get a bug
and you'll be like ah this model, you
know, like getting frustrated and then
you're like you forget forget that it's
like, you know, this is insane. So it's
just it's one of those, you know, it's
just like, you know, you could apply the
same to image generation or video,
right? you know, we shipped Sora and
it's like mind-blowing and then you see
this tiny, you know, this tiny fragment
and you're kind of like, oh, you know,
but you forget, you know, you zoom out
and you just become used to these things
so fast. But super point, I think the
cool thing is it's just super empowering
for small teams. Um and you know even
some of the junior engineers that that
that that we work with who you know
perhaps are only a few years out of
university you know the kind of the
breadth of work that they can that they
can do and the kind of big swings that
they can take you know I think just even
within the past few years has really
kind of accelerated their work as well.
Yeah, we've got Ahmed on the team. He
joined as a new grad.
&gt;&gt; Didn't know Rust, learned Rust super
quickly. I've never really seen one like
pick up like a new language like as fast
as that and like, you know, get

[21:00]
as that and like, you know, get
productive. And then it's the way that
he manages to
uh like accept the technology and the
potential and like discover the true
potential of agents is I think faster
than most people on the team. Uh and so
there's sort of like that superpower of
like how quickly are you willing to try
and adopt new ways of working as well.
Um I've seen also like veterans like you
know 10 years in the industry like you
know kind of stick to their um you know
more traditional ways of like developing
and uh it's tough. I'm not sure which
one you know is more effective but it's
pretty clear to me like you know jump
like three months six months from now
it's like you know it's going to be very
clear which one is more effective.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I think honestly it'll be a
surprise to a lot of folks to hear that
there are junior engineers at OpenAI
simply because there's been a widespread
perception over the last 12 months that
these tools can dramatically accelerate
people who know enough of the business
context and have the experience to
utilize them and then juniors coming in

[22:00]
utilize them and then juniors coming in
like I hear from juniors directly saying
I you know can't for the life of me get
a role anywhere uh because I don't have
experience and now you also need to have
the ability to have that experience and
leverage it with AI and it's even harder
and higher.
&gt;&gt; But you you guys have juniors and
they're apparently doing very well. So,
what what's that been like?
&gt;&gt; It's been awesome. Uh I think it brings
such a joy uh to to work as well and
like fresh perspective and then keeps
like us grounded. Um
&gt;&gt; and I have been delightfully surprised
uh about like you know how well that's
been working for us. Uh and it's changed
my perception as well of like you know
what is important like know this
adaptability.
Um, and then like a lot of it was as
well like Ahmed, I'm just going to take
Ahmed as an example, but uh, sorry
Ahmed.
Um, he he was sort of like he grew up
almost with this. Uh so it's like he

[23:01]
almost with this. Uh so it's like he
it's it's it's not quite true but you
know it will be true at some point where
it's like life before coding agents you
know background ambient intelligence
like you know having a little assistant
like in your terminal like that was not
a thing and so it's just supernatural to
them like whereas like for me and others
sometimes I'm just like oh you know it's
like I'm going to go back to Vim and
like you know just like that and like I
don't necessarily like resort to like
using it in the right Okay. And I'm like
slowing myself down in a way. And then
you you look at the way that you know
they are using AI today and you get
inspired. And so it's been actually
really interesting of like how they've
been able to level up the rest of the
team uh who is like on paper more senior
right
&gt;&gt; and a combination that I've seen work
very well is where we do spend a lot of
time on the general architecture of a
codebase. You know it's like the
principle of software engineering still
remain uh and then once you have the

[24:00]
remain uh and then once you have the
right scaffolding then you can just go
and like and run and be extremely fast
and proficient because the agent goals
just like respect the general
scaffolding and the boundaries that
you've set.
Reading between the lines a little bit,
&gt;&gt; it sounds like the quality of character
that is most important that you guys are
seeing on the ground as you work with
these models and to your point evolved
teamwork with these models. I is it
around openness to experience and
learning new things and the ability to
adapt quickly and that's something that
really whether you're junior, whether
you're senior, whether you're technical,
whether you're not technical, that's
what you got to have in the AI age or is
there something else?
I
&gt;&gt; It's interesting. I mean, you know, I
interview a lot of designers. It's
they're definitely qualities that I that
I look for um you know, when hiring. But
I you know it's we I mean we're just
we're we're going through a you know bit
of a step change technology wise and I
think it's just you know being open to

[25:01]
think it's just you know being open to
those new ideas being open to using
those new tools is you know is
definitely helpful. Um you know if I
think back to I'm a child of the the
internet you know I kind of grew up pre-
internet and post internet. I kind of
feel like we're at the same, you know,
the same point now for like software
engineers, creatives, designers, kind
of, you know, preAI, postAI. And I I'm
seeing more and more people who are
like, you know, maybe skeptical or like,
you know, learning about a little as,
you know, as TA says, kind of setting
their ways perhaps they have their
workflows, you know, dipping their toes
in and just seeing the seeing the crazy
benefits and and from there like moving
forward.
that I think curiosity and willingness
to engage is the one most important
thing right now. Uh and it's clear that
we're only at the very beginning of you
know what's going to continue to evolve
like model capabilities are going to
continue to increase like we are not
seeing really a sign of a slowdown like
the 5.2 2 that just came out. Uh, you

[26:01]
the 5.2 2 that just came out. Uh, you
know, it's a very strong model, but it's
also, you know, one of, you know, many
more to come. Uh, and like we have like
a very clear research road map there
that like a lot of the of the team and
the rest of Open is excited about, but
it's just to set
the reality is like this will continue
to revolutionize how we do software
engineering. So if you're not
if you're not willing to accept that
you're it's going to be tough and like
people who are like curious and are
focused on solving problems and are out
there in the world and are like hey just
like how can I help people's lives you
know how can I do this thing faster um
you know they're the ones that are
having a great time right now
that's really been true uh the stories
that I know that are positive hopeful
exciting
tend to be correlated really closely ly
to people who have like a nose for
interesting problems and who have a

[27:00]
interesting problems and who have a
curiosity to solve them and just look at
AI is this really cool super tool that
they can use to solve those problems.
Like I know uh someone who I think he
started out as a music major in college
and now he's a technical founder
&gt;&gt; uh because he felt like being one,
right? And so and now you can do that.
And he just went and solved problems for
customers. And I think that that's one
of the things that I find most
interesting about the trajectory that
we're on is that those stories become
more and more plausible, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I think I think it's it's maybe
one of the underrated or underrated
parts of it in that I think there are a
lot of you know really valid concerns
that people have but I think the thing
that people um you know don't focus on
as much is it it is an equalizer like
you know if I think of you know when I
when I got into design to design as a
kind of teenager you know I was I was
doing a lot of animation I was kind of
hand drawing things I was like doing a
lot of creative stuff making movies with

[28:00]
lot of creative stuff making movies with
my friends in my you know in the garage
you had to build a green screen you had
to you know buy the camera which was
expensive you had to get
you now with like kind of $20 charge of
DC subscription you can as a creative
make like basically anything uh right
you get access to codeex you get access
to all these other things so in many
ways it's an equalizer but it does
require leaping in as you say kind of
having that curiosity and yeah and
really like throwing yourself in and
learning all about it but you know if
you're curious then yeah there's so much
&gt;&gt; we still have complaints that usage
limits and rate limits are too low but
when you think about it like $20 a month
for like a prolific software engineer
that can help you get stuff done. It's
&gt;&gt; crazy.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And like this equalizer thing. It's
there's like so many problems that were
not that were left unsolved before this
and now that will got solved and that's
that's what gets me excited.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I guess that brings me to another
question I had. like you referenced
earlier this idea that it's about

[29:01]
earlier this idea that it's about
choosing what you're going to focus on
in this world because the tools are so
powerful and I think that's definitely
been something I've observed and then
you just mentioned another big piece
I've seen which is that there's a whole
host of problems that uh for lack of a
better term are SE 3 and SE 4 type
problems that are now accessible and
legible and solvable because we have a
tool that can do them. And so on the one
hand you have like more volume you can
attack that's perhaps lower urgency and
on the other hand you have a lot more
value on picking your overall direction
correctly. And I'd be curious to hear
like in practice for you guys what is
that balance like? How do you guys
tackle sort of those two
points on the on the scale? I think that
two things that matter to us is general
conviction that we have based on
information you know around like hey our
models are going to continue to improve
along you know this set of capabilities
like let's build ahead of that so that
we continue to scale and like you know
bring bring more benefit to our users

[30:00]
bring bring more benefit to our users
and then the second part is like what
are people asking for uh and there
deploying intelligence like hender helps
us as well like I was um was on Twitter
the other day like just I started a
thread like of like hey you know it's
like what should we build like you know
what's holding you back like what's not
delightful on Codex right now and then
got you know somewhere around like 250
&gt;&gt; yeah I saw that thread yeah it was a
good thread
&gt;&gt; it it's like 600 like unique ideas but
Codex helped me sift through it all and
you know bring it back then and and uh
based on my own priorities and my own
notes uh like actually section it and
then I was able to discuss it with the
team but so yeah conviction and and
feedback are like two good ways that we
go about it. Do you have others?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, I think that's I think that's
that's a good framework. Um, you know, I
think just to mention a few other areas
where um, you know, where we've been
building. So, we we we have this kind
of, you know, CLI product, we have this

[31:00]
of, you know, CLI product, we have this
web product and we have the ID
extension. We also have some cool
integrations. So, you know, you can add
codecs in Slack and you can add codeex
in linear. Um uh and with with a lot of
these like smaller issues that you that
you spoke about, one really cool trend
that I've been seeing is um you know
there are a lot of small tickets that
you know the end of the year or the end
of the course you kind of the team might
struggle to get round to or they're like
always there and they're kind of coming
up at the end of the meetings and now
right so like you know after you've
triaged a bunch of these things you know
maybe there are a bunch of small ones
that you could just put into one of
these um one of these integrations and
you can just be like you know Codex fix
this or you can literally assign it now
in in in linear and other products. So I
think like some of the small stuff it we
are starting to get to these like really
kind of endto-end workflows of you know
tracking a small problem meaning like
literally writing it down in you know
some short descriptive way and then
having a PR that you can review and
choose choose to merge or not and I
think like being able to free up a lot
of time uh you know from focusing on a

[32:02]
of time uh you know from focusing on a
lot of that low-level work like just
frees up pure resources and capacity to
focus on some of those some of those big
issues. So that's been a cool cool trend
as well which you know obviously you
always have to prioritize things you
always have to you know filter signals
through noise noise and and and make
some kind of hard decisions but I do
think that we've been able to to to to
get a lot of that lowle work um kind of
you know almost kind of enter and
automated so that the team can like
really focus on those big issues. I it
also moves bottlenecks around right so
like as we're solving almost solving
code generation and you can implement
any feature you know like faster and
faster like suddenly you're left with
deploying and maintaining the services
and you know whenever like like your
hardware breaks or like networking has
an issue or like whatever like million
things that can happen uh like now
suddenly that you know you get paged a
little bit more and like you're building
sort of like ahead of the automation
that we're able to uh deploy and the
intelligence is not yet capable of like

[33:00]
intelligence is not yet capable of like
doing all these things like you know
we're not able to yet have codeex deploy
the service and like be on call um and
this is like an area where currently
we're feeling sort of like that load
from having almost solved code
generation.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was going to go there so I'm
glad you did because to me it's like
&gt;&gt; you you've 100x extra code generation or
whatever you want to use the multiple
for but now you've just shifted all of
that down the pipe.
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean it opens up some cool
interesting um you know interface
possibilities like like if you think
about chatbt right you're you're
conversing back and forth with a model
and you know you're asking for some
piece of information and it kind of you
know presents something back to you with
a coding agent it's taking some action
in the world and it's coming back you
know most often in a codebase and the
the kind of artifact and result of that
is some code that you have to review if
you if you want to do something useful
with it. So yeah that at the moment I
think we're in this kind of like
transition period where the meme is that
kind of like you know a lot of like

[34:01]
kind of like you know a lot of like
software engineering is reviewing agent
code. So I think like as a you know as
an interface and as a problem to solve.
I think that's a really interesting one
to to think through. It's one that we're
thinking through and it's one that I
think you know many people in this in
the industry are which is like how do
you how do you not kind of shift the
burden as you say from like um uh you
know kind of like writing code to
basically reviewing code and how can you
make that as smooth as possible and you
know I think we're doing some cool stuff
in that space with with the code review
um you know agents and other things but
I think that's like one emerging uh you
know emerging problem that that that
we'll have to solve soon. One of the
things that's special about code
generation is like you can make it safe.
Uh so you're going to have all the code
generated in a sandbox. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Uh and you have no side effects and so
therefore you know I think also like
just because
&gt;&gt; all the context is there it's textual
like for code like you have you know you
have g you have reboard like a lot of
the automation already exists a lot of
the tooling already exists. So it was
solved first uh I think primarily due to

[35:01]
solved first uh I think primarily due to
a combination of reasons but that's a
big one
&gt;&gt; and you can make it safe like a lot of
the work that we do is like we view
coding agents under the lens of like you
know safety and alignment and like
alignment is not a solved problem which
means that whenever you know you go into
the world of like deployment and being
on call and actually having like real
world like consequences of an agent
taking actions into the world. That is
like a whole other game. Uh where you
know you cannot make it yet. You know
you cannot guarantee that the agent will
not go and like delete your service or
just like you know snoop at like you
know user logs and there's a whole
security aspect um and figuring out you
know how to restrict the set of actions
through like a safe space uh or you have
to solve you know the alignment problem
uh you know whichever will come first.
we're sort of like inching towards that
and finding more and more creative ways
so that our agents can act upon the

[36:01]
so that our agents can act upon the
world safely and that you know you're
able to steer and supervise that. I
think that's like the next frontier of
you know what we're going to unlock like
you know in 2026 it's like good
generation considered mostly solved good
review we've been investing a lot in and
then you know like where are the
bottlenecks now?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of where my head
goes as I look at the next year as well.
I think one of the things that people
tend to get curious about and I think
that will come up more and more as a
conversation in 2026
is how do engineers stay
fluent and able to read code structures
in ways that are meaningful in a world
where code generation is to your point
mostly a solved problem. How do we keep
the fingertippy skills that are relevant
so that you can understand what you're
deploying?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So there's this part that we
didn't discuss on like code
understanding and planning as well like
how quickly can you figure out like how
your system is act functions today

[37:02]
your system is act functions today
&gt;&gt; uh and then you know maybe use that
knowledge in order to plan like your
changes
&gt;&gt; and then after you have your changes
like how do you have them like you know
actually deployed and have an effect
upon the world like you know be it a
product or or something else. Um yeah,
that whole like um it's not just that
but like I am more productive, you're
more productive, everyone in the team is
more productive and it's also keeping up
with all of that. It's like you know
what the hell is everyone doing? Uh it's
like you know there are new features
minted every day. It's like the world is
changing so quickly around u just like
in teams even small teams keeping up
with it all is a challenge
&gt;&gt; and you saying that I just want to be
clear everyone's going to be like very
discouraged to hear you say that.
because we're all trying to keep up.
We're building towards that, right? So,
you want to have
&gt;&gt; you want to have
fast ways to like understand
&gt;&gt; what's going on in the codebase? Uh like
synthesize things. Is text the right way

[38:01]
synthesize things. Is text the right way
to do that? Do you want like a little
report every day? Um you know, how fast
should uh should your agent be in order
to understand to help you understand the
state of the code? But and to your point
about you know kind of staying on top of
um you know staying on top I guess kind
of programming as well. So not kind of
like delegating everything and and still
deeply understanding things like um you
know I I've seen some cool examples some
people internally like occasionally kind
of turn off their internet and they like
I forget the term that they use but
they're like basically kind of like you
know old school coding and they're like
there's no tab complete there's no agent
you know there's no codecs next to them.
Um and you know human curiosity doesn't
go away. Like people still need to learn
like you know the engineers on the team
still read engineering books. I still
read you know engineering books. So I I
don't think that like curiosity is going
away and I don't think like it'll become
this kind of like you know thing that
you hand it off to and you and you lose
all the knowledge yourself. Um and as
you say you know like models can can

[39:00]
you say you know like models can can
help you stay up to date as well. Like
if you know if I'm trying to get to to
know a code base um I can talk to the
model about it. I can you know ask it
like you know how does the back end
integrate here like oh like where does
this component come from can you just
explain the dependencies like the model
itself is also like a you know an
amazing feature so um I think that's
that's a cool angle as well
&gt;&gt; when was the last time
you were really surprised by an emergent
property in a model
this this morning. So, and
&gt;&gt; um
so yeah, I just saw someone build
scaffolding around a model to enable it
to work um on a problem that I thought
was out of reach of the current
capabilities of models uh and solve it,
you know, successfully. And I was really
surprised. I thought we would need to
train the model specifically to be able

[40:00]
train the model specifically to be able
to do this. Um but turns out like it
generalized fairly well and worked um
for like almost 13 hours on this one. Uh
yeah, just just by being more creative
on the tools and the setup around it. I
hadn't seen this done before. So that
was like really surprising to me.
Yeah, I was gonna I mean like most days,
you know, there's there there's some
things that I, you know, probably can't
say, but I think there's one one that
actually stuck out to me which we, you
know, we released it, but if you go in
the web product um and you know, you you
ask uh you ask the model a question and
it can kind of send you some front end
back. It like takes a photo of it and it
like sends it back with it.
&gt;&gt; And like when I first saw that, I
thought that was magical, right? you
know, you know, it's it's kind of using
a bunch of tools, but there is something
like very interesting about thinking
about coding agents, you know, being
able to code, but being able to see,
being able to generate these assets and
like at a conceptual level, I just found
that really interesting as like a as a
creative that, you know, this this model

[41:00]
creative that, you know, this this model
can like do so much more than I thought.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I think that one of the things
that's been my one of my biggest
takeaways as I reflect on 2025 is that I
probably
as much as I was excited about tool use
for models and I was I don't think I
realized the combinatorial power that
gets unlocked when you start to give a
model a good set of tools.
It's and and
there is something there about like what
is the a good set of tools and what the
approach that we've taken with
codeex is you know just give it access
to your computer through like you know
good old Unix tools right it's like give
it a shell uh and let's see how far it
can get by giving it a shell and then in
order to do this safely like have it run
in a sandbox
&gt;&gt; okay
&gt;&gt; and then what emerges from there um is
to us like surprising because we don't

[42:00]
to us like surprising because we don't
necessarily care about like you know how
the model is going to be able to achieve
its task.
&gt;&gt; Uh and so we don't necessarily have a
specific
bias there uh like other than like you
know you should probably use the shell
like a bunch of times. Uh but other than
that it's like it's a very general tool
and that's something that we've done
consciously because we believe it's like
one of the more scalable ways of doing
things as it scales with like the model
capabilities and it's super general.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess one of the
&gt;&gt; go ahead surprising things as well on
the creative side as well is like you
know you know I mentioned that there's
someone that that you know use it to
write documents and things like that and
it turns out that you don't need to give
it a document writing tool. you can just
use reg x and
&gt;&gt; you know like through bash commands edit
documents you know write kind of do
anything. I think that was uh yeah like
perhaps not surprising but but but
pretty pretty amazing capability.
&gt;&gt; Like the other day I was just like

[43:01]
&gt;&gt; Like the other day I was just like
playing with something and then we had
like a codeex SDK and then I just told
Codex about it and then it was able to
just write code and like use the SDK
write a bunch of TypeScript and then
invoke basically invoke itself in order
to achieve more. um like we don't have
native multi- aent in Codex but this is
a form of it that is just completely
emerging because I just read the
documentation I was like oh you know I
can probably get this tool to do
something for me um and I just like
wrote that code invoked it and it just
worked um Codex is very good at like
figuring out ways to solve its problems
&gt;&gt; so codeex essentially wrote in read the
SDK docs instantiated another codeex
instance and used that as a tool to get
a job done
&gt;&gt; that's Right. A bunch of them actually.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Effectively it it bootstrap multi-
aent.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Like without us like you know
thinking about it. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And so there's this thing of like
throwaway code is interesting to think

[44:01]
throwaway code is interesting to think
about it right is like code as a tool.
It's obviously extremely powerful. Um,
but maybe you know there's just like
this whole category of things where like
the agent is just you know writing code
as like it's not a piece of code that
you should ever review as a human or
like you know that you necessarily care
about. It's just a very general tool.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's it's code as a means, not
code as an output.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
So sort of riffing off the tool piece,
I've also seen sort of models with fewer
but more powerful tools that are more
general in nature doing better overall.
So that doesn't surprise me. Um I'm
going to the other side now looking at
the memory side of things and how
longunning agentic tasks handle memory
problems both maybe sort of stateful
memory you have outside the system and
also in context memory management
approaches. How do you guys think about
that for like you know the 20our task or
whatever that you're running? Um h how

[45:00]
whatever that you're running? Um h how
does memory work?
So memory is still an open research
topic like it's clear like something
there will emerge that is better than
you know whatever short-term approaches
you know we're are taking like right now
as a form of memories you know you can
have the model like the model can write
to a file and then you know keep track
of like a lot of its state like you know
through like just markdown files for
example
&gt;&gt; another thing that you know we're doing
is like for very long running
sessions like the model that that goes
beyond its context window. And so the
model is forced to like summarize like
what it's achieved so far and then
reboot itself uh through like a process
that we call like compaction where at
the end it's just like okay like let's
just erase like all of the content of
the the context window and then
summarize it and then you know you

[46:01]
summarize it and then you know you
reboot and then you restart and then you
can do this many many times and
essentially then you're able to have the
model you know the agent work forever.
Uh you know if the task like required to
work forever it would work forever.
In addition to that because it has
access to just like grab and is able to
like search through things it can also
dump additional context that it doesn't
really need to have always in its
context window just to files and that's
like a form of memory. uh with skills as
well like you know you might have skills
in a file somewhere and it's like a form
of memory that is shared between the
user and the agent
&gt;&gt; and you're co-evolving some common
knowledge there where it allows you to
have an agent that you know performs
hopefully better over time. There is a
problem with staleness there where it's
just like it's sort of like a poor
version and a hacky version of memory
and it does feel like this will get
disrupted at some point but that's

[47:00]
disrupted at some point but that's
mostly how we've seen like you know it
tackled and you know it's a very simple
way of achieving it.
Yeah, that's one of the themes that I
think is emerging as we chat a little
bit more is that you are seeing
surprisingly simple primitives
be surprisingly successful at solving
larger generalized problems.
Yeah, I think that's a thing that
a lot of people in the field have
learned a long time ago and I think it's
sort of like being internalized and it's
not necessarily like common general
knowledge of like hey keeping things
simple with models that are evolving in
capabilities month after month after
month is probably the right thing to do
because otherwise you end up with a pile
of complexity that you have to continue
to adapt to the ever evolving
capabilities. So that's why we decide to
think to keep things very simple as
well.
&gt;&gt; That makes a that makes a ton of sense.
Um the other the other big question I
want to get to this gets back to the
whole idea of like technical and

[48:00]
whole idea of like technical and
non-technical folks using codecs. I get
asked a lot how do I think about my
career? How do I think about career
progression in a world where job titles
are increasingly sort of optional hats
that you can take off and put on? Uh and
it's about the problems you solve. What
is the career conversation inside OpenAI
and and how does how does co-evolving
with the model shape that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. How do you feel about this?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a good question. I mean I
think like you know I think one kind of
emerging trend that I'm seeing um among
designers and to an extent some
engineers as well which I personally
think is a positive um uh you know
positive direction which is kind of what
I spoke to earlier with this kind of
idea of kind of equalization is there's
less of a focus on kind of credentials
and going through certain routes right
to get to to to kind of you know ascend
certain kind of peaks of credentials and
more a kind of focus on kind of what

[49:00]
more a kind of focus on kind of what
you've done and what you can show and
kind of like you know code wins. So
particularly in the design community,
you know, what I'm seeing is a lot of
people are kind of building really
exciting things, putting them out there
and from a career perspective, you know,
building up profiles and um you know,
kind of like work through what they've
done and what they show and no one cares
where they went to school, you know, and
all of those other things perhaps of the
past, which sometimes good, you know,
sometimes, you know, bad from like a
from kind of a credential point of view.
So I do think there is definitely a kind
of like learning through doing and kind
of you know kind of proving through you
know what you've done. Um which I think
is is an exciting uh trend and I you
know I think also you know a lot of like
creator economy and you know the rise of
you know podcasts and personal media is
is kind of similar right it's just like
anyone can kind of do you know you can
just do things is the internal phrase um
but you can just kind of you know do
things and show you and show your you
know show your skills through that
direction. So I think like that's
personally one trend that I've seen um

[50:01]
personally one trend that I've seen um
you know to broader broader trends you
know I don't know if I have as much of a
perspective there but
&gt;&gt; yeah yeah I think you can just do things
very much a mantra uh the second mantra
we have is like I am also curious about
this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Uh this is that's sort of like the two
things that people uh you know exhibit
at OpenAI. I'd say it's less a challenge
on um career progression at OpenAI. It's
a you know we look at impact and that's
sort of like you know how you progress.
It's it's been a challenge on you know
interviewing and finding the right
people because the traits that you're
looking for and you know like how you
can succeed has sort of like broadened.
Before it was like do you program well?
It's like oh let's give you a series of
like programming tasks and like you know
really hard ones and you know we're
going to pick the best talent there. But
now it's not that easy anymore. It's
like you you can actually be very
successful, you know, if you're like not
going to traditionally be like a top
performer at like, you know, hard
programming like tasks. And so like

[51:01]
programming like tasks. And so like
being able to um find the talent and be
more creative here has been a challenge
for us and like we're sort of like
evolving our thinking there, but it's
been very interesting.
Do do you guys have a silver bullet for
the persistent issue we see with
interviewing where people will have chat
GPT up on the side and we'll just be
kind of reading responses back in the
interview?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean we we bring people uh on
site uh for for a lot of the interviews
and then it's also just a a reality of
like hey you know in the job you know
you're going to use AI all the time. So
it's more of a the interview itself
needs to evolve and maybe not you know
limiting like you know the tools that
people can use.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think it's like one way of
thinking is like how are you using AI to
get around some constraint and then
another is thinking of it in an
empowering way and you know you need to
hit certain baselines. You need to um
you know you need to to to to have
certain skills in place but also kind of
are you open to using tools and how can

[52:01]
are you open to using tools and how can
you understand how those those can give
you leverage.
Yeah, it reminds me a little bit of one
of Jeff Bee's um favorite interview
questions where he asks people um how do
you solve uh a problem that has sort of
two obvious solutions like I want I I
want to uh have a higher quality car
that goes faster, right? How do you do
that? Uh and you have to pick which one
to optimize for. And the trick is you're
supposed to invent your way to both. Um
you're supposed to think outside the
box. You're supposed to think around the
constraint. You're supposed to push on
both. And that part of it is just
measuring the willingness to break the
mental box.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And
is the point there that you know if you
were using AI on the side like you know
you wouldn't get you wouldn't come up
with like a creative
&gt;&gt; uh I don't know that it's necessarily
that. I think sometimes I've seen that.
I think
&gt;&gt; the the best way I've seen to push

[53:01]
&gt;&gt; the the best way I've seen to push
people off script let's assume a remote,
right? because I think on-sightes are
critical, but we'll we'll take that as
red. Um, if it's a remote interview, I
think the most effective tool I've seen
is really to push off the standard
behavioral interview script pretty fast.
&gt;&gt; Um, and push people into
a really honest conversation that
demands some higher level trade-off
thinking and
they don't really have time to feed it
into a model and get a response in real
time. and you see pretty quickly
what their thinking tool set is in their
head and that gives you a sense of like
what they're going to bring as a partner
with AI uh when when they start to work.
&gt;&gt; We have this problem now, right? Like
not sure if you're reading the questions
off the screen on the right.
&gt;&gt; I actually am not. I have no questions
up. I'm staring at myself and you guys
and I'm just kind of
&gt;&gt; So are we. Sorry. Delightfully simple.

[54:01]
&gt;&gt; So are we. Sorry. Delightfully simple.
Yeah, I think it's more fun that way.
Like we get to kind of take the
conversation where we want to go. Now, I
did prep with chat GPT. I absolutely
prepped with questions, but then I was
like, ah, you know, they're okay and I'm
just going to riff it. So, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Interesting. Uh, you know, another
question we have. I know we only have,
you know, a few minutes left here. Um, I
think one of the things that we haven't
dug into yet that I hear a lot is, and
maybe this is like half a design
question, half an engineering question.
So, for the two of you together, like,
it's going to be perfect. Um,
I hear a lot of talk, especially when,
um, I put out videos talking about new
models. I'm going to do that for Chad
GBT 5.2 here. People will say, "What's
the difference? I see the same chatbot.
&gt;&gt; I see the same terminal.
I see a different label." Uh, how do I
know that this is actually better? And

[55:01]
know that this is actually better? And
like we've even had like comments from I
think Sam and others that say chat is
essentially a saturated use case. And I
kind of agree like I think it's mostly
saturated out. How do you convey the
significant not significance is the
wrong word the step change that you get
in capabilities over a six month or year
period to someone who is seeing the same
UI.
&gt;&gt; It's a good question. I mean I think
like if it depends on the use case right
like you know I think like what you know
like as a designer or design engineer I
kind of work with you know different
models and then for some for some tasks
I like one you know for others I like
the other just like you know many other
products um or if I'm in chatbt if I'm
asking like a super code question right
I'll just like leave it on auto or kind
of you know some low reasoning model and
if I'm really wanted to think maybe I'll
use pro or something like that so I
think it's one of these things where you
kind of like you know you test it and
and it depends on on the situation. Um

[56:02]
and it depends on on the situation. Um
you know that being said like we also we
have a bunch of research evals you know
so I think there are certain barometers
that you can use but we've kind of
talked through this interview about um
you know the different capabilities that
different model steps unlock and I think
we have consistently seen that right
like models today at least for coding
are like substantively different from
where they are when I joined this team.
Um so it I think it's a case of just try
them. Try try many different ones like
you know see what you like. Some things
are good for different use cases. Um but
uh but um but yeah I I I think like
maybe one good mental model perhaps that
that people don't think about is you
know when thinking about these things
they think with a snapshot of where we
are currently with how you interact with
chriier models. And I think in five
years time it's going to be very
different right like if you think about
what models these new capabilities can
unlock different products will have very
different experiences. You know you
might you know is chat always the best

[57:01]
might you know is chat always the best
um uh interface like you know you you
might not be interacting with a model at
all but it's still doing work for you in
the background and in that case right
model quality and and the model that
you're using is very different. So yeah
&gt;&gt; to come back to that where it's like
that's code review is again an example
of that where it just happens in the
background the model improves and you
know we know like the the either it got
faster or it's able to spot more things
it's like yay you just got an upgrade
for free you don't have to think about
it uh and you know you just benefit from
it like every day and then codeex itself
is a different product from chat uh
agents benefit still like from a a lot
of improvements on like we definitely
see like whenever we improve on
reliability like frontier intelligence
how long it can it can go but then it
feels like we will need another product
at some point as well where you're not
going to run codeex for like 3 days in

[58:00]
going to run codeex for like 3 days in
your terminal um yeah maybe people will
maybe people will right but it's like at
what point do we have agents that just
run forever
&gt;&gt; uh in that you you interact with it's
like that's going to feel like very
different. Maybe you text it from time
to time. Maybe you were going to call it
and it's just like we yet have to invent
like the right product around this. Like
the models are not there yet but they
will be. Uh
&gt;&gt; and then that's going to be like oh wow
you know it's just like we're like GPT7
right? And it's like it'll be like
obvious. Um and in the meantime it sort
of feels like oh okay it's like it feels
incremental at times. Um but then when
you look back like six months ago you're
like heck like none of this was
possible. Exactly. Like I did a video
this morning um about this idea that
straight line extrapolation is
surprisingly hard to experience in real
time. Uh like you're sitting there and
like like you said like people get used
to the products so fast and people get
disappointed and frustrated by the
products. I I vividly remember uh how

[59:02]
products. I I vividly remember uh how
excited I was working with Chad GPT5
thinking and how it felt like a step
change and then I immediately within two
days found a bunch of things that I
didn't like about it and wanted to fix
and like that's just how it goes because
that's how humans sort of scale our
taste I guess and I think one of the
things that I've been thinking about is
how do we
take our human defaults where we seem to
assume a static world and start to
transition to a human default where we
assume a dynamic world where we're
living on the slopey part of an S-curve
and like we have to think about rapid
gains and capability as a default base
case.
All right. Uh for our last couple
minutes, do you have a question for me
or the audience? Like I know you guys
are always hungry for voice of
customers. There's something that's been
bugging you that you would want to ask.
&gt;&gt; What are what are you? I mean, I'm
always curious like how people use

[1:00:00]
always curious like how people use
coding agents outside of coding. Like,
you know, you mentioned that maybe you
use it, you know, you use chatbt to get
ready for the interview, but like how do
you use it in your in your day-to-day?
&gt;&gt; I love that. Um, so I am a relentless
omnivore when it comes to AI models and
I tend to
jump around
really quickly,
but I have settled task groups that once
I decide where I want them to live, I
tend to put them there. And so right now
I am using chat GPT.
Well, it was 5.1, now it's going to be
5.2 do for uh a lot of the structuring
and brainstorming and researching and
thinking that I do as I start to think
about pieces that I write um and what
the stories are kind of and how it kind
of comes together. Um I'll use codecs
when I want I I call it like hard
thinking mode. I think that it's been

[1:01:00]
thinking mode. I think that it's been
marketed like I think Chad GBT 5.2 2 Pro
or 5.1 Pro, like people talk about it
and I've tried it out and I like it, but
I think it is sometimes
uh overexpressive
for what I need. And that's why I
mentioned conciseness as a value I
appreciate in codeex is that CEX comes
back and it doesn't give me, you know, a
thousand tokens. It just comes back with
a really concise answer. And I I love
the legibility of that and I kind of get
addicted to it. And so when I need
something that is a very clear concise
analysis and it can be a financial
analysis, it can be a project analysis,
it can be an M&A analysis, it can be uh
a doc analysis, it can be a response to
something that is really complicated
that I need to think through and I want
to draft it out. Codeex is great for all
of that because it just it it boils
really cleanly, right? You get exactly
what it boils down to and it's really
dependable that way. Um,
I get uh a lot of mileage right now out
of the document tool creation

[1:02:04]
of the document tool creation
or the tools used to create documents
from clot. I know they're the other
guys, but they are definitely shipping
well there. And just OPUS 4.5 really,
really, really does well on that. When I
want a PowerPoint, when I want an Excel,
it does well. Um, I've been both amazed
and also frustrated by uh using Notebook
LM and Nano Banana 2 to or really it's
is it three or is it no it's two is
Gemini 3 anyway using it to ship
powerpoints uh because I don't get
editability and I hate that but I get
all of these lovely graphics from Nano
Banana and that's fantastic. Um, and so
I think we're in this place where people
are um, we're tool omnivores because
we're desperate to get the best thing in
the moment for the particular task. And
we all tend to have like that list of
paper cuts. Like I was like, I don't
like the PowerPoint piece. I think

[1:03:00]
like the PowerPoint piece. I think
Claude Opus 4.5 has good tool use, but
at the same time, the ability to create
decorated PowerPoints is not really
there. Um, I think you guys have a ways
to go in PowerPoint creation right now.
Um, but the completeness that I'm
seeing, like I'm doing some early work
on shadow GPT 5.2 and and like it spits
out a very complete document. Like it is
a complete answer that thoroughly
answers the question. And so,
one of the things I preach a lot is like
you must get really fingertippy with
your models to actually be able to use
them to solve problems in a way that's
differentiated from just type something
into a chatbot. So, it's a long way of
saying I I have about half a dozen
models and I use them all every single
day, including like a bunch of open
eyes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then you have this like mental
model of like, you know, what is this
model good for? What is this model good
for? That's right.
&gt;&gt; And there isn't yet this like, you know,
perfect model that like answers all your

[1:04:00]
perfect model that like answers all your
needs
&gt;&gt; and your needs changing. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Because they keep changing. And that's
the thing that you've emphasized that I
really strongly agree with is that if I
were to try and boil this into a table,
it would look incorrect because I have a
um an evolving sense map of where these
models are good and not good. And it's
very it's very fine grain. Like I have
learned which models read handwritten
tally marks well and which ones don't.
Um because
&gt;&gt; when you refresh that thinking like you
know that knowledge like when you when
you allow yourself to say like hey let
me try this other one
&gt;&gt; all the time like I and that's I think
one of the things that like people lean
into with my channel is that I am
extremely open to new models and new
experiences changing my priors because I
think that you have to be to be at all
helpful to people in evolving this
landscape because you have to assume
that any given new model release from

[1:05:01]
that any given new model release from
any major model maker could upend a key
part of your workflow because it's just
better and you should not sit there and
say well Chad GPT before didn't do this
so I'm not going to pay attention to
this tool use capability it's like no
you you should you should assume that
the model is fully capable of surprising
you and test it carefully so I think one
of the things I've been thinking about
is what what we mean when we talk about
useful work and what useful work looks
like and we've talked a ton about codecs
and obviously with codecs useful work is
poll reviews uh PR reviews uh it's it's
coding it's it's work that you can
define in terms of the uh you know bits
and bites that the model outputs it gets
a little bit more complicated with other
knowledge work and so I'd be curious how
you guys think about that maybe beyond
codecs maybe looking at GPT 5.2 too.
&gt;&gt; I would say it's like it's similar
question in difficulty like even just
for coding. Uh there are certain
benchmarks like sweet bench they're like

[1:06:01]
benchmarks like sweet bench they're like
super saturated by now like do they
really measure how much use you're
getting out of the model like in
day-to-day use and also like know we
talked about like how we're going beyond
just like code generation and then it's
like helping you understand things
helping you like review like deploy like
doing CIS admin tasks and like more and
more things. So you know helping you
build like design prototypes. So it's
all about like this economical value
that you're able to create and you know
open like really worked hard to like on
GDP val like 5.2 to soda on GDP val I
think it's like interesting to go and
like from really hyper specific
saturated evals to a more a better
understanding of like how is this
impacting the real world you know
obviously no eval is perfect but I think
whenever a model like it you know puts a
new soda on something that measures
economical values like it's worth taking
a look at it
&gt;&gt; yeah it I I appreciate that you call
that out because I think it gets at this
idea that people get suspicious of

[1:07:01]
idea that people get suspicious of
benchmarks when they get reported on and
you get close to 100%. It's like okay
but what's another 2%. Whereas I think
there's something around
maybe an implicit measure of
generalizability that you get when you
get to some of these measures of
economic impact. So GDP val I think is a
good one. Um isn't there one around
vending machines? That's another one
that's sort of in that vein as well.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a fun one.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a good one. Yeah. Is it
vending bench or vendor? Yeah,
but with GTP val it's clearly not
saturated yet
&gt;&gt; and then that's usually the cycle that
you see with eval is you know eval gets
published it against traction you know
gets saturated like it did measure
something useful at some point and then
maybe after a couple of months or years
like it's not really measuring anything
very meaningful anymore because you know
every model is performing more or less
like the same on it and then you have a
new one like GGP is like measuring
something more interesting again uh and
given it's not Saturday. It's always
interesting to pay attention to it.

[1:08:00]
interesting to pay attention to it.
Vending Bench is also a fun one.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sort of underlines the story
that we've been sort of telling through
this whole hour together where we've
talked about this idea that progress
just keeps happening relentlessly with
these models and that there isn't a
wall. And you know, contrary to popular
reports, right, there isn't a wall.
We've continue to see progress and it's
something that allows us to continue to
publish new benchmarks because we keep
knocking down the old ones.
Yeah, an interesting thing there is sort
of like what are the benchmarks of the
future?
&gt;&gt; Uh, and that would be pointless to have
now because every model would just score
like zero.
&gt;&gt; Uh, like being able to be the CEO of a
multi-billion dollar company, for
example. Like, you know, that would be a
useful benchmark. Like, do we allow
models yet to run like multi-billion
dollar corporations? Like, you know, not
quite. Uh, but I'm pretty sure at some
point, you know, we're going to have
these kinds of crazy bench. They seem
crazy now, but like they're not going to
be crazy, you know, like in a couple
years.
&gt;&gt; That's a really interesting sort of

[1:09:01]
&gt;&gt; That's a really interesting sort of
brain teasers. What are what are the
evals of 2026 and 2027 that we're going
to turn to as measures of value?
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having us, Nate.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thank you. That was a good one to
end on. Uh this has been lots of fun,
guys.
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much. Next time.
