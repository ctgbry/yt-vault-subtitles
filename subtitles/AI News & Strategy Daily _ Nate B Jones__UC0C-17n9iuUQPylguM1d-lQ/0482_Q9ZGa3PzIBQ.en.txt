I've been talking a lot about OpenAI
monetizing ads and we have seen them do
three things that argue for ads maybe
four in the last week. One is starting
to hire a head of monetization and ads.
That's pretty transparent. Two is
launching Pulse for pro users where they
actually show you cards. You can see
sponsored cards so easily there guys.
And then three launching Sora 2. Again a
super easy platform for ads. Now the
fourth thing they are working with Etsy
and Shopify on checkout within chat GPT
and so now they would own the whole
funnel right well all of this helps to
answer the question for all of us about
how they are thinking about ads and how
they are thinking about maintaining the
perceived integrity of the system when
you get answers from chat GPT
