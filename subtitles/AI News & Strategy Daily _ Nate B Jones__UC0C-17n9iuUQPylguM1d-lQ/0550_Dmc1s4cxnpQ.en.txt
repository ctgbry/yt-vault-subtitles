I want to go through with you the core
issues that we see as builders, as users
of AI, as designers of AI systems. What
is the root of the memory problems we
experience? If we're at a systems design
level, if we're at a usage level, if if
we are even using Chad GPT, why are
memory problems so sticky and hard to
untangle? Why have we not seen better
solutions in the market? I think there
are good reasons for that. And then once
we go through those root causes, how can
we start to think about solving them?
How can we think about solving them as
users? How can we think about solving
them as builders? So, I'm going to go
through five root causes and then we're
going to flip the script and I'm going
to go through eight principles for
building a solution because I want you
to walk away from this and I want you to
feel empowered to actually design better
memory systems. I don't want you to wait
around for someone in Silicon Valley to
make a pitch and get funded for this.
You can design your own solution
