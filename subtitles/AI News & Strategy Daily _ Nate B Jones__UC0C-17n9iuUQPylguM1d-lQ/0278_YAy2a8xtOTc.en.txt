This is one of those things that I keep
emphasizing with AI. Just try it. You
will learn if you are willing to try. If
you're with teams and you're trying to
sort of not teams the software, teams
the people like people teams, let your
team try it. Celebrate the wins your
team is getting with co-pilot. Encourage
your team by showing them that you value
their time saved. And you will not just
pile more work on. You will not just
tell them you must not be that good at
your job because you did it that fast.
you'll actually celebrate the win. Okay,
here's the reality. I'm going to go
right back to the beginning. The CTO
wrote me and was like, they're only
using email, 6,000 person company. These
companies are are using 10% of a
six-figure investment in some cases,
whereas the ones that are using it
fully, they're getting or more return on
investment. The swing that I see here is
insane.
