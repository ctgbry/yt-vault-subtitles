There is a frog boiling in the pot
problem around media reaction right now
and I'm putting in this at the end
because media reaction isn't the most
important thing but I am including it
because I think the way we think about
the evolving intelligence curve does
matter. We're living through a
historical moment. This model is a
significant step forward in the way we
interact with AI. It is closer to
interacting with us as a thought partner
and I think the reduction in
hallucinations helps there. I think the
work done on stuff like medical where
it's high value helps there. I think the
work done on improving writing helps
there. People are going to feel like
they can trust this model more. People
are going to feel like it's right more
and they will be correct about that.
If you compare that to the flashbang
that came when chat GPT entered the
scene in the first place or the stunning
jump to chat GPT4 which may be hard to
remember but it was there or the jump to
03 reasoning. People I think are
assuming that it will feel the same way
with shed GPT5.
