Pattern four, AI augmented debugging and
testing. You want to make sure that you
are pasting your actual error traces and
communicating clearly what's wrong. That
you are being very specific and
prescriptive about how the system will
get to root cause about the kind of
suggested fix you will accept in line
with your house rules. And you should
apply fixes cautiously, especially in
production databases. Pattern five, AI
assisted code reviews. You want to be in
a place where you can prompt for review
of the code and then constrain the
review to just the space you want looked
at. Keep in mind, humans will have to do
a second pass, but you can use a tool
like Devon to go and get a lot done
quickly.
