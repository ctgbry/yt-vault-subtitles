Can this agent mode go rogue? The answer
is yes. And Sam Alman himself warned
about it. He said, "I would not use this
for email triage because someone, and he
tweeted this on Maine, someone could
write an email to me with a prompt that
agent mode would read when it opened the
email and that prompt would hijack agent
mode." That is a new form of prompt
injection. That is a new form of attack,
an email as a prompt injection attack.
Well, if we weren't thinking it before,
Sam, we're sure thinking it now. Thanks
for giving everybody the idea there.
He's right. That is absolutely a way you
could prompt inject and hack these
operator mode agents. And the challenge
is you can do that with other websites,
too. You can put text at lower contrast
that humans are not going to notice that
an agent might notice.
