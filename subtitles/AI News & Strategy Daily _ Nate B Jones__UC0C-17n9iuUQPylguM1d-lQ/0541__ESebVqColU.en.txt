The state of AI report is finally out.
This is an annual report from Airst
Street Capital with Nathan Benich at the
lead. It's been published for the last
eight years. Every time it comes out, it
shifts the industry. I'm going to go
through and I'm going to summarize the
313 slides in just a few minutes so that
you get the TLDDR. So, first things
first, the takeaway is that the model IQ
contest is over and the infrastructure
wars are just beginning. So the thesis
is fundamentally we have been pushing
and pushing and pushing to make
incrementally smarter models. But now
what really matters is systems
specifically three compounding forces
that drive those systems. The capability
to cost curve, the distribution
question, and the physical
infrastructure question. We're going to
get to all three of those, but the
thesis of this entire 313 slide report
is that those three drivers are going to
matter more in terms of practical AI
than just model IQ. And so the winners

than just model IQ. And so the winners
in the race are going to be the ones
that can route computational work to the
cheapest capable model rather than just
defaulting to Frontier or Smart IQ
options.
