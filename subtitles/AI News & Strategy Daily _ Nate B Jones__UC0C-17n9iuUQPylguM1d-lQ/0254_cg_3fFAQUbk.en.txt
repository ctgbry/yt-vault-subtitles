We need answers for jobs that do not
depend on showing that you have gone to
college and know all the things because
those things are devoid of meaning now.
And so we have to rethink from the
ground up what makes a human job
interesting and worth doing and
meaningful. And it doesn't make it
easier to do that if all around us
everyone is shouting about AI taking
away jobs. It is much more productive to
sit there and actually ask yourself,
well, what do we know about what AI is
good at? And what do we know about what
AI is architecturally maybe not so great
at? And if we know what those things
are, can we start to get a sense of
where our skills might lie in the
future?
