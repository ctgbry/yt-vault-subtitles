I want to leave you with this. Rag is a
way to solve some of AI's biggest
problems. Hallucination, stale
knowledge, lack of memory. It can be
started as simple as a few lines of
code. And it does scale up to the
enterprise scale, although not with 15
lines of code. This is why so many
enterprises and businesses are thinking
about rag moving toward Brack. It solves
problems that are real if implemented
well. The tools do exist today. I've
mentioned some of them on this video.
You have no excuses not to start if you
have a problem that fits in the fairly
wide rag problem space. Most of us have
run across hallucination stale a stale
knowledge and memory issues. But if
you're going to do it, pick a small use
case. Build just a prototype to start.
Don't pour the concrete. Measure the
impact and eval it. Evaluate it and then
learn and iterate.
