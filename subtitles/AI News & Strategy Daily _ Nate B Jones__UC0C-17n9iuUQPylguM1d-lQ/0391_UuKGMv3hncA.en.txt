Number three, model drift and mismatch.
So old workflows produce different
outputs after migration to chat GPT5.
That is somewhat inevitable. I would
suggest if you've been running workflows
in production that you I I hope that you
have been keeping track of your prompts
that you have been versioning your
prompts and that when you have a new
model that is responding differently
with outputs because drift is inevitable
with new models. any new model would
have produced drift.
