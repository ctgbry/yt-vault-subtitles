Job applicants have to demonstrate
knowledge and they only can do it by
resume because that's what we've always
done. And if they can only do it by
resume because that's what we've always
done, we have no way of knowing if
applicants are any good because the
stoastic parrots can simulate a resume
perfectly. So what do we do? And right
now the truth is no one knows. Some of
the big companies are coming in and
saying come in person. Some of them are
coming in and saying do something on a
whiteboard. Write something where it's
clearly not an AI helping you. At least
for now until the AI is in your glasses.
The AI is not in my glasses. The point
is that we answers for jobs that do not
depend on knowledge. We need answers for
jobs that do not depend on showing that
you have gone to college and know all
the things because those things are
devoid of meaning. Now.
