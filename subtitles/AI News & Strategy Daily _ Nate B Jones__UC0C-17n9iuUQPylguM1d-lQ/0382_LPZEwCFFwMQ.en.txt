So be aware of that. You may not want to
use it for coding. Creative writing, you
have to have a narrative with a
particular singular voice. I would not
use GPT5 Pro for this. And I don't know
of many people who are, so this feels
like an easy one. But you're going to
get maybe some really coherent,
thoughtful plot feedback from this
model, plot architecture, where it's
going to give you its solution to a
particular plot problem, but it's not
going to make the bold creative choice.
It's not going to write in a particular
voice. That is not really what this
model does. Conversation. And this is a
really important LLM use case. A lot of
the LLM use cases that we see in
production are conversational use cases.
This is not a model for conversation.
One, it takes a long time. And two,
human dialogue needs consistency and
personality. If it feels robotic, which
GPT5 Pro is going to feel robotic. If it
doesn't feel sequential, if it if it
jumps around, humans aren't going to
like
