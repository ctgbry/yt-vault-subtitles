reports jumped over the weekend that as
big as the $200 million pay package was
that Mark Zuckerberg offered and that
was accepted by someone to come to Meta,
I think that was the biggest headline. I
think they all vary between 10 and $200
million, which is just generational
wealth, right? It's incredible.
Apparently, at least 10 researchers at
OpenAI turned down, the rumor goes, $300
million paychecks. $300 million. That is
more than most professional athletes
make. That is show Otani money. if
you're a baseball fan. So, the reason
I'm calling this out is that this is
part of Meta's playbook. If you're
looking at the trust fingerprint for
Meta, they are very heavily into
spending money to catch up aggressively
and making sure that they can back up
their demos. Even if their demos were in
the move fast, breakthrough, break
things spirit initially.
