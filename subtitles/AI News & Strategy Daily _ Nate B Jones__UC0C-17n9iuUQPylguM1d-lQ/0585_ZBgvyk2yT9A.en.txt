I don't think we talk enough about the
categories of AI adoption failure and I
want to lay them out really cleanly so
that we have a vocabulary to talk about
them to address them and ultimately to
get back on track. Let's start with
number one, the integration tarpit.
Let's say engineering ships working AI
code in weeks, but sales and legal and
compliance cycles were never meant to
run that fast. They stretch into months
or longer. Cross team stakeholder
meetings are multiplying all over the
business talking about policies and
approvals. The root cause here is that
the organization's budget for AI
development was structured in terms of
dollars and cents and not in terms of
coordination cost. When you are working
with a prototype, it's very simple. But
a prototype does not equal a system that
fits data architecture, compliance, and
politics together. Yes, organizational
politics are relevant.
