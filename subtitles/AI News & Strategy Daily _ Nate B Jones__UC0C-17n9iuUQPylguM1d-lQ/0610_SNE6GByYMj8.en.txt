We are at a point where individuals can
level that playing field. I want to sort
of go back to why we're doing this. We
live in a system where institutions have
historically had an exclusive monopoly
on complex information. They don't
anymore. AI levels the playing field on
information complexity. But
unfortunately, most people don't know
how to use AI to actually level that
playing field. Because just like
everything else in AI, it's how you use
it that matters. It also has the tools
to go and get current documents. But if
you don't know how to ask for it, if you
don't know what steps to take, you're
stuck with a very generic, hey, can you
help? I want to make sure that you have
the tools to speak to the greatest
machine intelligence we have ever made
so that you can use that intelligence as
a tool to solve problems that we have
never been able to solve as a species.

level that playing field. And so this is
much bigger than a story about someone
being charged a ridiculous amount of
money by an institution over a visit to
the ER. This is a story about
institutions everywhere trying
desperately to hold on to a monopoly on
information that AI is eating away. Join
the revolution,
