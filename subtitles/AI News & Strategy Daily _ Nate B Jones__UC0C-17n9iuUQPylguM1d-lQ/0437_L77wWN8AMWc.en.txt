You can set up claude with multiple
agents to do that in claude code for
example. What is the E? Execution.
Execution environment. Is it cloud
contained? So it runs on the provider
sandbox. Chad GPT claude both do that in
their application interfaces. Is it
integrated into your IDE? So it works
within the development environment
inside cursor for example. Is it
platform hosted with dedicated agent
runtime? Naden can be that. It doesn't
have to be that depending on how you
configure it. Is it infrastructure
spanning? Can it deploy or access
different external systems and use
complex tools? Manis can do that. You
can configure cloud code to do that as
well. And so I when you look across
this, it's easy for you to say, well
Nate, you just said a bunch of things,
right? You said it needs to have
complexity def defined execution
environment defined autonomy defined the
modality defined
