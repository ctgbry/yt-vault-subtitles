AI has dropped the cost of business
writing to nearly zero and most of the
businesses I work with or know about are
drowning in AI documents and have huge
issues with AI business writing. This
video is how you troubleshoot those,
what the principles are for using AI
well in business writing situations, and
then I'm going to walk through an actual
example of a prompt I'm using that sets
a much higher bar for AI business
writing than I've typically seen. And
we'll just go through it. So, first
let's get into the principles. The first
thing I want you to keep in mind overall
is that the real bottleneck in AI
assisted writing is never capability of
AI. People think it's the model. It's
not the model. Don't let anyone tell you
it's the model. It's organizational
ability to articulate what constitutes
good work. And typically that means
we've relied on individuals to have
instincts for what constitutes good work
instead of actual structured information
about what constitute good work. AI
forces tacet knowledge into explicit
standards and that is very very hard for

standards and that is very very hard for
most businesses. You cannot rely on I
know it when I see it because AI cannot
read your mind. It is not that good.
It's never going to be that good. Every
quality criteria needs to be concrete
enough to specify, to test, and to
verify. That is the only way through on
the business writing side. And if people
say, "Well, I don't have time for that."
I've got to ask you, do you have time
for the business writing you're drowning
