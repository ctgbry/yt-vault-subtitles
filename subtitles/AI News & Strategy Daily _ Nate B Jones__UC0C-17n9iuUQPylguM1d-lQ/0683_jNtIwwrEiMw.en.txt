Anti-gravity is shifting our sense of
how we pay attention in coding in ways
that we all need to understand, even if
you're not a coder. Because what
anti-gravity does is it dares you to
focus on where you need to intervene
with an agent that's building something
rather than to focus you on the code
side of things. And we have seen
glimpses of this in the direction that
cursor is evolving, but anti-gravity
really really leans in. And I think that
this implies that a lot of the great
work that we do going forward is going
to look weirdly similar for great
product managers and great tech leads
because it's going to to be work that is
done by people who can describe what
they want built really really clearly
and who can smell a bad artifact really
really quickly. And so really, you
should evaluate how you want to work
with Gemini less in terms of its ability
to purely write code and more in terms

to purely write code and more in terms
of your ability to articulate intent,
see useful results, and your ability to
quickly refine and review. Increasingly
the models will get there on the code
that needs to be done. But you need to
be the one who is given space to review,
refine, pay attention, and decide what's
acceptable.
