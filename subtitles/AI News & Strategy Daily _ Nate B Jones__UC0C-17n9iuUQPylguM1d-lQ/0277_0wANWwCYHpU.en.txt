People have been so primed by the news
to be afraid of AI stealing your job
that they won't listen to anything else
until you address it. And that must come
from the leadership team and preferably
from the CEO. And by the way, there's
not a ton of evidence that AI is
actually stealing jobs in aggregate
right now. The it's not just me saying
that. Ethan Mollik is one of the best
known AI uh academics out there. He
studied AI extensively. He tweeted as
recently as like early July 2025 that
there was just not much evidence that AI
is actually responsible for significant
job attrition. Isolated instances or
expectations changing for job roles 100%
changing job descriptions. Yes. scaling
up, hiring for AI specific roles.
