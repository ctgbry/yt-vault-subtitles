So 49%
of organizations draw incorrect
conclusions because their data lacks
business context. Again drawing from
this Salesforce survey. So, as an
example, let's say that the data says
revenue is $2 million and the customer
is Acme Corp and it's the third quarter
revenue number, but maybe that
particular database row or that
particular fragment retrieved by the AI
does not specify that the $2 million was
a one-time contract, not recurring
revenue, and your agents are now
inappropriately adding $2 million in ARR
to your reporting. What I'm saying is
that is not uncommon and that is a great
illustration of how the context really
matters when you are trying to construct
efficient agentic systems. You have to
get context that works. So you need
semantic layers that encode business
definitions, relationships and logic.

customers from universal single source
definition sources of truth. And if you
don't have that, if you don't have a
semantic layer that defines the meaning
across the top of your data at a high
level, then the more data you add
without context just means more
confidently wrong answers.
