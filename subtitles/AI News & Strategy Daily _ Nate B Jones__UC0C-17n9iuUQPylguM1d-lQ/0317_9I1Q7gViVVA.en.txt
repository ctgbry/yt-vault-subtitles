So, just as we defined AI agents that
are doers, as LLMs and tools and
guidance, I'm going to tell you that if
you want to use agents as modelers, you
add one thing more. You have agents that
are LLMs with tools and guidance in a
simulated world. That's the last part.
And that's why the simulation matters so
much with the warehouse that Jensen
introduced. Every other example we have
of model building simulates the world.
Now, it might not be like a 3D video
game world simulation. It might be a
simulation that models the relevant
constraints of the world in text in
words. That can happen too. And all you
have to do, like we we do this all the
time, there are prompts that will set up
your LLM to act as an agent within a
reality simulator. And all you're doing
is telling the agent to act in a certain
way with this policy and guidance given
these constraints around the
