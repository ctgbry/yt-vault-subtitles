Five things that I think you can take
with you and that I think are unlikely
to be disrupted by AI given where jagged
intelligence is going. Number one is
taste. Knowing how to solve a problem
matters. Choosing the right thing from
the million options AI gives you
matters. Understanding what not to build
matters. Taste matters. Extreme agency
is number two. The ability to operate
with minimal direction. Maximize
ownership. If AI is good at execution,
humans must get good at goal setting. We
must get good at defining priorities,
course correcting, building systems.
Agency is going to be highly valued.
Number three is learning velocity. This
one does not get talked about as much.
It's not about knowledge accumulation.
It's about speed of adaptation. If the
half-life of a technical skill is being
compressed farther and farther, then the
value is going to acrue to those who can
learn faster than knowledge inflates,
who can surf the wave of obsolescence
instead of just drowning in it. That's
