We need to make sure that we prioritize
moving to thinking machines for high
leverage, high value activities. Finance
sure comes to mind. It seems pretty
valuable because when you ask for
answers from an LLM, the LLM is trained
to be helpful and gives you a perfectly
acceptable generic answer because your
prompt did not give it the room to do
what it does best. your prompt did not
give it the room to analyze to actually
dig deep. And so what I want to focus on
in this video are the principles. I'm
going to use finance as a lens because I
think it's a high lever high value
activity. We all do it one way or
another. Whether we're in a budgeting
app or whether we're investing or
whether we're negotiating compensation,
we have to do with money. I want to talk
about how you use LLMs for this because
it's a lens into how we use them for
highv value thinking activities.
