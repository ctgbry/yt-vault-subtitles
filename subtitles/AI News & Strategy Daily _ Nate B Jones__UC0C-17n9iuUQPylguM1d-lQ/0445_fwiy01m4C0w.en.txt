You can build custom software for a
specific tiny audience. If your audience
loves to take notes and they have a
particular way of taking notes and
you've always had a note-taking system
and you wanted to share it with the
world, well, you can do that now. If you
wanted to build a fantasy football
software that you have never been able
to find before, you can do that now. If
you wanted to build some kind of special
event planning software that you would
never have been able to get in the
market, well, you can do that now. These
micro markets exist, but no one has been
building software for them because
software is such a blunt instrument
because it was so expensive. By moving
from natural language to code, we now
have the ability to treat software like
a scalpel. And so we can carve out these
micro niches and build really
sustainable side businesses where we are
the authority on that particular tiny
corner of the universe.
