I think that gets at a use case I
actually had for Atlas today. Um, which
was really interesting to me. Uh, I was
looking at a GitHub repo and I was
running through and I was like, I want
to get a sense of what's in this GitHub
repo really quickly. What if I just have
Atlas look at it and I put the assistant
up on the side and I just have a
conversation with Atlas about the repo.
And what I found was there was this sort
of magic that happened when I was in
Atlas because I was working with sort of
that uh there's sort of a magic to code
comprehension I'm finding with some of
sort of the way Chad GPT like touches
and plays with code. it was able to like
click through, take control of the
screen, look at all of the different
files in the repo, and it came up with
some really, really thoughtful questions
that enabled me to get much more
fingertippy with the code much more
quickly. It was one of those magic
moments for me. So I think the browser

it's it's so simple it almost sounds

a user to access some of this magic it
can feel like making the magic available
like in the first Yes.
