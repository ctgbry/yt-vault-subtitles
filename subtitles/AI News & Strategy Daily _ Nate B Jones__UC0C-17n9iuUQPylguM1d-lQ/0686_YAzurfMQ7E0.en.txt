I want to emphasize here the differences
I'm talking about are differences on top
of very capable baseline LLM capacity.
These models are all good at lots and
lots of everyday tasks. They're good at
writing emails. They're good at
synthesizing PRDS. They're good at
writing engineering requirements. The
things I'm calling out are the nuances
that help you make the most of these
mods. So prompting shifts in line with
this insight around entropy. Right? So
Gemini 3 prompts you actually are
spending your effort on output
structure. You're spending your effort
on task constraints on how you anchor
phrases and name and define which part
of the context you're retrieving. So you
need to get comfortable feeding high
entropy multimodal context which I
normally shy away from but you have to
define what good synthesis looks like
and good analysis looks like across that
context. So schemas, ranking criteria,
what you retrieve, etc. Whereas with G
GPT 5.1, you're spending more of your

GPT 5.1, you're spending more of your
time defining the task definition. Is
that really clean? Is it unambiguous?
You're making sure you insist on the
tone you want. And you may pre-process
it so that well structured context is
available to the model so that it can
think deeply and not wade through jump.
If you want all of this in one line, use
Gemini 3 to tame the chaos of your
inputs and use chat GPT 5.1 when you're
tackling hard thinking and communication
around more structured inputs. Once that
chaos is structured, you can do some of
both with both models. But that is the
takeaway I am starting to come
