What do these have in common? I mean,
it's AI agents, but really to me, they
represent a competing vision and a
battle over the future of AI agents that
I think we need to talk about. Google
really laid out an idealistic, a utopian
vision for AI agents that I do not see
companies actually implementing in 2025.
I get where they're going. It is part of
Google's job to lay out the vision of
the future. And Google feels really

published that white paper, it was right
after the claude code hack news broke.
And one of the key learnings in the
cloud code hack news is that we cannot
depend on model layer security. We have
to go to orchestration. What is Google
all about in this white paper? They're
all about orchestration. They basically
are saying if you get serious about
agents, you are gonna have to solve the
orchestration problem at scale. And
right now I got to say most
organizations getting ROI are doing much
simpler things with agents which is

exactly where Versel comes in. Versel

how can we get practical value out of AI
agents at work. We're not writing a

to get to tomorrow and get to good ROI
which is where like 99% of businesses
are. And you know what they do? They go
through their back office operations.
This is alarmingly simple, but I love
