Because at the end of the day, if you
are a model maker and you believe good
models will get better over time, you
should be able to eat more and more of
workflows over time just by delivering
good models and you can do something
like I don't know clawed code which is
frankly just a terminal and compete with
cursor, you're going to eat some of
these tools for lunch over time and you
kind of don't care. And so we are seeing
this tectonic struggle between the
toolmakers that are trying to build on
top of this model maker tech and the
model makers who are really incentivized
to grab as much territory as they can.
Modelm makers hold the cards here as you
saw with Claude cutting off access to
Windsurf but they don't hold all the
cards. And so one of the things that's
super interesting about this dynamic is
that it's sort of a 2/3 one-/-ird
situation where you might say that 2/3
of the power sits with the modelmakers,
but the tool layer has a third of the
Power.
