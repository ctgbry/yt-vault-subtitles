if you'd like to see something that I
help put up just yesterday you can visit
tracker. vote uh so I used llm tooling I
worked with a friend of mine we went
from idea to production Deploy on a
custom domain in just a hair over two
hours and it's a tiny little react app
and the entire purpose is to provide you
a simple very fast AdFree way to track
votes in 50 states and to track the
calls that are made for each state over
the course of the November election
night and I suppose into Wednesday as
well so if that's useful that's great uh
I wanted to have fun and build something
that was uh useful and also a nice
exercise in showing how quickly you can
get to production with an idea so that's
what I did uh I'll link it I think I'll
also link the GitHub and you can look at
it so enjoy
