Anyone who's hired will tell you you
cannot magically scale expertise by
hiring people. It lives in your brain
and traditionally there have been only
three ways to scale experts and all of
them suck. All of them are bad. And AI
created a fourth way. So let me show you
the problem. Option number one, this
sucks. Work more hours. Say you're a
lawyer. You're great at what you do. The
client demand goes up. You work nights
and weekends. You burn out. This doesn't
scale. Or else you just pad the billing
hours. Whatever it is. But the point is
you can't scale your hours infinitely.
There is not infinite time. Option two,
hire people. You hire associates. Maybe
you hire junior lawyers. They don't
scale expertise. They dilute expertise.
The point is they don't have the years
of pattern recognition that go with true
expertise. I have worked with senior
senior engineers, people who are at the
principal level or above. It's the same
thing. And you end up trading your work
for management work. and that is
draining and you're still the
bottleneck. Option number three, the

bottleneck. Option number three, the
only way we found to scale that doesn't
suck as bad as working more hours and
hiring more people is raising your
prices. So great, you charge more. You
go, you raise your hourly rates. The
lawyer raises the hourly rates to 600
bucks an hour, a,000 bucks an hour, but
there's a ceiling. Eventually, you're
too expensive for most clients, and
you've traded volume for rate, and
you're still limited to the amount of
time that you have. These are your
options. This is why any expertise-based
business hits a wall. This is true
whether you're in the legal profession
or whether you are a senior principal
architect or whether you are a uh
tradesman, whether you're in plumbing or
whether you're installing HVAC systems,
your expertise hits a wall by scale.
Your knowledge is the asset and it's
been trapped and there's been only one
of
