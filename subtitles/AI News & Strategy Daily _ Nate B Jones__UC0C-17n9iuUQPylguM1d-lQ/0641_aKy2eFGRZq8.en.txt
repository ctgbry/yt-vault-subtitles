I want to give you a sense that
Goldilocks prompting is a learnable
skill. It's also a sharable skill. I'm
going to share a bunch of these prompts
with you. So, you can start to build
them, modify them. If you don't like my
examples, use different examples. But if
you keep it to relatively the same
length if you use a similar structure,
you're going to end up in a place where
you have guidelines, useful context, a
scaffold if you will, for large language
models to use, but not so much that it
is a brittle prompt that often fails.
And that's what I want you to have. I
want you to have a toolkit that feels
like a well-worn chisel in the woodshed
and a well-worn hammer. Something you
can use every day for a wide variety of
tasks and not get lost on. So there you
go. That is my plea to start thinking in
terms of the altitude you're at.
Thinking in terms of Goldilocks
prompting, asking yourself, am I
prompting at the right level for the
task I'm asking for? Good luck with
Goldilocks prompting.
