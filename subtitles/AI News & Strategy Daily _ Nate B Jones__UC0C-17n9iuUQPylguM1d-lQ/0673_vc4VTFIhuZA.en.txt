If you're looking ahead to 2026, these
are the three mental models that you
need to survive in your career as we
start to have AI agents more and more in
the workplace. Number one, AI is a
collaborator on structured work. It is
not a magic brain. So, I'm going to say
it again, LLMs are pattern machines.
They're very, very good at transforming
text and code. They they can map messy
inputs to structured outputs very well.
They follow explicit instructions
increasingly well and they can do the
same thing a thousand or 10,000 times
and never get bored. But they are not
inherently good at making high stakes
decisions with very ambiguous
trade-offs. They don't understand your
organization's politics or background
well. They don't know your context
unless you give it to them. And they are
very very bad at respecting boundaries
that you have not defined previously.
And so the right question is not can AI
do my job although I hear that a lot.
That that's wrong. That's not the right
question to ask given what we know about

question to ask given what we know about
AI agents today. Instead, it is which
parts of my job are repetitive, are
checkable, are describable, are
verifiable, and how do I turn those into
workflows that AI can run or assist
with? How do I begin to take charge of
how AI shapes my job? And if you can't
describe the work clearly, that's
something that you're going to have to
