If you're in the age of AI and you're
building something, you want to build a
side gig, think about your distribution
first. What is your distribution
advantage? What do you know that other
people don't know about your market and
where they hang out and what they like
and what they don't like and what their
pain points are? And are you a member of
that community in such a way that they
trust you and you're respected and you
won't look like you're just scamming
people if you talk about a product that
you built? That is really really
important.
