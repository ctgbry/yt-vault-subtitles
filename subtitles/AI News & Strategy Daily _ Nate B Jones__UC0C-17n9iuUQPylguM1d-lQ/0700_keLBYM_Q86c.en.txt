For anything that ends up having to go
through multiple edits that touches code
where you're trying to stay consistent
across different formats in an article
or whatever it is, Opus 4.5 is the
safest pair of hands. So for images, for
UI concepts, for marketing visuals, Nano
Banana is really helpful, but you find
you feed that with other things. Right
now for decks, I tend to build them in
claw and then I tend to polish them by
running that claw deck through Notebook
LM, which is powered by Gemini and
powered by Nano Banana Pro. I get that
visual polish over the top of a deck
with bones constructed by clot.
