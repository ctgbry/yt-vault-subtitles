We are entering an era of architectural
specialization. The next breakthrough
and I and I think that people need to
get past this idea of bigger models. The
next breakthrough may not be a bigger
model. It may be how we use reasoning
architecture for specific cognitive
tasks. Now that we're in the LLM era, we
may see more specialization. That would
not surprise me. So where do I want to
leave you? Intelligence is not the same
as utility. GPT5, however you measure
it, is a very intelligent model. But its
intelligence is not what makes it a
success or it's a failure. The key is
understanding that intelligence and
utility are diverging as we get farther
into the LLM era. And it's up to you to
figure out if parallel reasoning makes
AI smarter for the tasks that you want
to accomplish.
