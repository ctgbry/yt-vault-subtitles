so I asked Claude for help with this uh
and I'm trying to figure out if it's a
good survey or not I'm going to throw
the link in the uh description under the
YouTube you can hit it and you can tell
me what you think I am trying to build
an interesting Maven course that
essentially helps people accelerate
their Tech careers it's a question I get
a lot and of course I've been asking AI
to help with some of the course
questions in the course design but
there's nothing like real people so if
you're watching this go underneath to
the description look at the link and
tell me what you think I'd love to get
your feedback uh and the nice thing for
you is if you do that and you complete
the survey and you sign up you will get
a discount code when it is time to sign
up for the course because thank you
right like I really appreciate it so
thanks for helping me figure out what's
good in this course uh this is your
chance to shape it and tell me what you
want to hear cheers
