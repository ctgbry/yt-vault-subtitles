The last thing that I want to call out
is templatization. And this is something
that, you know, we have gone after for a
long time. If if you've ever done
consulting, people talk about
templatizing your services all the time.
The difference with AI is that AI
enables you to do much much more
interesting things with templates.
Prompts can be living templates.
Templates can be extended through
prompting at the end of the end of the
engagement surface with the client.
templates themselves become more
customized and distinct service
offerings because AI makes it so easy to
extend tokens to the value chain that
the customer is bringing. This is
reflective of the fact that software
itself is changing. Software can be more
customized now because it is so cheap to
write code. Similarly, consulting can be
more focused on individual customers
than was practical before and still
utilize the power of templates because
it's cheaper to customize those
templates Down.
