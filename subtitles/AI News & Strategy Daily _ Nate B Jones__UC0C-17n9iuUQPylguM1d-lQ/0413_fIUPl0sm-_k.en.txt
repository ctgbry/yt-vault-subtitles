AI agents are not a tickbox. AI agents,
if you want to implement them, implement
them this way. And so many teams do. AI
agents are just a new way of doing
software for everybody. And it's
possible to do software for everybody. I
firmly believe that if you work with
your favorite LLM, whether that's Claude
or Chad GPT or Gemini or even Grock, you
can get to a point where you build this
yourself and it builds in line with what
I'm suggesting. It's simple. It's
composable. it fixes real pain points
etc. You don't have to have an engineer
to do that but let's recognize that you
are doing real engineering work. You are
actually building software and this is
part of the magic of the AI era. If
you're willing to think this way with
this kind of clear intent, you too can
do the work of building software and you
can generate the magic, the real ROI
that comes from true automation.
