I am really tired of models overfitting
to eval. So when we have exams that are
supposed to be like humanity's last exam
that are supposed to be good measures of
model evaluation and quality,
it's goodart's law all over again. As
soon as you make that a goal for a model
maker to hit, they will overfit to the
data. And I got to say, Grock 4, as hard
as the team has worked, is looking like
a terribly overfitted model. A model
that is much lower in real world quality
than we actually see in all of these
reported benchmarks.
