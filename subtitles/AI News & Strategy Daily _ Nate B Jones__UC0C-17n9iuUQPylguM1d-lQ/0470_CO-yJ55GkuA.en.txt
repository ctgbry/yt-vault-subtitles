There are talent implications for the
kind of world we're talking about. And
if you're building for the team, a lot
of people are asking me, where are the
engineers? Where are the architects?
What does that look like? I also want to
ask you about the next level of team. As
you're thinking about your budgeting,
don't just think about architects. Don't
just think about engineers. Think about
implementation. What does it take to
invest in training? What does it take to
invest in implementation specialists?
What does it take to invest in your
culture so that you have the right AI
champions on the team, not necessarily
just engineers and architects, who can
drive the business forward. This is one
of the biggest misses most businesses
had in 2025. It's one of the reasons why
that infamous MIT study showed up with a
95% fail rate. There's talent issues at
every single business I consult at. take
