This gives us a glimpse of do the work
assistance, but critically it also is
pushing the edges of AI agent autonomy
and it's doing so from a Chinese
perspective. And what I mean by that is
that it is reminding us that the Chinese
uh model development evolution continues
to push the edges. And if you're like
deep in the weeds technically, Kimmy K2
also set a new bar on efficiency for
training. You can look up um muon if you
want to get deeper on that and you will
see a lot on sort of how the K2 model
was trained and how efficient they were
at training the K2 model. That's just a
little sort of nerd sidebar there. But
this is really the larger story that
that the Chinese companies innovating on
AI are pushing the edges forward
especially around open-source and they
are very very intentionally pushing
straight to Aentic. It's sort of a
leapfrog motion where they're not just
satisfied with LLMs.
