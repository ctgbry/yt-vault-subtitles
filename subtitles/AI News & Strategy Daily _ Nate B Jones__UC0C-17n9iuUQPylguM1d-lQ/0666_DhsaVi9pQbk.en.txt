Google Gemini 3.0 appears to leak
through a shadow release on mobile
canvas. Users began reporting that
Gemini's mobile canvas suddenly outputed
dramatically better results, polished
SVG animations, fully structured UI
prototypes, and even functioning
interactive code, far beyond what Gemini
2.5 Pro could do. Meanwhile, Vert.Exi
briefly exposed a Gemini 3 Pro preview
November 2025 endpoint, which has
confirmed internal testing. That
endpoint has since been pulled back. The
most credible explanation of what is
going on here is indeed a deliberate
shadow release. Google has a history of
doing this and certain prompt types on
mobile canvas appear to be routing
automatically to Gemini 3.0 checkpoints
while the web interface stays at 2.5.
It's a really lowrisk way for the team
to gather telemetry on usage and how the
model's doing before a public
announcement. This aligns with Google's
promise of a year-end Gemini 3.0 no
launch and leak specs that point to a
very large million token context window,
major multimodal upgrades, and frankly

major multimodal upgrades, and frankly
the likelihood that Gemini 3.0 know is
going to be the first major
state-of-the-art model jump over
anything that we have in the market
