Let me just show you a really cool skill
that falls in the meta-kill category,
but I don't think anyone's doing this.
This is the Claude skill for continuous
learning. Okay, here's the idea. I want
to take this idea that I've been sort of
finding across the web around continual
learning as a challenge. What would it
look like? And I want to turn it into a
skill because no one's done that and I
think it's super interesting. And so I
take that as a challenge and I say
within the constraints that you've got,
tell me how you would solve this
problem. And I want to make it clear,
right? So Claude basically identifies
that the key thing, the bottleneck is
manually adding any new update, but
Claude could identify opportunities to
create new skills autonomously within
natural conversation, which would be a
huge plus. Claude can recognize learning
moments. It can document the learning in
a structured format and recommend a
skill. And it's sort of gives me a
sample of how this would work. And long
story short, I can build a continual
learning capture skill and stick it into
cloud, which I think is super
