we're all prone to bias which is a form
of cognitive distortion however what
we've observed is that there's one bias
that seems
Universal to human beings it's been
observed in all people in all cultures
throughout history it's so prevalent
that psychologists have given it a
special name it's called the fundamental
attribution error in my most recent

explains what this is
and it almost certainly is in play in
your own life
and to the extent that it is
to your own detriment we can see that
when we
are unconsciously executing the
fundamental attribution error we rob
ourselves the opportunity for
appropriate self-improvement
and we also corrupt our ability to
maintain harmonious relationships with
others so it's a double whammy check it
