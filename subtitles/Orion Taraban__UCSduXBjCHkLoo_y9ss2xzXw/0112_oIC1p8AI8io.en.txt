i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to be more disciplined here we are
in january 2022
people have goals for the coming year
resolutions with respect to habits they
would like to adopt and vices they would
like to disabuse themselves of
and all of these things require some
measure of discipline for their
accomplishment
in today's episode i'm going to tell you
a very very effective hack for
increasing discipline with respect to
any new habit you're attempting to
cultivate
it's psychologically true that human
beings will do more to avoid pain
than they will do to secure pleasure
this is why the stick is generally more
incentivizing than the carrot some
carrots are good it's good to reward
yourself and important milestones on the
path to your goal but especially if
you're serious about achieving your goal
it's also good to have sticks in your

[01:00]
it's also good to have sticks in your
contingency program as sticks tend to
motivate more consistently and
energetically than do the carrots
now i'm going to tell you how to do this
it works 99.99
of the time so it's basically a sure
thing
the catch and there's always a catch
is that people don't like to do it
but i'm here to tell you that it's
practically guaranteed to increase your
motivation so if you're serious about
your goals it's something to seriously
consider
it goes like this
first
think of a group that you dislike
this could be a political organization
or a religious institution or a
non-profit company it doesn't matter so
long as it's a legal entity
next
you're going to create a situation and
you might need some help from a friend
or a parent or spouse for accountability
here
a situation where every day or every
week or every month you can decide the
time period

[02:01]
time period
that you fail to execute the desired
habit
you will be forced to donate a certain
amount of money to that disliked
organization
this means that the only way you can
avoid not paying the money is by
successfully executing the habit that
you're attempting to cultivate
this is called an escape contingency
devious isn't it
now
when it comes to setting a penalty you
want to pick an amount that will
actually hurt
we don't want it to break your bank but
you should feel the money leaving your
account it should sting especially since
the money will be going to that disliked
organization
on certain days you might not feel like
executing the desired habit
but i can almost guarantee that you'll
feel even less like cutting a check to
that political party
this
really really works and it works because
we're creating a cost associated with
avoidance that is even greater than the

[03:01]
avoidance that is even greater than the
pain associated with compliance
i hope this helps and if you've ever
tried this technique please drop a
comment below i'd love to hear from you
