What I really liked about your book and
everything that you teach is that you're
basically showing people the [music]
reality of things
&gt;&gt; trying to
&gt;&gt; you're trying to and whether we like it
or not, we have our own, you know,
opinions about how relationships or love
should be. People are understanding,
okay, this is how modern dating works.
With that being said, there's two ways
of it. This is how modern day dating
works. Let me teach you, okay, these are
the weapons you should pick up and level
up in this video game of modern dating.
And then there's the other route which
is to teach people how to be more
unconventional rather than to play that
game. And some people don't realize that
they can be they don't realize that
maybe they can heal. They can connect to
their hearts. They can choose a
different reality. It's kind of like
people realizing they don't have to do
the 9 to5 [music] and then suddenly
they're like, "Oh, actually I could pick
that route." And I think that's where
maybe we're a little bit different
because for us it's like I want people
to know that they can choose to opt out
&gt;&gt; that they can choose to not play this
game but then your your advice is very

[01:02]
game but then your your advice is very
important as well which is then don't
pick that person who is playing the
game. So, I talk about that in the last
chapter of the book about the future of
relationships. And I do think that there
is a crisis in the sexual marketplace
these days in the game of mating and
dating. Like you just said a few moments
ago, it's like, I'm so glad I met you
before
&gt;&gt; I had to deal with all of this. Yeah.
That's generally how people who are
already paired up look at what's going
on in 2025.
&gt;&gt; But because old ways are falling apart
[music] and no one yet really knows
what's going to emerge. We're in a very
transitory period. It's a crisis, but
it's also an opportunity. It's like
maybe the old ways are falling apart
&gt;&gt; for a reason.
&gt;&gt; For a reason. Like, and I don't think
the genie goes back in the bottle. I
don't think that we're going to go back
to 1950s, that romanticized view of
gender and marriage. But I also don't
think we have to fall it has to fall
apart entirely. We can be intentional
about this both collectively and
individually. We can pick the things
that we want to save because they matter
