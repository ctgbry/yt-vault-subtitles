I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is
psychack's Better Living Through
psychology and the topic of today's
short talk is why women monkey branch
if you are unfamiliar with the term
monkey branching is the phenomenon in
which a woman leaves one relationship
and very quickly enters into another and
generally the gap between relationships
is so small as to preclude the
possibility that she didn't already have
the second relationship lined up before
she pulled the trigger on the first
hence monkey branching in which the
monkey doesn't let go of the first Vine
until she has a firm grip on the second
now almost all men have had this happen
to them at some point in their lives and
it can be though it doesn't necessarily
have to be a painful experience
however as with much having to do with
women understanding can do much to
mitigate the pain today I'm going to
explain to you why this phenomenon is so
prevalent which should help you to
accept reality and move forward

[01:02]
accept reality and move forward
first if you haven't done so already I
would highly encourage you to check out
my episode women treat men the way men
treat jobs because that will provide the
appropriate context for the following
talk now if it is true that women treat
men the way men treat jobs then we have
to enter into let's say a corporate
frame of mind
when attempting to understand female
mating and dating behavior and if you've
ever worked in the corporate world you
know that the biggest jumps in
compensation that you're likely to
receive over the course of your career
don't occur when you're promoted within
a company but when you lateral to a
different company
the same is true in dating and there are
many rational principles in play that
conspire to create these incentives
let's go through a few of them
when you're initially hired at a company
the process is usually protracted

[02:00]
the process is usually protracted
just like in dating these conversations
can occur over several months as both
parties are kind of trying to figure out
whether they can do business what that
would look like and how they can
negotiate the best deal for themselves
this is because despite the fact that
both parties need each other there is a
fundamental antagonism between their
aims namely management wants as much
work for as little money as possible and
labor wants as much money for as little
work as possible
and so long as these classes exist this
will never change
by the same token all things being equal
men want as much sex and freedom for as
little time energy and money as possible
and women want as much time energy and
money for as little sex and freedom as
possible
behind all the fun and excitement the
courtship phase of a relationship just
like an extended hiring process is

[03:02]
like an extended hiring process is
basically two people figuring out what
kind of business they can do together
and negotiating what they're willing to
give up for what they expect to receive
in return
people will balk at this but that's the
way it is it often doesn't seem like
it's the way it is because just like in
business negotiating too explicitly is
gauche like if you want a job you can't
tell your potential employer look I
could care less about your mission and
your culture you're going to use my
skills to increase your profit and I'm
going to use your brand to increase my
income and if I'm going to trade my time
for money I want as much money as I can
get and since I have a few other offers
what I want to know is can you give me a
better deal because all things being
equal I'm going to go with the
organization that pays me the most
you're going to come off as mercenary
and sociopathic but that doesn't
necessarily mean that that is not the
subtext of hiring negotiations

[04:01]
subtext of hiring negotiations
also keep in mind that any company that
shamed a potential employee for
prioritizing the bottom line would only
do so tactically like because it's in
their best interest to do so
as making employees believe that they
should work for things other than money
allows companies to functionally receive
the same amount of labor for a smaller
expenditure of money which increases
their profit but yeah I digress
in any case once this protracted
negotiation is finalized that is once
you decide how much money you're willing
to receive to compensate for the
expenditure of your time you're going to
be anchored at that level as long as you
remain at that company
this means that it's going to be very
very hard to get a large raise at that
company because all raises will be
proportional increases from that
negotiated price point you can get five
percent here ten percent there but you
won't ever double your money by
remaining loyal

[05:01]
remaining loyal
that will only occur if you successfully
negotiate a different anchor at a new
company
big bumps in comp don't happen
internally they happen laterally the
same is true for relationships big bumps
in title and lifestyle generally don't
happen internally they happen laterally
and on the occasions they do occur
internally they generally occur in order
to retain someone who has received a
better offer elsewhere and is willing to
leave
just keeping it real

[06:01]
and I really appreciate your support
now all this kind of begs the question
if the first company can buy an
employee's labor for X dollars why would
some other company pay 1.5 x dollars for
the same labor I will tell you why
the reason why the second company is
willing to pay significantly more for a
poached employee is that on a longer
time frame this strategy is cheaper for
the company than developing its own
Talent
how does that work well if a company
were to hire someone from scratch
without any real experience and without
any real proof of ability then that
company is running a risk
after investing in their training and
development many of these employees
don't pan out in the long run or they
simply lateral to other companies once
they have been trained and developed and
unless you run a company that
intentionally grinds through unskilled
temporary labor this approach to hiring

[07:00]
temporary labor this approach to hiring
will likely prove expensive or even
unsustainable
on the other hand an employee that has
already been trained has already been
developed and has already demonstrated
proof of ability is much less of a risk
poaching companies pay more because they
have functionally outsourced the due
diligence and training processes
this means that not only will there be
less time energy and money wasted in
cultivating employees that don't go the
distance but there will also be a lower
likelihood of future lateral movements
as they are paying above market value
for the labor in question
consequently these companies pay more
because it saves them time and buys them
longer loyalty but make no mistake they
only seem to pay more if churning
through short-term employees weren't
more expensive they would do that
instead
the same is true in dating
and this explains why we see monkey
branching far more commonly in women

[08:01]
branching far more commonly in women
than we do in men
churning through short-term
relationships is much more expensive for
women than it is for men
furthermore demonstrated proof of
competence and ability in men is much
more attractive to women than
demonstrated proof of sexual
availability and experience in women is
to men
a woman who has been trained and
developed elsewhere is less appealing to
men than one who has not
at this point you might be saying okay
Orion well all that makes sense but why
do women have to do this from within
their current relationship why don't
they have the Integrity to break things
off with the first man before they go
looking for the second
I will explain this to you this is
because just like in business it would
be incredibly stupid to quit your job
before you have another opportunity
lined up
and this is true for two reasons first

[09:00]
and this is true for two reasons first
it's stupid because you don't actually
know how long you will remain unemployed
because whether you are hired isn't up
to you so unless you are independently
wealthy you may not be able to float the
employment gap if the market is
inhospitable and if you are
independently wealthy why are you
looking for a job
and second it's stupid because you will
be able to negotiate a more competitive
salary at your next position if you both
a retain proof of your employability and
B have another confirmed bidder for your
labor your current employer
and once again the same is true in
dating
these reasons in conjunction with the
fact that women generally have
relationship goals whereas men do not
and the fact that women operate under
shorter time Horizons than men do are
sufficient to explain not only monkey
branching behavior in general but also
its increased prevalence in women
relative to men in particular

[10:01]
relative to men in particular
just one final word men if this happens
to you don't take it personally King
when women do this you have to
understand that it's just business
but you might also consider that you're
being given a gift
why well think about it when were you
most loyal and committed and
hard-working when you first join the
company
or when you've been working there for
several years
when you first joined of course when you
take on new Talent they are generally
thrilled at the opportunity to be there
on the other hand you may end up paying
more and more just to keep a disgruntled
employee from leaving
people price themselves out of
relationships all the time
let the new guy over bid for your used
merchandise
