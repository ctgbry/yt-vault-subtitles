i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
emotions and mastery
among other things emotions are tools
given to us by evolution to facilitate
our survival
and this is because contained within
every emotion is a behavioral impulse
that has persisted to the present day in
large part because the ancestral
organisms that relented to this impulse
were more likely to survive and
reproduce all things being equal than
were those organisms who were limited to
a different impulse
as a rule the stronger the emotion the
more difficult it is to resist the
emotional impulse contained therein
however there are folks who find it very
challenging to resist their emotional
impulses across the board so let's talk
about this
the fact that matter is that it's
generally only a good idea to relent to
an emotional impulse if it arises in the

[01:01]
an emotional impulse if it arises in the
context of a domain of mastery
what does this mean
well let's take as a concrete example
the domain of chess
if you're a chess beginner if you just
learn the way the pieces move and what
the victory conditions are then it's
probably a terrible idea to let your
emotions influence your decisions you
can't really think to yourself hmm i
have a strong feeling that it would be
best if the horse he went over here and
expect that you're actually going to win
the game
on the contrary if you're in the process
of learning how to get good at chess
it's generally a good idea to doubt your
emotional impulses
and to scrutinize them with respect to a
rationally explicated model of reality
some kind of chess strategy or principle
on the other hand if you happen to be a
chess grand master and you've played a
hundred thousand games
then you will be able to feel through
your intuition
what the next best move might be
without being able to explicate a

[02:01]
without being able to explicate a
specific rationale for this feeling
and that's because the emotional impulse
in this case arises out of years if not
decades of unconscious procedural
knowledge and deep pattern recognition
so it makes sense for the grand master
within his domain of mastery to relent
to emotional impulses that arise from
that knowledge base
whereas the beginner who does not yet
have such a knowledge base
should submit his emotional impulses to
rational scrutiny
now what does this mean for us
well our mastery is not evenly
distributed over all domains
the grand master might not have mastery
in the domain of dating in relationships
and vice versa
there are parts of our lives where we
have more mastery than others and it's
important to recognize when we happen to
be in those domains as this is our cue
to relent more uncritically to our

[03:00]
to relent more uncritically to our
emotional impulses since they've been
practically vetted by years of survival
and if we happen to not be in one of
those domains then we can and should
exercise greater skepticism with respect
to the wisdom of those same
impulses i hope this helps in the
