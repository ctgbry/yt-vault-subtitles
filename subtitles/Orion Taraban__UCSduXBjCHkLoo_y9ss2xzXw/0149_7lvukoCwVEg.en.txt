i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is
the experience of inner emptiness
so this is something that i've
experienced in my own life
and i believe it is at the heart of many
of the issues that i discuss with my
clients namely this inner emptiness this
void that exists or seems to exist
inside of us
i experience it as a kind of painful
numbness if that makes sense and it's
highly aversive
those who experience it try all kinds of
ways to fill it
they try to fill it with drugs and
alcohol with sex and relationships with
work and business
with money and power
with distraction and pleasure etc i mean
there's just so many ways that human
beings have invented in their attempts
to avoid this
experience and they don't work
which is to say that they work for a

[01:01]
which is to say that they work for a
time at a great cost
and the reason for this is that you
can't solve an internal problem with an
external solution
and the sense of emptiness is definitely
an internal problem
[Music]
that said
i no longer experience this inner
emptiness myself and i've helped other
people to heal from this experience as
well to
fill
this inner emptiness
and in my experience there are really
only three ways to do this
the first is psychotherapy
okay that's straightforward enough the
second
is a felt relationship with a higher
power okay let's talk about this one
on some level the experience of inner
emptiness is a spiritual issue
and that's why it can't be solved with
material things like money sex and
substances it's a spiritual issue
and to address a spiritual issue you
need a felt emotional relationship not

[02:00]
need a felt emotional relationship not
an intellectualized relationship a felt
emotional relationship with a higher
power however you choose to define that
it's within this relationship that you
can feel loved unconditionally and
existentially justified
it's within this relationship that i
began to experience myself more and more
as a being who deserves to exist on this
planet
and increasing my capacity to receive
divine love and grace did a lot to fill
that emptiness that we're discussing
okay so therapy higher power
the third way
is to create yourself
through the intentional striving toward
an ultimate goal
most people are plankton
they're drifting through life
and their daily lives are shaped more by
the currents that buffett them than by
their own purpose and will this is no
bueno
it's important to sit down and develop a
vision for your life like seriously
where do you want to be in 10 years so

[03:01]
where do you want to be in 10 years so
that you can reverse engineer backward
to your starting point in order to
create a trajectory toward your ultimate
goal
and this striving is going to be
challenging
it's going to be time consuming and it's
going to demand a sacrifice of blood
sweat and tears
but in that sacrifice you might gain
something greater
than what you spent
and what you might gain among other
things is the creation of yourself
on some level we become what we strive
toward
and this meaning making requires
sacrifice at the very least
the sacrifice of who you are
for who you hope to become
what do you think have you experienced
something similar
