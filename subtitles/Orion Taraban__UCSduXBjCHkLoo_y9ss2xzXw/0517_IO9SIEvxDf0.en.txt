I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why men
have midlife crises so a midlife crisis
is generally something that occurs in
the late 30s to mid-40s the archetypal
crisis is a man who suddenly divorces
his wife leaves his family buys a sports
car dates much younger women and
otherwise abandons his responsibilities
in favor of an increasingly hedonistic
lifestyle well I believe that women can
also have midlife crises they tend to
look different but they're generally not
as common and I think the reason for
that is the factors that tend to produce
these crises are as we'll see more
prevalent among men than they are among
women that said all men obviously do not
have midlife crises so what typically
causes this phenomenon when it does
appear midlife crises occur for two
primary reasons first of all they tend

[01:01]
primary reasons first of all they tend
to impact men who have been pro-social
Duty conscious and responsibility
oriented for most if not all of their
adult
lives potentially ever since they were
teenagers these are men who were making
their parents happy then they were doing
what their teachers wanted then they
were hardworking long-suffering
employees and finally they were the
often thankless Servants of their wife
and
children as long as they've been
conscious they've been measuring
themselves by other people's yard sticks
behaving as they should often at Great
personal expense to be fair they were
often socially rewarded for their
sacrifices however what they gained
might have actually paled in comparison
to what they lost in the bargain now
what generally happens around 40 at
least in the modern civilized world is
that people get their first real taste

[02:01]
that people get their first real taste
of mortality everyone knows they're
going to die but most of the time this
is more of an impersonal fact than a
felt understanding and it's around this
time that a parent for the first time
Falls seriously ill or passes away or
perhaps a person experiences their own
first significant Health scare and it
can happen that nothing at that point is
standing between that person and death
like death used to be something very far
away parents stood in the way
grandparents stood in the way however a
person in middle age might find himself
next on The Chopping Block as it were
for the very first time in any case
death starts to transition from an
abstract idea to a concrete reality for
a lot of folks at this time there is a
growing appreciation of the fact that
not only are there a limited number of
years left there are an even more
limited number of good years left and

[03:03]
limited number of good years left and
this is when a person potentially
realizes wait a minute I've spent my
entire conscious life doing what other
people wanted me to do which was frankly
my fault and if I don't do anything I'm
going to spend the rest of my conscious
life doing the exact same thing I I've
just been doing what was expected of me
this whole
time what about me like my life is also
for me I want certain things I want to
live the way that I want to live there
are experiences that I want to have
before I go Etc and this selfishness
which has been suppressed for so long
just explodes onto the scene and this
isn't necessarily a bad thing it is the
privilege and responsibility of every
human being to live their own lives
which if they also want to to live among

[04:00]
which if they also want to to live among
other human beings doing the exact same
thing requires a kind of creative
selfishness like a selfishness that can
be creatively adapted to exist among
others and without that element of
selfishness people don't live life life
lives them so we kind of want people to
ask what about me that's a fundamentally
healthy and rational question but here's
the thing if a guy gets to be 45 years
old before he is suddenly and urgently
concerned about living life on his own
terms then he is going to be out of
practice being selfish and this is
frankly why I think more men have
midlife crises than women do for better
for worse women aren't out of practice
they ask what about me all the time but
for some men the last time they allowed
themselves to enact that selfishness was
when they were 15 years old and that's

[05:00]
when they were 15 years old and that's
why when a 45-year-old man who hasn't
asked what about me for 30 years
suddenly starts trying to be selfish
it's going to look like a 15-year-old
version of selfishness that might be as
far as he got before he was forced to
become responsible and that's why
midlife crises tend to look like Teenage
fantasies fast cars and hot women these
men stopped cultivating their fantasy 30
years ago it hasn't matured in 30 years
so they revert back to that level of
functioning now before I go any further

isn't it bad to be selfish

[06:00]
isn't it bad to be selfish
no no it's not because selfishness is
ultimately connected to the survival and
flourishing of the individual organism
trying to remove this inborn
characteristic of human nature could
very well create more problems than it
solves can selfishness be taken too far
absolutely but when I look around at
Humanity I actually don't see that to be
the issue if anything I don't think
people are selfish enough about their
own happiness and well-being they
certainly don't act that way they're not
they're not flourishing they're not
they're not demanding the best of
themselves okay in any case I don't
think that selfishness can be completely
eradicated and if it's repressed for 30
years then it's going to most likely
erupt in forceful ways and at
inopportune moments some selfishness
along the way probably serves the
function of a release valve preventing
the buildup of an unsustainable pressure
a Man Who develops cultivates his

[07:00]
a Man Who develops cultivates his
selfishness probably isn't going to
explode in an origy of adolescent
selfishness when he is 45 so that's
reason number one reason number two is
that the guys who have midlife crises
are also generally the guys who are very
good at delaying
gratification most of them have spent
the last two decades of their lives
grinding away at their careers and a
good portion of their success was likely
based on their effort and discipline and
their ility to foro a present pleasure
in favor of a future reward so it's
actually a very useful skill to be able
to do this men who can't delay
gratification generally don't get very
far in life if you want to build
anything of value you have to be able to
put your present needs aside in the
service of some future goal so that's
true and it's also true that you can't
take it with you my dude so another
realization that men have at the crisis
of mortality that tends to occur around
this age is that all of their wealth all

[08:02]
this age is that all of their wealth all
of their prosperity all of the good
things they've worked so hard for so
long to
cultivate other people are enjoying them
they think wait a minute if I delay
gratification
indefinitely I'm not delaying it I'm
forfeiting it uh who knows how much time
I have left which is correct no one
knows how much time they have left I
want a slice of my own pie but here's
the thing just as before this man hasn't
practiced gratifying himself in a very
long time starting to do so at this age
is going to be like bringing a starving
person to a buffet a starving person
does not act like a normal person at a
buffet a starving person is likely not
going to be able to control himself and
he's going to eat himself sick he's not
used to eating food on the other hand a
normal person with a normal appetite is
much less likely to do something foolish
they'll pce themselves properly and stop

[09:00]
they'll pce themselves properly and stop
when they'll they're full and they do
this at least in part because they're
not worrying whether they're ever going
to have the opportunity to eat again
just like men have to practice being
selfish they need to practice gratifying
themselves otherwise they either end up
forfeiting gratification entirely and
where's the fun in that or they
dramatically increase the chances of one
day exploding in some kind of gluttonous
orgy now this explosion could be a
lesson that can be learned from it could
be a step in the direction of
responsible self-gratification a phase
that most people have to pass through
however the sudden forceful nature of
many midlife crises is such that they
can be very difficult to recover from
many women aren't going to like support
a man through this process especially if
spoiler alert they have been the primary
beneficiaries of the man's service and
gratification delay over the years in
any case I believe it's important for
men to cultivate that creative
selfishness throughout their lives if

[10:01]
selfishness throughout their lives if
they ask what about me earlier they are
significantly less likely to find
themselves in a lifestyle that doesn't
work for them 30 years down the road and
if they practice gratifying themselves
along the way they probably won't need
to make themselves sick when eventually
given the opportunity to eat what do you
