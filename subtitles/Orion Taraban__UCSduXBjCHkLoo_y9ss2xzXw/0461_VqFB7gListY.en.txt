in the early 20th century developmental
psychologist Margaret Mahler described a
phase that all children go through
called the reprosha ma stage the toddler
is up and walking and is curious about
its environment what toddlers basically
do is they run off to explore say the
backyard in order to satisfy that need
for expansion and growth but once they
lose sight of mommy they start to feel
insecure they start to feel a little
afraid does mommies still exist did she
forget about me and what they do is they
run back to Mommy not because they
really want to like spend time with her
but because they want to make sure that
Mommy is still there the reproach them
all stage is a kind of approximates the
early courtship process alternating
periods of togetherness and separateness
and where guys mess up at this stage of
the process is that for whatever reason
maybe they can't tolerate the distress
of the woman's absence maybe they're
impatient for another sexual encounter
guys try to collapse this appropriate
rhythm of interaction one way or another
