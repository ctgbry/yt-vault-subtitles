what I'd like you to consider is that
whether you fight with a woman might
have more to do with you than you might
realize just like women can be
disrespectful to men without realizing
it and as I've said it's their
responsibility to stay on the sunny side
of the unbreakable rule men can be
antagonistic without realizing it and
it's your responsibility to clarify your
tone when speaking with a woman I'm
using the word clarify in the sense of
clean
up I'm advising you men to remove every
hint of annoyance or aggravation or
judgment or really any negative emotion
from your communication with women let
me
explain one way to think about women is
that they are incubators whatever you
give them they will magnify and reflect
magnify and reflect that's feminine
nature
