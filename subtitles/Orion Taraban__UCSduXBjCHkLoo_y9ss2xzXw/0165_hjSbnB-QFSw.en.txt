i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
never want something for someone else
more than they wanted for themselves
this is a very very important principle
and it's one that i put into practice
every day in the context of my clinical
work what does it mean
maybe you have a friend or a loved one
who is suffering maybe they're depressed
maybe they're on drugs maybe they're in
a bad relationship
or maybe they're just not taking care of
themselves properly
and you want them to improve to suffer
less to be prosperous to have a good
relationship to generally clean up their
act
and those are good things to want for
the people that you love
but here's the thing
what i've discovered is that in a given
relationship
if one person cares more
it kind of frees up the other one to
care less
and if one person has to care more
it needs to be the person with the
problem
i've seen this dynamic play out over and

[01:00]
i've seen this dynamic play out over and
over again in both my personal and my
professional life
when one person cares more it's kind of
like they do the caring for both people
they do the caring for the relationship
it's similar to when one partner is
clean and the other partner is messy it
usually turns out that the clean person
ends up cleaning for two
so the carer often ends up caring for
two
why should one person care when the
other person is caring for both so the
trick
is to take all that good will that you
feel
and to kind of situate it deeper inside
of your heart
and to meet the person where they're at
not where you'd like them to be
my goal as a therapist is to want what
my clients want
a little less than they do
so if they're not really motivated
i'm even less motivated than they are
i mean on some level why should i care
if they're not motivated i'm not the one
who will suffer as a result of that lack
of motivation the client will
and if their suffering is not sufficient

[02:00]
and if their suffering is not sufficient
motivation to take action i can't
reasonably expect that my words will
prove to be more effective than pain
i'm never ahead of my clients
pulling them and dragging them to where
i want them to go
i'm always behind
supporting them in their decision to
walk in the direction of their chosen
goals
and this is often very effective
when people who are used to other people
caring more
suddenly encounter somebody who cares
less
they increasingly learn that it's their
responsibility to carry that caring for
themselves
and this can be a new experience for
some folks
so there's generally a pain period
involved as they develop this capacity
but it's worth it in the long run
so i'm not telling you to not care about
people
but that sometimes caring can be
counterproductive you kind of have to
learn to care effectively to care in the
right way
