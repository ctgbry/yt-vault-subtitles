There is no reason for a man to behave
like a gentleman with a suit. That's
kind of the whole selling point. That
would be ridiculous at best and wasteful
and dangerous at worst. So that's the
answer to the question that began this
series. Where are all the gentlemen?

the respectability of a lady for the
rest of their lives. And unfortunately
that doesn't make sense to
