I remember I was once in a relationship
with a woman she was 25 years old at the
time and she told me I was the first man
who had ever told her no can you imagine
what that would do to a person being an
incredibly beautiful woman is kind of
the equivalent of being some billionaire
Scion you just grow up with this
extremely distorted view of life in
other people do you think folks like
this typically have the emotional
intelligence let alone the distress
tolerance to enter into a normal given
take relationship I mean temper tantrums
are not a good look at any age they are
really ugly at 25 or 35 here's another
reason it's often the case that when
women Blossom earlier in life they can
receive the kind of attention and
priority that disincentivizes them from
developing other aspects of themselves
their personality their interests their
skills their career the kinds of things
that make them good and interesting and
lovable and the kinds of things that
make it easier to have a relationship
with them and let me tell you the older
I get the more effortlessness in a
relationship matters to me
