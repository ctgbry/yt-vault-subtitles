this question that you may be asking
yourself what if I never find love is
frankly a bad question and here's why it
assumes that love is something that you
find it's something that you uncover or
you meet outside of yourself in other
people this is not the case the only
love you will ever find the only love
you will ever feel is your own love
coming out of you you can't actually
ever feel somebody else's love or just
like you can't actually feel somebody
else's sadness or somebody else's anger
you can empathize that's sort of like a
attenuated echo of what that feeling
might be but even if you do succeed in
stimulating that in yourself it's your
own feeling that Echoes that other
person's possible emotion you only ever
find love as it comes out of you that's
where you need to look
