I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is you can't
get there the same way twice you can get
there again wherever there is you just
can't get there using the exact same
approach that you used in the past let
me try to explain what this means this
is an Insight that I initially received
through my meditation practice but only
after many years at this point I've
studied and practiced meditation for
quite some time I've been interested in
mysticism and esoteric Pursuits since I
was a young man and I became heavily
involved in meditation as a
teenager one day after a few years of
practice I was finally able to
experience a state that I had long
striven to achieve I was able to
completely empty the field of
consciousness of all content and to
abide in this deep non-conceptual space

[01:02]
abide in this deep non-conceptual space
for an extended period awareness of time
and space disappeared as well as the
egoic sense of self there was only
Consciousness without any of the objects
of Consciousness it was quiet and still
and peaceful and perfect and as you
might imagine very difficult to describe
now I have no idea how long I was in
that state but when I dropped out of it
I remember feeling very happy even proud
that after many years of practice I had
finally experienced something that I had
read so much about it felt like I was
really making progress and naturally I
wanted to get back to that state again
however no matter how closely I seem to
approximate the internal and external
conditions that led to me attaining to
that state the first time the same
routine the same breath work the same
time of day the same location the same
intentional non-intentional

[02:00]
intentional non-intentional
Etc I couldn't seem to get back to where
I'd been this was extremely frustrating
more frustrating than if I had never
attained to that state to begin with and
I eventually had to despair of my
ability to return and to relinquish my
desire of returning before I was able to
find myself back in that state I did get
there again but when it happened it was
very surprising and unex expected it was
like I effortlessly slipped into that
state almost by accident at the
beginning of a session I hadn't tried to
make it happen nor had I made any kind
of special preparations against its
coming so as you might expect I then
tried to recreate this experience by
replicating its conditions I tried not
to try and prepared not to prepare and
desired not to desire and as you might
also expect this didn't work either and
I had to pass through the whole process
of frustration and despair and surrender

[03:02]
of frustration and despair and surrender
before I was able to enter into that
state for a third time under you guessed
it radically different circumstances now
I had to go through this process many
many embarrassingly many times before I
was able to realize that this state was
like a Moving Castle the castle was
always essentially the same but because
it was constantly moving the approach to
it was always Shifting the approach that
worked in the past didn't work in the
present not because the approach was bad
or incorrect or wrong but because the
castle had simply moved on from that
location this is how I learned that you
can't get there the same way twice and
you can't get there the same way twice
because the flow of time has shifted the
position of the
castle if you're interested in taking
your understanding to the next level I

see you
aboard I'm sure you've heard the saying
that you can't step into the same river
twice right well the river is a symbol
of time which is constantly flowing
constantly changing everything is in
time including yourself this means that
every moment is actually unique and
distinct it has never existed before and
it will never exist Again by the same
token you've never been the person you
are right now and you'll never be that
person again we can gloss over these
truths truth when we're mindlessly

[05:01]
truths truth when we're mindlessly
engaged with the busyness of life but
our lack of awareness doesn't change
this fundamental characteristic of
reality the strategies and tactics that
worked in the past can't be replicated
in the present with the same results
because both the circumstances to which
they are applied and the individual
performing the application have changed
sometimes the change isn't immediately
apparent to the eyes but the change is
there
nonetheless this teaching isn't
restricted to achieving transcendental
meditative States it applies to
achievement in general success is a
Moving Castle whether it's picking up a
girl or growing a business or winning a
battle or performing a surgery the path
to success in any particular case will
look different from the path to success
in any other it may not be wholly
different like in most cases there's no

[06:01]
different like in most cases there's no
need to reinvent the wheel but novel and
original elements or combinations will
always be present to unlock the unique
Pathway to success to the moving
Castle's present
location people don't like hearing this
and people don't like hearing this
because in general people are lazy and
dim they would much rather achievement
be reduced to a replicable formula
a set of stepbystep instructions that
guarantees success and every day they
shell out millions of dollars to husters
that supply that inexhaustible demand
however success doesn't work that way I
wish I could tell you that if you sit in
full Lotus position focus on your Naval
take 18 deep diaphragmatic breaths in
through the nose on eight out through
the mouth on 10 keep the tip of your
tongue connected to the of your mouth

[07:00]
tongue connected to the of your mouth
and ensure your posture is effortlessly
erect then you too will be able to
experience pure Consciousness devoid of
its objects in two weeks or less or your
money back but that's just not how it
works and that's not how it works
because any of that is bad advice like
in general it's good to sit in full
Lotus position and in general it's good
to keep your posture effortlessly erect
Etc it doesn't work because you are a
different person in a different moment I
just got through telling you that it
doesn't even work for me from one moment
to the next and I'm the same person so
how could it possibly work the same way
for a different person at different
points in
time success generally requires some
degree of Mastery and Mastery requires a
lot of time and energy and more than
anything else a willingness to engage
with the constantly shifting conditions
of the present moment however there

[08:01]
of the present moment however there
really is no way around this we see this
time and time again the way you got your
first business to succeed is not going
to be the way that you get your second
business to succeed raising your first
child won't be like raising your second
the line that worked on yesterday's
blonde isn't going to work on tomorrow's
brunette again it is possible to
replicate success politicians win
reelection athletes win back-to-back
championship
but they cannot exactly replicate the
pathways to success and this is why we
collectively need to be very cautious
with respect to formulaic
Solutions CL witz began his famous
Treatise on War by functionally
admitting that he can't teach anyone how
to win a battle and this was coming from
one of the most celebrated and
successful generals of his generation
and he said this because he understood
that as soon as he laid out the strategy

[09:02]
that as soon as he laid out the strategy
for victory some clever opponent would
find an effective countermeasure to that
strategy and just like that it's no
longer a strategy for victory and people
will think he's a huster and a fraud
this is why Masters at the highest level
of any discipline so often speak vaguely
or at most on the level of general
principles greater specificity suggests
a concrete Pathway to success and
chances are good that the Moving Castle
has since relocated this is why Lau
begins his work by saying that the Dow
that can be named is not the real da
this kind of talk can be frustrating for
those looking for easy answers or
Concrete Solutions but it's
unavoidable the highest wisdom must
account for the widest possible set of
circumstances and it's very ult to
ascertain what remains true at all times

[10:03]
ascertain what remains true at all times
and in all cases which is probably why
the data Ching is such a short book the
solution to this devilish problem as far
as I can tell is to develop Mastery in a
specific domain a learn lots of
different skills lots of different
tactics and lots of different strategies
B improve your powers of observation to
collect data on the character of the
present moment and C apply this
practical knowledge to current
conditions skillfully and efficiently do
this repeatedly and you will cultivate
intuition which will accelerate your
progress even more the path to Mastery
takes time but it's your best chance of
consistently attaining to success under
widely varying conditions and if it
takes time you might as well get started
