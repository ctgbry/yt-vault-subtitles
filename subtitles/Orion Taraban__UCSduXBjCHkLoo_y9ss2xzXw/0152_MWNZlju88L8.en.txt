i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
what is the critical inner voice
the critical inner voice is a very
important psychological concept i think
we all have it to some degree or another
however it can be sadistically cruel in
the case of certain people
now the critical inner voice isn't a
hallucination people don't experience
the voice as coming from outside of
their own heads
rather it's a malevolent form of
self-talk that can in its extreme forms
be incessantly berating and abusive
for instance it's the thought that
judges you very harshly when you make a
mistake
or that over generalizes global
personality flaws from local failures
and rejections
it's very very difficult to enjoy any
kind of quality of life when the
critical inner voice
active and energetic
so
where does it come from

[01:01]
where does it come from
a lot of researchers believe that the
critical inner voice is an introject
of the parents perceived negative
attitudes towards the child
these negative attitudes may have been
explicit in the form of physical or
emotional abuse but in most cases these
negative attitudes were implicit in the
form of a look a gesture a tone of voice
a withdrawal of affection etc
and the child unconsciously internalizes
these attitudes as a critical inner
voice it does so because despite the
cruelty of this voice it's preferable
for the child to consider itself
loathsome than it is to believe its
parents are hateful
given its dependence on them
so what do we do about it
the first step to addressing the
critical inner voice is to begin to
appreciate that this voice isn't really

[02:01]
appreciate that this voice isn't really
you
it's an introject
an introject is like a thought or a
belief that doesn't really belong to you
but is nevertheless inside your head
it's similar to how a hamburger isn't
actually a part of your body even though
it's inside your stomach you wouldn't
think i ate a hamburger and now that
hamburger is me but people think all the
time i had a thought so it must belong
to me
the first step to addressing the
critical inner voice is to make this
voice ego alien which means to identify
this voice as other as not me
if you can do that that's already a big
first step in the direction of resolving
the problem
i'll talk about next steps in future
episodes for today let's content
ourselves with an introduction to the
critical inner voice its origins and the
first step towards its undoing
