I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is scicax
Better Living Through psychology the
topic of today's short talk is why men
are afraid to approach women
so there are a couple of obvious answers
to this question that don't really need
the psych hacks treatment but are
important to note so let's just go ahead
and get them out of the way at the
outset men are afraid to approach women
because they are afraid of rejection not
only because rejection by definition is
frustrating and generally perceived to
be painful but because rejection in this
domain carries a special threat namely
that they will be perceived as creepy
this is especially true in the shadow of
the metoo movement men are afraid that
not only will they be rejected but they
will be shamed or canceled as a
consequence of expressing sexual
interest this is the world we live in
today
but let's dive a little deeper into this

[01:01]
but let's dive a little deeper into this
issue because it's not immediately
obvious why sexual rejection would be so
much more intensely painful for men than
other forms of rejection though it is
patently obvious that it is experienced
as such by the vast majority of men and
we can consider that the pain of sexual
rejection Cuts deeper because from an
evolutionary perspective the survival of
the individual is of lower priority than
the perpetuation of its genetics
that through the lens of evolutionary
theory an organism that lives a long and
healthy life but fails to reproduce
viable Offspring has failed as an
individual because its genetic lineage
has gone extinct just as certainly as if
he had never lived long enough to reach
sexual maturity on the other hand the
individual that leaves behind an
abundance of Offspring ideally with
different mothers as the genetic

[02:00]
different mothers as the genetic
diversity will increase the likelihood
that at least some of his children will
survive to sexual maturity is an
evolutionary success
in a very literal way sex
is life
and sexual opportunity is both a
determinant and a signal of individual
success
on the other hand while lack of sex is
not literally death it is symbolically
something much more pernicious namely
Extinction
this means that on a very deep level
rejection from a woman not only
signifies that the man in question does
not deserve to reproduce but that by
Extinction he does not really deserve to
exist
as his continued genetic existence
depends on his ability to successfully
reproduce
in this context it's important to keep
in mind that biologists do not declare a

[03:00]
in mind that biologists do not declare a
species extinct when all of the
individuals of that species are actually
dead but when opportunities for
reproduction become non-existent
the inability to reproduce is extinction
and the threat of Extinction colors
every female rejection and this is a
uniquely male threat as there are few
women who could not get sex if they
wanted it
it's this asymmetrical privilege coupled
with a failure in perspective taking
that contributes to women's lack of
understanding and frustration regarding
the importance of sex for men
however it doesn't end here
not only does female rejection carry the
threat of Extinction
but it carries the threat of Perdition
as modern man uses woman as The Crucible
for his self-worth
let's look into this further the idea of
utilizing a proxy to publicly reveal

[04:01]
utilizing a proxy to publicly reveal
private Merit is very old and through
most of human history men used contests
of arms to do this
whether in actual combat or in
ritualized simulations of combat the
idea was that the Victor was not just
the strongest not just the most capable
but the most deserving
in short the Victorious combatant
especially given the chaos and
vicissitudes of war was the one that God
Favored
this meant that entering into combat was
in a symbolic sense putting oneself in
God's scales to determine whether one
had the right stuff
now before I go any further if you're

believe you've derived from this episode
because it's donations like that that
make all this happen thank you for your
support
now we don't really have that trial by
combat culture anymore however the
desire to test one's quality remains and
what has replaced Warfare in similar
pastimes as The Crucible of self-worth
for modern man who is man indoctrinated
with the ideology of romantic love
is woman
for many men even if they would not
consciously formulate the idea as such
woman has replaced God as the Arbiter of
their worth
this means when a man approaches a woman
he is functionally allowing her to
evaluate his Merit by using the
encounter as a crucible for his
self-worth
can I buy you a drink sometime becomes
both from an evolutionary and a
spiritual perspective do you think I

[06:01]
spiritual perspective do you think I
deserve to exist
now from a rational perspective this
makes no sense whatsoever and some men
are going to vigorously deny this
interpretation however it does have the
benefit of explaining an anxiety that
can't really be accounted for by other
conscious explanations
and women certainly do their part to
play into this projection
did you know that the word glamor which
is a distinctly feminine concept comes
from an old Scottish word meaning
spellcraft
female glamor in the sense of their
makeup and their fashion and their
behaviors is a spell designed to bewitch
the perception of men into believing
they are more than they are
and the more they tap into feminine
spiritual archetypes the more they are
successful in this endeavor
so women whether they are conscious of
it or not kind of conspire with this
unconscious belief in men because of
course if they for went all of their

[07:01]
course if they for went all of their
props men's desire for them would
significantly diminish
again men rationally understand that a
woman cannot possibly be the Arbiter of
his self-worth especially a woman they
have just met and has next to no
information on which to base such a
judgment even if she wanted to do so but
this fear is not a rational thing which
is why it can't really be dissipated by
rational arguments
so
how do you overcome approach anxiety
well like any other anxiety it can
really only be overcome through exposure
and repetition
that is you get over the anxiety of
approaching women by
approaching women and the idea is to
approach enough women that the
non-terrible experiences collectively
constitute an emotionally disconfirming
experience of the feared outcome
so that you can reasonably expect all
things being equal that you will have a
non-terrible experience approaching

[08:00]
non-terrible experience approaching
women moving forward
and the best way to do this I found is
to kind of make a game out of it
think of approaching women like playing
tennis
when you play tennis you don't have to
play both sides of the net
you don't have to visualize how the
whole volley is gonna go and you don't
have to try to win every point with an
ace
all you really have to do is put the
ball into play and respond
and as a man it's your job to serve
it's your job to put the ball into play
but once you do it's her job to hit the
ball back to you
now if a woman likes what she sees and
hears she's going to help you
she will hit the ball back to you nice
and easy right where you're standing
because she's interested in playing
she's going to make it easy to hit the
ball back to her
on the other hand if she doesn't like
what she sees or hears or if she just
isn't in the mood to play

[09:00]
isn't in the mood to play
she's gonna hit that ball right out of
bounds this will look like short or one
word answers uh delivered in a cool tone
without making eye contact
gentlemen trust me I've approached over
a thousand women
this is as bad as it gets
and if she doesn't want to play you just
take your ball and find someone else to
serve it up to
on the other hand a woman who wants to
play will make good eye contact her tone
will be warm and she'll use a lot of
words to give you something to work with
make sense
all you have to do is serve the bowl the
rest is kind of up to her and here's the
crazy thing it doesn't really matter
what you say
because what you say is really just the
pretext to engage in a little verbal
back and forth so you don't need to be
funny
you don't need to be clever you don't
need to be Charming at least not in the
opener
all you really need to do is
put the ball into play

[10:01]
put the ball into play
this will serve as a litmus test for
whether she wants to play with you
after which point your natural
conversational reflexes will begin to
take over
