do you think that the differences that
exist between men and women like for
example it's been said that men are
success objects to women and women are
Beauty objects to men do you think that
that Rings true sure in a lot of
different ways now that's obviously it's
changing to a certain extent given
women's relative material success in
2024 you talked about all these women
that now have boats oh really they
there's some boat captains out there
you're talking about my book yeah okay
yeah um so a lot of women do have their
own boats their captains of their own
ships and generally what people want is
what people lack in fact that word want
has two meanings one is to desire and
one is to lack like when we talk about
extreme want we talk about extreme
poverty and it makes sense that what you
lack is precisely what you would desire
because you'd like to fill that void
whatever that is and generally the more
people have the harder it is to find
what they might want because they lack
less and less
