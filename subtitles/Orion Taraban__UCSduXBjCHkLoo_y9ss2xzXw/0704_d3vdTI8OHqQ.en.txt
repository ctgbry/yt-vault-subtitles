so if someone wants to leave if a friend
is taking a different path in life if a
woman thinks she can do better then let
them go and if you can wish them well at
least in your heart wish them well thank
them for accompanying you as long as
they did and part graciously not only
will this make it easier for you to let
go of that relationship but it will also
increase the likelihood that the ones
who leave will eventually regret their
departures now when someone is heading
for the door an Impulse might arise in
you to either justify your value or
remind the one un leaving of all the
value you've provided in the past
surrendering to either of these impulses
would be a mistake this is because the
game does not run on gratitude people
are more likely to feel resentful of
your reminding them of your good works
than grateful and in any case they've
already benefited from those Works they
don't lose them by leaving the
relationship rather people only lose
what they still want but haven't yet
been given so this isn't likely to work
