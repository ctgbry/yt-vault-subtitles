maintain an unwavering orientation
toward the things you want for yourself
for your life for your future hopefully
believe that you can actually attain
them well at the same time Harbor
absolutely no expectations that the
person you're speaking to will actually
help you move in that direction this can
require an almost zen-like commitment to
the here and now in this practice there
is no past and there is no future only
the Eternal present hence walking the
razor's Edge as the present moment is
vanishingly thin whether you should or
shouldn't if you want to be successful
in the sexual Marketplace you kind of
have to let go of the past if all you
can think about are the dozens of boring
dates that went nowhere of the thousands
of dollars you spent on ungrateful
candidates of the flaky and
disrespectful behavior of uninterested
lovers then how are you going to be able
to show up to another date let alone
show up to another date in a non-bitter
non-rental state
