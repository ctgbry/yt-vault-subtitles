I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is frame
cannot be shared
so in this episode I'll be responding to
the most common objection to my
conceptualization a frame in my episode
understanding frame I Define frame as
the world of the relationship and when
it comes to heterosexual relationships
either the man can be in the woman's
frame or the woman could be in the man's
frame that's it those are the only two
options
now the most common objection to this
formulation goes something like well
Orion why can't they be in each other's
frame like why can't both parties leave
behind their individual frames and enter
into a mutually constructed egalitarian
frame that serves both people like why
isn't that possible huh
so
I will Begin by conceding that that
alternative sounds really good like
there are a lot of nice and pleasant

[01:01]
there are a lot of nice and pleasant
ideas in that objection however a little
like socialism which is often associated
with lofty sentiments and Noble ideals
this doesn't really work in practice
the truth is that this alternative isn't
really possible and I'm here to give you
the three primary reasons why frame
cannot be shared let's get to it
in the first place it's important to
appreciate that with respect to most of
the important decisions that a couple is
forced to make compromise is impossible
for example if one person wants to live
in LA and the other person wants to live
in New York you can't compromise and
live in Kansas like that doesn't make
any sense now neither person is getting
what he or she wants so what's the point
of the relationship again if one person
wants kids and the other person doesn't
you can't compromise by having half a
child
I'm not yet a father so I'm not an
expert when it comes to children but I'm
pretty sure they don't come in half
sizes you either have one or none at all

[02:03]
sizes you either have one or none at all
so if the parties want different things
if the relationship is to continue one
person will need to concede to the
other's frame
however let's complicate this a little
bit more let's imagine that we're
dealing with two people who want exactly
the same things with respect to these
big non-compromisable decisions they met
in LA but they both want to start a
family in New York they're on the same
page he's not moving into her house
she's not moving into his house they're
going to buy a place together and call
it our house do you understand isn't
that possible Orion
and I would respond of course it's
possible people do things like that
every day the issue is that the frame
cannot be shared due to the passage of
time
even if we imagine that both people want
exactly the same things in exactly the
same amount
that will change as the days pass and

[03:01]
that will change as the days pass and
reality presents itself
people have different interests
preferences and temperaments life
doesn't treat everyone equally what this
means is that in practice when a couple
decides to say buy a house in New York
even if they both want exactly the same
thing in exactly the same amount in the
moment they make that decision
one person is actually going to like
that house more than the other one
person is actually going to like living
in New York more than the other one
person is actually going to benefit more
from their mutually constructed
lifestyle than the other
so even if there are mutuality in those
big decisions there isn't equality in
the subjective experience of the
consequences of those decisions in this
hypothetical example both parties were
equal co-creators of this relationship
frame but that's not how it's going to
feel with the passage of time this will
inevitably create an imbalance in the

[04:00]
inevitably create an imbalance in the
relationship which means that
functionally and in practice one person
will increasingly come to live in the
other's frame despite the fact that that
frame was mutually constructed

this episode I don't do big sponsorships
or product placements I rely on your
support to keep all this going and I
really appreciate it thank you
however
let's now go even one step further than
this let's imagine that we're dealing
with two people who not only want
exactly the same things in exactly the
same amount but that they track and
correct imbalances in frame as they
present themselves over time like they
regularly check in with how the

[05:01]
regularly check in with how the
relationship is going and continue to
change the frame in order to approximate
equality of preference over time
maybe one person likes New York more
than the other so the other person gets
to choose which house they get to buy or
something like that with some creativity
and good communication couldn't these
people co-create a mutual frame over
time even if it's not possible for two
people to like exactly the same things
in exactly the same amount indefinitely
wouldn't it be possible for two people
to create and continuously recreate a
frame in which both people experience
the same net happiness or satisfaction
and I would respond go ahead and try let
me see how it goes well it's
theoretically possible to live in this
way the amount of attention and time and
energy and money that would need to be
spent in order to track the subjective
experiences of both parties in order to
ensure that one person isn't being
privileged more than the other with
respect to their Mutual decisions and to

[06:00]
respect to their Mutual decisions and to
constantly make adjustments to the frame
in order to undo that fluctuating
privilege would be considerable it's
theoretically possible but it's neither
practical nor efficient
most people don't want to live this way
because in order to live this way you
spend a sizable amount of the
relationship talking about the
relationship which is probably one of
the least interesting things you can do
in a relationship and the more time you
spend on the relationship the less time
you have for whatever you got into that
relationship to do
so it's time consuming and inefficient
it also tends to reduce the
effectiveness of the relationship this
is why you don't see frame switching in
any successful organization or business
on the planet like if you were on a
plane
would you want the pilot and the
co-pilot to switch roles halfway to the
destination like wouldn't it be more

[07:01]
destination like wouldn't it be more
fair and egalitarian if everyone got a
chance to be the captain
how would you feel about that as a
passenger
one of the reasons why this doesn't
happen is that not only is switching
inefficient as it takes time and effort
to make the change and enter into the
new frame but it's dangerous as well
every step is an opportunity to misstep
so all other things being equal we
generally want the most parsimonious
solution with the fewest moving parts
just consider what happens every year
when Daylight Saving Time ends and we
move the clocks back one hour in the
middle of the night
the next day like clockwork pun intended
traffic accidents go up absenteeism
spikes and we collectively experience
billions of dollars in losses and
damages and that all comes from changing
the clocks one hour
once a year
if your changing frame continuously then

[08:02]
if your changing frame continuously then
you're not only likely wasting a lot of
time energy and money but you're
significantly increasing your error rate
and the likelihood that you're working
toward inferior outcomes
in my opinion a better alternative is
role complementarity each party should
figure out what he or she does well and
specialize and that of course would mean
that one person would be better at
constructing and maintaining the frame
than the other and this of course would
dovetail nicely with my doc metaphor in
which captains build ships their
