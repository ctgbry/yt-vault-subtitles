you are free to think whatever you want
in the privacy of your own Consciousness
you can test or play with all kinds of
thoughts and ideas you can think hateful
things you can think absurd things you
can think patently untrue things you are
free to think whatever you want that is
your right however you are not free to
feel however you want as a consequence
of what you choose to think that part's
not up to you if you choose to think
that you are worthless and competent and
that nothing ever goes your way you are
going to feel depressed if you choose to
think that you are a Perpetual victim of
betrayal and Injustice you are going to
feel angry if you choose to think that
other people have good things that you
could never hope to earn or achieve you
are going to feel envious and it's not
possible to feel happy if you
simultaneously feel depressed or angry
or envious like those two states cannot
coexist at the same time
