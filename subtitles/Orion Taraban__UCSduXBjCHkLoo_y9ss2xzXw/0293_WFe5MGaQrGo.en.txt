I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
women want it all
so the title of this episode is actually
a riff on one of my all-time favorite
psychology research papers entitled
attractive women want it all it appeared
in the journal evolutionary psychology
in 2008 volume 6 issue 1 in case you
want to look it up and I love this paper
because it's like the Nerds and academic
psychology finally researched a question
that the average guy both didn't already
know the answer to and really wanted to
know the answer to namely
the question of what women wanted now
before I unpack This research which is
very surprising please remember to like

quality content to the world so thank
you for your help so what happened in
this study basically the researchers
started by asking about a hundred guys
to write a whole bunch of women in terms
of their attractiveness their face their
body and their overall appearance and
the women invited to participate in the
study were the ones that the men rated
most highly the researchers then sent
these really involved surveys to the
women deemed most attractive by the men
and the surveys functionally asked in a
hundred different ways ladies what do
you want do you want a handsome man do
you want a rich man do you want a family
man do you want an emotionally available
man do you want a committed man what do
you want
and how did the women respond
the women basically responded with a
single word
yes
it turns out that attractive women
wanted
every single thing on the list and this

[02:00]
every single thing on the list and this
was surprising to the researchers the
women looked at all of these qualities
and attributes and collectively said
yeah sounds good I'll take it
it's a fascinating study because I think
it's very honest but here's the really
interesting part while the women
apparently wanted it all they didn't
want everything equally
the women expressed a positive desire
for all the attributes across like two
dozen different categories however some
preferences were much stronger than
others and according to the study the
three categories that the women cared
the least about do you know what they
were you're gonna love this
that he be intelligent
that he be loyal
and that he be kind and understanding
the women would prefer to have those
things than not but those three things
actually weren't even statistically
significant according to the researchers

[03:02]
significant according to the researchers
analyzes intelligence loyalty and
kindness of the nearly two dozen things
that attracted women want in a man these
were apparently the three attributes
they could most readily dispense with so
what's the upshot if you're taking the
study at face value it means men
if you want to be a viable option for
very attractive women you need to listen
to what these women actually value
if you're putting a lot of energy into
your intelligence your loyalty and your
kindness especially if doing so detracts
from other higher value attributes like
being physically fit earning a lot of
money providing a house Etc
you're probably not gonna be picked for
Dodgeball
you got me
