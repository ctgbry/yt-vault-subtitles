the fastest way to build relationships
is to undergo a shared trial undergoing
a shared trial brings people together as
it functionally forces them to lean on
each other in order to overcome the
trial so by entering into a period of
apprenticeship where you'll be asked to
perform a great deal in a short amount
of time you will be undergoing a shared
difficulty with your fellow aspirants to
make a friend you actually need to spend
time with the other person let's say you
try to make a buddy by going to the
Wednesday night Jiu Jitsu class at the
local Dojo every week in a year you
could have spent around 50 hours
together but if you were to enroll in
some kind of training camp you might be
able to spend a couple hundred hours
together in the span of a few months and
because it's tied to some kind of
achievement or certification you're not
going to encounter the kind of flakiness
or non-investment that plagues casual
classes these programs often attract a
higher caliber of person than those you
might find just hanging around at the
local pub
