in my episode the worst thing to say in
a dating profile shania simsel comments
it's good to add in your profile that
you are looking for a long-term
relationship in order to weed out the f
boys well
i can see how that makes a superficial
level of sense however i don't think it
actually works in practice
but in order to back up that hypothesis
with some evidence i decided to activate
my hinge profile
and do some swiping hinge is interesting
because men and women can indicate what
their dating intentions are in their
profile and i swiped until i saw a
hundred
women who indicated their dating
preferences and i had the results right
here
and what i discovered is that 89 of
those 199 percent said that they were
looking for a long-term relationship or
a life partner
so if women are complaining about
meeting f-boys on online dating apps
and 89 of them are saying they want a
long-term relationship or a life partner
i don't think it's actually working to
weed out the f-boys so something to
consider
