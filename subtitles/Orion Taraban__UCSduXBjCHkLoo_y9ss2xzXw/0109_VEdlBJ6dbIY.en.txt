i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
overcoming scarcity mentality
so i have a secret to confess
when i was in my teens and early
twenties i would occasionally receive a
gift from a friend or a family member
something small like a cupcake or a
bunch of cookies
and even though i was delighted by the
present even though the present looked
rather delicious
i would often refrain from eating the
present
because on some level if i ate it it
would be gone
and then i would have nothing
but if i didn't need it i would still
have the present
i understand that this was irrational
but it's what i did
i'd sometimes keep those cookies for
months even though doing so would cause
them to go stale
because it would keep me connected to
the gift
and the intention that i presume to be
behind it
of course
in the holding on to the gift i lost the
gift because the cookies got stale

[01:00]
gift because the cookies got stale
but for a time i managed to convince
myself that i still had it
and i think this is how the scarcity
mentality works i'm going to cling to
this and not use it or enjoy it or
experience it i'm going to cling to this
because clinging is preferable to the
nothingness that i expect would take its
place
where i too use it or enjoy it or
experience it
i had no real confidence that if i were
to eat the cookies they would be
replaced by a fresh batch on a
reasonable timeline
for me that's the crux of the scarcity
mentality if i were to eat the cookie it
wouldn't be replaced
now the fact of the matter is that we
need to eat cookies in order to create
space for more cookies to come into our
lives
if my friend were to find out that i
hadn't yet eaten the cookie she had
already given me
why would she bake me more
it would be wasteful
and i think both people and the universe

[02:00]
and i think both people and the universe
tend to operate according to this
rational principle of parsimony
the reality is
that we're going to lose the cookie
anyway
whether we lose it through staleness or
whether we lose it through consumption
is irrelevant the cookie is doomed
so if we're going to lose the cookie
anyway why not enjoy it
and why not cultivate more trust in one
of the more rational dimensions of
reality namely that nature abhors a
vacuum
in enjoying the cookie we create the
space for more cookies to come into our
lives
now in the beginning this attitude
requires some measure of faith that the
void will be filled but the more you do
it the more you will come to trust in
this underlying fabric of reality
it's in the nature of things that you
will be provided for
you will be provided love and friendship
and money and growth and health and
redemption
these things won't always be provided to
you on a silver platter and that's good
because it gives us something to do with
our time
but the universe is abundant in its

[03:01]
but the universe is abundant in its
possibilities there are opportunities
for all of these things
but we first need to create the space
for them to come into our lives by
increasingly letting go of what we cling
to in our fear
and the best way to do that
is to consume through active
participation
the goodness that comes into your life
thus opening up more space for even more
goodness to arrive in time
i hope that makes sense
