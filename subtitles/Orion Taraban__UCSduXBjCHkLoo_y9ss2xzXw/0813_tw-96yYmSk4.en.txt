basically when I talk with women in
their 20s the question often arises as
to why they choose to focus on their
education and professional development
in the decade that all other things
being equal their sexual Marketplace
value is at their Peak and they would be
most able to secure the most favorable
terms with the most attractive men for a
long-term relationship why do they
choose to prioritize the one set of
goals over the other and the response
that I almost always get from these
women is something like well the career
is kind of a hedge Ryan in the first
place I can't just sit and wait for a
rich man to snatch me up things cost
money and if no one else is buying I
need to pay for myself but even if I
were snatched up by a rich man I
wouldn't ever want to be in a situation
where I am financially dependent on my
husband as this would leave me in a
vulnerable and Powerless State what
happens if the relationship goes
sideways I NAB a guy at 22 but I don't
go to school I don't enter the workforce
I don't build a career and then at 40 he
leaves me for his secretary like where
does that leave me
