the fact of the matter is that the vast
majority of suffering on this planet is
unnecessary and that unnecessary
suffering is caused by ignorance of
course malice exists but malice is
actually a special form of ignorance an
ignorance of the underlying nature of
reality if it's true that most people
are generally doing the best they can
then it must also be true that most
people have a lot to learn their
consciousnesses are dark and confused
and they are also mostly responsible for
the suffering that they experience which
has more to do with their thoughts
beliefs and behaviors than with external
reality just think about it was that
cancer patient peaceful and content
prior to his diagnosis was that
heartbroken woman grateful and joyful
before her relationship ended if
suffering especially the unnecessary
kind has much more to do with our
judgment and understanding that it has
to do with external reality then what
real good is it to change the
circumstances of external reality that's
like a doctor who treats a patient's
symptoms because he lacks the knowledge
or ability to cure the underlying
disease
