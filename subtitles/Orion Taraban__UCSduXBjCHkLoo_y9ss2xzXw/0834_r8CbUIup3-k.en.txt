how we come across other people is
through our social media so the way you
look has more of an importance in if
you're meeting people online for example
how you look on Instagram or on your
dating apps if people are using that
yeah it makes sense though it's like I
was talking about whether you're using a
dating app or Instagram you kind of want
that to be the glossy brochure for who
you might be getting if you were to sign
up for a relationship with you uh with
women it's very important to have
extremely beautiful shots of their face
and their body men that's also useful
not as important with men what I often
counsel them to do is you want to have
first of all fantastic pictures so they
should be on an SLR camera with good
lighting like it shouldn't be just
something blurry and Casual right and
the idea is not only should the man in
the picture look as attractive as he
possibly can be but the various photos
on the profile or on the the social
media profile the dating profile the
social media profile should represent
different facets of his life
