I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the court
does not deal in Trifles so this is a
phrase that I learned from a friend back
when he was going through law school
apparently the Supreme Court of the
United States hears between 100 and 150
cases every year that's their session
however the court is asked to review
over
7,000 cases a year that means that
between 98 and
99% of all petitions are dismissed
that's a very high reject rate and
generally when the court rejects a
petition they provide a reason for their
decision to do so and one of the reasons
the Supreme Court can give when they
reject a petition for a hearing is the
title of this episode namely the court
does not deal in Trifles and this is a
nice polite way of saying this isn't
worth our [ __ ] time I first heard

[01:02]
worth our [ __ ] time I first heard
that phrase the court does not deal in
Trifles when I was 21 years old and it
has stuck with me ever since my friends
you have to understand that just like
the Supreme Court of the United States
you have a limited amount of time a
limited amount of resources and a
limited amount of bandwidth with which
to deal with the [ __ ] of everyday
life and if you give your time resources
and bandwidth to to any one thing you
are not giving it to anything else
within the context of necessary scarcity
attending to that which truly does not
matter is an enormous liability for
several important reasons in the first
place it lowers your station and dignity
things only really have value at the
point of transaction and that includes
intangibles that means for instance if
you're going to lose your [ __ ] every
time you suffer a minor inconvenience

[02:02]
time you suffer a minor inconvenience
then that's exactly how much your piece
is worth a minor inconvenience and it's
worth that much because apparently it
only takes a minor inconvenience to
purchase your
piece by the same token if you're going
to respond to every niggling criticism
someone throws in your general direction
then that's exactly how much your time
is worth a niggling criticism and it's
worth that much because apparently it
only takes a niggling criticism to
purchase your time and you've decided
that your peace and time are worth that
much because you decided to engage which
is to say you decided to transact at
that price point on the other hand by
selectively choosing what you will
respond to you effectively sell your
time and peace and attention at a higher
price point communicating both to
yourself and others that these are
valuable resources coming from a person

[03:00]
valuable resources coming from a person
of some worth and dignity many people
aren't respected at the levels they
would prefer precisely because they
devalue these resources through
inflation giving your attention to
everyone who asks for it is functionally
like printing more money all it
effectively does is diminish the value
of the resource already in circulation
you can never increase the value of
something by creating more of it only by
creating less of it so by letting most
things slide you will begin to carry
yourself with greater dignity and
self-possession in the second place it's
important to understand that not all
time which is generally your most
valuable resource is equally valuable
people say that you have 24 hours in a
day that's not really true you're
spending at least 10 of those hours
sleeping and attending to necessary
self-care that leaves 14 hours however
you don't even really have 14 hours in a
day

[04:00]
day
this is because people have a limited
bandwidth with respect to their focused
attention for most folks this is between
four and six hours a day I call these
hours the golden time and it's when
people are at their Peak mental
functioning for all intents and purposes
these are the only hours you really have
in a given day at least with respect to
any tasks requiring high levels of
creativity or concentration or physical
exertion or careful reasoning or
performative Charisma Etc that means
that if you squander these hours you
functionally squander the entire day now
before I go any further if you're liking
what you're hearing please consider
sending this episode to someone who
might benefit from its message because
it's Word of Mouth referrals like this
that really helped to make the channel
grow I'm also proud to announce that
I'll soon be publishing my book the
value of others so if you'd like to

description okay let's get back to
it now your golden time should be
guarded very jealously you should not be
responding to emails during that time
you should not be sitting in meetings
during that time you should not be
allowing your wife or your friends or
your family to introduce unnecessary
problems into that time this is because
attending to these demands during the
golden time is a
misallocation of resources if the
Supreme Court used one of its 100
hearings to adjudicate a spat between
neighbors with respect to where their
property line is to be drawn that would
be a slap in the nation's face by the
same token if you are texting with your
girlfriend about her frustrations with a
coworker during your golden time that
would be a slap in your own face you
would would be disrespecting your own

[06:01]
would would be disrespecting your own
time and you communicate that your time
isn't worth much more than serving as a
passive receptacle for an impotent
frustration guard your time more
jealously don't expect others to do it
for
you this means that you will likely have
to start saying no a lot more often and
that's not a word that is often well
received especially by women however
that's not your problem how people
respond to feedback is their problem how
you guard your own time is your problem
don't get it mixed up this means that
you don't have to manage their reaction
to your feedback and they don't have to
protect your time everyone has enough on
their own plates without eating off
anyone else's and guess what if a
certain problem is a trifle then any
problem created by not dealing with that
trifle is also a trifle it's even
smaller than a trifle it's it's like a
micro trifle it's like a nanot trifle

[07:01]
micro trifle it's like a nanot trifle
don't allow other people's reactive
noise to influence your judgment over
the significance of the original issue
telling people no will be disappointing
to certain people however you have to
appreciate that the alternative to this
is disappointing Yourself by doing
violence to your own judgment and
priorities and if you're ever put in a
situation which is usually done against
your will by another person in which you
are forced to make a decision between
between disappointing yourself and
disappointing someone else than failing
any explicit agreement to the contrary
disappoint the other person like that
should be the default decision
here now if you say you're going to do
something you should do it and if you
say you're not going to do something you
shouldn't do it but in the absence of
That explicit agreement if someone is
just operating under the unjustified
expectation that they somehow deserve
your time or they are entitled your
attention or they should be able to

[08:01]
attention or they should be able to
expect certain consideration just
because they are dating you or because
they are a friend or a family member
then they are mistaken this is not
necessarily true like we certainly
prioritize these people over random
folks in society but even these Intimate
Relationships do not come with
functional entitlements that haven't
been mutually and explicitly
negotiated failing to appropriately
disappoint others often creates
resentment which will corrode a person's
contentment and willingness to
enthusiastically remain in the
relationship in the long term and this
is your responsibility to do just like
it's the Court's responsibility to
reject 99% of its petitions this is
especially important to remember because
there are plenty of people who exist in
the world who will keep taking until
they are actively
resisted they're not going to pick up on
your sign signals or read the room or

[09:01]
your sign signals or read the room or
know better that's an extremely passive
if not an extremely passive aggressive
position to take and it also disempowers
you as it functionally Awards another
person control over your time and peace
take that power back say no reject deny
disappoint ignore why because the court
does not deal in Trifles just because
it's important to someone else does not
necessarily mean that it has to be
important to you don't even give your
attention to things if they don't pass a
certain threshold of significance
something to consider what do you think
does this fit with your own experience
