[00:00]
I think one way that we can think about
archetypes is that they're Universal
symbols that they exist in the
collective Consciousness and may even
have like a biological origin and these
are ways of perceiving that all human
beings are capable of
um they're all human beings are capable
of regardless of their culture or their
language so these are symbols like
um
like death
or like
um the wise old man or
um the empress things like that you know
the kind of stuff that shows up on tarot
cards actually yeah so it I think that
there is a strong argument for the
possibility of archetypal symbology in
all human beings just like there seems
to be some Universal human emotions that
are always kind of as far as we know
experience but certainly expressed in
the same way regardless of people's
culture or socialization

[01:00]
culture or socialization
um what have you what have you done with
respect to junkian archetypes in your
work Rob
well funnily enough I just finished
editing uh yesterday morning or the day
before
um I've got a new video that I haven't
put out yet which is on um
Carl Jung's uh quite short book called
the Undiscovered self
um I read that for the first time
recently and it's only 79 pages so
sometime recorded that
um
yeah I mean I've been aware of Carl
Jung's stuff for a long time I've read
about his theories but never read his
books until recently I think I've read
some of his papers before
um and I I think it's fantastic he's
absolutely brilliant he was so ahead of
the Kev and like the stuff that he was
writing away back in the 1950s is
absolutely relevant today
um yeah so I mean was there some
specific aspect of young that you wanted
to discuss there well you've made a
couple of videos on the Shadow and I

[02:00]
couple of videos on the Shadow and I
think the shadow is really interesting
because there are a few different ways
that we can approach the idea of the
Shadow both in jungian Psychology and in
other forms of psychology
um I think there are two general
um ways to approach it that I'm aware of
and you can correct me if you if you
want to change the definition or if you
have another idea one is that the shadow
is sort of the disavowed self it's the
part of myself that I don't allow myself
to acknowledge and so I deny and repress
and and see it in other people and want
to destroy the projected evil that I
perceive in others because I'm willing
to accept it in myself I think that is
the more let's say jungian approach to
it there's another
um idea about the shadow that basically
says the shadow is kind of inescapable
even if you were to do all of this deep
personal
you know psychological work to kind of
like understand your demons as we say to
integrate Your Shadow you still have a
shadow you can't get away from it

[03:00]
shadow you can't get away from it
because your shadow in this
conceptualization is just the sum of all
of your unchosen lines
that it's not necessarily a bad thing
it's just the path that you didn't take
and on some level The Shadow
becomes even more dangerous to the
individual when the unchosen path
represents let's say greater happiness
and prosperity than the one that you
decided to take does that make sense
yeah yeah
um okay so let's try to think there so
so you're talking about the like the the
rejected part of ourselves absolutely
that's so big I totally agree with that
and we projected on to others and then
we we hate the other people who we
projected onto absolutely and uh you
know I mean young talked about that in
terms of world of thought world affairs
Wars and stuff you know it's like he
said virtually all was it's just two
sides each projecting their own shadow
onto the other side and then attacking
it you know so

[04:00]
it you know so
um he talked about the the mutual
withdrawing of projections as a way of
stopping War not an easy thing to
persuade all the leaders to do is it
um and then the other one you mentioned
can you just clarify that for me a
little bit again yeah rather it be like
so in the first definition the things
that I'm disavowing of myself are like
my own capacity for cruelty my own
darkness my own hatred my own envy and
selfishness
I'd prefer you know like I'd prefer to
think of myself as all good as righteous
as honest as forthright but like those
those darknesses live inside of me you
know and I if if I don't get through
them they're always there they're built
in um
yeah and so uh it's in our nature the
way we we grew up and you know the way
we evolved we had to fight we had to be
we had to fear you know all that kind of
stuff yeah it's yeah you can't get
really you can become aware of the
Shadow and lessen its effect on you so

[05:03]
Shadow and lessen its effect on you so
that you don't project so much but you
can't get rid of it that's my
understanding of it yeah and I think
that the more that I do that shadow work
myself and accept those parts of myself
I've become more compassionate and
patient with other people because it's
like yeah and when I see this and other
people I'm like well you know have I
really done have I done something that
bad myself in the past maybe I have
could and if I haven't could I yeah I
probably could so
um you know I don't want to give bad
behavior a pass but it is important to
the we can respond to that behavior
without necessarily needing to hate it
or destroy it absolutely so yeah so
that's that's one part the other part is
that um like
think think about this maybe there's an
archetypal story I can't think of one on
top of my head but there's like two twin
brothers and one person takes the path
of I'm becoming a scholar and I'm
working hard and I'm getting married and
becoming a productive member of society
the other person takes the path of I

[06:00]
the other person takes the path of I
want uh a life of adventure and
exploration and
um danger and like this intensity of
Life neither one is necessarily bad or
wrong but one is kind of the shadow of
the other because they couldn't take
you'd either take one path or the other
and on some level that twin becomes the
shadow of the other person because
um they represent all of their the way
their life could have been but they
didn't choose does that make sense so
all of the uh motivations the desires
that would have unpinned the the would
have been the basis of that ultimate
life if it had happened
you go down a different path but
okay I guess you could say the edge for
the the path that you didn't go down
that edge is still there you could refer
to that as like the shadow sure because
whenever we make a choice we actually
have to forbear every other decision out
there and so every decision requires

[07:01]
there and so every decision requires
this sacrifice and that means like
actually giving up a huge part of our
lives and a huge part of our our
potentiality it's like my best friend in
in high school he right out of college
went to law school and he got a
corporate job and he bought a house and
got married and I was an actor and I was
living this kind of life and he would
look at me sometimes and think oh Ryan
you're so free you get to do kind of
whatever you want and I was like yeah
but I'm broke and you got a nice house
and a fancy car so it's like we just
represented the path that the other
didn't take okay yeah yeah that's a lot
of paths there it is right yeah
yeah but so I think in that case the
shadow is more around like Choice points
it's like if I could
um you know what would my life have been
like if I didn't marry this person or if
I didn't become a doctor but it's
usually around really or even that this
tragedy didn't befall me you know what
I'm saying that's a big one yeah

[08:02]
I'm saying that's a big one yeah
so it's not necessarily about the the
negative that's just another way of
looking at it but we can talk about
either one of those definitions of the
Shadow or something else I think I got
what you mean though yeah I mean it's um
the the term Shadow because Shadows are
literally dark implies that it's a
negative uh
nature to the to the shadow but yeah I
definitely agreed as
either whether you would call it the
same Shadow wall whether we've got
multiple Shadows that come with us and
some are more positive some are more
negative yeah but definitely I agree
that there's
um
an unconscious side of us that follows
us that's full of positive things
definitely yeah I definitely agree
that's the case I mean whether you want
to lump that in with the negative side
and call it as one or whether you can
separate it out into different pieces
for them but we're getting into
mathematical uh
relationship comparisons there so I
don't think the words really can do it
justice can they you know they often

[09:00]
justice can they you know they often
can't so I was bringing this up in the
context of your analysis of a full metal
jacket do you want to talk about that or
do you want me to try yeah great yeah
yeah so what do you what do you see is
the role of the shadow in that film
uh the main thing that I see is the the
split between the two halves of the
movie the first half and the second half
and a lot of people don't like the
second half of the movie this is quite
interesting because uh I mean young
talked about
that a lot of people don't like
accessing their own unconscious they
don't want to be aware of their own
shadow it's uncomfortable isn't it you
know so um so naturally they don't like
the second half of the little jackets so
much because it gets into the the the
youngin Shadow thing uh and you know
Kubrick did talk about Carl Jung in
relation to Full Metal jackets and
interviews he specifically said that he
and the co-writer Michael Hare who wrote
the book uh is called dispatches which
Full Metal Jacket takes many of its
scenes from

[10:00]
scenes from
um Kubrick said that he and Michael hair
were specifically talking about ways of
getting Young's The Shadow into full
metal jackets so I mean you know never
mind all the secrecy that with 2001
Space Odyssey that Kubrick was pretty
open about putting uh jungi and Shadow
Concepts into full metal jacket it's not
so obvious when you watch the movie
because nobody tells you except for that
one moment when um The Joker character
is talking to I think is a kernel or a
and sort of high rank an officer and the
officer the officer demands to know from
why have you got a peace symbol on your
your jacket and you've got born to kill
written on your helmet and Joker says I
was trying to make um a comment about
The Duality of Man the jungian thing you
know that that's quite a blatant
giveaway for Kubrick I mean he's not
normally that blatant but you know he
slipped it in there
um so yeah but for me the overall split
that happens in that movie is between

[11:00]
that happens in that movie is between
the first and second half and the way I
view it is that the recruits in the
first half of the movie
they are shadowed in the second half of
the movie
those recruits in the first half are
reborn as
the Lost hog Squad in the second half of
the movie uh I did have a video up there
at fact it's still up uh about Full
Metal Jacket called um it was about the
private pile character
um Born Again hard I think I called the
the video I haven't watched that one a
few days ago I thought that was really
insightful yeah so so you know the basic
point where private pile his death is
symbolic in the toilets in the first
half of the movie and that's like
killing off the the innocent child he's
like a baby like innocent character and
in the military training they want to
kill that off they want to get rid of
your innocence and your your
childishness and just turn you into a
man I mean they literally call you we're

[12:00]
man I mean they literally call you we're
going to turn you into a man that that's
standard jargon in you know military
training so they want to get rid of the
infants so he gets killed off uh
symbolically in the first half and then
he comes back in the second half uh his
shadow is the character called animal
mother and if you watch the two
characters they have similar facial
expressions similar height and build
one's fat and the other ones suddenly
become lean and um yeah so this that
that's your Shadow at work right there
and what neither of them is aware of the
other animal mother never ever makes any
reference to uh the first half of the
movie in fact in the second half of the
movie nobody talks about the first half
of the movie at all
um the cowboy character shows up in the
second half and Joker meets up with them
but it's like the first half of the
movie didn't even exist I think that
freaks people out and watching film out
of jackets like you're watching two
separate movies
um and I think it was like they're two
heart two hemispheres of the brain

[13:00]
heart two hemispheres of the brain
separate of the oil and but it's not
just animal mother who that happens with
lots of the other characters in the
first half of the movie appear to be
reborn in the second half so you've got
private snowball which is the black
character in the first half and he
becomes private eight ball in the second
half
and he gets killed later
um and yet yeah so that that's that's
the way I look at it is the the squad is
reborn as their jungian shadows in
Vietnam and the military has split their
psyche so that they've become somebody
else and they can't even remember who
the hell they were when he started the
basic training
