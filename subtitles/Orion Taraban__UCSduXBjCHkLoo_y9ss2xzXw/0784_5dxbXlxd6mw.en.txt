in the act of wrestling with the angel
of love you will shed resentment hatred
bitterness and selfishness and the more
you wrestle with this Angel the more you
will lose these things because these
things are the cost of love like you
cannot be a loving person while you
still Harbor resentment hatred
bitterness and selfishness it's not that
you're not supposed to feel these things
you literally can't feel them and love
at the same time where the first
emotions are the other isn't and vice
versa now this isn't going to happen
overnight you can't just hand over your
resentment and egotism and expect to
receive love in return why because these
things are deeply subtly and vigorously
lodged inside of you it will take time
and effort and care and discernment you
will have to wrestle with yourself only
after a while will these elements be
sufficiently disentangled that you will
be able if you so desire to make a
sacrifice of your egoic self which is
ultimately the cost of love
