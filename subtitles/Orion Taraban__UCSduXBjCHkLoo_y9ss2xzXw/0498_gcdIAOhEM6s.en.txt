I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is women
need game too this one is for the ladies
women it turns out you also need game
game is not just for the boys however
men and women need game for different
reasons let me help you understand this
let's say you're about to go on a first
date with a guy you matched with on a
dating app you're probably not thinking
to S I hope he'll let me Smash like I
hope the date goes so well that he'll
take me back to his place and do
whatever he wants with me there might be
some women out there that think that and
feel free to get in touch with me if
that's you but they're decidedly in the
minority my understanding is that women
generally dislike dating if they're
thinking anything before the date it's
probably something like please God
please Jesus alab Buddha please make him
better than the last guy please make

[01:00]
better than the last guy please make
this the last first date I ever have to
go on please hear my prayer and that's
because women generally want
relationships and if they could skip
right to that part they would however
they can't so dating is something of a
necessary evil for them this is also why
they're generally not very good at it
but that's the subject for another
episode in any case that's my
understanding of how women tend to
approach first dat however it's also
true that most women have had sex with a
guy on the first date how did that
happen that wasn't the woman's primary
intention going into the date right did
she just stumble into bed no it happened
because that was the guy's primary
intention and because he had game that
is the guy was able to sufficiently
stimulate that woman's interest and
attraction and confidently lead the
interaction in the direction of a sexual
encounter after all women are The

[02:00]
encounter after all women are The
Gatekeepers of sex so sex happened
because the guy was able to find a way
inside nice work guy the point is that
most women don't go into that situation
hoping for or expecting that outcome and
yet that outcome happens every day
that's game now let's take a look at it
from the other side shall we as a guy I
can tell you that when we're about to go
on a first date with a woman that we
matched with on a dating app we are not
thinking I hope she's the one I hope
this is the love of my life and my
future wife and the mother of my
children I hope she's willing to take it
slow and that she's ready for a serious
relationship because that's sure what I
want now there might be some men out
there who think that way but they are
decidedly in the minority most men are
thinking I hope she looks like her
pictures and she lets me
Smash that's how men tend to approach

[03:00]
Smash that's how men tend to approach
First Dates however it's also true that
men end up getting married and starting
Families how did that happened that
wasn't the guy's primary intention when
he started pursuing her did he just
stumble onto the altar no it happened
because that was the woman's primary
intention and because she had some game
that is the woman sufficiently
stimulated the man's interest and
attraction and was able to direct the
interaction in the direction of a
committed relationship after all men are
The Gatekeepers of commitment so
commitment happened because the woman
was able to find a way to get inside
nice work lady the point is that most
men don't go into that situation hoping
for or expecting that outcome and yet
that outcome happens every day that's
game now before I go any further if

offers every day to do that this helps
me stay independent and allows me to
produce this high quality content for
you I really appreciate it thank
you as a any woman who has dated for a
while has learned committed
relationships generally don't happen if
men are just left to their own devices
most men are totally fine keeping things
casual indefinitely this is because as I
talked about in my episode men treat
women the way women treat money we
already had to work really hard just to
get sexually selected so we want to
enjoy our time not take on a second job
most men don't have relationship goals
like women do that's because the goal of

[05:02]
like women do that's because the goal of
most men is to get laid they don't think
much beyond that this is because the
vast majority of men are incredibly
hungry for sex and they would be
absolutely ravenous if they weren't
anesthetizing themselves with
pornography when people are starving all
they think about is food they're not
really interested in what happens after
dinner now women you might be disgusted
by this you might think oh if I just
want sex go somewhere else but it's like
that's actually men are so e easy to get
into relationships with because of that
that's where they're so vulnerable
that's what I'd like you to consider is
that this is an opportunity for you it's
not something that like should be
considered beneath you in any case most
men don't have a problem with dating
casually and if women aren't satisfied
with that then like men on a first date
looking to have sex with a woman who
wasn't principally focused on doing so
women need game to guide the situation
in the direction of a committed
relationship and let me tell you most

[06:01]
relationship and let me tell you most
women are terrible at this they are
terrible most of them just flat out tell
the guy that they're looking for a
committed relationship and it's like
yeah and what you have to understand
ladies is that that line is like a man
telling you that he's looking for casual
sex
like what is that to you right how often
do you [ __ ] men who talk to you like
that ever right and yet you do [ __ ] men
and the men you do [ __ ] don't talk to
you like that do they the same is true
for you men don't just hand out
committed relationships to women because
they're looking for them it doesn't work
this is because a strange woman asking
me if I want to have a committed
relationship with her sounds about as
appealing as if she'd asked me if I
wanted to have unnecessary dental
surgery this weekend saying this because
you don't want to waste your time ends

[07:00]
you don't want to waste your time ends
up wasting your time because it works
about as well as a guy saying he doesn't
want to waste his time on a date if you
can't first reassure him that there's a
strong likelihood that he'll have sex at
the end of it like it's going to take a
long time for him to not waste his time
isn't it ladies if trying to set
expectations that sex will be in the
cards prior to a date doesn't work on
you ladies then trying to set
expectations that a committed
relationship will be in the cards prior
to it an interaction isn't going to work
on us there's no game here it's so
inelegant it doesn't work and without
game you can't get past the gatekeeper
if you're a man that means no date and
no sex and if you're a woman that means
no date and no committed relationship
remember wanting is free simply wanting
what you want is not sufficient to
getting it like if a man thought that a
woman should just give him sex because

[08:00]
woman should just give him sex because
he wanted it and didn't want to waste
his time if a woman wasn't interested
wouldn't you find that disgusting
wouldn't you find that narcissistically
entitled men earn their sexual
opportunity and they do this by being
sufficiently attractive and possessing
enough skill to guide a burgeoning
connection in the direction of sexual
intimacy women do the same thing you
earn your commitment and you do this by
being sufficiently attractive and
possessing enough skill to guide a
connection in the direction of a
committed
relationship that's female game and if
you don't have it it will be very hard
for you to get that commitment
especially in today's day and age where
there is significantly less social
pressure to give
it because let's be real what game women
have historically possessed is akin to
dread game in Men the goal was to make
men sufficiently uncomfortable for not

[09:00]
men sufficiently uncomfortable for not
giving you what you wanted until they
gave you what you wanted and the
principle way this was accomplished was
through shame and this worked not all
the time but at least it was something
you need to man up a real man would
respect me and my time and of course the
takeaway if you don't give me what I
want I'm leaving imagine if a man did
this for sex and like was pressuring you
to do that and to be fair some do and
they do it for the same reason that
women do this it works not all the time
but some of the time on some of the
people the issue here is that women's
game where it exists is always negative
it doesn't make us interested or excited
to give you what you want when it works
it works by making us nervous or
uncomfortable to not give you what you
want and listen to this next part very
closely ladies this only works on guys
who don't have other options and those

[10:03]
who don't have other options and those
guys aren't typically the ones you're
trying this on do you understand women
you have to appreciate that most men
will have sex with most of you so the
amount of interest that you have to
generate in a man in order for him to be
willing to have sex with you is very low
that is why among other things it's no
real accomplishment for a woman to get
laid like we don't call it getting lucky
when a woman has sex right however the
amount of interest that you have to
generate in a man in order for him to be
willing to commit to you is
extraordinarily high and it's high in
proportion to his
optionality it's not going to get there
by itself just like in the majority of
cases a woman's interest in having sex
with any particular guy isn't going to
get there by itself now you might be
thinking well that's not true Orion it's
gotten there by itself with me my
response would be that that's because

[11:00]
response would be that that's because
the guy you were dealing with was so
good that you didn't even notice what he
was doing and that is the epitome the
highest level to which game can attain
namely it becomes invisible to the other
party and the other person doesn't even
realize it's happening same thing when
women have very good
game the men think it's their idea to
advance the relationship in the
direction of her preferred level of
commitment this isn't typically that men
this isn't something that typically men
give you any more than you're just
handing sex out to men it's something
that you get men to give you expecting
men to give you what you want just
because you want it or just because
enough time has passed is a belief you
need to examine ladies the fact of the
matter is that you can get any man that
you have direct access to I am not

[12:01]
you have direct access to I am not
kidding you can get any man you want and
I'm going to be doing some episodes on
this subject in the near future but to
get him you have to have game you can't
get him by doing whatever you want you
can get any man you want but you can't
get them doing anything you want there
are certain ways that you have to behave
to do
that now let me tell you there are
millions of men right now who are out
there making it their second job
studying what women want just so that
they can get laid and in today's market
frankly sex isn't even all that valuable
like it's not that hard to get so ladies
if you want something extremely
expensive like a committed relationship
with a high value man you had better hit
the books and learn what works otherwise
I got no sympathy for you just keeping
it a buck what do you think does this
