now because romance was actually a
historical phenomenon it originated in
the south of France in the 15th century
we know who invented it men invented it
more specifically the chivalric Knights
of that time and place and these men
invented it for them for men not for
women and they invented romance in an
attempt to compete with the rich and
powerful men of their time for access to
the best women and this is because if a
guy couldn't convince a woman that he
had something special something
intangible that the king didn't have
there's no way he's getting laid the
truth about romance is that it's a
strategy that lower status men have
adopted in their attempt to compete
successfully with higher status men for
women this is also why romance is a
young man's game because most young men
don't have anything to offer women
