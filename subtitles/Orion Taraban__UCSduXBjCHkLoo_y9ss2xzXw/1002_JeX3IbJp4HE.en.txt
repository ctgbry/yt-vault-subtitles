Sex and power are very very closely
related to each other and we're going to
be exploring some of those relationships
today. To begin with, we have the claim
that everything is about sex. And I do
think this is true in the vast majority
of cases, especially when it comes to
men. I discussed this a bit in my
interview with Steven Bartlett on Diary
of a CEO last year. The unrestrained
sexual impulse in men is dangerous and
antisocial. Any man who does not learn
to control it quickly finds himself
exiled from the community or worse. It
would be chaos if men were to act in
this manner. Which is why we institute
our severest social and legal
punishments for men who act on their
sexual impulses indiscriminately.
Therefore, for society to function, the
sexual impulse needs to be channeled
into pro-social ends. Freud called this
unconscious process sublimation. And
it's the sublimation of this impulse

[01:00]
it's the sublimation of this impulse
that constitutes the drive to accomplish
the difficult, dangerous, and
uncomfortable tasks upon which
civilization is based. The term libido
has become specifically associated with
sexual desire, but Freud originally
intended it to mean something like life
force, which of course makes sense since
sex creates Life.
