I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is what is
conviction conviction is an interesting
word and there is a mystery inside of
this word if you look at the etymology
the origin of the word conviction it is
derived from the Latin prefix con
meaning with and the verb vincere
meaning to conquer
so conviction literally means with
conquering or perhaps more felicitously
with victory
thus conviction means victoriously
but before I unpack the nature of this

okay so conviction means victoriously
well that's a little weird right because
that's generally not how we use that
term as in that person has the courage
of his convictions where's the victory

[01:01]
of his convictions where's the victory
in that here's the thing the victory at
the heart of conviction
is a victory over doubt
once a person is able to triumph over
his Tendencies to doubt himself he
arrives at conviction
and that's why conviction is actually
something of a double-edged sword people
who have triumphed over their doubt can
be both very admirable
and very terrifying
some of the most heinous things that
have ever been perpetuated throughout
history have been done by people who are
either not willing or not able to doubt
whether they were right in what they
were doing
and so a lot of thinking sensitive folks
issue conviction because of that very
reason they see the potential for
zealotry and fanaticism inherent in
conviction
by the same token
if we never attain to conviction it's
very hard to make progress through life
that is if we're unwilling to make a
decision and to remain committed to that
decision nothing of significance gets

[02:02]
decision nothing of significance gets
accomplished if we're not convicted in
our destination for example we either
never leave the house or we change
directions so often that we never really
make any progress at all
so where does that leave us it's
important to entertain Reasonable Doubt
in advance of the decision and in
certain circumstances to review that
decision after the fact but we cannot
allow doubt to obstruct our Forward
Motion it is the work of each person to
arrive at conviction with respect to his
or her purpose and principles and attain
to victory over doubt after due prudence
