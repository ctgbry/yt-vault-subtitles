I have a question for you, Dr. Ryan. How
do you know what is it that you truly
want and need in a relationship?
&gt;&gt; That's very difficult to know. I I think
that it's hard to know what we truly
want. That could be an onion that has
many different layers as we dive deeper
into our experience. I think we have a
general idea of what we consciously
desire and that seems to be the target
that we place in the external world that
we move towards. The really frustrating
and difficult thing about relationships
is that what we want and need changes as
a function of time and also as a
function of getting what we want. This
is one of the things that makes
relationships so difficult in the long
term. Basically, I move towards you
because I sense that you have what I
want.
But if you give it to me, then on some
level, I don't need you as much as I
previously did. And so by satisfying my
need or desire, you've you've undermined
the basis of our relationship. The
metaphor I use in the book is no one

[01:01]
metaphor I use in the book is no one
continues to pay the plumber in the
sense that the plumber is in very high
demand when the toilet is backed up, but
after the problem has been solved, no
one continues to pay that guy. He goes
on his way. And so this is a very
difficult
line to walk because if I get the sense
that I can never get what I want or need
from you, I might put up with it for a
while, but eventually I'm going to get
frustrated and take my ball and go home.
But if you give me everything that I
want and need right away, then on some
level you're complicit in making
yourself obsolete.
And I'm only going to continue to relate
to you if I have a deep abiding love or
friendship for you, which are um let's
put it mildly, rare. They take time and
to to develop those types of
relationships and they're really
developed for their own inscrutable
reasons and given from the free and
spontaneous will of the givers with no
strings attached.
