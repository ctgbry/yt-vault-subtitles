i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
applied stoicism
good and bad
so this is the first in a series of
short talks on applied stoicism which is
what i call my adaptation of stoic
philosophy for the practice of clinical
psychology
and it all kind of begins with an
understanding of the concepts good and
bad
you know the older i get the more i'm
forced to accept that much of what i
label as good or bad
is fundamentally egocentric
for lack of a better definition
good is when i get what i want
and bad
is when i don't get what i want or when
i get what i don't want
i want the world to exist in a certain
way and when it does i call that good
and when it doesn't i call that bad
i can dress all this up in fancier
language and talk about ethics and
philosophies and moralities

[01:00]
philosophies and moralities
but at the end of the day most of that
is rationalization
it's pretty rare for example for someone
to not get what they want and call that
good
irrespective of their professed beliefs
now
there is a silver lining to all this
which is
i'm in control of what i want
remember wanting is free
therefore
if good is getting what i want
and i'm in control of what i want
then
at least theoretically
i can always experience the good
same thing with my aversion what i don't
want
if bad is getting what i don't want and
i'm in control of what i don't want
then at least theoretically i can never
experience the bad
however this requires that i master my
wanting
my capacities for desire and aversion
i can practice desire in such a way that
i can always get what i want

[02:00]
i can always get what i want
which is good
and i can practice aversion in a way
that i never get what i don't want which
is bad
and who wouldn't want to know how to do
this
as for the actual practice i'll talk
more about that in future episodes so
stay tuned
what do you think do you think it's
possible to always get what you want
