what people don't understand about
prenups is that they already have one
seriously if you are intending to get
married you already have a prenuptial
agreement what is it it's the default
contract between married parties that
exists in your state that contract
predates your nuptials
it is your prenup
now does that contract actually fit the
needs of the individuals who are getting
married not necessarily any more than
buying clothes off the rack are likely
going to be custom tailored to your body
so a prenup as we understand that is
just a tailoring of the pre-existing
contract that already exists in your
state between folks getting married you
already have one
entering into a different negotiation
just makes it more likely that the
contract will reflect the needs of the
individuals involved
