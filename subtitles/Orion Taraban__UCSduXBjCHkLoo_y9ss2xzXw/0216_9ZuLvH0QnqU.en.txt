in my video
to be free you cannot do whatever you
want
doro gaya moya asks if you could
recommend five books on any subject what
would they be i've gotten a number of
requests for reading suggestions over
the months that i've been participating
in this channel and i gave it some
thought and here are my five
recommendations on any subject the first
are the discourses by epictetus
the second would be the daodachin
by laozi
the third would be the imitation of
christ by thomas akampus
the fourth would be the denial of death
by ernest becker
and the fifth would be the sickness unto
death by soren kierkegaard
i am
nominating these five books because each
one of them blew my mind when i read it
for the first time
and had a powerful effect on my life
hope you enjoy
