prostitutes have to exist because
they're the altar on which the virtue of
other women is sacrificed so
traditionally speaking the value of
prostitution okay um well what's the
value of just sex in general for the
vast majority of human history it's been
from a man's perspective a lifetime of
commitment protection and provision
which is an insanely high price tag for
a sexual experience especially since
there's actually no guarantee that the
sex will be particularly forthcoming
after the man that commitment but he's
on the hook potentially for the rest of
his life so that's an extraordinarily
high price to pay for sex especially
given the fundamental biological Drive
in young men to do that and so the re
the way that the lady can exist sh up
andow talks about the European lady only
can exist because there's the brothel
down the street and those women are the
ones who are actually protecting the
Chastity and the virtue of these women
oh wow okay wow yeah
