I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cytax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is what is
confidence so in a previous episode
three steps to becoming more confident I
discussed how the recipe for the
cultivation of confidence is contained
in my working definition of that concept
namely that confidence is the consistent
felt experience of success however
there's a mystery in the word confidence
that can Elevate our understanding of
the concept even further but before I
explain what that mystery is please
remember to like this video And

so there's a mystery in the word
confidence that is revealed by examining
its etymology
confidence is a word from Latin it comes
from the words Khan meaning with and
Fidelis meaning faith

[01:02]
Fidelis meaning faith
so confidence literally means with faith
or Faithfully
which is kind of weird in modern
parlance when we talk about confidence
we usually don't think we're talking
about faith
so what's going on why might confidence
mean Faithfully well when do you most
need confidence you need confidence when
you're entering into a situation where
you don't yet know the outcome you don't
that you don't yet know whether you
actually will be able to emerge
Victorious or you don't yet know whether
you'll actually be able to do what is
asked or expected of you you haven't
done it yet you can't have evidence that
proves that you will because you haven't
done it yet
so in the absence of evidence that you
can either that you either can or will
do it in order to take action you need
to have belief beyond the evidence which
is what faith is
confidence is Faith In Yourself
you really have no good reason to

[02:00]
you really have no good reason to
believe that you can do it but you're
going to believe anyway
and you believe it anyway because belief
motivates action
this is why they say that faith can move
mountains without faith no action is
possible and with even a little faith
great Endeavors are accomplished
and that's because confidence is faith
in your own ability to overcome
adversity as it inevitably presents
itself on your path confidence says I
don't know what's going to happen
but I have faith that I will be able to
handle it if and when it comes up
I will find a way or I will make a way I
have no evidence that I will succeed but
I have faith in my own ability to rise
to the occasion
and that is the mystery of the word
confidence it is to act with faith with
respect to one's own ability or success
hopefully that makes sense what do you
