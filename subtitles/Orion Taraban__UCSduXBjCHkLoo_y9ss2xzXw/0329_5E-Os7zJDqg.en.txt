I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
men treat women
the way women treat money
so after my episode women treat men the
wing men treat jobs I got a lot of
requests for the complementary treatment
basically what are women to men
after giving it some thought this is the
result
just keep in mind what I said in that
previous episode that it was
understanding where women were coming
from that helped me to make sense of a
lot of otherwise painful and bewildering
things that women did and this
understanding helped me to heal accept
and ultimately enjoy more fulfilling
relationships with women
my intention here is to do the same
thing for you ladies if you can
understand without judgment
where men are coming from this should
help you heal accept and ultimately

[01:01]
help you heal accept and ultimately
enjoy more fulfilling relationships with
men the key here is without judgment
may be asking too much but there it is
and that's the spirit in which all of
this is being given I'm here to help
now before I get into it please remember
to like this video And subscribe to this
channel it takes less than a second
costs you nothing and it's a great way
to show your love thanks for your help
okay so women treat men the way men
treat jobs and men treat women the way
women treat money
at first blast you might be thinking
same same but different but they're not
the same thing at all
think of all the associations you have
about work
versus all the associations you have
about money
remember work is really a means to an
end no one shows up to work for work
they show up for a paycheck this is why

[02:03]
they show up for a paycheck this is why
women typically have relationship goals
they see the relationship as a means to
an end just like men see a job as a
means to a paycheck
but for when but for men
women are the paycheck they're the money
when we get into a relationship with you
it doesn't need to go anywhere because
we're finally where we wanted to be it's
payday it's the second Saturday of the
second Friday of the month you know what
I'm saying it's our time to relax and
have fun and we think that way because
of the incredible amount of work it took
to get you
this cannot be overstated most women
have absolutely no conception of the
sheer amount of effort and time and
skill and resource that goes into
getting you
because you don't see it it all happens
before you say yes

[03:01]
before you say yes
this is really important so let me try
to help you understand this when a guy
approaches you in the bar on the street
and chats you up and you're attracted to
him enough to give him your number or
when you match with a guy on a dating
app and you text back and forth and
you're attracted enough to actually meet
up with him how long does the whole
interaction take place
just a few minutes in the first case and
probably just a few days in the second
from your perspective
from the man's perspective it actually
took years
across hundreds of attempts
I work with a lot of guys on pickup and
attraction
at this stage in my life I can walk into
a crowded bar and walk out an hour later
with a handful of numbers
but the fact of the matter is that it's
taken me 10 years to be able to pick a
woman up in 10 minutes
it takes a lot of work to be confident
to be Charming to be smooth to be

[04:01]
to be Charming to be smooth to be
successful to be witty to be
self-controlled
and you don't see any of that work
ladies you didn't stick around to see it
but we do the work for the same reason
that you do your job we want the
paycheck
but here's the thing just like a lot of
women secretly resent all the work that
they have to do to get paid and would
prefer to just have money
a lot of men secretly resent all the
work they have to do to get into a
relationship
and would prefer to just have women
and the more difficult it is for people
to get something the harder it is for
them to give it up and the easier it is
for them to take it when it's offered
and the more they want something the
easier it is to rationalize doing
whatever it takes to get it
women how easy is it for you to spend
your hard-earned money

[05:00]
your hard-earned money
didn't you prefer to spend someone
else's money before you had to spend
your own of course you would and on some
level it's perfectly rational for you to
have that preference
but just like women would prefer not to
spend their own money which they earned
if they don't have to
men would prefer not to forego women
the access to which they earned if they
don't have to men do more work than
women to earn their optionality so it's
hard for men to give that optionality up
for the same reason it's also easier to
take when it's offered ladies how often
have you turned down free money
assuming it was being offered in good
faith probably never
if someone offered you money like as a
gift you probably wouldn't say oh no
thank you I have enough money
and you certainly wouldn't say oh no
thanks I have a salary
it's very hard to turn down free money
and you probably couldn't think of a

[06:01]
and you probably couldn't think of a
good reason to do so anyway your
employer might not be thrilled about it
but why well if his employees could get
money without working for it then he
kind of couldn't use money to
incentivize employees to be the means to
his ends anymore
at least not without offering a better
deal
free money would drive up the price of
employment that said we're probably not
in danger of that happening anytime soon
by the same token it's extremely hard
for a man to turn down a woman who is
offering herself to him
of course the socially acceptable thing
for him to say is oh no thanks I already
have a woman so I already have enough
woman thanks
they probably turn down women
significantly more often than women turn
down money however it's very very very

[07:00]
down money however it's very very very
hard to do so
and of course it doesn't always happen
his woman might not be thrilled about it
but why
well if men could get sex without
working for it
then women kind of couldn't use sex to
incentivize men to be the means to her
ends anymore
at least not without offering a better
deal
free sex would drive up the price of
commitment
do you understand
and that leads me to my final Point
women let's say that you've worked hard
for your money and you want to enjoy the
fruits of your labor for many years to
come
I decide to consult with a financial
advisor on how best to invest your
hard-earned cash
do you think that advisor would ever
under any circumstances ever
counsel you to put all of your money in
One stock

[08:00]
of course not no one in their right mind
would advise you to do that the advisor
would tell you to diversify your
portfolio because in case the market
goes south you're not going to be
completely taken to the cleaners do you
see
the diversification of your portfolio is
an essential component of husbanding
your finances properly what a strange
coincidence that that word would show up
into that context huh by the same token
a lot of men let's say diversify their
portfolios with women
ladies it's not personal
in fact if you can look at it
objectively it's kind of the rational
move
just like it's not really prudent to
invest your life savings in only one
stock a lot of men correctly see the
risk of investing entirely in one woman
especially if that woman could leave at
a moment's notice with no real recourse
and I'd like to argue that this is

[09:00]
and I'd like to argue that this is
potentially as much a part of man's
nature as it is a part of woman's nature
to choose the best available
compensation package or to leave a
pre-existing position for a better offer
shaming and blaming either way does
little to change reality contrary to
what the internet will tell you a man is
not necessarily a narcissist if he has
more than one woman he could be but he's
not necessarily according to one study
link in the pinned comment below 46 of
men 46 percent admitted to maintaining a
sexual relationship with more than one
person during the same time period
and that's just the percentage of men
who admitted to it on the contrary
epidemiological studies approximate that
about five percent of all people are
narcissists when men have other women
they don't do so because they're
pathological how can it be abnormal when
half of men do it

[10:01]
half of men do it
when men have other women they do so
because it's really really hard to turn
down free money
and it's really really stupid to invest
all your money in one stock
ladies the more you look at how you
treat your own money the more you'll
understand how men are going to treat
you
and the more you accept reality the more
things start to make sense
the faster you start to heal
and the sooner you start to get what you
want
I know it's hard to see things from the
perspective of the other side but trust
me it is worth it to make the effort
what do you think remember to be
respectful and let me know in the
comments below
thanks for listening
