you often hear it's usually women
they're dissatisfied with men's lack of
interest in going to therapy men would
literally want to refurbish a train than
go to therapy and talk about their
feelings well it's partly it's because
there aren't a lot of male practitioners
and I think what's good for men isn't
always what's good for women and vice
versa what's good for the goose isn't
always what's good for the gander what I
found is that women generally talk to
process their emotions and they're more
keen on emotionally focused strategy
right whereas men they try to resolve
things through action and through
solution and they often see that just
talking about their problems and paying
for the opportunity to do so to be a
complete waste of time and money and I
can understand why now it does have its
place like it's very important for some
men to be able to have a safe space to
really share their experience and talk
about this stuff because man they can be
judged harshly if they open up to the
wrong people so there's a time and a
place for that for men as well but it's
generally not every week for several
years
