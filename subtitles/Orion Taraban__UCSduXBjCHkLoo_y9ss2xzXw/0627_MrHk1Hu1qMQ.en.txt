I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic today's short talk is Strike when
the iron is cold so this is a tactic
that I started to implement several
years ago and it has been a GameChanger
with respect to not engaging in
unproductive conversations in fact since
I adopted this tactic I haven't gotten
into a single heated argument with
anyone and this is because it really
does take two to tango two people don't
fight if one person isn't interested so
if there is a fight it's generally
because both people wanted it to happen
and this means that if we want to reduce
the amount of unnecessary conflict in
the world we kind of have to figure out
how to keep our cool when other people
have lost theirs one thing I've learned
as a therapist is that once people pass
a certain threshold of emotion their
capacity to think rationally is

[01:00]
capacity to think rationally is
completely compromised the type of
emotion doesn't matter we started
talking about arguments so it's often
anger but it can also be hopelessness
and despondency or fear and Terror or
jealousy and insecurity only the
intensity of the emotion is relevant not
its tamber and once this line is crossed
words are generally
powerless this means that the most
useful truth or the most trenchant
Insight or the most persuasive people
piece of evidence is going to fall on
deaf ears they will just not be able to
hear it or even worse they'll hear it
through the lens of their emotion which
will generally cause the comment to be
perceived as an attack on the continued
existence of the emotion in question and
this will lead to defensiveness
minimization and invalidation remember
emotions are living things and like
living things they will fight to
preserve their lives in a myrian of ways

[02:01]
preserve their lives in a myrian of ways
all this is to say that the most
appropriate time to say bring up that
your partner tends to throw you under
the bus with her parents or that she
teases you in front of her friends or
that she hasn't been pulling her weight
around the house might not actually be
the moment you notice it or in the thick
of an argument people often think that
the time to talk about these things is
generally when they are most emotionally
Salient I.E strike when the iron is hot
however I found that doing so
functionally guarantees that whatever
reasonable point you are about to make
will be completely lost a much better
idea on the other hand is to strike when
the iron is cold that is to bring up
issues in the absence of
emotionality this can be difficult to do
because the issues will feel less
relevant when they are disconnected from
any kind of emotional urgency however if
you're actually interested in being

[03:00]
you're actually interested in being
heard and influencing change then
bringing up issues in the absence of
emotionality will significantly improve
your likelihood of success the right
word is wasted if it's delivered at the
wrong
moment so what do you do the idea here
is to kind of put that comment in your
back pocket and wait for your moment
when the opportunity presents itself you
can then speak your peace like a
surgical strike and I'll explain how to
recognize that opportunity in a moment
for the time being however if you
perceive that someone has crossed the
threshold of excessive emotionality the
name of the game is
deescalation gently avoid don't get
drawn in let some time pass and this is
very helpful give the person the benefit
of the doubt in your mind consciously
remind yourself that they're just
temporarily not seeing clearly but
they'll be able to see the error of
their ways when they come back to their
senses in the meantime that comic can go

[04:01]
senses in the meantime that comic can go
right in your back pocket keep in mind
that your back pocket as a cognitive
construct is functionally Limitless you
can fit a lot more back there than you
might think now before I go any further

interested in booking a paid
consultation links to everything in the
description let's get back to it now of
course the same goes for you as well if
your own emotions have passed a certain
point then it's typically a good idea to
table further discussion until you can
get that under control the vast majority

[05:00]
get that under control the vast majority
of issues do not need to be resolved
right then and there this perception of
pressured necessity tends to force
discussion which generally leads to
suboptimal results if you're emotionally
activated then anything you say or do
will be colored with that emotion which
could very well create more problems
than it solves especially when it comes
to anger so if you can resist the urge
to force the issue right then there if
you can resist the impulse to engage in
unproductive back and forth then you
will be in a much better position if and
when the individual in question comes
back for a discussion and in my
experience most people do come back
after they've calmed down
especially if you chose not to engage
them in kind this is because your
unwillingness to enter into their
emotional world will cause their
behavior to exist in stark contrast to

[06:03]
behavior to exist in stark contrast to
yours they very clearly will have
stepped over a line because you didn't
step over it with them on the other hand
if for whatever reason they succeed in
drawing you in then you will have both
been tainted and an apology will be less
likely in any case when the person comes
back to repair the situation this is the
perfect opportunity to strike when the
iron is cold this is because the
individual in question will not only not
be emotional but he or she will have
taken the initiative to come to you this
is the minimum necessary effort that you
should expect from people with whom you
decide to have
relationships and if people are
unwilling or unable to make this minimum
effort then you might need to have a
hard talk with a person in the mirror to
figure out why you're working to keep
these people in your life do not chase

[07:00]
these people in your life do not chase
people down after they've behaved
badly trust that most will come back
when they're ready and be willing to let
go of the ones who
don't and this effort is necessary
because it functionally communicates
some measure of regret the cognitive
dissonance created between the memory of
their behavior and their preferred
self-concept has motivated them to take
corrective action which indicates that
they will be much more open into
corrective feedback as well just like
it's not a good idea to offer advice
unless it's explicitly asked for because
let me tell you it can be hard enough to
get people to follow advice that they do
explicitly ask for it's not a good idea
to offer corrective feedback unless the
other person is in a position to receive
it
appropriately and that feedback can just
stay in your back pocket until they're
ready for it don't worry the truth
doesn't rust if it's true now it will be

[08:01]
doesn't rust if it's true now it will be
true in a few hours or a few days or a
few
weeks don't worry and you can do more
good with the right word at the right
time than you can endlessly repeating
the same message when someone isn't
ready to hear it just save your breath
in any case the best time to discuss an
issue is generally when both parties are
levelheaded and unemotional and this is
often not the moment the issue has
presented itself if you choose your
correctly then you're not only less
likely to make matters worse but you may
actually succeed in improving the
situation with your effective
communication as well what do you think
does this fit with your own experience
