i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychex
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is theory
of mind
theory of mind is a technical term from
psychology
it's a little clunky but it basically
means that we tend to believe that other
people think the same way that we do
each of us only has direct access to
that portion of our consciousness at
which we are aware or could conceivably
become aware
however we tend to project that portion
into the minds of everybody else in
order to make interpersonal interaction
efficient let alone possible
we tend to engage with others through
that projected portion of our own
consciousness
on the whole
this is sort of a necessary evil for
lack of a better word because it's just
not possible to directly experience the
content of another person's
consciousness
and on some level it's safer to assume

[01:00]
and on some level it's safer to assume
that despite all our differences
we have more in common than we don't
like for example we assume a certain
preference to avoid pain and disrespect
in other people
on the grounds that we ourselves would
prefer to avoid those things
and this projected assumption keeps
society more or less
civil
so you can see how theory of mind can be
usefully
pro-social theory of mind can also be an
effective pathway by which to change our
actual experience of reality let's get a
bit more concrete
often i talk about theory of mind with
folks who are suffering from social
anxiety
when i talk to these people about what
actually constitutes their experience of
social anxiety
they tell me that they feel as though
they are constantly being judged
negatively by other people
they generally don't have any concrete
proof of these negative judgments
however on some level they believe that
they can in a non-psychotic way
read these people's minds and ascertain

[02:01]
read these people's minds and ascertain
their private thoughts
the social anxiety sufferers believe
they're being judged as awkward or
stupid or unattractive
etc
then i talk to these people a little bit
more and i generally come to learn that
these very same people who believe that
other people are judging them negatively
are almost constantly in the process of
judging other people negatively
socially anxious folks are often
very very judgmental of other people
and by virtue of the theory of mind
these people are assuming that other
people are behaving in the privacy of
their consciousness
the way that they themselves are
behaving in the privacy of their own
consciousness
and they are unconsciously projecting
these tendencies onto other people
basically if i'm judging other people
negatively on a consistent basis then
i'm going to assume that other people
are doing the same thing as a matter of
course
so
what does this have to do with changing
our experience of reality well in this

[03:01]
our experience of reality well in this
case we can change our experience of
reality by altering the content of our
own consciousness
for instance with socially anxious folks
i typically ask them to become
increasingly mindful of their own
negative judgments of others and to
restructure those judgments using the
block and replace technique
and when they start to generate some
momentum in this direction and the
frequency and intensity of their
negative judgments of others begins to
decline
lo and behold all of a sudden
people don't seem to be as judgmental as
they used to be
it's fascinating
and this i think is how we can
potentially understand the buddhist
admonition to change the world by
changing yourself it's through the
function and process of the theory of
mind
if we change the content and structure
of our own consciousness
then
by virtue of this unconscious projection
that on some level we can't really
control
we come to live in a world that's

[04:00]
we come to live in a world that's
increasingly aligned with these changes
inevitably and by default on some level
it can't not occur
so that's what i'd like you to consider
to what extent can i intentionally
change my own perceptions of reality to
create an experience of reality that's
more aligned with my own self-interests
so that's what i have for you today if
you'd like to suggest a topic for a
future episode or to schedule a
consultation you can reach me at psychax
