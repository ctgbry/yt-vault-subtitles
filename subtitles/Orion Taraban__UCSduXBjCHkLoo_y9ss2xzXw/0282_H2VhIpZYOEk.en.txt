in why men don't go to therapy
Australian girl asked what advice would
you give for women trying to resolve
relationship problems with men this is
an excellent question and I would
counsel you to take under consideration
the fact that men and women typically
have different styles when it comes to
solving problems in their relationships
women tend to want to talk and when they
have an issue they want to sit down and
they want to they want to actually
communicate about it and you know
there's some a lot of good you can say
about that approach men have a different
kind of attitude towards this often they
want to withdraw and they want to
process their emotions themselves and
problem solve before they come to you to
communicate it's not that the
communication doesn't happen it's just
that men tend to want to do their
emotional processing by themselves
whereas women want to do it together and
if you understand this about men you
won't push to have conversations before
their
