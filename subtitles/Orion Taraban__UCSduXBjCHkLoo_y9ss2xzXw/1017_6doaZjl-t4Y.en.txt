What's the one thing most men
misunderstand about what women actually
want when it comes to dating? In other
words, what do women want? This is a
question that has flamed thinkers for
generations. Freud famously said that
there was no answer to this question or
at least not one that he could figure
out. My unsatisfying answer to that
question is that women want what other
women want. It's less to do with men
than it has to do with other mimetic
desire that women are presenting around
them. I think that's part of why even
female attraction is subject to some
fattishness. It certainly seems that
certain types of men become more popular
among women from one season to the next,
almost like they're changing fashion. We
have to also balance that against maybe
the evolutionary psychology arguments
that women want men with good genes. So,
you know, bigger, stronger, good facial
symmetry. There's some suggestion that
facial symmetry in particular is a
indirect indicator of like fetal health.

in the sense that the baby was less
insulted by outside pathogens which may
have corrupted the facial development in
the small person. So there's these
indirect metrics of physiological health
that I think women also want. But when
it comes to like the day-to-day women
tend to want what other women want. And
so
&gt;&gt; female interest is sort of like an
emerging phenomenon that arises out of
like a bunch of individual decisions at
the population level. Women are
constantly looking at other women very
closely to kind of know what is safe.
When there's a critical mass of women
doing a certain thing, that's like the
fattest part of the behavioral curve.
They know that they're kind of in the
middle of the herd, the middle of the
shaw, and that's the safest place to
