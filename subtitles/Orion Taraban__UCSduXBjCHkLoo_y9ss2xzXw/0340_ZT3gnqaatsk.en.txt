it's all there in the title dates are an
evening activity getting coffee is not a
date there's a number of reasons for
this first of all what are you doing
that you're available in the middle of
the day the middle of the day is for
doing business the evening is for
connecting and relating but when
business hours are operating it's time
to get things done secondly sitting down
opposite each other in a brightly lit
Cafe over coffee suggests it's a job
interview we'll be talking about like a
position that we found on LinkedIn
so it doesn't have the right Vibe and we
both people know that there's very
little likelihood that you're both going
to leave this Cafe in the middle of the
day and go off and hook up so you're
taking all the possibility all the
sexual tension out of the exchange which
is a terrible way to start off a
relationship a primary sexual
relationship by like saying there is no
opportunity for us to have that kind of
tension or banter
