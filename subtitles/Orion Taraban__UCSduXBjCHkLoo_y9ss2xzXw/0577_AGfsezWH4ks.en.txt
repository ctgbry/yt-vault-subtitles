I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
save your mind this is an extremely
important subject and I hope that this
message reaches a good number of people
given some realities with respect to
human cognitive development your mind
needs saving no matter who you are and
the stakes of not saving your mind both
individually and socially are extreme
high so let's not waste any time here's
the situation every human being only
arrives at the point of full physical
maturity at age 25 and full emotional or
psychological maturity if that ever
happens occurs even later the upshot is
that most people can't even begin to
think for themselves critically and
independently until they are at least

[01:00]
independently until they are at least
this old the issue is that by the time
you reach this age your head is so full
of that you can't even think
straight irrespective of your beliefs to
the contrary and this was put
in your head as it were without your
permission through such a subtle and
intimate process that on some level you
couldn't prevent it from happening even
if you wanted to you lacked the
awareness and the experience and the Cy
ological capacity to resist it this
means by the time you get to 25 years
old your head is full of facts beliefs
and attitudes put there by your parents
and your teachers and your priests and
your government and your media and your
friends and your culture your mind is
literally full of thoughts that are not
your own but that you might identify
with in fact it may not be an

[02:02]
with in fact it may not be an
exaggeration to say that at this point
you may not possess a single original
thought you may never have had the
chance to think one any spare room you
may have had for such a cognition could
have been filled Years Ago by some
nonsense bit of cultural trivia like an
advertising jingle or some fact that
your teachers forced you to memorize
that while technically true is just as
obviously worthless like the capitals
and these are some of the less harmful
offenders many of the thoughts in your
head are wrong like objectively and even
more of them are useless even if they're
not necessarily
false what this means is that every
person usually around 30 years of age
has the opportunity to start waking up
but they only find themselves in like a
hoarder's house a house full of crap in

[03:05]
hoarder's house a house full of crap in
reality they've been living in this
house for years but they've only
recently become sufficiently aware of
their situation to consider that their
living conditions might be
circumstantial as opposed to inherent to
reality in any case they begin to
understand that their house is cramped
and dingy and full of stuff that came
from God knows where now if you know
anything about hoarders you know that it
can be very very difficult for them to
disabuse themselves of their things why
because they have all of these emotional
connections to their junk an old scrap
of paper might be a tether to a
relationship that is long since ended
some expired medication might be useful
again sometime in the future these
emotional bonds with their objects
prevent hoarders from taking appropriate
action the same thing is true with the

[04:00]
action the same thing is true with the
facts beliefs and attitudes that were
put into your mind by other people the
reason why it is difficult to let go of
these things is that you have emotional
attachments to these things even if it's
not true this is an attitude that came
from your dad even though it's not
helpful this is a fact that came from
your teacher Etc and the most common
emotional attachment that people have
with the in their minds is that
it is right
however in the vast majority of cases
right doesn't mean right it means this
is how my family did it or this is what
we were supposed to do at the time you
get me now before I go any further if
you're liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this episode to someone
who might benefit from its message
because its Word of Mouth were FRS like
this that really helped to make the
channel grow you can also tip me in
proportion to the value you you feel

[05:00]
proportion to the value you you feel
you've received from this message to do
that you can go to my website and donate
to me directly through venmo that way I
get all of your donation I don't do
corporate sponsorships or product
placements so I depend on your help to
make all this happen I really appreciate
it thank
you fortunately there is a way out of
this situation but just like emptying
out a house full of junk it is going to
take some time after all if it took you
30 years to accumulate all of this
it could very well take the
rest of your life to divest yourself of
what was put there against your will
however if you don't do this you're kind
of because you will never really
become well you an individual person if
you don't do this you will simply be a
cipher a pasti of your culture and the
idiosyncrasies of a particular
historical moment that will be your life

[06:03]
historical moment that will be your life
you might not be miserable or
unfulfilled if you don't empty out the
because only individuals can
truly be miserable or unfulfilled but
you might spend your whole life with a
vague nagging hunch that something
doesn't feel right or something is
missing but because you never learned to
think for yourself you might never learn
who you are so you won't be able to do
anything about this feeling beyond what
your culture prescribes for the
indiscriminate masses alcohol streaming
services psychiatric medication
professional sports shopping and sex you
will have lived your whole life without
ever learning who you were so the way
out of this process is akin to dealing
with a hoarder except you'll be dealing
with cognitions not material things
you'll need to to turn your attention

[07:00]
you'll need to to turn your attention
Inward and slowly carefully examine each
individual thought one by one ask
yourself some questions where did this
come from is it true is it useful will
this serve me in who I want to be and
where I want to go hang on to the things
that are true and useful and that
support the person you want to be
everything else thank them for their
service such as was and let them go you
want to simplify and clarify your mind
as much as you want to simplify and
clarify your actual living space this
could take years however over time
little by little you may arrive at a
point in which the majority of your
mind's contents is there with your
conscious permission and at your
conscious pleasure this is long
laborious work but there's no way around
it fortunately the more more you do this

[08:00]
it fortunately the more more you do this
the better you get at assessing things
accurately and the easier it becomes to
discard things that no longer serve you
and of course once you start on the path
of decluttering your mind of
you're going to want to like restrict
the flow of new facts beliefs and
attitudes coming in at the very least
you'll want to install a kind of valve
to control your intake of information in
our culture people can be obsessed with
diet but they limit their
conceptualization of this idea to what
goes in their mouths as opposed to what
goes in their minds and frankly what
goes into people's minds is far more
important than what goes into their
mouths if for no other reason that what
goes into people's minds controls what
people put in their mouths and not the
other way
around I personally stopped watching the
news like 16 years ago and here I am a
I'm I'm a perfectly functioning human

[09:01]
I'm I'm a perfectly functioning human
being and I don't just mean watching the
news on like the Legacy Media I mean
watching the news on news sites or
YouTube or Reddit or social media
LinkedIn Tik Tok Twitter Facebook I
don't have any of these apps on my phone
I upload my content on a third party
platform so that I don't have to touch
these apps directly after I expended
years and years of conscious effort to
expel most of the from my head
I don't want any new rushing in
to take its place understand and media
especially social media is far far more
dangerous than most people think so if
you want to save your mind if you want
to go through the timec consuming
process of actually becoming an
individual you need to go through the
very personal and very challenging
process of carefully examining the
contents of your Consciousness and be
willing to divest yourself of that which
is no longer true and or useful once you

[10:03]
is no longer true and or useful once you
do that I guarantee you will be much
more discriminating with respect to any
new unexamined belief or attitude that
happens to present itself to you on your
walk through life what do you think does
