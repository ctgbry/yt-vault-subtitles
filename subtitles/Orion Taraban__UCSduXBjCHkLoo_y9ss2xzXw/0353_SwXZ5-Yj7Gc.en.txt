I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is there are
only two goals the importance of goals
cannot be overstated if we do nothing
things get worse this is the law of
entropy disorder increases inside of a
closed system this law is baked into the
fabric of reality it is not a product of
our culture or our social systems as
Shakespeare wrote tis an unweed Garden
that grows to scorn things Rank and
gross in nature possess it merely so we
need goals because if we do nothing life
falls apart some effort is required
simply to maintain the status quo and to
counteract Decay disorder and
dissolution and that effort can be
directed in a myriad number of ways
however I'm here to tell you today that
there are really only two goals and
before I get into this framework please
remember to like this episode And
subscribe to Channel it takes less than

[01:01]
subscribe to Channel it takes less than
a second costs you nothing and it's a
way that you can help Stave off the
entropy inside this closed system so do
the thing
now as I said there are really only two
goals here they are the first is that
you can start doing something that
you're not doing and the second is that
you can stop doing something that you
are doing
that's it all goals can be subsumed into
one of just these two categories now
just because this is a simple framework
doesn't mean that there's no substance
here
most importantly this framework
clarifies that all goals regardless of
whether they seem related to external
phenomena are really self-directed
action
all goals are properly Behavioral a
happy marriage
isn't really a goal changing how you
respond to your partner so that you
fight less is

[02:00]
fight less is
a bank account with 10 million dollars
in it isn't really a goal building a
side hustle that earns a significant
passive income is and this is helpful
because to the extent that you localize
the goal in your own behavior you
simultaneously begin to develop a plan
of action for attaining that goal and
this will make it more likely that you
get what you want faster
and if you want to see the fastest
Improvement it's best to prioritize the
latter goal that is to stop doing
something that you are currently doing
it's better to stop doing the one or two
things that are hampering or obstructing
your progress and this is because in
this world Pleasure and Pain creation
and destruction
are not really equal
one or two bad actions can counteract
tens of good ones it's not a one-to-one
equivalence generally bad things are
more bad than good things are good for
whatever reason reality is such that bad

[03:01]
whatever reason reality is such that bad
things are overpowered
so rather than screw up all this
discipline and intentionality and effort
to do things that you're not currently
doing in order to get more good in your
life
First Direct that discipline and
intentionality and effort toward things
that you are currently doing in order to
get less bad in your life
this is because even if you succeeded in
the first attempt which would be hard to
do anyway your progress might be
counteracted by the Decay that you've
left unaddressed and this will corrode
your discipline and intentionality over
time with respect to the good actions
because you won't really be seeing a lot
of improvement or progress for your
efforts and it's very difficult to
maintain consistency which is a
requisite of progress under these
circumstances
finally if goals are behavioral that is
if there are things you either do or
don't do
then you can really only have one goal
at a time
because you can really only do one thing

[04:00]
because you can really only do one thing
at a time
this is really important sometimes folks
fall into this kind of mania for goal
setting often around New Year's and they
try to work on too many things at once
and this generally leads to sub-optimal
outcomes and self-recrimination why do
that to yourself
pick one thing and work on it until it
kind of becomes routinely integrated
into your lifestyle it could take
several months but that's okay once it's
there it's stable and you can turn your
attention to the next goal
a successful life is like spinning
plates you have to give a plate enough
attention and energy for it to kind of
hum along for a while while you attend
to something else otherwise it'll wobble
and crash as soon as you take your eyes
off it hopefully this all makes sense to
you what do you think do you have any
tips for goal setting let me know in the
comments below and thank you for
