can you imagine if if you came in for
help for an addiction and the person
helping you had never even had a a drink
and they were just sort of like reading
interventions out of a textbook like how
insulting would that be the only reason
that these really fragile and ambivalent
people who are addicted and know that
their life is crazy and chaotic and they
want to give it up but they find it
extremely difficult to do so the only
possible way they could trust another
human being that they've just met is
I've been through hell too like I know
what that's like I I see myself in you
you are me 30 years ago I know what hell
is man I've done all kinds of shameful
disgraceful regrettable things in my Act
of addiction and there's a way out and a
person who not only can use his pain his
trauma his scar to heal and attain a
life that's worth living and can
therefore bring that gift to other
people that is one of the most
meaningful lives I think a human being
can live and that's how the scar becomes
a star it's a source of guidance
