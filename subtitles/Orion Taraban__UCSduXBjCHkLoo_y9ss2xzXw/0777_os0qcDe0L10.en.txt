because so many men have gone so long
without any interest or affection or
kindness from women the slightest whiff
of that can make some guys feel like
they've hit the jackpot and of course
because they've never had it before
they're worried that they will never
have it again and this scarcity
mentality often motivates them to invest
in women when it's probably not in their
best interest to do so now some of you
might think well Orion what's the
problem these women are looking to get
married and have kids just like me they
might want the attractive guy but they
can't get him so on some level his loss
is my game what's the issue here namely
these men get used now to be fair these
men often participate joyfully and
enthusiastically in their own
exploitation they are being used by
these women for certain things and once
they receive these things they make
themselves redundant and unnecessary in
the absence of real attraction these
relationships are basically perpetually
maintained by giving the woman what she
wants
