just like men have to practice being
selfish they need to practice gratifying
themselves otherwise they either end up
forfeiting gratification entirely or
they dramatically increase the chances
of one day exploding in some kind of
gluttonous orgy now this explosion could
be a lesson that can be learned from it
could be a step in the direction of
responsible self-gratification a phase
that most people have to pass through
however the sudden forceful nature of
many midlife crises is such that they
can be very difficult to recover from
many women aren't going to like support
a man through this process especially if
spoiler alert they have been the primary
beneficiaries of the man's service and
gratification delay over the years in
any case I believe it's important for
men to cultivate that creative
selfishness throughout their lives if
they ask what about me earlier they are
significantly less likely to find
themselves in a lifestyle that doesn't
work for them and if they practice
gratifying themselves along the way they
probably won't need to make themselves
sick when eventually given the
opportunity to eat
