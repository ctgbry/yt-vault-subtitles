now sometimes I get push back from
people on this idea they take offense
and tell me oh so I just can't do nice
things for people I'm just supposed to
be an all the time is that it
I'm just a nice person and I like to do
nice things for people is that so bad
Orion and I would respond well yeah
sometimes it is so bad more is not
always better in a relationship remember
it's the cat who decides what milk is
good the negative reaction of the person
you are being nice to is there way of
communicating that that milk is not good
for them insisting that they should take
your affection and appreciation and
respond with positive regard is selfish
it's communicating my preference for the
Gap in the imbalance of Attraction takes
precedence over your preferences for the
same that's not nice people that's
selfish complaining that women are cruel
or men are ungrateful is missing the
point those people are giving you
constructive feedback
