[00:02]
hello everybody thanks for joining
me I'm Dr Orion taban this is my first
attempt at a live stream so you might
have to bear with me as I work through
some of the Kinks but thank you for
being here on time and I hope that we
can have an interesting and fruitful
discussion I see that there are
already uh about 78 or 80 of you in the
chat that's
fantastic uh hopefully you guys can help
me with some questions otherwise I'll
just be monologuing up here for quite
some time which I don't think would be
interesting for any of us uh I'll start
out by saying uh thank you for joining
me the purpose of this live stream is to
discuss the book that just came out the
value of others um hopefully we can stay
on topic there because I know that can

[01:00]
on topic there because I know that can
be somewhat complicated it can be
somewhat provocative and there's a lot
of ideas in the book that I hope that we
can kind of parse out today together
I'll begin by saying so far it's been
phenomenal uh the book was launched last
Wednesday so six days ago and already
it's a number one bestseller on Amazon
in a number of categories which is just
a phenomenal response I don't have a
Publishing House I don't have an agent I
don't have a marketer I don't work with
promoters I don't do paid advertising
the fact that this book has been able to
Garner this kind of reaction it's really
a word of mouth and Grassroots effort
it's thanks to you um for spreading the
message and sharing the book and the
content with other people who might
benefit I I honestly couldn't do this
without you because I'm really in many
respects one guy sitting in his living
room uh trying to make something

[02:00]
room uh trying to make something
happen and so I want to thank you so
much for the support that you've shown
thus far I think that the book has legs
it could go some distance and I think
we're just getting
started so here we are about 211 people
joining wow that's fantastic
so let's get into some of these
questions the chat is coming hard and
fast so I might not be able to get to
everything but let's see um Bill Tomkins
he says question why do so many
relationship books feel like mostly
fluff this book feels like real truth
why is that so rare to find these days
that is an excellent question and I've
been thinking about
this in my uh private life and I'm
trying to figure out how to make an
episode about it but since you asked
this is let me take a stab at it so I I
do kind of approach this idea in the
book I think there's just like one or
two sentences about it which is that
there are rules and laws about
relationships laws are more biologically

[03:00]
relationships laws are more biologically
determined and seem to be Universal to
time and place but rules are really
culturally bound they're really specific
to specific times and places and you're
not supposed to break the rules like you
can't break the rules with interpersonal
impunity and the fact of the matter is
is that the core of all relationships
between men and women is transactional
okay but you're not supposed to say the
quiet part out loud that is violating
one of the rules of our culture which is
that transaction we're not really
supposed to openly acknowledge we're not
to really highlight and make explicit
it's supposed to kind of be operating
behind the scenes out of sight and out
of mind and in an attempt to distract
from the core component of relationships
we've covered relationships with a lot
of [ __ ] with a lot of fluff okay
okay where we talk about love languages

[04:02]
okay where we talk about love languages
and we talk about improving effective
communication and we talk about learning
to listen and to compromise
okay what I'm going to say is that the
problem is too many people listen to
that and they take it too seriously and
they attempt to fix a deeper problem
which is the level of the transaction by
offering a superficial Solution on the
level of the [ __ ] and so people go
to coup's therapy and they try to
improve their communication or they read
books and try to meet their Partners
Love Languages and it doesn't really
work and they're very baffled as to why
it's not working because they're doing
what their culture more or less tells
them that they should
do the issue is that they're not really
addressing the root problem which is
that there's some sort of dysfunction or
imbalance in the transaction at the
heart of the relationship to put it

[05:00]
heart of the relationship to put it
another
way in the professional Arena you're
exchanging labor and time for money okay
but even in a professional
Arena we can't be too explicit about
that like if you were to go in for a job
interview and they said well why do you
want a job at this company and you said
well I've been very passionate about not
starving and I would like the money to
be able to buy food and pay my
bills that's just a little too mercenary
okay by the same token those same
companies who are have trouble hiring
people they'll do all kinds of things
they'll talk about how they have an
inclusive culture and everyone's a
family here and we offer professional
development and we really want each
member to make an
impactful uh influence on the company
and the and the destiny of our product
etc etc etc and a lot of these companies
are still having trouble hiring people
and then you ask the employees like what
the problem is it's like well you don't
pay

[06:00]
pay
enough like a lot the companies wouldn't
have to do all that other [ __ ] if
they paid people more if they could pay
people more paying people more will
solve a lot of problems in the office do
you understand because that's actually
the court transaction at the heart of
professional relationships is the
exchange of money for Time and
Labor um addressing the other [ __ ]
that we use to mask that uh leads people
astray
okay um but on some level culture has
developed to kind of protect people so
that people don't feel too mercenary
about exchanging their time and their
labor for money because that can rub
people the wrong way by the same token
when you make the transaction at the
heart of sexual relationships too
explicit it can really rub people the
wrong way it can offend people's dignity
because it lowers the what's supposed to
be Sublime and emotional to the level of
um needs and wants which feels icky even

[07:03]
um needs and wants which feels icky even
though if you solve the relationship
problems on the level of needs and wants
you don't have to do any other fluff and
[ __ ] in the vast majority of cases
it's equivalent to paying people more
now paying people more in the
professional environment doesn't solve
all problems for all
people but it solves a lot of the
problems like a lot of people would
would feel more respected they would
feel more secure they would feel more
enthusiastic about going to work if they
had higher salaries I think that's true
for pretty much any line of work no
matter what you do um and and if you
don't feel like you're getting enough
then smaller problems are going to feel
more detrimental and we also see that in
romantic relationships when the
transaction becomes unbalanced and one
party feels like he or she is giving
more than he or she is getting then
smaller things become prob atic like

[08:00]
smaller things become prob atic like
there is more irritability there is more
withdrawal there's more like Petty
fights um and these fights from a
therapeutic perspective are very rarely
about what the fights seem to be about
which can be about really insignificant
small things but the fights about those
small things are really proxies for
power are really proxies for Value um
but it feels too mercenary to address
that directly
and in any case we're trained by our
culture not to because that's a
violation of one of the rules which is
you're supposed to provide value but
you're not really supposed to call
attention to the idea that you're
providing value right okay so hopefully
that uh answered some of the questions
there let's take a look
here um oh boy it's coming hard and
fast if you have a question it will help
me if you put in like big capital

[09:01]
me if you put in like big capital
letters question because I'm getting a
lot of different comments here and that
will help me to differentiate it from
those other
things
um why do you feel like we Juan narz
says why do you feel like we can't
directly discuss this transaction it's
almost so indirected unconscious that
it's difficult to understand why this
would
be um it's hard to know how rules
develop like I talk about the symptom
pool in one of my episodes that cultures
and symptom pools are kind of like
emergent phenomenon people can influence
these things but no one can really like
decide this is the rule now like we have
laws people can decide that I suppose
but if the law is opposed to the

[10:00]
but if the law is opposed to the
cultural rule it's it's going to have a
tough time being obeyed and that law
probably isn't going to last very long
on the books unless there's some sort of
tyranny or
um a police measure or aggressive
measure to maintain it right so you have
to understand that at the heart of
intersexual relationships between men
and women is the transaction of value
and fundamentally men are exchanging
resources for sex and women are
exchanging sex for resources
which on some level means that the vast
majority of sexual relationships between
men and women are like indirect forms of
prostitution like it's prostitution with
extra steps okay and it's only an actual
prostitution where literal explicit
money is exchanged for literal explicit
sex in the vast majority of romantic
relationships it's money but it's also
time it's energy its attention it's
opportunity and it's exchanged for
the possibility of sex or the sexual

[11:01]
the possibility of sex or the sexual
opportunity as I talk about in the book
and this is offensive to a lot of people
it's it's offensive to exchange sex for
resources that's what Horrors do okay
and I've found very few people who want
to publicly be seen and known in that
way though behind closed doors sometimes
it's another story right um but the idea
here is that goes against the Dignity of
the lady in the vast majority of cases
and so there is a complicated ritual
that we have developed that has like
protected the Dignity of
woman that so that she needn't feel that
she's actually exchanging her sexual
opportunity her reproductive opportunity
for resources and among other things
that's the courtship process and the
institution of marriage socially that's
different from like the religious or
spiritual institution it's the social
institution of

[12:00]
institution of
marriage and in this way women are sort
of like protected against it and um let
me tell you that's a very good
opportunity for a lot of women like
women can exchange a great deal of
resources for not a lot of sexual
opportunity in a committed marriage
probably way more than she could get on
the open market so um that it still
exists the heart of even that social
institution but it needs to be covered
to sort of like protect the Dignity of
the individuals involved because no one
likes to feel like they're just doing
things for money but in a professional
context you wouldn't like it either even
though you work explicitly for a
paycheck if your boss just sort of like
dangled money in front of you and said
do you want this
$10,000 what would you do for this
$10,000 like you might want that 10
grand you might need that 10 grand but
the more
explicit that person makes it the more
it offends your dignity as a person and
you might even out of pride and
self-respect decide that you're not

[13:02]
self-respect decide that you're not
going to do what you need to do to get
that money because you'd rather have
your self-respect than the 10 grand so
the more explicit the transaction
becomes the more there's sort of like a
calculus around how much do I want the
thing and how much do I want to kind of
protect my honor or my sense of dignity
here um ideally you get both uh but
that's not always possible sometimes we
have to make trade-offs or at least to
prioritize certain things
okay kind of a spicy answer but that's
what I've been thinking
about
Okay Ross sherlin says I know you focus
on a lot about sex but how does
long-term companionship and they want to
develop a family and have children fit
into that equation does sex absolutely
Trump that no it sex does not absolutely
Trump that and people get
into uh relationship for all kinds of
different

[14:00]
different
reasons um and I I think I talk about an
example of that in the first chapter
where a man it's a hypothetical man but
this hypothetical man could be an
archetype for many people um and many
men that I've actually consulted with
and uh this person may have chosen to
forgo let's say more attractive sexual
opportunities for a woman who wanted to
be a mother and might have good maternal
instincts and
because that woman given his sub his
priority of goals has more of what he
wants he might be willing to forgo the
sexual opportunity in order for a woman
to start a family with okay the issue
with that is that once the children come
and certainly after the children are
grown to a certain extent the
reproductive attractiveness and the
maternal instincts becomes more and more
irrelevant

[15:00]
irrelevant
and the Really tragic nature of
relationships in general is that by
giving people what they want we we often
are complicit in lowering our own
value like I say in the book no one
continues to pay the plumber the plumber
is a very urgent and important person
when the toilet is clogged but after the
toilet is
unclogged he's like okay here's your
money I need to get on with my kind of a
thing and no one continues to pay the
plumber after the work is done right so
when you go into a relationship for a
specific reason if you don't get that
thing well that's sort of like bait and
switch or a misleading tactic which is
one of the strategies in the sexual
Marketplace it always has been and
always will be
um so you you generally do have to give
people more or less what you've promised
to give them or what you in good faith
entered into the relationship to

[16:01]
entered into the relationship to
transact but in the process of
giving the person needs you less because
that need has been
discharged this is what's really tricky
about maintaining relationships over
time because let's say what a 20
something needs is going to be very
different from what a 70s something
needs but on some level we kind of
expect that the one person is supposed
to discharge all of our needs at all of
these different stages of the lifespan
throughout all kinds of different um
roles like that person might be a great
mother um and might have a really good
Instinct with children but might be a
terrible wife might be a might be a very
bad lover um may not really be
interested in the things that you're
interested in might be kind of cold and
distant but would be really great for
the mother you see and one of the things
I talk about in chapter 12 is of the
things that causes marriages and

[17:00]
things that causes marriages and
long-term relationships to fail is the
expectation that one person be too many
things um especially across a lifespan
it's not very popular but sometimes
relationships run their course and
because of course all relationships end
one way or another um and sometimes I
think it's wiser and better to let
relationships run their course to do
that intentionally than to try to fit
people into boxes that may not be what
they even originally signed up for to
begin with
right in in my opinion if there's
any purpose to marriage it's to provide
a safe context for children to be raised
and that's it like that's I think it's
fundamentally a very humble institution
as I say in the book marriage was never
meant to be uh a partnership with your
best friend it was never meant to be an
adventure with your romantic lover uh it
was never meant to be etc etc etc for

[18:01]
was never meant to be etc etc etc for
thousands of years a marriage was sort
of like running a small
business because life was very hard and
you had what five to 12 children and you
needed that because you needed the extra
hands to stay out of starvation on some
level and you needed somebody to kind of
like keep the Machinery of the small
business running and if you wanted love
if you had the luxury of being able to
afford that you found that elsewhere and
if you if you a best friend you
generally had it most men spend most of
the days with other men and most women
spend most of their days with other
women for the vast majority of human
history um but with the decline of real
communities and the Advent of the
nuclear family so extended kid networks
don't really exist anymore we've asked
our spouse our partner to be all things
for all time and that's just an
impossible situation for anybody to
discharge so um and and then we blame
the people or ourselves for not living

[19:02]
the people or ourselves for not living
up to let's say impossible expectations
and one of the arguments I make in the
book is that it might be time for us to
collectively examine the maturity and
the realizability of those expectations
for long-term relationships and to do
that with our feet on the ground and not
with star-eyed romantic
ideals that's what I got for you with
that okay
question Robert Green interview wouldn't
that be fun I'm I'm actually slowly
making my way through the 48 Laws of
Power for the very first time I'm I'm
ashamed to admit it but it's the first
time I've read one of his books it's a
fantastic book like I highly recommend
it most people in this chat probably are
aware of it or have read it already if
not get your hands on a copy uh he
clearly put a lot of effort and thought
into that book um I would love to talk
to him one of the chapters of the book
is about power um I did write it before
I read the book so hopefully no one

[20:01]
I read the book so hopefully no one
thinks that I I CRI his ideas but having
now read most of the book I think that I
do offer some um some original content
on that
theme what I've discovered though and
this is true for in general sometimes I
get requests through the comments or
through emails or through DMs for me to
talk to a specific person I don't do a
lot of talks on my show I can talk about
that for a second I haven't done one for
a while um I would love to be able to
talk a lot of these people but I found
that it's always better when I'm invited
versus when I invite myself in the past
when I've tried to invite myself it's
never worked I just end up in the inbox
with anybody else so I've stopped doing
that and now if I now I wait for the
invitation and I find that that's
generally more conducive to
success uh the reason why I haven't been
doing interviews on my channel is more
with respect the
algorithm

[21:01]
algorithm
uh the algorithm has been trained on my
Cadence and my content and this is true
for any other regular content creator
now I do full length episodes on Mondays
and Fridays they're between usually
eight and 15 minutes long and on other
days I usually publish about two shorts
a day at very regular times what I
discovered is that when I would do a
long form interview
just sort of as a one-off and put that
on the channel it it didn't really get
good views but even worse it tended to
like
affect the the channel for like weeks
afterwards like every time I would put a
long form interview views would go down
for four weeks afterwards because the
algorithm was like what are you doing
you need to stay in your lane or you
need to do this so regularly that it's
your new standard operating procedure
and I I don't have the bandwidth to do
that regularly maybe further down the

[22:01]
that regularly maybe further down the
road I I I'm still kind of wearing Three
Hats and working three jobs so I I don't
really have the capacity to do that
right now um so that's why I've held off
on doing more long form interviews on my
channel but if you'd like me to talk to
other people one of the best things to
do is to get into those creators inboxes
and DM them and say hey have you heard
about this guy Orion on pyx I think you
too would be great and if that gives
them a chance to kind of Snoop on me a
little bit and do their research and if
they agree with you uh they often extend
an invitation so that's the best way to
get interviews between me and anybody
else you might want to talk to
okay let's see oh here's something that
has to do oh somebody
paid 50 bucks okay let's let's go there
okay got my attention with money uh
Caesar price thanks for your
hello rizm okay it's a high high praise

[23:03]
hello rizm okay it's a high high praise
do you think that men have low standards
yeah that's an easy one I was talking to
my therapist and I recognized that a lot
of men tolerate bad behavior from women
just for the sake to get
laid Yeah you hit the nail on the head
man um one of the things I talk about in
the book is that one of
the the less acknowledged benefit to
having
optionality in the sexual Marketplace is
that with optionality you are not forced
to choose between your emotional and
sexual needs and your dignity and
self-respect because that's very
difficult to do like people will choose
their dignity and self-respect when
things get really bad but then they're
having to deal with horniness with
loneliness with isolation with a host of
other
problems so
it's not really a good choice either way

[24:02]
it's not really a good choice either way
okay
interestingly having optionality also
generally increases the quality of
interaction that you have with any given
woman Patrice Neil talks about this
where he talks about how like fish need
to smell other fish on the fisherman to
know how to know that that fisher can
catch other
fish the fact of the matter is is that
everyone is unique and everyone is
replaceable that's a that's like the
third episode I ever made on this
channel go back to some of the old stuff
some of them have really good ideas in
it but the tech isn't there so I can
understand why it might be difficult to
go backwards um but the idea here is
when when people know that there I are
either others waiting in the wings or
there could very easily be other people
waiting in the
wings uh and they want to keep their
position they find a way to act

[25:00]
position they find a way to act
right and that generally makes it less
necessary to have to choose between
dignity and self-respect and one sexual
and emotional
needs
um and I also talk about one of the
reasons why men have low standards in
the book at greater length which is
that potentially one of the reproductive
incentives of men is to spread their
seed far and wide I mean that's why men
create billions and billions of sperm
every every
month is to like always be ready for the
possibility of a sexual opportunity
falling in his lap and one of the
best reproductive strategies from an
evolutionary standpoint is for a man to
reproduce with as many different women
and as many different kinds of women as
possible because the genetic mix match
will create kind of a
robust buffer so that at least some of
his children will survive to
reproductive maturity themselves this
isn't the only reproductive strategy

[26:00]
isn't the only reproductive strategy
with a great deal of success but it's
one of them
right uh so for most men you don't
really need to have a good
option in order to just like shoot shot
if you're if you have if you're firing
billions of shots you know it just needs
to be a non- terrible shot and I think
that's
why most men tend to have lower
standards than women is because H if it
doesn't work out she's not the best
that's okay at least that's out there
and I can I can just sauner on like the
the risks and responsibilities of
pregnancy and child birth are just so
disproportionately carried by men and
women a man can shoot a shot leave in
the leave before the sun rises and never
see that woman again and that woman
could be left with a pregnancy and a an
extended motherhood that she wasn't
looking for potentially in that moment
so uh women tend to
have much much higher standards with

[27:01]
have much much higher standards with
respect to their sexual partners um
because there's also a huge opportunity
cost there
um you know if they they only create one
fertilizable eg a month and if they do
become pregnant then they can't become
pregnant with any other man's child for
pretty much a year it's a huge cost I
mean if if men bore a similar cost that
every time they made a man a woman
pregnant he she he couldn't do that
again for another year I think men would
also be more cautious about who they
slept with but this is the world that we
live
in okay what do we got
here Zima
beloved thank you for your donation how
can a woman please her husband if it's a
long-distance relationship marriage
that's a great
question
so first of all I'll start by saying
that in general long distance
relationships don't

[28:01]
relationships don't
work especially if it's before the
marriage part like I I know that's not
your case but let me talk about this for
a second um if you're if you're still
dating and it's long distance then you
need to find a way to kind of get
together and be in the same place at the
same time um otherwise what you're doing
what are you doing because like to date
you actually have to spend time with
each other and do things and you're not
doing that when you're with a
phone uh it's a lot of ATT ention and
buildup without any kind of relief or
release so it can actually be very
romantic and it could lead people into
relationships because they're filling in
the gaps in their knowledge base with
what they want to
see uh despite all of my thoughts to the
contrary I I once got involved in a
long-term relationship um against my
better judgment a while ago and because
I was
was uh this this woman lived on the

[29:00]
was uh this this woman lived on the
other side of the world basically and we
were just communicating through the
phone which is a very curated and um
peole into somebody's life like through
a phone a person can type it out think
about it edit it be very careful about
what he or she says show just what he or
she wants the other person to see it can
be a
very
um curated that's the nice word or a
very real istic view of who that person
might be um but of course if what you
see stimulates your attraction enough
you're going to fill in the gaps with
what you want to find there because
that's what attraction
does and once you actually get with the
person in the same place at the same
time it usually doesn't take long to
realize how your model of what that
person might have might be that was
built over the months or years of long
dist relationship doesn't really Accord
in reality so um I'm pretty against long
relationship in the courtship that said

[30:00]
relationship in the courtship that said
This Woman's question is about
longdistance marriage sounds like or SL
marriage Law's marriages can actually
work pretty
well why like I was saying earlier it's
kind of unnatural for men and women to
be spending so much time with each other
James ston the divorce lawyer who became
very uh popular on the internet in
recent months um he had this great line
on his interview with soft white Under
belly which was that married folks
signed up for Better or For Worse but
not for lunch and that's kind of what
happened in Co is that they were
spending so much time together that the
divorce rate like went through the roof
in that first year or two of the
shutdowns sometimes distance and
somebody's work saves a marriage like
being able to have someplace to
go is probably what keeps more
relationships together than we might
think
and think about how it used to be for

[31:00]
and think about how it used to be for
many many times uh in olden times we
tend to romanticize the 1950s well that
was sort of the age of the traveling
salesman and a lot of these guys were on
the road 200 days out of the Year while
the the woman was at home baking and
raising the kids and on some level that
obstruction may have kept both of those
people more happy and in that
relationship so
obviously this needs to be
navigated and um you know consented to
more or less by the two individuals
involved it's not going to work for
everybody but it can work very very well
for certain people like my mentor in
grad school he got married for the first
time when he was 60 years old he had
dated many women throughout his lifetime
but he never really thought he was going
to settle down but he did he got married
to a woman at 60 who lived 2,000 miles
away in a different state and
she had her life and her practice in

[32:01]
she had her life and her practice in
this state and he had his life and his
practice in this state and they both
really enjoyed what they did and it was
a huge part of their identity and their
sense of fulfillment with life so
neither one was really going to give it
up for the other um and they would spend
two months out of the year one in the
summer and one in the winter and the
rest of the time they were kind of off
doing their own things and staying in
you know communication to some degree
and that really worked for the two of
them the idea
that when couples spend a lot of time
apart or go on separate Vacations or
even sleep in separate
bedrooms that that's a sign that there's
something not working in that
relationship isn't true it can be true
but it isn't like necessarily true and
I'm guilty of that judgment myself when
I was younger I heard that some married
couples like slept in separate bedrooms
and I thought what's the point it's like
clearly the passion and the the love is
gone why why are they even just it's
like no I get it it's like once you

[33:01]
like no I get it it's like once you
slept with somebody for 30 years and
they snore and you want a good night's
sleep you're going to sleep over there
it doesn't mean that you don't love the
person or that you're not committed to
the relationship it's just that
different kind of considerations come
into play and sometimes that separation
or the ability to separate is what saves
marriages it's keeps people together um
it also helps keep the passion alive I
talk about that in the book as well um
space Is Like Oxygen to a fire and we
can think of passion or sexual intimacy
like a flame you need space in order for
a fire to combust without space it just
smothers and smolders right um because
one of the principal mechanisms of sex
is to join together is to is to
reunite but you can't reunite with
somebody if you never separate with them
to begin with and separation doesn't
always just
mean uh physical separation because if
your phys physically separated but the
whole time you're on this magic

[34:01]
whole time you're on this magic
rectangle and you're sending piics and
you're giving constant status updates
and the person knows and can track your
physical location at all times it's like
you don't actually separate there has to
be an
actual absence of information about
another person so that you when you get
together you have a reason to reconnect
and you have something to talk about so
um longest relationships and marriages
can work wonders for some people how can
a woman please her husband if it's
long-distance marriage send him pics
sexy pics sexy videos I
mean give rich and creamy milk that's
that's one thing that a woman can do and
if you think about it that's the legally
and socially sanctioned place to do that
so if you're not going to do it there
really what are you doing okay that's
the best I can do with that
question all right what else do we got
here Dr life thank you free donation 35
male newly single from toxic BPD X make

[35:03]
male newly single from toxic BPD X make
around 250k what area of the country
would give me the best chance to find a
partner in your
opinion New York City was the easiest
place in the world to date but not great
partner material yeah New York is a
great place to date if you're a single
man not a great place to enter into
relationships as I've said on some of my
appearances Manhattan was Tinder before
Tinder
existed um 250k is a good amount of
money not in the Bay Area maybe not in
New York City but in a lot of parts of
the
country
um I think that if you want I mean if
what I would
do I mean the fact of the matter is that
there's good women and there's women
that you might want to avoid everywhere
just like there's good men and there's
men you might want to avoid everywhere
um it's hard to say that all the good
ones are in Kentucky and you should just
stay out of Idaho you know what I'm
saying so
um in general if you're single you do
kind of want to be around a major

[36:01]
kind of want to be around a major
Metropolitan C region that just gives
you the optionality cities are great for
young people for two reasons because
they're accumulations of of capital of
money and they're accumulations of
people so the idea though is to use the
city and to not stay in the city longer
than you have to use the city to get
money and to find a partner if that's
what you want and then get the [ __ ] out
of the city because the quality of life
is not great there and it's extremely
expensive
so take what you want and then leave
because that's generally what people
might be looking for anyway like most
people want to get out of the situation
that they're currently in that's not
very uh optimistic but it's true like a
lot of the girls who are getting all
dressed up in the 4inch heels and the
tight dresses to go into the nightclub
are hoping not all of them but a lot of
them are hoping that they're going to
meet somebody and they never have to do
that again and they can just sit at home
and watch Netflix with this guy you know
a lot of the women who go to these

[37:00]
a lot of the women who go to these
places are looking for men to take them
out of these places okay which is
generally not a good idea but they do
that with that intention do you
understand um I would probably where
would I go if I were a single person now
uh at your age I would go maybe
to an upand cominging small town small
City not a small town small City I think
up and cominging small cities are the
future what we learned during the co
shutdowns is that a lot of work can be
done remotely that we don't need the
huge megalopolises anymore with their
crime and
their their poor quality of life and
their High living expenses is that we
can live in cities of 100,000 to 300,000
people which will give you lots of
optionality which will give you lots of
variety which will give you lots of
culture but isn't overwhelming and
disruptive in the ways that major cities
are so I would look for cities in in
that age R uh in that population range

[38:00]
that age R uh in that population range
100 to 300,000 people um I might go to
like Scottsdale that's a fun place Boise
is an interesting place I'm really
interested in the Mountain West I think
that's going to become more important
and um interesting in our cultural and
nation's history moving forward um Salt
Lake City is a cool place it has a bad W
because of the Mormon population there
but it's actually one of the most
diverse cities in the country probably
after like New York LA and Chicago
because the more traveled around the
world and brought women back from all
over and so there's hundreds of
different cultures in that City it's
beautiful right around the
mountains uh also your money will go
very far there and you can kind of live
like a king in some of these off-market
cities um but even there there's going
to
be women you should avoid bad women and
there's going to be women that
you might want to get into a
relationship with and you still have to
seal the deal like just because they're
there doesn't mean it's going to be easy
to get them either so I it's hard I

[39:02]
to get them either so I it's hard I
actually gave you some concrete places
but I think it's more like
um understanding that you can more or
less win the game no matter what the
conditions are you just have to be
flexible and
clever okay thank
you all right here's another one Ronnie
web thanks for your donation dude or uh
yeah Ronnie question understanding love
is being humiliated selft triumphant
which implies a sacrifice of self at
some level how can a man portray love to
his girlfriend wife without losing frame
or feeling as if the woman is placed on
a
pedestal yeah man I I get it that's
that's really hard to do I don't know if
it's possible I don't know if it's
possible like one of the things I talk
about in the book is that love is very
unattractive like true Declarations of
love where you humble yourself for the
good of the

[40:00]
good of the
other those are not very attractive they
do not make a woman aroused they don't
flutter a woman's heart if anything they
tend to make a woman's heart sink like
real life is not like the romantic
comedies where if you do the kind of
things the protagonists do there women
are more likely to call the cops than to
end up in your arms at the end of the
night and one of the things I talk about
at length in the book book is that
relationships and love have nothing to
do with one another like clearly you can
love people you're in relationships with
but you're kind of playing two games at
the same time and that's one of the
reasons why love marriages tend to fail
at such a high rate is because what's
good for one game is bad for the other
game like they're actually antithetical
with each other what am I what do I mean
the the Game of Love is really about
Spiritual Development it's about the
rendering of the ego to make more space

[41:02]
rendering of the ego to make more space
for
generosity
for compassion for patience for kindness
sacrifice the game of relationships is
the transaction of unequal Goods of
comparable
value you can't both exchange unequal
Goods of comparable value while
simultaneous sacrificing for the good of
the
other those two games are antithetical
to each other and so generally what
happens is people vacillate back and
forth in their minds and in their
hearts sometimes they are playing the
game of love and they just feel really
safe and satisfied
about putting the good of the loved one
ahead of themselves and then the next
minute they're thinking well could I do
better or are my boundaries being
violated or respected you have to
understand that love doesn't think about

[42:00]
understand that love doesn't think about
itself it thinks only about the good of
the other that's why I really dislike
the The Love Languages those aren't Love
Languages those are want languages those
are things that people want and love is
not about getting what you want
relationships are about getting what you
want right that's why relationships have
these rules about well I'm gonna give
you that I'm gonna give up this to get
this in return and we're going to enter
into this Arrangement and we're going to
Define it we're going to have these
rules this is in bounds this is out of
bounds love doesn't give a [ __ ] about
that stuff right so the idea here is
trying to a love marriage is kind of a
paradox because you can't win both of
those games
simultaneously and what I've discovered
is that it's better as a man in a
relationship to win the game or to play
the game anyway of the
relationship because what I found in my
personal experience and in my
professional consultations with clients
when men lean too hard into playing the
game of

[43:00]
game of
Love they often succeed in lowering the
woman's
attraction they put her in the place of
the adored which is not generally where
women want to
be and it deregulates the relationship
and they end up losing and disrupting
the relationship as a result so at the
very best I and I understand this this
is why I talk about in the book why men
generally have to make a volunt
sacrifice to be the adorer there is a
strong Instinct in men to be romantic
there is a strong Instinct in men to to
be that generous giver and provider and
to
just and to respect and and put the
woman on the pedestal and to share and
show and express his his love and
devotion it just is generally
antithetical to the success of the
relationship in many respects I wish it
weren't but that's kind of what I found
to be the case so at the very least uh
so there's kind of like two ways to
navigate that I guess there's probably

[44:00]
navigate that I guess there's probably
more but there's two come to my mind the
first way is you find someone to have a
relationship with and you find someone
to love and they're different people and
that's frankly been the solution that
has existed in many different cultures
across space and time it's like you had
your wife and you had your mistress and
you loved your mistress and you worked
with your wife right because it's a
small business um but if you don't want
to do that for whatever reason which is
fine
uh then you have to temper it like you
you can't go all the way with that
declaration like you have to you have to
treat it like a spice that's you have to
use very in in smaller quantities with
good discernment because if you use too
much of it it's going to overpower the
rest of the food which is actually
what's nourishing for the relationship
the love is not nourishing for the
relationship it's the other stuff that's
nourishing for the relationship the
value that's being transacted
that's what I got for

[45:00]
you
okay adalo hope I said that right thanks
for your
donation how do men reconcile the fact
that their female partner seems to have
outgroup
preferences in other words they tout the
virtues of multiculturalism queer
Lifestyles third world nobility
Etc I'm I'm kind of unfamiliar with the
term group preferences in this context
but I guess what I'm getting at is your
woman is kind of woke that that's kind
of what I'm picking up here in that they
talk about diversity and
multiculturalism and LGBT and stuff like
that okay
um okay so that's what she chooses to
believe like I don't think that it's
impossible to have a relationship even a
satisfying relationship with somebody
who has radically different cultural or
political beliefs it's harder
um because both people have to actively

[46:00]
um because both people have to actively
exercise tolerance in a way that they
might not have to if they were aligned
culturally and
politically but it can potentially be a
richer relationship it's just going to
require more work like I wouldn't argue
with her about her beliefs as I've said
before it's it's it's stupid to argue
with a woman about anything because you
can't
win um even if you start to fight you
lose lose even if you defeat every
single one of her points with reason and
logic because
that's that's often when when women are
backed into a corner men can do this too
but when women are backed into a corner
they start to
flail and they go for emotional damage
like they're not I I found it that it's
more difficult for them to kind of stay
on a topic and to debate the issue as it
were so I wouldn't try change your mind
uh if you really want to have a
relationship with this woman part of

[47:01]
relationship with this woman part of
loving is accepting the other person for
who he or she is because wanting them to
be different or other than they are is
actually a subtle form of disrespect
even if what you think they could be
capable of is objectively better
whatever that means it's still somewhat
disrespectful it's basically saying how
you are is not good enough or how you
are is wrong and it would be better if
you were right and I have the idea of
what's right okay so I think that's kind
of a dangerous road to go down at least
in terms of relationships because it
doesn't lead to more satisfying and
harmonious relations with anybody
so I think it's people are free to
believe whatever they want to believe
and have their values and to have their
faith and to have their cultures and
ideologies that's that's fine I'm I love
diversity I like that there's lots of
different kinds of people in the world I
wouldn't want to have a relationship
with a lot of those people
but that's okay I don't need to so one

[48:01]
but that's okay I don't need to so one
of the things that I often counsel is
like be honest with yourself if for
whatever you don't you don't have to
beat yourself up you're not a bad person
we all have our preferences and we all
have our our tastes as it were if
whatever reason you feel like you can't
really accept your partner for who he or
she
is maybe don't try to have that kind of
relationship with them you could have
something potentially more casual but uh
it it would be very difficult I would
think if not but not impossible to have
a more satisfying harmonious long-term
relationship so um that's kind of what I
have about
that
okay high quality Leisure thank you for
the donation big fan of the channel 35m
here in dead bedroom with 35f that
doesn't sound fun I would love to work
things out but I don't know if there is
hope it's tough I don't know how long
it's been dead but um it can be very

[49:02]
it's been dead but um it can be very
difficult to resuscitate a Mor abund
buis it's not impossible uh and I did an
episode about that how to bring sex back
into a relationship it can take a while
like if you've gone years without sex it
could take months to begin to pump Vigor
and life back into that dimension of
your relationship but it's not
impossible also dealing with guilt over
leaving her
after wasting her prime years we go back
and forth on kids but yeah uh I hear
what you're saying man let's talk about
this I made an episode uh a while back
called I don't want to waste my time
which is something that uh I've heard
from women and a lot of guys hear from
women and I get where it's coming from I
don't think that men should actively
mislead the women that they are in
relationships with they shouldn't flat
out lie and de deceive them about
wanting to have kids if they know for
sure that they are never going to want
to

[50:00]
to
reproduce like that's I can't get behind
that but it's also technically not your
responsibility to protect other people
from wasting their time it's my job to
not waste my time and it's your job to
not waste your time like there are 600
people in this live chat if I were just
to get on to camera and for the last 15
minut 50 minutes I just read the phone
book in a boring monotone
voice I still couldn't have wasted your
time you chose to waste the time by
signing in and staying through the
entire 50 minutes like why why did you
after a minute or two or that why didn't
you say this is this is [ __ ] I'm out
of here so like I couldn't waste your
time even if I tried like it would be on
you to stay in an
unsatisfying
situation when you had other better
things to do like go [ __ ] do them
right so it's not I understand where

[51:02]
right so it's not I understand where
that guilt is coming from and sometimes
that's put on the man by society and by
the woman in question but it's actually
not true you can't waste somebody else's
time even if you want to it's their
decision to spend their time however
they want to spend it and there's
another thing to consider which
is and I talk about this in the book is
like the goal of many women in dating is
to end up in marriage
into that kind of long-term
relationship but not all women are going
to get
there in a professional context it's a
goal of many people to become the
CEO not all employees are going to end
up in the C Suite most employees are not
going to end up in the SE
Suite but that's
okay it's okay because they weren't
hired for that job one and two they
received a paycheck every two weeks and
they accepted that job that they were
hired for most likely because of all

[52:01]
hired for most likely because of all
their available options that was the
best job that they could get they didn't
forgo a better job for a worse
one if there was a better job they would
be there working at that position trying
to get into the sea suite at that
company do you understand so you don't
necessarily need to feel so bad because
if she had a better option she would be
with that dude you were her best option
and she stayed with you because of what
you were able to provide for her over
that time like the hope of a future gain
will keep people hanging on it's
certainly true but that's not nearly as
powerful as the reality of value
provided
like people will will work for a long
time if they think they might hit the
jackpot like that's kind of how startups
are are structured you work like a slave
for a year or two because you hope that
you're going to get this you know
billion dollar payoff that's going to
take you to the moon but people can't do
that indefinitely like no one's going to

[53:01]
that indefinitely like no one's going to
work 20 years
unpaid for the possibility that maybe
there's a one in 10 shot that they're
going to get a seven figureure buyout so
hope is a powerful motivator but it's
not nearly as powerful as actual value
provided and she wouldn't have chosen
you if she had a better option and she
wouldn't have stayed with you if you
weren't providing value throughout that
time so hopefully that helps to resolve
your guilt about the situation of course
if you and I'm assuming that you didn't
explicitly lead her on and say that you
did want kids and that you were going to
marry her because like don't do that I I
wouldn't recommend doing that but I
don't know what the situation is that's
what I got for
you okay next question Voodoo 2130
thanks for your donation hi Dr terban
what are your thoughts on B's attachment
Styles and romantic relationships and
how can couples address each other's
attachment style without much conflict
that's a great question so attachment
styles are a real
thing like they have been very

[54:00]
thing like they have been very
thoroughly researched and there is a
robust evidence Bas to support their
existence that said I do think that they
have been widely overgeneralized in the
popular
imagination one thing you have to keep
in mind is that the original experiments
on attachment were done on infants they
were done on one-year-olds in a very
controlled laboratory environment called
The Strange experiment which had to do
with infants reactions to their mother
disappearing and then reemerging
sometimes later and the researchers kind
of categorize these infants into three
or four different camps and that's where
attachment Styles come from now
obviously things that happen in our past
and especially at certain parts of our
childhood can impact our future and our
adult
lives but it's also true that we're not
infants anymore and that people can and
do change and mature and develop so
def it's kind of like there's this
phrase that I love from Marshall linan

[55:01]
phrase that I love from Marshall linan
the creator of dialectical behavior
therapy who's dealing often with
personality disorders and really high
dysfunction individuals she has this
thing this great line which is it's not
your fault but it is your
responsibility it's like it's not your
fault what happened to you when you were
a kid maybe you had neglectful parents
maybe you had abusive parents maybe had
conflict parents maybe you're raised by
a single mother single father you were
even past around the child welfare
system who the who knows like kids can
go through all kinds of stuff that they
just in the vast majority of cases did
nothing to deserve like and often bad
things happen to kids and they really
can't do anything about it because
they're young they're inept and they're
powerless and and then they grow up and
at least for a while into adolescence
and young adulthood they're they're
generally still acting out from that
what like was done to
them however it's one thing to be like a
20-some blaming your parents and it's
another thing to be a 60-some blaming

[56:00]
another thing to be a 60-some blaming
your parents like your parents might be
dead they might have been dead decades
ago and you're still blaming the parents
for something they did or didn't do 50
years ago it it becomes less it's easy
it's harder to sympathize with and it
becomes increasingly pathetic and the
idea that some of these things are not
like carved in
stone like somebody who's anxious
insecure will probably never be all the
way on the other side of the spectrum
but it is a spectrum and they're not
like rigidly here and there's like
nothing you can do about
it um people can heal their attachment
inj injuries and their emotional wounds
that give rise to their attachment
Styles and that's kind of their
responsibility you know think about it
this way sometimes I do consultations
with guys and they're dating a girl and
the girl says something like oh you know
I kind of have trust issues because my
ex-boyfriend cheated on
me on some like what what is that to

[57:00]
me on some like what what is that to
that guy that guy hasn't done anything
wrong so what I usually counsel those
men to say is like hey I totally
understand it sucks being cheated on um
but what are you doing about it and
she's like huh it's like well this is a
problem for you right like your your
difficulty trusting people is a problem
for you right and if it's a problem you
should be actively working to resolve
that problem or were you just expecting
that I was is going to just like
accommodate this this thing that
happened to you and you're absolved of
any kind of responsibility for for
growing and healing like that's not the
basis of any kind of mature and Lasting
relationship so people have attachment
Styles because of things that have
happened to them when they were children
but once they get to be adults and they
have more
agency they can begin the healing
process and they don't have to like just
be the victim of what was done to them
when they were a child now some of this

[58:01]
when they were a child now some of this
stuff is really deep especially that
happened preverbal which is in the first
let's say one year of
life that's the hardest thing to
fix um but regardless of how difficult
something is people can generally heal
more than they currently are and improve
in the direction of where they want to
go even if they can't get there 100%
which is possible like a scar never
really heals back to the way it was
before the wound but it shouldn't be
oozing and [ __ ]
either so um something to keep in mind
it's useful for attachment stells are
also useful for like
selection like I was I was definitely on
the uh avoidant side of things
pretty pretty uh solidly avoidant and
through a lot of work and inside effort
I I'm pretty much like on the secure
avoidant boundary so I know from
personal experience that this is

[59:00]
personal experience that this is
something that can
fluctuate um but that generally means
that I probably require more space than
other people I'm probably not going to
be as emotionally effusive as other
people
um things like that and I I'm now you
know in my 40s it's like those things
have changed to the degree that they can
change and they're probably going to
change much further at this point
because of all the the effort and
attention I've already paid to this so
it's also now like this is who I am I've
done what I could to like heal as best
as I can and to work more into the realm
of secure attachment um I'm here I'm not
gonna be over here you know um I'm not
gonna be over here and if that works for
you great and if that doesn't work for
you it just seems like it's a bad match
and this should be something that Pro
you don't really need to talk about it
with your mouth it's something that you

[1:00:01]
with your mouth it's something that you
just sort of sus out in the early stages
of your courtship and that's why it's
really important to keep a rain on your
emotional investment in the early stage
of a relationship because you don't
really know if this person is compatible
for you with the kind of relationship
that you would
prefer um the basis of appropriate
selection is accurate self- knowledge is
you got to really know who you are not
who you want to be not you think you are
not who you think you should be but who
you really are and when you do that it's
easier to make better
decisions okay what else we got
here um let's go
backwards okay okay I think that's all
the I think that's all the the paid
ones I can't get rid of this now hold on
a second
okay I get

[1:01:03]
it I can't get rid of this
okay sorry I deleted something there we
go just trying to get it out of the way
um all right let's do a few more
questions Talking for an hour I don't
want to bore anybody
um oh here's here's one that came up ARS
what's that is that is that Argentine I
mean 500 sounds really big but I don't
know what currency I'm dealing with here
anyway thank you for your donation uh
histor all something or
other it says what to do about her
possible elha widows do I do nothing
about it do I ask her about her their
past lovers do I ask her how their past
lovers were to know that I have to be
better than who the other is and so I
can see if it is worth the effort she is
20 I'm 22 okay
okay it's good question now we're
getting into the realm of sexual

[1:02:01]
getting into the realm of sexual
jealousy in
general nothing good comes out of
examining a woman's sexual
past I'm just gonna put it out
there because there's not going to be
any information there that's going to
reassure you for all time it's one of
the real problems about snooping which
people will do and kinds of different
ways is there's not going to be like
you're not going to find a text that
says oh now he's definitely not cheating
and I I don't have to worry about this
anymore there's only evidence that is
either very clear positive evidence or
can be misinterpreted as positive
evidence there's just the best you can
hope for is the absence of that which
doesn't prove that something isn't
happening right because the presence of
an absence is
not is not evidence of an absence I

[1:03:01]
not is not evidence of an absence I
think I got that right okay so I would
not go um asking about that even if she
had only one prior partner that person
could come to occupy your fantasy in a
malicious way and I don't think that's
going to be good for your um
relationship uh you'll know how good you
are relative to her past lovers by the
way that she treat you so you don't
really need to know the details the
details could be misleading because she
could just lie I mean most women have
learned not to tell men the truth about
that question that's why women have all
kinds of strange ways of counting uh
with respect to their body counts and
their hooking up Etc because they've
learned that men don't really take that
information
objectively for better for worse
um so rather than go seek
words or reassurance from her mouth like

[1:04:00]
words or reassurance from her mouth like
seek it in her behavior a woman who sees
you as her best option will treat you
very well that's that's just how it is
um especially if she's had at least some
experience on The Dating Market the
metaphor that I use
is almost everybody starts out in the
professional Arena working [ __ ] jobs you
work as an intern the pay sucks you're
at the bottom of the status hierarchy
you're often the first ones let go when
things go wrong you don't have any power
and you do all the jobs no one else
wants to do okay and generally you have
a few experiences of that when you start
out working now if you eventually get a
job that's very high paying and has
great benefits and is satisfying and you
have real influence in the
company especially in the context of
what you know is out there and how rare
this particular role might be in the job
market you're not going to do anything
to rock that vat inappropriately unless
you're actually [ __ ] crazy which you

[1:05:00]
you're actually [ __ ] crazy which you
know some people are uh but most people
aren't so most people know what side
their bread is buttered on so you can
learn whether you are a woman's best in
the context of her previous Lovers by
the way she treats you and that's a more
reliable answer than anything she's
going to say with her mouth through her
direct questioning like guys and women
have to get better at getting the
answers to the questions they need
through detective work the idea that you
can just ask a question and Trust the
answer is it's
stupid I mean the question are you
trustworthy both the trustworthy person
and the untrustworthy person are going
to say yes why did you even bother
asking that question it's going to lead
you to this false sense of re of
confidence and reassurance in your
assessment which is why companies
generally don't just do structured
interviews they they do here's a problem
here's a creative lateral task they
observe you in Social contexts they

[1:06:02]
observe you in Social contexts they
reach out to people who know you for
indirect validation it's like they they
do all kinds of things besides dealing
with the applicant directly in that very
explicit um interview so learn to get
the information that you want through
observation and through indirect means
that's generally a more reliable
way okay
James Francis thank you for your
donation favorite YouTube channel you've
referenced Patrice O'Neal a lot in your
discussions on meeting and dating yeah
he was great wasn't he what in
particular do you think he got wrong in
this regard if
anything
H uh you know I I can't say that I've
consumed patrice's entire o you know uh
I've seen a few of his standups I've
listened to a few of his um r
shows he was great his radio shows were
great too because he could really

[1:07:01]
great too because he could really
uncensor himself in a way that he
probably couldn't do for the HBO Comedy
specials what do I think he got
wrong um the
one and I don't even know if it's wrong
you know it's very hard for me to talk
about another person's relationship
because it's it's really between those
the individuals involved but I do
remember one time he kind of
it seemed like he caved in a sense he
has this great line where someone asked
him about his relationship and he said
something like you know my girl's been
with me for seven years and I've been
with her for three kind of a thing
um which I I thought was was true and
made a lot of sense to me but I think
that he eventually got to the point
where he did give up the other girls and
he did ex commit monogamously to the
woman that he was dating
and I don't think he which might be the
right decision but when he talked about

[1:08:00]
right decision but when he talked about
it he didn't seem happy about it he
seemed kind of downfallen crestfallen
downtrodden about it and he acknowledged
that it wasn't good for him but it was
good for her and he so he kind of got
into that adorer phase and he was
putting the woman's um best interest
ahead of himself his his own best
interest potentially um not always a
problem like some men do thrive in the
Ador role and some women do thrive in
the adored every relationship is
different but the point I'm so it's not
so much what he did it's the fact that
he didn't seems very enthusiastic about
doing it which seemed so different from
a lot of what he talked about where he
would kind
of he wouldn't hide I think that was one
of the the titles of one of his comedy
specials is never hide and you know he
was he was selfish about what he wanted
and he wasn't and and he was okay with
that that and and I thought that that
was um that was kind of right and if he

[1:09:01]
was um that was kind of right and if he
wanted to make a sacrifice of certain
things and enter into a committed
relationship with a woman I I get this I
would have wanted to get the sense that
he was more enthusiastic about doing so
and it kind of just felt like it was a
defeat for him but a necessary defeat to
keep the woman that he loved I don't
know if it was the right thing to do but
that's the only thing that comes to
mind
okay prr thank you for all your help
you're welcome thank you for being
here
um only four Cuban links thank you for
your donation in marriage counseling and
honesty do not agree with a lot of
opinions okay now our home environment
is well this is what was said in
counseling so do this why is marriage
counseling more female based well
Counseling in general is female based
85% of mental health workers are women
when I was in grad school I was one of
like three men in my
cohort uh women also constitute the

[1:10:02]
cohort uh women also constitute the
majority of uh therapeutic they buy the
majority of therapeutic services they're
more likely to go into therapy and
they're also more likely to buy like
therapy ancillary things like self-help
books and development
seminars uh and a lot of those things
are businesses and businesses always
have to maintain some level of
marketing they have to cater to their
customers and if most of your customers
are women then over time the service
that you provide will be catered more
and more towards women I think that's
one of the
simplest most objective Arguments for
what often goes on in couples's
counseling this therapy in general is is
a very feminized profession right
um and I've talked about why couples
therapy generally doesn't work
because the client in couples's therapy

[1:11:02]
because the client in couples's therapy
at least ideally is the relationship and
not the individuals involved and it
could very well be the best thing for
the individuals involved to and the
relationship but you can't you're not
supposed to really talk like that as a
coup's therapist it's like you're a
doctor in the absence of a DNR you have
to keep that patient Alive by any means
necessary even if it's expensive even if
it's painful even if it's in the best
interest of everyone to just sort of
accept reality and to gently let go
that's what I got for you there's a
bunch of questions they already kind of
going long so I want to get to some of
these shorter answers now James Hughes
thank you for donation boatless Captain
here and you're not a captain how can I
attract passengers when I haven't
developed my boat yet how should I apply
the game and please no thanks for your
work okay so sorry to be flipping but if
you don't have a vote you're not a
captain like the fundamental even even
having a boat doesn't make you a captain

[1:12:00]
having a boat doesn't make you a captain
but you absolutely can't be a captain
without a boat and that's what I talk
about is being a captain takes a very
very long time there's no shame in not
being a captain I get the sense that you
might be a young
man very few if any young men are
captains okay um and it can take about
10 years as I say in the book to ascend
to your
captaincy but um if you can't attract
passengers to your boat if you don't
have a boat yet like you're asking your
passengers to be psychotic or to not
really abide in reality so I would focus
on building that boat which in my
metaphor is the development of an
emotionally compelling lifestyle and
then you have something to invite
passengers onto and into which is your
relationship frame so um find you know
play to your strengths what are your
talents what are your unique abilities
what are your interests where can you
make money where can you shine like find
the contexts in which you can stand out
because as I've said most men are

[1:13:01]
because as I've said most men are
wallpaper and assiduously and
consistently work towards the
development of that boat once you have
the boat you can do some other things
um that it's one of the hardest parts
but just having a boat doesn't even make
you a captain right it just makes you a
boat
owner um how should I play the game of
please no um well you can't avoid it
it's like you don't have to do anything
to apply it you're already doing it uh
whether you're aware of it or not every
interaction in the sexual
Marketplace is more or less a game of
please no hey do you want to date hey
you want to go back to my place hey you
want to drink hey you want to get
married it's like most of relationships
are negotiation and that negotiation has
to be
completed subtly and indirectly because
as we started this talk by discussing
one of the relationship rules is you
can't be too explicit about the
negotiation you can't just say hey you

[1:14:02]
negotiation you can't just say hey you
know I make this amount of money uh I
will protect and provide for you you can
get a car and in return I want two kids
sexual Fidelity and the ability to kind
of have every other Sunday off
like it could be possible to broker
relationships like this that's more or
less how arranged marriages work it's
like marriages were were not arranged
over years there wasn't the ye years of
courtship and getting to know each other
and uh analysis and matchmaking it was
like okay it's time for this person to
get married what are some of the
available candidates let's look and then
like in a month or two you know you
generally match and you move on with the
business of what the relationship is
supposed to accomplish right um but
that's not the world that we're living
in that would feel too mercenary it
would feel too
transactive in today's day and age so
that's why everything takes longer
because we can't be direct about it and

[1:15:01]
because we can't be direct about it and
so those who thrive in the game of
please no in today's day and age are
those who can Thrive through indirect
meanss through subtlety through
emotional
manipulation um in the absence of
explicit direct transparent negotiation
you have to go through these indirect
subtle and and more covert in emotional
means so uh you're already doing the
game of please no uh this is how and you
can learn to get better at
it Beauty hack thank you for your
donation very generous thank you okay uh
xad Trader thank you for your donation
would you recommend an East
Asian uh okay I I assume you're saying
you're a 40-year-old incel situation not
political in Canada to upro to a
passport bro life I'm just looking for a
loving wife to raise a family priority
wellbeing and generational no hope here
ever thank
you
uh okay you're in Canada Canada is like

[1:16:02]
uh okay you're in Canada Canada is like
America and a lot of the West it's
um yeah I mean I don't like I said
earlier there are good women everywhere
you could find a woman in a good woman
in New York City in LA in Toronto they
exist but they're harder to find because
there's a lot of chaff surrounding that
wheat let put it that way but that's not
true in other places like a I know men
who are successful surgeons in Manhattan
who on Friday when they get off work get
on a plane and fly down to
Columbia to meet women on a different
continent because it's easier for them
to do so in South America than in
Greenwich
Village
so people have different tastes in women
people have different types they have
different things they're looking for in
relationships and fortunately we have

[1:17:01]
relationships and fortunately we have
diversity yeah this is one thing that
diversity is great and there's still
parts of the world where there are
different Traditions there are different
cultures and a lot of the rules that
govern the way that men and women
interact with each other and relate to
each other are cultural and so there are
absolutely other cultures with different
rules that might make it easier to find
what you're looking for
and on some level you got to go where
those women are like if you're that's
why so many people for so many
generations have come to America from
all parts of the world because this is
where the money is like if you want
money you've got to go where the money
is you can't expect to just make your
living in some you know [ __ ] kicker town
where nothing is going on and there's no
jobs there's no employment you know For
Better or For Worse you might have to
get off your ass and
move sometimes a far distance to go
where the jobs are to go where the money
is so if you want certain kind of women
you have to go where those women are you

[1:18:01]
you have to go where those women are you
have to be willing to do that and if
you're not willing to do that then maybe
you don't want it as much like there's
some sort of sacrifice you have to go
where the fish are biting and different
fish bite in different locations so if
you haven't traveled get out there man
it's a it's a really interesting world
there's lots of beautiful women from all
kinds of different walks of life and um
I do think it's possible to have
satisfying harmonious relationships with
a lot of different women um if you know
how to love well like that's really
helpful um the better you are as a
partner the easier it is to have
satisfying relationships with a woman if
you're peaceful she it's easier for her
to be your peace right don't look for it
outside of
yourself okay we'll do a few more James
Francis thank you for your donation
you've said that in the past you've
rejected women who you might have had
satisfying relationship with on a
relevant
basis yes I have okay I think I know

[1:19:00]
basis yes I have okay I think I know
what you're talking about what are the
basic minimum qualities one should seek
in a long-term partner okay I actually
have an episode coming out about this
I've just recorded it but it hasn't been
published yet when I talk about this
Insight I have rejected women in the
past based on
Irrelevant in my opinion irrelevant
qualities and it kind of goes like this
um when I was younger I thought I wanted
to meet my equal I wanted to meet
somebody who could kind of like meet me
where I was at because it felt like that
was the promise of romantic
relationships and so I thought well what
are the things that I like I like
quantum mechanics I like spiritual
discipline I like backpacking in the
wilderness I like Shakespearean
literature I like young Yan de
psychology etc etc so I was like I want
a woman who is interested in those
things and can discuss discuss those
topics on my level who's willing to go
out into the wilderness for a week or
two at a time and to keep up with me and
who
can read trist and cresa and be able to

[1:20:02]
can read trist and cresa and be able to
discuss the intersexual implications or
whatever the [ __ ] it was at the time and
um this was as you might expect
dramatically limiting my pool of
applicants for the role of girlfriend
like it was very hard to find a woman
that I was attracted to who was
interested in even one of those things
let alone several of those things and so
here I was I was complaining that there
was no good woman I couldn't find any
women to have relationships with when my
standards were just insanely High and
the fact of the matter is is that you
don't need to be interested or able to
discuss Shakespeare to be a really good
partner and I brought this to a mentor
and he kind of shook me up and I talk
about that more in the episode and one
of the things I realized the consequence
of this
conversation um I kind of made a
commitment to myself and the commitment
was if I could get a need met in any
other relationship on the planet besides
a sexual relationship with a woman I

[1:21:01]
a sexual relationship with a woman I
would get that need met
elsewhere like I would only bring to a
woman the things that I could not or
would not get in any other kind of
relationship with any other person on
the
planet and this dramatically simplified
what I was looking for for a woman to
just like three or four things which I
talk about in that
episode and it's so much easier to
satisfy three or four criteria than 30
or 40 criter criteria and some people
have that many conscious criteria and
who knows they might have 400
unconscious criteria it's like people
have are very demanding and picky about
who they want to mate and date with
which is of course their right but as I
say and is expensive every time you want
one more thing I want this and this and
this from a statistical standpoint
you're reducing the probability that all
of those will be satisfied
and you might just price yourself out of
the market or you're basically saying
the odds of you meeting that person are

[1:22:00]
the odds of you meeting that person are
six billion to
one what are the basic minimum qualities
that one should seek in a long-term
partner well I talk about this a little
bit in the channel um the things that
you yet you might like when you examine
the the things that you can get from a
woman that you couldn't or wouldn't get
elsewhere your list might be different
from my list there's probably some
overlap but there's probably some
personal differences there but there's
one thing that I think is um basic and
minimum and nonnegotiable which is that
to have a satisfying harmonious
long-term
relationship the two people but we're
talking about a woman here um they have
to be
inoffensive I've talked on the channel
about how disrespect is the unbreakable
rule for women but that's just one way
that a woman can be
offensive a woman is offensive when
she's disrespectful obviously but she's
also dis um offensive when she's nagging

[1:23:02]
also dis um offensive when she's nagging
when she's complaining when she is
emotionally disequil too often when she
is clingy when she is jealous or envious
when she's critical and judgmental it's
like these women might actually provide
a great deal of value positively in
their relationships but the issue is
that these negative quantities they they
corrupt they like negate they invalidate
all the positives that they might that
the man might be getting from them in
that relationship which isn't going to
make the woman feel good because she's
going to be like look at all the things
that I do but she's also doing these
other things that kind of cancel out the
satisfaction that the man might derive
from the good things like what's the
point of getting these good things if
these bad things cancel each other
cancel out the good things like that's
a you know that's a break even or even a
net loss it's probably a net loss
because negative things tend to be more
negative than positive things are
positive like the the best in the sense
of like the longest lasting the most

[1:24:02]
of like the longest lasting the most
satisfying and fulfilling relationships
that I've had in my life were not with
the hottest women they were not with the
smartest women they were not with like
the most accomplished women or the most
talented women they weren't with like
superlative women they were with except
for like they were the most inoffensive
like there was there was nothing bad
about the dynamic between the two of us
it was it was like clean and that
allowed the positives that I did receive
to just shine through all the more
clearly um and made it easier to focus
on it's generally the the things that
you don't like that that end a
relationship as opposed to not getting
enough of what you
do okay um I think we already had a
question from you let's see a7x what is
dating like for you now considering
their smv is probably the highest it's
ever been um well I did make an episode

[1:25:01]
ever been um well I did make an episode
a while back called being famous is like
being a woman and I'm only like a little
famous you know I'm YouTube
famous uh which is kind of a weird thing
a weird kind of thing because some
people like recognize you but you're
also can be invisible to the vast
majority of people who never use YouTube
right um but I will say that
like women really do make an effort with
the men that they are very attracted
to I mean it's not uncommon for me to
get a couple marriage proposals a week
for instance and I assume that they're
fairly
authentic um and women reach out to me
all the time through various messages
to try to make something happen and this
is very different than the standard

[1:26:00]
is very different than the standard
situation for myself and for the vast
majority of guys out there where you
have to approach the woman and you have
to kind of pick her up or you have to
RIS her up and make make it happen you
know what I'm saying it's like when and
and and these women don't know really
anything about me they feel like they
know things about me because maybe
they've watched hundreds of hours of my
content online but they don't they don't
know anything about me besides what they
see on the screen right and so they have
this idea they have this fantasy of me
that is very very attractive to them and
that high level of attraction overcomes
their privileged position of waiting for
the offer and they will actively try to
make something happen and so that's
that's probably been the most
um obvious change since I've um since
I've become a little famous is that uh
women really do make a more obvious and
effortful uh

[1:27:01]
effortful uh
effort okay we'll do two more
James what do you suggest for men who
feel emotionally numb or numb to the
point where the only feeling left is
anger
yeah I think CS Lewis who was a pretty
smart guy said something like
I sat with my anger long
enough that I eventually learned that
its real name was
grief and that feels really right to me
I think that behind a lot
of male anger is
grief it's hard to be a
man and we're not allowed to talk about
that and you don't get any sympathy for
it anyway if you're fool hearty enough
to talk about it most men are
scarred um they're scarred by men and
they're scarred by women both physically
and
emotionally
and they're subject to experiencing a

[1:28:01]
and they're subject to experiencing a
great deal of pain and sometimes it can
feel like the only way to escape feeling
the pain is to cut off the ability to
feel
anything and really that should only be
done as a last resort but I will I won't
I'll say that there's a time and a place
to do that it's like sometimes you got
to amputate a limb to save the person
I mean there's always kind of like this
murky Gray Zone when it comes to
Battlefield medicine and maybe cutting
out the emotional capacity was what
saved a man's life but maybe that was
also temporary because what we're really
talking we're not talking about a
physical organ or a limb we're talking
about like a
sensibility and for most men that
sensibility isn't like amputated it's
more Ines ized and it's anesthetized
with alcohol it's anesthetized with porn
it's anesthetized with video games and

[1:29:00]
it's anesthetized with video games and
weed it's anesthetized with streaming
services etc
etc
and what can happen when a when a guy
makes the decision to stop
anesthetizing is the pain comes back
now this isn't this isn't going to sound
very scientific but one of my kind of
pet theories is that the feeling of an
emotion is that emotion leaving you like
we say in therapy you have to feel it to
heal it it's almost like you're vomiting
it up when you vomit something up it's
kind of gross but you taste it again you
know what I'm saying it's like when you
feel it that's the emotion leaving and
until you feel it it doesn't leave it
stays inside of you like as trust me
I've tried every which way to try to
avoid feeling certain feelings and
nothing gets rid of them the the only
thing that I know to get rid of certain
feelings is to feel them the problem is
if you anesthetize yourself for years or

[1:30:02]
if you anesthetize yourself for years or
maybe even decades you might have
[ __ ] years or decades worth of
feelings to
feel and when it starts to come out it's
going to feel absolutely potentially
overwhelming like there's just so much
you have an emotional debt you have a
40-year emotional debt some guys do how
do you begin paying off 40 Years of
credit card debt it's like It seems
impossible in the beginning it is
possible but it's like it's not going to
happen overnight
right so the way to do that is is to
pull back on some of the
anesthetizing activities and to begin to
feel some of those emotions and then
when when you when you're feeling
overwhelmed you can reapply the the
anesthesia if you need to or do
something else like you're not going to
be able to get through everything in any
in like one sitting it's not like in the
movies where you have one good therapy
session you have a breakthrough and then
that's it so you might have to like open

[1:31:00]
that's it so you might have to like open
it up and then close it open it up and
then close it and do that a lot of times
to kind of eventually get things out um
and eventually it does get out like
eventually you do get out of debt that
emotional debt and you're kind of like
up to the present moment in terms of
your
sensitivity and that's a great thing
like it's actually a really good thing
to have emotions it's not a good thing
to have emotions if all you feel is pain
but maybe that's because you're in a
painful environment that you couldn't do
anything about but now you're
older now you're you have more agency
hopefully you have more resources and
there's some things that you can do
about that you don't have to abide in
painful environments anymore you can
take yourself out of that and then you
can work to let go of some of the stuff
that you are holding on to good question
okay one more and then we'll call it a
night okay
okay let's go with this one Drew liamson

[1:32:00]
okay let's go with this one Drew liamson
thank you for your
donation how do you choose whom to
love can you unconditionally love two
women at the same time sure and are
there are circumstances in which
unconditional love should end well
no because then it would be conditional
love right unconditional love is really
um it's a beautiful thing but it's a
dangerous thing uh um Love is a choice
it's otherwise like how could Jesus say
love your
enemies like who would organically feel
affection for people who are trying to
kill you like only crazy people would
feel that and I don't think Jesus was
nuts you know what I mean so what he's
getting at I think is that love is
something that you can intentionally
practice and you can practice it with
anybody even people who hate you you
even people who want nothing to do with
you which is also a couple clues that
love isn't really a positive emotion

[1:33:00]
love isn't really a positive emotion
like it doesn't feel warm and
fuzzy and you don't need a relationship
to love because you might have to love
people who want nothing to do with you
beyond your destruction right that's the
injunction of that commandment to love
your
enemies so you can choose to love and
love is something that you can access to
greater and greater capacity the more
that you love the more that you practice
and like I said you can practice
sacrifice self-sacrifice you can
practice egolessness you can practice
putting other people first you can
practice forgiveness you can practice
kindness you can practice compassion and
the more that you practice those things
and the more that you put the good of
the other ahead of yourself the more
that you love the more you are love
right and you chose to love whoever you
chose to love not because they were
worthy of it who's worthy of that you

[1:34:00]
worthy of it who's worthy of that you
know what I'm saying uh but because it
was your pleasure to do it as a lover
they they couldn't earn your love just
like they couldn't earn your friendship
right they people people decided to be
your friend because they wanted to be
your friend it's not like you had to
prove it to them first and was like oh
okay because you did this I'll be your
friend right that doesn't feel like a
friend right so you chose to love who
you chose to love and they did nothing
to earn that which also means that they
can do nothing
to unar
it which is what makes love very
dangerous right if you if you love your
enemies if you if you're supposed to
anyway
and love is
about putting the good of the other
ahead of yourself it's not about
boundaries like you can be in a
situation where all you do is give and
give and give and the other person just
takes and takes and takes and we'd call
that like an abusive or exploitative

[1:35:00]
that like an abusive or exploitative
relationship which it
is but love doesn't care about
that love is an inexhaustible source and
it will just keep on giving to the even
where they have to make a sacrifice of
their own lives like Jesus did right so
that's why love is actually a really
dangerous addition to relationships most
people don't know how to love most
people actually don't want to love they
want to get and again love is not about
getting what you want it's about giving
other people what they
need which is not always what they want
which is often why people that you love
tend to dislike you because giving
people what they don't want doesn't make
you very
popular okay so uh this was great I had
a lot of fun with this conversation it
went really
well uh I think I'll do this again some
time in any case I might as well plug
the book again the value of others it's
