over the duration of my career I've done
a lot of consultations with a lot of
different men and many have spoken to me
about their unsatisfactory marriages and
relationships and this has allowed me to
discover points of convergence
throughout most of their cases I've
discovered that bad relationships are
almost always based on poor selection I
cannot say this enough you can't have
any relationship with anyone for
whatever reason certain people are not
temperamentally or emotionally or
psychologically able to have stable
peaceful loving long-term relationships
and it's not your job to figure out why
or how to fix them so you can get what
you want from them if you insist that
you should be able to have the
relationship you want with the person
you want to have it with independent of
whether or not that person can
emotionally or psychologically do so
then my friend you're on the path of
pain it won't work out for you but
you'll only figure out that I'm right
after years of conflict heartache and
despair
