You mentioned this before. It's easier
to console your friends when you're down
versus giving feeling happiness for them
when they have success.
&gt;&gt; Oh, sure.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; The success of a peer is an affront to
one's vanity.
&gt;&gt; There's been a lot of folks who I think
might secretly be waiting for my
downfall on some level. You know,
because to them, I'm just Orion and
maybe they've enjoyed a a more positive
social status to me historically and
this is an affront to their egos or
their vanity.
&gt;&gt; I think you have to catch yourself. is
something of a habit. Did you play
sports as a kid? Yes.
&gt;&gt; What sports did you play?
&gt;&gt; Football, basketball, wrestling, track.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, you got a couple of team
sports in there. And remember after the
game, whether you win or lost, you had
to go out and shake the other team.
&gt;&gt; And didn't sometimes you not want to
do that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I got into there was a huge brawl
several times uh after a football game
&gt;&gt; because I don't think that's the natural
response of any child to be like, well,
you know, the better man won and thanks
for giving me a good game, chum. So
that's when we lose, we're petulant,
we're angry, we're we're upset, maybe
we're crying for boys, you know, it's

[01:01]
we're crying for boys, you know, it's
like that's the natural tendency in
people is not to feel happy for the ones
who beat us or are ahead of us, but we
cultivate that habit in children so that
we can navigate in society where there's
always going to be a bigger fish. You
know what I'm saying? So I do think that
there could be a natural organic
tendency towards envy in human beings
when they see a perceived equal doing
better than them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So what you should start doing, even if
you don't feel it, is to say, "Man,
congratulations. I'm so happy for you."
It's like going back on the field when
you were a kid and shaking the opposing
team's hand after you got trounced.
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's going to feel not very authentic.
It's going to feel bad, but it'll
cultivate a habit that will destroy envy
from taking root in your heart, which is
one of the best things that you can do
as a successful
