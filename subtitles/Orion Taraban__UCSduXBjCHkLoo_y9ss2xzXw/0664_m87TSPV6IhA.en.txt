so what does this mean that a man exists
in the frames of two women
simultaneously uh let's say that the
wife is demanding the man leave his
mistress and stay with her and that the
mistress is demanding the man leave his
wife and stay with her not only does
this insist on a mutually exclusive
decision that may not necessarily be
required but in his mindset the man's
entire range of optionality is either to
give woman a what she wants or a woman
be what she wants like what about what
the man wants the choice is not between
wife or mistress this is a product of
the women controlling the discussion the
choice is actually between the wife or
no wife will the wife help the man go
where he wants to go and between the
mistress and no mistress that is will
the mistress help the man go where he
wants to go and this can be hard for men
because many of them haven't thought
about what they want in quite some time
this is because they have gotten so in
the habit of serving their women and
they have gotten so comfortable existing
in their women's frames
