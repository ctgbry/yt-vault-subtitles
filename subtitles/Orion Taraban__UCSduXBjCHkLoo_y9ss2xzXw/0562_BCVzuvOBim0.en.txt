I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why men
make more than women so if you are like
me who grew up in the west since the
time you were a child you were told that
women earn 82 cents for every dollar
earned by a man this was repeated over
and over and over again until it more or
less assumed the status of an
unquestionable truth and doubting its
validity was tantamount to attacking the
entire female gender however by now dear
listeners you should know that things
are not always or usually what they
appear to be so today let's take a
closer look at this old standby the
statistic from which this fact is
derived is a third grade statistic like
it's something we might expect an
8-year-old to calculate how was it
constructed to get this number they
added up every man annual salary and

[01:01]
added up every man annual salary and
divided the sum by the number of working
men and compared it with the sum of
every woman's annual salary divided by
the number of working
women that's it as statistical analyses
go it's probably the most imprecise
approximation of reality one could
possibly conceive what's more this third
grade statistic was paired with an
equally Elementary interpretation namely
since the only apparent difference
between the two groups identified as men
and women was ostensibly gender then the
observed wage Gap must be entirely due
to that variable third grade math
coupled with third grade thinking it's
time to grow up now the easiest way to
help people understand why the statistic
isn't true is to ask them a seemingly
unrelated question do all women make the
same amount of

[02:00]
same amount of
money obviously they don't so then you
have to ask why do some women make more
money than others they can't possibly be
due to gender because they're all women
so what else could be
responsible well maybe some of them are
in higher paying Industries absolutely
the kind of work that you do would have
a huge impact on your earning potential
but do all say women lawyers make the
same amount obviously they don't so why
do some women lawyers make more than
others well maybe it's due to seniority
okay that could definitely be part of it
but do all say women lawyers who have
worked for a company for 10 years make
the same amount obviously they don't so
why do some women lawyers who have
worked for a company for 10 years make
more than others well maybe some of them
work more hours than others yeah I mean
if you do more work or work more
overtime you're going to get paid more
aren't you but do all say women lawyers

[03:01]
aren't you but do all say women lawyers
who have worked for a company for 10
years and who work a total of 80 hours a
week make the same amount etc etc the
point of this thought experiment is to
draw out all the variables that may
reasonably affect income that have
nothing to do with gender we can then
Factor these variables into our original
calculation with respect to men and
women by controlling for their influence
and this actually allows us to compare
Apples to Apples because if we remove
all other known sources of income
variation then what's left might be
attributable to
gender and in fact people have done just
that this is called the controlled pay
Gap and lo and behold when you control
for all these known variables of income
variation the gender paid Gap shrinks
from 18 cents to one cent one cent so

[04:01]
from 18 cents to one cent one cent so
there is a 1% difference in pay that
favors men which is not a statistically
significant difference this means that
men and women are functionally paid the
same amount all other things being equal
however you have to be nuanced in your
analysis in order to arrive at this
conclusion does this mean that sexism
doesn't exist no but it does suggest
that sexism plays a much smaller role in
the economic realities of women that is
commonly believed now before I go any

[05:00]
appreciate it thank you very much
of course when you relax all of these
controls it remains clear that men as a
whole make more than women as a whole
and this uncontrolled pay Gap increases
significantly once a woman has children
now one of the common interpretations of
this finding is that men out earn women
because women are doing more of the
unpaid labor of raising children and
running the household and if men would
do their fair share of the household
duties this uncontrolled Gap would
shrink now while it's true that women do
more of this unpaid labor than men do
this may be due less to sexist cultural
forces than to the biological
psychological reality that infants need
their mothers far more than they need
their fathers of whom they may only be
dimly aware at this
point it's also true that these factors
are merely Cor corelated that is one

[06:01]
are merely Cor corelated that is one
interpretation of the data could be that
women make less than men because they're
busy doing unpaid labor in the household
another interpretation could be that
women are busy doing unpaid labor in the
household because they make less than
men like in any given relationship it's
far more likely that the man earns more
than the woman given the fact that
income status and social Prestige are
key drivers of female mate selection and
it would make economic sense in a
partnership in which resources are
shared and in which one party earns more
than the other for the party who earns
more to kind of specialize in earning
money and to devote more time to that
Pursuit the earning discrepancy would
free up time in the other person's day
to attend to the necessary but unpaid
tasks that keep the partnership running
in fact
you could even consider that these tasks

[07:02]
you could even consider that these tasks
are paid by the earning discrepancy of
the other party that is then shared
mutually in the relationship under such
an arrangement like specializing in that
way makes good economic sense so though
we don't know for sure I'm willing to
bet that that's closer to the truth of
things than the other way around here's
the thing the uncontrolled gender pay
Gap will always exist always
period no matter all the social advances
or economic incentives or ideological
campaigns it's never going to change men
will always make more than women and men
will always make more than women because
earning is tied to men's reproductive
success in a way that it is not tied to
women's why because as we all know I
don't want no scrub a scrub is a guy who
can't get no love from me hanging out

[08:02]
can't get no love from me hanging out
the passenger side of his best friend's
ride trying to holler at me like For
Better or Worse women in general don't
with guys with lower status and
income the same is not true for women
men will an attractive convenience
store clerk with no status education or
resources it is what it is so here's the
upshot money means lots of things to
lots of people it can mean security it
can mean Freedom it can mean fun it can
mean confidence it can mean lifestyle it
can mean all these things to women but
it means all these things to men plus
reproductive
success money serves one additional
function for men that it doesn't for
women this is why all other things being
equal money is relatively more valuable
to men
than it is to women and this is why no

[09:03]
than it is to women and this is why no
matter how much money women make men
will continue to make more like if women
worked 90 hours a week men would work 91
not all of them but enough of them and
they will do this in order to outpace
women in order both to improve their
ability to access more and more
desirable sexual
opportunities and to maintain the
stability of their pre-existing
relationships as well this is because
divorce which is already
disproportionately initiated by women is
50% more likely again when the woman out
earns the
man if necessary men would Advent a 25th
hour in the day if it meant it would
improve their odds in the sexual
Marketplace and this is why the
uncontrolled pay Gap isn't going
anywhere anytime soon
in fact if it disappeared we might be in

[10:02]
in fact if it disappeared we might be in
some kind of end of days scenario
because in that case the pool of
eligible bachelors for these higher
earning women would then be so small
that we would probably be well below
replacement rates with respect to our
population and that's why men make more
no matter how hard women work some men
will always work harder because given
women's selection criteria it's related
to our genetic survival what do you
