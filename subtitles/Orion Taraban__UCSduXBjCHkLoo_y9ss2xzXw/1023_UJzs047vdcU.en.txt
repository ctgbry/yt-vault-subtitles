I remember also in my lectures on anger
and rage and their evolutionary
components, I included some research
that showed that cultures of honor have
higher rates of violence and aggression.
Yeah. Than cultures that don't because
cultures of honor are generally uh
they're less propertied. Yeah. They're
not really landed agrarian places. So
maybe they were nomadic or herders or
it's like the wild west. It's like you
you carry your wealth in your
reputation.
&gt;&gt; Yes. And so any disparagement of your
reputation is in those cultures
tantamount to say like stealing your
property. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And in property society say that you
know more or less if you have a home
invasion you're justified in doing what
you need to do to defend yourself in
that situation. But what if your
property is not the home? You don't live
in that kind of society. Your property
is your status and your reputation.
&gt;&gt; No. It it seems to me like a license
that we give the the property person
when he's transgressed upon should be
given to the honorable man when he's

given to the honorable man when he's
transgressed upon. But that's, you know,
tricky stuff. Yeah. Not tricky stuff.
