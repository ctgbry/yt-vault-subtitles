i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
enough is a psychological quantity
so
have you ever seen enough money
i haven't
i don't know if enough money exists as
an objective quantifiable amount
people might generally be in agreement
as to what more than enough money looks
like
but enough money is probably going to
vary significantly from person to person
same goes for the other things that
folks generally chase after enough love
enough sex enough pleasure enough
achievement
enough power
is something that actually doesn't exist
in the extensive universe
it exists in the intensive universe it
exists inside of us it's a psychological
quantity
diogenes that punk rock cynic
philosopher
once said that he who has the most is

[01:02]
once said that he who has the most is
the one contented with the least
and i think that's a really useful way
of evaluating the concept of enough
enough contentment is when we mentally
decide to stop wanting more
when we perceive our present
circumstances as sufficient
our needs as humans are actually very
very simple
the vast majority of us have what we
need and then some
and while our needs are limited our
wants our desires
if undisciplined
are subject to being unlimited
think about it the mind left unchecked
is never satisfied
the body which is more connected to
objective reality is satisfied but the
mind is not the mind will crave more
food when the body says it's full
the mind will desire more sex even
minutes after the body has been
satisfied

[02:00]
satisfied
the mind will want more money even after
all of its desires have been paid for
left undisciplined and unchecked the
mind will continue to want and to want
more
and these uncurbed desires can actually
be the source of so much suffering on
this planet
the perception of sufficiency the
perception of contentment is a decision
it's a decision to perceive reality as
enough
it requires our will which imposes
limits on unlimited desire to be more
aligned with reality and doing this
actually allows us to live in abundance
if our desires are never curbed by our
wills
then we will perpetually believe that we
never have enough which is a scarcity
mentality
on the other hand
if we restrict ourselves to what we need
and limit our unlimited desires
then we will find ourselves in a world
of superfluous abundance where there's

[03:01]
of superfluous abundance where there's
just more than enough everywhere we look
a life full to bursting with resources
and opportunity
