I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the most
dangerous thing for a relationship
apologies for the clickbaity title but
here you are in today's episode I will
be discussing the most concerning sign
that your relationship might be in
trouble it's a little counter-intuitive
but that's kind of how we like to roll
on psychics let's get to it
many people want to know what causes
relationships to fail and the general
consensus is that relationships often
fail because one partner
kind of starts to deteriorate maybe this
person stopped putting effort into the
courtship or into his or her appearance
maybe this person hasn't really Advanced
his career or her lifestyle or has
fallen into hard financial straights or
maybe this person has become depressed
or addicted or otherwise Comfortably
Numb there are lots of ways this can
occur but the idea here is that the
relationship fails when one partner

[01:01]
relationship fails when one partner
fails or refuses to recover from some
kind of setback and that can certainly
be the case however in my clinical
experience that's not what I usually see
there's this old joke it's not really a
joke because it's not really funny but
the joke basically says that the fastest
way to end a relationship is for one
partner to start therapy
and what's the grain of Truth in this
unfunny joke that relationships are more
effectively destabilized not when one
person starts doing worse but when one
person starts doing better
when it comes to the long-term health of
a relationship success especially if it
only comes to one of the partners is
often much more dangerous than failure
let's examine why this might be the case
the fact of the matter is that
Improvement is destabilizing when one

[02:02]
Improvement is destabilizing when one
person starts to grow in therapy starts
to process his or her emotional baggage
and begins taking responsibility for his
or her own happiness this forces a shift
in the relationship when one person
achieves great professional success
arrives at a position of power or fame
and enjoys significantly more social
opportunity
this force is a shift in the
relationship when one person starts to
work out attend to his or her health and
improve overall attractiveness this
forces a shift in the relationship and
this is because in a system where all
the parts are interconnected it's not
possible for one thing to change without
causing an alteration in all the related
Parts it's not always possible to
predict exactly how these related parts
will change especially if the system is
particularly complex but we can expect
alteration so to speak to Ripple outward
from the source of the change
now you might say but Orion
that happens when one person gets worse

[03:01]
that happens when one person gets worse
doesn't it it isn't that a change that
forces a shift in all the related parts
of the system indeed it does however
this is not nearly as destabilizing as
you might think and that's because you
have to understand that when a change
occurs within a system the most frequent
response from the other parts of that
system is to reinstate the pre-change
conditions
that is most systems have a tendency
toward homeostasis and this is great
news if the change in question is
negative it makes it more likely that
the partner will bounce back from the
setback but not so great news if the
change in question is positive as it
increases the likelihood that the
progress will be undermined to preserve
the status quo
now if someone is in a relationship and
their partner starts to deteriorate
this can be a frustrating and

[04:01]
this can be a frustrating and
inconvenient and anxiety provoking
situation
however if we're honest it's also not
without its compensations
these aren't things that people will
generally admit
sometimes not even to themselves but
there are a lot of let's say emotional
opportunities for the non-failing
partner in this situation opportunities
that if he or she is not careful can
very well become traps for both parties
because they keep people in
dysfunctional relationships far longer
than they otherwise would
for instance though it's not pleasant to
admit one partner's failure could be the
other partner's opportunity to feel
Superior or righteously indignant
and to the extent that this failure is
intractable like an addiction or a flaw
or a foible the partner now has a
Perpetual scapegoat someone they can now
blame for all of their unhappiness not

[05:01]
blame for all of their unhappiness not
so fun fact relationships in which one
partner is an alcoholic are more likely
to end not when the addict is in the
throes of his or her addiction but when
this person sobers up
and this is partly because the
non-alcoholic partner can no longer use
the alcoholic as a scapegoat for all of
the pain and suffering and
disappointment in his or her life if
only this person didn't drink if only I
didn't have to spend all of my time
cleaning up after your messes or solving
all of her problems
the addiction gives the non-addict the
opportunity to feel morally Superior and
to externalize responsibility for his or
her suffering that's why these people
need to go to Al-Anon
what's more if the partner in question
is of a more codependent persuasion the
deterioration of one could be a project
for the other a source of purpose and
meaning
I will do what it takes to get you sober
we'll get through this difficult
situation and it's more positive aspect

[06:02]
situation and it's more positive aspect
this can help bring people closer
together
however in its more Insidious
manifestations it can give rise to
Perpetual victims so that Heroes can
have someone to save
white Knights and damsels damsels in
distress for instance seem to have a way
of finding each other
in any case my point is that the
deterioration of a partner is not devoid
of potential benefits

now on the other hand the significant
Improvement of a partner can be much

[07:01]
Improvement of a partner can be much
trickier for the other person to handle
it's hard to be a Perpetual cheerleader
and the Improvement of the other can be
perceived as an indictment of our own
lack of progress this is especially true
the more the partners perceive
themselves to be equals as it creates
the conditions for Envy to occur Envy is
a complicated emotion but one of its
many preconditions is that it can only
arise in the context of perceived equals
if you don't perceive yourself to be
someone's equal then his or her success
or superiority is experienced as
admiration
however the more
similar people believe themselves to be
the more likely they will feel envious
of another's progress even if
or rather especially if it's a loved one
the person who isn't improving may also
start to feel as if he or she is holding

[08:00]
start to feel as if he or she is holding
the other person back or that he or she
is increasingly the problem in the
relationship this is a narcissistic
injury and it can throw all those all
but those with the strongest sense of
self for a loop and let me tell you as
hard as it it can be to be in a
relationship with a problematic person
it's often easier to deal with someone
else's problem than to feel as though
you yourself are the problem
this feeling causes people to act in
well
problematic ways including but not
limited to
sabotaging the improving partner's
progress
or undermining the improving partner's
perception or experience of that
progress
success is also destabilizing here
because it creates new and different
opportunities the successful partner May
suddenly have access to many more people
some of whom may be more desirable

[09:00]
some of whom may be more desirable
potential mates the opportunity is
threatening and creates the conditions
for jealousy and games of control the
idea here is frankly is to prevent the
improving partner from leaving
on the other hand dysfunctional
relationships are often very secure and
the reason is that it would actually be
very difficult to have that particular
dysfunctional relationship with anyone
else
dysfunctional relationships tend to be
specialized in their dysfunction which
makes it harder for either partner to
leave even if it would be better for
everyone involved to leave a
dysfunctional relationship one or both
Partners would have to learn new ways of
relating new ways of being in order to
have a relationship with someone else
it's like the dysfunctional people have
become koalas they can only eat
eucalyptus leaves
and this creates barriers against
exiting the relationship even if the
relationship approaches misery

[10:01]
relationship approaches misery
by contrast it's actually very easy to
have a relationship with a successful
high functioning individual these people
are omnivores they can eat whatever they
want and it's not going to cause any
problems do you understand
and this perspective has been
corroborated by the literature for
instance the French sociologist Emile
durkheim discovered that suicide rates
did not go up during periods of hardship
or economic contraction but
counter-intuitively during periods of
Rapid social Improvement
the idea here is that when times are
hard people buckle down join together
and strive toward a common goal with
Hope For Better Days the hardship
creates the opportunity for Union and
meaning making just like in a
high-functioning relationship in which
one person suffers a setback
on the other hand periods of progress
and growth were far more destabilizing
as they tended to disrupt the limits
within which people habitually operated

[11:02]
within which people habitually operated
this sense of limitlessness which
durkheim called anime
created a kind of vertigo a vortex in
which life seemed to fall apart in the
midst of Plenty and progress and it is
precisely this enemy produced by the
success of one partner that is one of
the most difficult storms for a
relationship to weather
