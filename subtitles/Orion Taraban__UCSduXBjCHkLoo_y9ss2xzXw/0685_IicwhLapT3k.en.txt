the fact of the matter is that women get
away with all kinds of in today's
day and age behavior that society would
never tolerate in a man few men stand up
to women because doing so is a kind of
social suicide in today's political
climate though that doesn't eliminate
the desire to see it happen many men
through the anonymity of the internet
can live this fantasy vicariously
through the content creators who are
brave or fool hearty enough to do so so
that's the content trap that tends to
ins snare men however the female version
is even more Insidious it's more
Insidious because as big as the male
problem is the female problem is not
only bigger it's more invisible
marketers have learned that tapping into
female fantasy can be insanely
profitable and the way this is done at
least among many content creators online
is by making women feel right the
creators who can make women feel right
are the gendered equivalents of the
creators who make men feel angry
