I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why the
people you like don't like you back have
you ever noticed this have you ever
noticed that when you seem to be really
interested in somebody they never seem
to reciprocate your feelings on the
other hand have you ever noticed that
when you can kind of take or leave
somebody they seem to be really
interested in you isn't that sort of the
ironic tragedy of dating
I've experienced this phenomenon from
both directions over the course of my
life and it took me a long while to
figure this one out however before I
share this Insight with you please
remember to like this episode And
subscribe to this channel it takes less
than a second costs you nothing and it's
a great way to begin to get involved in
the community so do the thing
now
this phenomenon occurs because people
are making a fundamental mistake when it
comes to dating and attraction most
people are not conscious of this mistake
but as soon as I bring it to your

[01:01]
but as soon as I bring it to your
attention you will likely see it in
operation in your own life it's very
easy to communicate the mistake is that
folks generally treat the people they
are attracted to differently from the
people they are not attracted to and why
is this a mistake well think about it
whatever you're doing with respect to
the people you are not attracted to
is working
those are the people who are actually
pursuing you and are trying to enter
into a relationship with you whatever
you're doing there is working however
there's this belief that whatever you're
doing wouldn't or shouldn't work on the
hotter women or the men that you really
want to get married to and that's not
true
what works on the women you're not
attracted to works on the women you are
attracted to what works on the menu
don't want to have a relationship with
works on the men you do want a
relationship with
and this is because the men or women

[02:01]
and this is because the men or women
that you are attracted to
are not different from the men and the
women you are not attracted to why
because that attraction exists only in
your own head it's not an objective
empirical fact there are not two species
of people one of which you are attracted
to and the other of which you are not
there's just one species people
and what works on people in general will
work on people in particular
irrespective of your subjective
attraction
and just what is it that works in the
people that you're not attracted to and
that will work on the people that you
are if you use it
indifference
it's the take it or leave it attitude
that increases attraction yeah they're
nice yeah yeah there's nothing wrong
with them and yeah there's probably
somebody better out there that's the
attitude
you spend time with them great and if

[03:01]
you spend time with them great and if
you don't
you're not really going to miss him
you're certainly not going to pursue
them or worry about them or anxiously
wait by the phone that's the correct
attitude to have toward the people that
you are attracted to
this isn't easy at first and it's
probably not going to feel very
authentic however you don't necessarily
just abandon what works in other parts
of your life because you feel a certain
way
the good news is that you already know
that this approach works because it's
likely already achieved the desired
result albeit with the undesired Target
many times in your past so it's a pretty
low risk proposition
I have more to say on the subject but
I'll leave it for my next episode in the
meantime let me know what you think in
the comments below and thank you for
listening
