i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the balance of pain and pleasure
look one of the most absolutely
infuriating aspects of being alive is
the asymmetry between pleasure and pain
and this asymmetry manifests itself in
several different ways for instance
there are so many different flavors of
pain and suffering there are species of
anger and despair and envy and guilt and
loneliness and dementia and disease and
cruelty and injustice they vastly
outnumber the number of different
flavors of pleasure and contentment
what's more painful experiences seem to
be more painful
than pleasurable experiences are
pleasurable and this is really important
to closely examine if you are trying to
win the game of hedonism which is to

[01:00]
win the game of hedonism which is to
maximize pleasure and minimize pain
the game is rigged because it's not a
one-to-one ratio it's not like if you
have one pleasant experience and one
painful experience that you've somehow
broken even
because the negative experience is
likely to be more negative and the
positive experience is positive
so an even balance of positive and
negative experiences is actually a net
the house is winning at this point and
that's why the game of hedonism is
actually so very hard to win
and this has been corroborated by
scientific research into relationships
as well for example john gottman the
psychologist who runs the love lab in
seattle has closely examined the micro
interactions between couples and has
derived some very robust conclusions
about what causes a relationship to
flourish and what causes a relationship
to fail
gottman has identified what he calls the
magic ratio of positive to negative
interactions with respect to successful

[02:00]
interactions with respect to successful
relationships
according to his research for a
relationship to succeed there has to be
at least
five
positive interactions for every one
negative interaction at minimum five to
one
so this is something to keep in mind
with respect to your various
relationships it's not enough
that the positives balance the negatives
on the contrary if that were the case
you're probably going to be miserable
rather we need to have at least
five positive interactions for every one
negative interaction in order to
experience that relationship to be a net
benefit at all
and this conclusion lends itself to a
obvious deduction namely
if you want to improve your overall
happiness or the quality of your
relationships
rather than try to increase the number
of positive interactions it's much more
efficient and effective to reduce the

[03:01]
efficient and effective to reduce the
number of negative interactions if
possible
because of the asymmetricality of the
ratio involved you get way more bang for
your buck by mitigating the negative
than attempting to augment the positive
