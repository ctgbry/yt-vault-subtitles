another Carl
quote a man who has not passed through
The Inferno of his passions has never
overcome them well that's certainly true
it reminds me of some of the
self-righteousness that tends to come
out when another politician or athlete
is caught in some form of infidelity
which you know it's happened for
hundreds of years it's never going to
stop happening and there's a lot of men
in particular who might come out and
very publicly loud their loyalty and
their undying love and commitment to
their wives and I don't doubt that some
of that is true and authentic on the
other hand I wonder how much optionality
these men really have in the sense of
how much Temptation have these men had
to experience for how long and at what
level temptation is an interesting word
it has the same root as temper which we
often think of as like anger to lose
one's temper but it actually is also
associated with the tempering of metal
to temper a sword means to harden it and
to make it stronger and that ultimately
is the role of Temptation
