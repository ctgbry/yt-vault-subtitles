might actually work and be actionable to
a subset of the population, but it's not
very generalizable. That's like like

what you do is you just go up to a woman

shoulder. You look into the eye for 2.3
seconds. you say hey and it's and that
will work that will work it's like that
doesn't work like there was this who was

that the really smart people will find a

basic principles like in general it's
better to have the higher ground but
there are times when even that is a
liability ability. So, what's the
alternative? That we say nothing.

There's nothing to say about winning a
war.
