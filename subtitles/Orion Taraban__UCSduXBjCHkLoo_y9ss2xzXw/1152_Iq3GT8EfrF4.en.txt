So, there's been a lot of chatter on the
interwebs lately from women complaining
about men putting in the bare minimum
when it comes to the courtship process.
If we give these women the benefit of
the doubt, we can consider this movement
an attempt to whip men into shape, who
would then presumably put in more of an
effort when dating them. I'm here to
weigh in on this topic, and I'm going to
say in no uncertain terms that the men
who are doing the bare minimum are the
men who are doing it right. You can
almost hear the angry comments from
here. That's right. Men should do as
little as possible when courting women
in today's day and age. And today, I'm
going to walk through three reasons why
that might be the case. You can be the
judge. First and foremost, it's
important to understand that you can
never move backwards with women. That
is, whatever you do serves as the
standard against which future efforts
are compared. This means that if you
come right out of the gate with a lot of
effort and provision and consideration,
then you've just created a logistically

then you've just created a logistically
impossible relationship. It's going to
be very difficult to maintain that level
of effort, let alone top it. And trust
me, even if you are able to maintain
that level of effort throughout the
entirety of your relationship, it
wouldn't be enough. This is because
women grow acclimated to the treatment
they receive and the lifestyle they
enjoy. The same effort that might wow
them in the beginning will hardly seem
impressive or important a year or two
from now. So if you come out doing
everything you could possibly do,
congratulations. You just painted
yourself into a corner. from Macho.
