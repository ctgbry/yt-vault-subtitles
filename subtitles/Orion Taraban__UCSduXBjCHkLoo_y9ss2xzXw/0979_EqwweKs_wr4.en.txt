Over the years, I've met with many men
in this situation who have come to me
for guidance. Is there anything I can do
to change the situation? How can I keep
the connection with my child alive in
the wake of my ex's gatekeeping? How can
I ensure that my children don't hate me?
These are all tough questions,
especially because we have to be honest,
fathers don't have a lot of rights under
certain agreements. And as previously
mentioned, these can be very hard to
change. So there is often a measure of
acceptance required to navigate this
challenging situation with equinimity.
But here's the thing. For better or

lovers, colleagues all come and go. But
family relations last a lifetime.
Irrespective of the preferences of the
individuals involved, you will always be
those children's father and they will

there are empty chapters, but that
doesn't necessarily mean that the story
is over. Just because people fall apart

a father who is estranged from his
children, you might have to play the
long game. Rely on the fact that family
stories are long and b your time. In the
worst case scenario, you will have to
wait until your kids turn 18.
Eventually, your children will become
adults, and as adults, they will have to
make up their own minds about things,
including, very notably, their parents.
They may even come to you with
questions. However, there is also the
possibility that after years of
emotional alienation, they will feel no
particular motivation to establish a
relationship.
