what works with women is diversity of
experience if you just keep providing
the same thing over and over and over
again it will lose its value this is the
law of marginal utility applied to
intersexual relationships for instance
irrespective of her professed
materialism a woman is much more likely
to value a designer handbag if she
hasn't got one than if she has 50 like
if she already has 50 the 50 First isn't
going to matter all that much the need
or desire Satisfied by the first 50
handbags reduces the perceived value of
the 51st regardless of its price tag
makes sense in any case the issue that
very successful men encounter in their
long-term relationships is that they run
out of things to buy and if they're not
careful at this point the woman will
take the last thing from him that he's
in a position to give namely a severance
package to prevent this outcome the man
has to continue to offer things that the
woman desires and doesn't yet have and
this is possible but it's only possible
through affection
