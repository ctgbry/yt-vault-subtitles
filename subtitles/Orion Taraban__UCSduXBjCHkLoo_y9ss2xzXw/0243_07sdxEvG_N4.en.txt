i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
don't be the last guy to leave the party
so this is a message that is
specifically addressed to the
20-somethings in the audience
the 20s and in particular your early to
mid 20s or a really interesting time in
your life because it's probably the
chapter of your life that will be most
dominated by your friendships
in many respects it's still a
continuation of college your peers and
your friends play such an enormous and
rewarding role in your life and most of
your socializing is done in your friend
group there's a lot of going out there's
a lot of partying and that's all well
and good there's nothing wrong with that
it's important to understand however
that this doesn't last forever
when you get to around 28
over the next five years from 28 to 33
your friend group will start to fall
apart

[01:00]
apart
this is usually not due to falling outs
of any kind if anything everyone still
feels as positively about their friends
as ever
it's just that other parts of life
slowly become more important
one person decides to go back to law
school
another person moves away for a better
job opportunity yet another person gets
into a serious relationship and starts
having kids
for better or worse people begin to
prioritize other aspects of their lives
above their friendships
so why am i talking about this
have you ever been to a house party
it's a lot of fun the music is playing
the drinks are flowing and everyone's
having a good time
but then around a certain point of the
evening
people begin to make their exit
in the beginning it's just a person here
or there then it's a few couples
and then there's this mass exodus and
like within the space of 20 or 30
minutes the party just dies almost
everyone clears out
now

[02:00]
now
maybe you are having a fantastic time
and you're not ready for the night to
end
have you ever
not left with that mass exodus
have you ever had the experience of
being the last guy or gal
at the party
chances are you have and chances are it
wasn't a pleasant one the music is now
uncomfortably loud maybe someone's
passed out in the corner there's vomit
on the couch and the bathroom's a mess
and then the sadness sets in
it's generally not a good experience to
be the last person to leave the party
and that's because nothing good happens
after a certain point in the night you
understand
now this piece of advice is useful for
any given saturday night but it's also
useful in the context of your 20s as a
whole
so we can generalize the scope of this
piece of advice like i said the first
half of your 20s will be dominated by
your friends and fun
but then some people are going to get

[03:01]
but then some people are going to get
married and some people are going to get
serious about their careers and some
people are going to suffer death and
loss
and then there's going to be this mass
exodus
you don't want to be the last person to
leave the party
you don't want to be the 33 year old
who's still trying to get high and
wasted with his friends on the weekend
at that point your friends are gonna
have other things to do and frankly so
should you
so enjoy your time while you can
but leave while the getting is still
good hopefully that makes sense
