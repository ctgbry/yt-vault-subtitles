i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
stop what hurts you first
this is something that is extremely
useful to do before seeking out
professional help
and yet i see folks not doing this time
and time again in my own clinical
practice and why is this problematic
because in the vast majority of cases
improvement is less a question of
starting 10 new good habits as it is
stopping the one or two things that are
directly related to causing the problem
often just stopping these one or two
things is enough to resolve the issue no
further action is required and the truth
is
you probably already know the one or two
things you would need to stop without
paying someone to tell you what they are
as hippocrates said before you heal
someone
ask him if he's willing to give up the
things that make him sick

[01:00]
things that make him sick
for example a person might come to me
complaining of high levels of anxiety or
even a history of panic attacks and in
the course of treatment it comes out
that he's drinking six or seven units of
alcohol on a nightly basis now if you
don't know this alcohol is a
neurodepressant it inhibits the
sympathetic nervous system
and in its attempts to restore
homeostasis the body stimulates the
sympathetic nervous system
to work more intensely to counteract the
effects of the substance so that when
the alcohol intoxication eventually
wears off the sympathetic nervous system
no longer has an inhibitor to push
against and it feels like it's kicked
into overdrive and in many respects the
felt experience of elevated sympathetic
response is functionally
indistinguishable from anxiety
and so now the question is complicated
is this person legitimately dealing with
an anxiety disorder or is he attempting
is he experiencing the withdrawal
syndrome
of acute alcohol intoxication

[02:01]
of acute alcohol intoxication
and until the individual makes an
attempt to abstain from alcohol for a
while there's really no way to resolve
this ambiguity and it's hard to create
an effective treatment plan if the
actual problem hasn't yet been reliably
identified
and this is something that a person in
most cases could have done on his own
before contracting with a therapist as
hard as it is
why not try to go two weeks without
drinking and observe its effect on the
anxiety best case scenario hey
i'm not getting as anxious maybe i need
to focus on restricting my alcohol
intake as opposed to seeking help for
panic attacks
on the other hand if that person were to
stop drinking for two weeks only to find
no change in his anxiety levels then
that would be very useful information
for any therapist he may choose to
engage to treat the anxiety because now
the individual can say to the
professional look i tried this this and
this
didn't actually work what else you got

[03:02]
didn't actually work what else you got
this will help make that session way
more useful effectively giving you more
bang for your buck and increasing the
likelihood that you're both on the same
that you're both on the right track so
if possible try to stop what hurts you
before seeking out professional help
