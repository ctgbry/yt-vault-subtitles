i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to handle failure like a pro
look if you're going to be great
you have to be willing to fail
think of the greatest basketball players
of all time michael jordan kobe bryant
lebron james
now think of how many games those guys
lost
together they've lost more games than
most professional players will ever win
over their entire careers
just by virtue of the fact that they've
been so great for so long
even the all-time leaders in major
league baseball have a career batting
average of less than 400 which means
that the very best hitters in the
history of that sport failed to get a
hit more times than they succeeded
so the path to mastery requires passing
through not just failure
but a great deal of failure
therefore in order to be great
the ability to come to some sort of

[01:01]
the ability to come to some sort of
emotional acceptance with respect to the
inevitability of failure is essential
and i think professional athletes
actually have a very good attitude with
respect to failure that's worth
emulating
what happens after lebron loses a game
he's in front of the reporters at the
press conference and he'll say something
like yeah we weren't passing very well
and you know we're missing our free
throws which obviously we can't do the
other team played really well they
showed some good hustle
but right now we're just focused on
tomorrow's game and we'll get them next
time
this is an
excellent
response to failure
there are three parts to it worth
mentioning in the first part there's a
recognition of what could be improved
the passing was poor they weren't making
their free throws
those behaviors were instrumental to the
failure in a reality-based way
and they are simultaneously the
opportunities for growth and improvement
that will decrease the possibility of

[02:01]
that will decrease the possibility of
failure in the future
good
second there's the non-defensive
acceptance of failure this demonstrates
a good degree of dignity and respect
both for oneself and if appropriate for
one's opponent
and third the result is ultimately
forward facing
there is no
inclination to ruminate or sulk
tomorrow's a new day and tomorrow's a
new game i believe in myself i believe
in my team
and we'll get them next time
all told i think that's an excellent way
of responding
to the inevitability of failure on the
path toward mastery try it out for
yourself
