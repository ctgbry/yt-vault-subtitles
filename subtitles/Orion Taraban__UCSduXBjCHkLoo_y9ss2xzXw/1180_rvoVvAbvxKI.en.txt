The second thing I want to say
particularly about incels because it's
also related to depression. So there's
many different forms of narcissism and I
know that's a loaded word. So I'm I'm
kind of going to approach this more
clinically which is uh we all kind of
start out narcissistic. All children are
inherently narcissistic because they
can't do perspective taking which means
that their empathic ability is
completely offline. like they can't help
but think they're the center of the
world. And as they age, then the world
generally more or less softly or more or
less harshly beats that misconception
out of them. Right? When we talk about
narcissists, it's individuals who for
whatever reason have avoided disabusing
themselves of that fallacy of the
necessity for perspective taking, theory
of mind, etc., etc., into adulthood. But
there's many different kinds. You look
at the DSM and you just see one flavor
of narcissists, which we might call the
grandiose narcissist. I think that I'm
the God's gift to women. I can't not
succeed. Everybody loves me. I'm far
more important and powerful than I
actually am. But we might posit there's
another form of narcissism that's called

another form of narcissism that's called
like inverted narcissism. And inverted
narcissism, I think, is very much
related to depression. It's the idea
that like, oh, I'm so broken and damaged
that nothing could possibly fix me.
Happiness is is for something else. It's
not for me. It's like a negative form of
specialness. I'm so broken that I'm a
unique exception to the rule. This
treatment would never work for me. This
protocol would never help because I'm
this special negative exception to the
general rule. And that's a form of
narcissism.
