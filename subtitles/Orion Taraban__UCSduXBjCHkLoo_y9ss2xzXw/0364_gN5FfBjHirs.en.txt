if pain is inevitable and regret is a
form of pain then regret is unavoidable
one way to think about regret is that
it's sort of baked into the nature of
being a human being one of the essential
facets of humanity is the necessity of
making choices we have to make decisions
as human beings refusing to make a
decision is itself a decision and the
the nature of decisions is such that
when we choose anything we refrain from
choosing everything else and so no
matter what we choose there will always
be some measure of regret associated
with the path not taken you want to get
married great you'll regret not spending
more time single you want to be single
great you'll regret not forming a family
and creating those deep lasting bonds at
some point I guarantee it make your
peace with regret
