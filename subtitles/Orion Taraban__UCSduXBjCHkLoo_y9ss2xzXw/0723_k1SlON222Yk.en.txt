imagine that you're playing a game of
tennis and over the course of five sets
you completely trounce your opponent
fair and square in such a case it's
right that you should have won as you
were clearly the better player so you
won the game of tennis however if in
your Victory you started to gloat you
started to brag about how amazing you
clearly are and you started to rub your
superiority in your conquered opponent's
face then you would lose the metag game
of sportsmanship you are clearly right
like you are objectively the better
player and your bragado doio would
actually be founded on verifiable
empirical evidence but that wouldn't
matter and this is because For Better or
Worse we don't live in a completely or
even a mostly merit-based world it's not
always the best players who get to play
like other people still have to like you
enough or at least not dislike you
enough in order to deal with you and
while the better you are the more people
will put up with you everyone kind of
has their limit
