I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycats
better at Living Through psychology and
the topic of today's short talk is
inequality is the basis of relationship
now this sounds somewhat
counter-intuitive but I hope to
demonstrate the truth of this statement
in today's episode most people believe
that equality is the basis of
relationship and that can't be further
from the truth but before I explain why
this is the case please remember to like
this episode And subscribe to this
channel it takes less than a second
costs you nothing and it's a great way
to help spread this message so if you
like what you're hearing then please do
the thing and if you're thinking about
going to grad school then you need to
check out my GRE self-study program at
Stellar gre.com you can use the code
psych for 10 off all membership plans
here's the thing people need things from
other people and the medium through
which value is transacted is a

[01:00]
which value is transacted is a
relationship
no relationship no transacted value and
when the value of the proposed
transaction is equal
no transaction occurs and therefore no
relationship is possible
allow me to demonstrate this imagine I
were to come up to you and say hey I'll
give you this dollar bill
for that dollar bill
would you do it
it's kind of a strange request right you
might respond are you asking me to break
that dollar into quarters so you could
do laundry or something as the same
value in a different form might be more
useful under certain circumstances but
if I responded no I just want that
particular dollar bill
what would you think
at this point you might start to wonder
is there something special about my
dollar bill like is it a misprint was it
printed in a valuable year or something
or conversely you might suspect is there

[02:00]
or conversely you might suspect is there
something wrong with his dollar bill is
this some kind of scam this doesn't make
any sense the point is that you would
begin to suspect the existence of some
degree of inequality to make the bread
pose transaction explicable
so would you do it well you might think
one dollar isn't that big of a risk so
if I'm getting scammed I'm really not
losing much but if I were to repeat the
same experiment with higher valuations
this a hundred dollars for that a
hundred dollars this one million dollars
for that one million dollars
you would become increasingly reticent
this is not just because the proposal is
suspicious if we assume that everything
is legit and above board
the equal transaction is actually
a net loss to both parties
why because nothing is gained for the
expenditure of time and effort to
execute the transaction which could have

[03:01]
execute the transaction which could have
been more profitably spent in another
transaction
both parties spent resources time and
energy for No Gain that's a loss
so equality is not the basis of a
transaction and no relationship is
possible on these grounds
this suggests that inequality must be
the basis of transaction which is the
actual fact a transaction only occurs
when both parties believe that what they
are receiving is of higher value than
what they are giving up
let me illustrate this with a concrete
example
when you go into a cafe and you hand
over your three dollars for a cup of
coffee you are functionally saying that
in that moment you esteem the value of
that cup of coffee more than those three
dollars all of the things being equal
you would prefer to have the coffee than
the three dollars and by the same token

[04:01]
the three dollars and by the same token
the coffee maker would prefer to have
your three dollars than 12 ounces of his
coffee
this is likely due to the fact that you
have more money than coffee and he has
more coffee than money so the differing
marginal utility of the money in the
coffee across the transaction creates
the differing subjective valuations of
the goods involved and what this means
is that both people think they're
getting the better deal
they might say with their mouths that
sounds like a fair trade however
internally each person is motivated to
act because he feels that he would
profit from The Exchange
and there is no profit in a strictly
equal exchange indeed as we've seen
there's actually a loss in that
situation
so inequality is the basis of
transactions and the transaction of
value is the basis of a relationship
where there is no value transacted there
is no relationship however as soon as

[05:00]
is no relationship however as soon as
some value is transacted voila you have
a relationship and this holds true for
romantic relationships no less than it
does for professional relationships
a fair and equal trade of perceived
value is not the basis of a romantic
relationship
it sounds strange but the economic
principle Remains the Same a
relationship only occurs if both people
think they're getting the better deal
and this is possible due to the
subjective perception of value
and the principle of marginal utility
this latter most principle is something
that seems to trip up women especially
successful women in particular
if I'm a rich and successful man
then the marginal utility of your
six-figure income is negligible to me
that is not nearly as valuable to me as
it might be to a guy who is struggling
financially who might not be who you

[06:01]
financially who might not be who you
really want to get into a relationship
with
bringing success and achievement to a
man who already has those things is like
bringing coffee to a cafe instead of
money
they already have enough coffee they
don't want more coffee they want more
money which is something that they have
in scarcer quantities do you understand
your relationship Effectiveness will
improve exponentially if you understand
this concept which is basically an
economic principle economics isn't about
money
it's about how people make decisions and
many of those rules are just as baked
into human neurobiology as the rules of
logic
you work against them at your own risk
what do you think have you seen this to
be true in your own experience let me
know in the comments below and thank you
for listening
