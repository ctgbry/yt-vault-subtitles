many of the women I've spoken to were
uninterested in getting married and
having children in their 20s however
when their priorities shifted in their
30s they often didn't appreciate how
much more difficult it would be to
secure the same offer that they once
received at this stage of the game most
women can't simply sit back and wait for
their meat cute and the men who do show
interest are much more likely to
entertain a casual relationship and a
long-term commitment so what's to be
done in so many words these women need
to get better at sales too often in the
sexual Marketplace women lead with what
they want which if the woman is
attractive enough is a decent strategy
like men will line up to give beautiful
women what they want if they believe it
will improve their chances of securing a
sexual opportunity the issue is that
most women are not attractive enough to
do this but their girlfriends and their
society at large insist that they are
this is not true
