I think I made an episode about this
some years ago there is a pull for
Content creators to do that I don't know
if you've experienced that yourself but
yeah like for example I started psyx and
it took about a year and a half for the
first episode to get any kind of
attention whatsoever sure YouTube's a
hard game then it's tough you know it
was the 97th episode I created and it
went viral several months after it was
published but it's very difficult to
keep I I posted an episode every other
day for about a year and a half and it
was getting three views five likes it
was you know after about a year I was
contending with some measure of
hopelessness in the sense of I had a
dream for this Channel and I was
uncertain as to whether I would be able
to fill it anyway during that time I
definitely felt a pull to do more
extreme things in order to Garner some
kind of attention and there was this
little voice in my head that was
basically like no one no one cares
anyway like you could say whatever the
you wanted and on some level the
internet pulls people to enact more
extreme versions of their personality in
order to attract attention that's the
attraction
