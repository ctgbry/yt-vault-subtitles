it's actually very very difficult to
tell what a woman's bedroom Persona will
be until you get her in the bedroom even
through careful observation of her
public facing Persona it will be
difficult to predict what she's going to
be like behind closed doors there are
girls who seem to be squeaky clean on
the outside like they seem conventional
innocent even pure nice girls but who
are the nastiest freakiest girls
imaginable when the curtains have been
drawn by the same token there are some
women who looked toally wild they're all
tatted up with provocative clothing and
edgy attitudes but who are fairly timid
and conservative when you get them in
the bedroom the upshot is that the
public facing Persona rarely affords
good consistent information with respect
to the bedroom Persona and women I think
often don't adequately appreciate how
difficult it is for most men to navigate
this dichotomy For Better or Worse we
tend to think that how she is out in
public is more or less how she is going
to be in the bedroom
