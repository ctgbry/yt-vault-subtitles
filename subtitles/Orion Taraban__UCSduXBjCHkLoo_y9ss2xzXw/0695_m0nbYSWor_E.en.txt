[00:03]
hi everybody thank you for waiting uh
thank you for joining me today I'm very
excited to have you and to begin this
second live stream ever on this
channel um I want to begin just with
some general
orientations and then we can jump into
your questions which is definitely the
most interesting part of all of these
talks first of all I would like to say
thank you so much for all of your
support thus far the book the value of
others has been out for about a month
now and it's selling very well I think
it's in the top 10 in several different
Amazon categories which is just an
amazing turnout and result for a
self-published non-marketed or
advertised book and that is all due to
your efforts and your support and your
willingness to tell others about your

[01:00]
willingness to tell others about your
experience in the channel and I really
couldn't do it without you and I say
that to you particularly the ones who
are tuning in to this stream because you
are some of my most uh Ardent supporters
and I really appreciate everything that
you've done so far and I hope that we'll
continue to walk together for some time
to come because I have many good things
planned for the
future so uh I want to jump in to this
live stream first I do want to apologize
for um my first attempt I'd never done a
live stream before so I wasn't really
sure about the culture of how things
work and I'm still kind of learning the
uh the bells and whistles um so I didn't
ask for the super chats that are already
starting to come in with the questions
that just seems to be the culture of
these sort of live streams um which I
I'm not really used to so if anybody
asked me a question question that came

[02:00]
asked me a question question that came
with a donation last time and didn't get
an answer that wasn't intentional I I'm
sorry um if that happened and I'll be
more conscientious about that in the
future so um I do want your questions
and I'm going to prioritize questions
that come with the Super Chat donations
because that really helps them to pop
out of the stream of the general chat
and I will do my best to make sure that
they get addressed during this live
stream so if you have a question please
please consider to um submit it in that
way and I'll do my best to get to it
thank you for understanding and your
patience as I'm learning about this
Brave new
technology um so here we are the book's
been out for about a month it's kind of
dense isn't it you know it's over 400
pages long I didn't pull any punches
it's a a bit more intellectual and
Abstract than the content on the YouTube
channel I think that the medium of a
book can support that kind of language

[03:00]
book can support that kind of language
and support that kind of careful
consideration whereas something that you
might just put on YouTube can be
listened to more casually this generally
requires a little bit more attention and
thoughtfulness and may even require a
few different read throughs or listen
throughs um it's not something that was
hastily dashed out this is a book that I
hope will still be relevant 100 years
from now um that's certainly my intent I
don't want to create something that will
be useful for a little bit I want to
create Evergreen content that could
potentially benefit men and women for
many many years to come and uh of course
it's for posterity and all of you to
decide whether or not this book meets
that
standard okay so uh
there's a lot of stuff in the book so
hopefully we have some questions that
are geared towards its content as we
talk about relationship ship the

[04:01]
talk about relationship ship the
attraction the negotiation and the
maintenance phase and intersexual
Dynamics more generally all right let's
get into it we got a few different
questions already marriage causes
divorce one of my oldest fans nice to
see you uh he asks with your value-based
model bro law in hypergamy in mind does
associative mating a five dating a five
make sense or should men who are fives
consider dating women who are
threes okay so there's some terminology
in here that might need to be unpacked
so um rfo laws I think there are three
of them and they talk about sort of
some unconventional views about the
value transaction the heart of
certain sexual relationships for example
one of the laws I'm going to paraphrase
here is that

[05:00]
here is that
uh where a woman cannot derive benefit
no relationship exists for example and
that fits with my model that women tend
to mate and date for game that's
fundamentally the basis of
hypergamy okay
um now associative
dating is
the belief that basically people around
the same level of attraction and Status
End up more or less in relationships
which we kind of see it's like we dare
we we very rarely see a super beautiful
woman with a very ugly man unless he's
very rich you know what I'm saying um
and we certainly don't see the opposite
a very ugly woman with a very handsome
man even if she is Rich so people do
tend to date associatively already the
issue with this question marriage causes
divorce is that it's way too rational
it's way too rational and it doesn't fit
with the realities that we actually see

[06:02]
with the realities that we actually see
when we enter into the sexual
Marketplace namely that even women who
are threes tend to not want men who are
fives um and that's just the way it is
so uh um a man who might be a five just
which is not a bad thing it's like in
the normative scheme of things that's
average five is average that's average
height average income average looks it's
not ugly it's not poor
it's average um and the vast majority of
people are average like if we're using
the normative model of sexual
Marketplace value 68% of all people are
going to be between let's say a three
and a half and a six and a half two out
of three people are going to be in that
range of
attractiveness
um but that doesn't necessarily mean
that women see the distribution of
attractiveness quite the same way that
men do we know from some of the data um

[07:02]
men do we know from some of the data um
data from dating apps that men tend to
have a let's say a more realistic view
of women's
normalized sexual Marketplace value
where where they consider that a few
women are are very unattractive a few
women are extremely attractive and most
women are kind of like average which is
more or less in line with reality when
we examine women's behavior on these
apps though it's very very different
which is that probably
the the bottom 70% of men are just ugly
they're just unattractive and you only
start to see some response in the top
30% and the Lion Share is in the top 10%
so it's like the parto principle is
probably a better way of explaining how
women mate and date Than The Rao model
in my opinion so
um would it make sense for a woman who
is a three to consider a man who is a
five as a potential mate absolutely like

[08:00]
five as a potential mate absolutely like
in the scheme of things that might be
the best that she can do um but you also
have to consider that there might be uh
threshold activation costs associated
with decisions which is that even if it
might be the best that she could get it
still may not be good enough and that
can be bewildering and frustrating for
men but that's just the way it is so
um it's also important for men and women
to understand that it's for the other
side to determine how attractive you are
it's not for men to decide how
attractive they are it's for women and
it's not for women to decide how
attractive they are it's for men in
heterosexual relationships so um this
sort of like objective assignment of
sexual Marketplace value it it often
Falls flat when we engage with the
psychological dimensions of mating
choice that we encounter in reality

[09:01]
choice that we encounter in reality
okay hope I did okay with that my friend
um thank you for your question let's
move down the road okay next question is
D hosen thank you for your donation can
you explain how why by the cow when you
can get the milk for free becomes Why by
the cow if you have to pay for the milk
in today's sexual Marketplace absolutely
so this is something that I discuss in
the book so it used to be the case that
in the sexual Marketplace commitment
preceded
sex and that's where this phrase this
first phrase Why by the cow we can get
the milk for free comes from which is
basically saying that what men might
want sex was traditionally put on the
other side of this pay wall
commitment and if men got what they want
without paying the
fee why would they ever eventually pay
the fee and there's some truth to

[10:01]
the fee and there's some truth to
that however this only makes sense in
the context of a Marketplace in which
milk is generally
sold if everyone around you is selling
milk like you can't even get a taste
without paying for it then any vendor
who's willing to give you milk for free
is like that's a great deal for the
consumer and that person is going to get
as much free milk as possible and then
may bulk at the possibility of paying
for something that he's used to getting
for free like most people suddenly don't
want to start to pay for something that
they've gotten for free like imagine if
you were dating a woman traditionally
and she suddenly wanted to become your
sugar baby it probably wouldn't work
right so it's the same basic principle
the issue is that in today's sexual
Marketplace sex precedes commitment now
whether or not that should be the case
or whether that's good for women or good
for men is irrelevant on some level

[11:00]
for men is irrelevant on some level
because that's the way it is and that's
not going to change anytime soon okay
and so what you have to understand is
that you can't charge for milk if
everyone else around you is giving it
away for
free that doesn't make any sense if
you're in a at Whole Foods and and
there's all of these free samples and
you walk up to one stand and they're
like oh it cost five dollar to taste
this you're gonna be like what the what
are you talking about like
I thought this was a free s there's
there's nothing but free samples all
around here you want to charge for a
taste it's like that's going to be
bewildering and strange and it's not
going to work because people have gotten
used to the free sample they've gotten
used to the taste of milk before buying
so you have to understand that the model
has changed it's like the way that
mating and dating works today is kind of
like a subscription streaming service
like Netflix
how does Netflix get memberships it

[12:02]
how does Netflix get memberships it
certainly doesn't saywell you can't even
see my shows until you buy a
membership like that's not gonna [ __ ]
work like good luck with that no what
Netflix does which is really [ __ ]
smart of Netflix is it makes it very
easy to access its content it says you
have a free trial unlimit you know
there's no restriction on this free
trial enjoy all of our fantastic shows
and movies all for you three months
totally free no strings attached okay
and then ideally after you've started to
engage with the content after you've
gotten emotionally involved in one of
these series after you've started to to
like and value this service then they
hit you with the pay
wall and the reason why Netflix kind of
has to do this even though it was
probably the first is that that's how
Hulu does it and that's how peacock does
it and that's how h B Max does it I'm

[13:00]
it and that's how h B Max does it I'm
surprised I know all these streaming
services it's like that's how everyone
does it it's like if all the other
streaming services offer these free
trials you couldn't put your content
behind a pay wall up front it wouldn't
work you would not be competitive in
that Marketplace the same thing is
happening here so what you have to
understand is milk is given away freely
so you can't charge for milk anymore so
now if I have to pay for the milk and I
have to pay for the cow that's more
expensive than just buying the cow in
which case I would assume the milk is
free now I have to pie the milk and the
cow that's too expensive in the context
of my available optionality in the
sexual
Marketplace okay hopefully that makes
sense that's the best I can do with that
one all right let's keep it
moving thank you for your question Ace
7x thank you for your donation Orion
your book is even better than your
phenomenal vids thank you I am
susceptible to flattery excellent work
found you through fnf good guys like

[14:00]
found you through fnf good guys like
myON and Walter offer still stands come
out to Vegas and I'll set you up with
the baddest nastiest [ __ ] you've ever
met in your
life well thank you for the invitation
Ace so a lot of people don't know this
but I'm actually from Las Vegas like I'm
a native I was born and raised I lived
in Las Vegas for 15 years and I think
among other things that's one of the
reasons why I kind of have a
non-judgmental attitude towards a lot of
the things that I saw there like I grew
up within walking distance of the strip
I grew up seeing Street Walkers I grew
up seeing alcohol and drugs and gambling
it was just a natural part of life like
I didn't know anything outside of that
world because children just accept the
reality with which they're
given and I just accept the fact that
people do these things people use
prostitutes and people gamble and people
drink and people use drugs and people
eat too much and they want Fine Food and

[15:01]
eat too much and they want Fine Food and
they want the nice hotels and the
entertainment like there's a reason why
Vegas isn't running out of money anytime
soon
um and I think that's helped me like and
I don't do any all those things like I'm
not a I I very rarely gamble I I don't
use escorts uh I don't use drugs I mean
it's like just because you grow up
around that it doesn't mean that you
just think that it's okay and good
either you know in fact on some level it
could take some of the Mystique and the
energy out of it I heard somebody once
say that one of the reasons why
Americans have bigger problems with
alcoholism is because the drinking age
is 21 whereas the drinking age in Europe
is 18 and they even begin to introduce
children to the culture of drinking wine
at dinner even earlier than that and so
they don't end up with these like this
attitude of binging like I have to

[16:00]
attitude of binging like I have to
finally have so much of something that
was forbidden and disallowed and taboo
for so long which just makes it even
more attractive and seductive and there
might be some truth to that
so I'm just saying this a because I I
appreciate where the imitation is coming
from Vegas doesn't have that Allure for
me anymore like I've grown up around
that stuff I've certainly been back with
my guy friends as an adult and I've gone
to Bachelor parties and I've done the
things that I've done and um I don't
know I like to go to Vegas these days I
like to go to the Michelin star
restaurants and uh the shows and I kind
of like the bougie uh Escape uh which
Vegas does very well one of the culinary
destinations destinations of the world
these days so uh thank you for the
invitation okay next San meet s thank
you for your donation
question is it not sufficient to build
ship

[17:00]
ship
as a captain one should learn seduction
and frame
management oh it is not sufficient to
build ship as a captain one should learn
seduction and frame management
yes I say that that's part of learning
to sale it's one of the skill sets that
men have to cultivate to successfully
navigate the high seas in this case the
sexual Marketplace seduction and frame
management how can we build these skills
any supplement resources from your
Channel or
otherwise
H yeah it's
tough because neither one of these
things can really be
scripted there was a famous book written
BYL Von klitz I think that's his name
who was a very famous Prussian military
General who wrote wrote a textbook on
war strategy in the 19th century and he
basically starts his book by saying I
can't tell you how to win a war because

[18:01]
can't tell you how to win a war because
as soon as I tell you what how to do it
like a successful creative General will
find a way to beat that so I can't write
down how to do it because as soon as I
write it down people will find ways to
counteract that so I can only give you
kind of general
principles that always have
exceptions so that's not very satisfying
but I think that's a true answer I know
more about seduction and frame than I do
about war but I do know that you can't
just like you can't win every battle
using the same strategy you can't seduce
Every Woman using the same tactics like
that doesn't make
sense the essence of Seduction is the
ability to direct attention towards a
sexual
goal attraction is the ability to direct
attention period like to attract
attention is just to be able to command
eyeballs to make sure that people are
focused on you and not something else
and you can do that in a variety of

[19:00]
and you can do that in a variety of
different
ways seduction is the use of Attraction
towards a sexual end okay one of the
best ways to do that is to learn how to
listen that's why I have that whole
chapter in the book on the game of
please no people will tell you how they
want to say yes if you listen very
carefully to how they say no to
understand that no is just information
and the information is you haven't yet
unlocked the yes and to learn that
certain women will be unlocked with
playfulness other women will be unlocked
with uh disinterest some women will be
unlocked with aggressiveness some women
will be unlocked with uh you know very
easygoing soft touch it's sort of like
being a Salesman in fact that's probably
one of the best ways to learn how to
seduce women is to be a Salesman whether
you have to call people on the phone or
you're selling cars or something like
that because what happens is somebody
walks into your

[20:00]
walks into your
dealership you have to figure out like
who is this person what do they need
like is this going to be somebody who
has already kind of made up his mind and
just wants to hand over the money ready
and I should just stay out of his way is
this somebody who doesn't really know
anything about cars doesn't even know
what she might want and needs a lot of
education and help in the
decision-making
process and you can observe the person
as they walk in and make some calculated
assessments as to kind of where they are
in the spectum
and then you send out your opening foray
and based on how they respond to you you
know if you're on the right track or not
and if you're not on the right track how
they turn you
down or how they are disinterested in
your offer might give you a clue as to
what they are really looking for in the
interaction from you so that actually
might be a really great way to learn
seduction is is to get into sales um
frame
management frame management is um one
second

[21:02]
second
turn Okay frame management is
um what might help you with that uh
probably like running a
business uh as an entrepreneur where you
have to kind of like start from scratch
and figure out everything the issue with
being an employee which is what most
people do is everything is kind of taken
care of for you you can just show up
there's even like a death
waiting for you on your first day and
you already have something to work on as
soon as you sit down it's like as an
entrepreneur you don't have a desk you
have to build a desk you don't have
something to work on you got to figure
that out and once you have like the
mission once you understand the
operation of your business then you can
learn like what's good for the business
and what's not good for the business and
understand like okay that's not a good
idea for the business like I understand
that you think it might be a good idea

[22:00]
that you think it might be a good idea
but I actually built the business I know
how it runs I know how it functions I
know how it thrives that's not going to
work maybe because I've even tried it in
the past and it's I have that knowledge
through painful experience right so I
would say that those are probably the
two best ways to learn those things
seduction is sales and freay management
is being an
entrepreneur um other resources yeah I
think one of the best YouTube resource
for seduction is the naturals
Lifestyles uh they have a YouTube
channel I think they have a few hundred
thousand subscribers at this point I had
one of their coaches Alex Leon on my
channel a while back I think that they
tend to give a lot of practical
non-creepy advice on how to approach
women and how to escalate things on a
date and in the bedroom so uh I really
enjoy their content they're not paying
me to say this I would encourage you to
check them out if you'd like to learn
more about that thank you for your

[23:01]
more about that thank you for your
question okay moving forward Voodoo 2130
good day Orion good day I guess that a
dollar is Australian dollar so I should
say good day good day Orion I want to
become a marriage counselor okay I know
you once mentioned that relationship
counseling does not have a high
probability of success correct how can I
apply the content of the book into
marriage counseling in the future that
is an excellent
question so sometimes people come to me
and they want to do consultations as a
couple and I have turned them
down it's something that I'm not very
good at like as a therapist as a
consultant I find that it's hard enough
to tell the person that you're talking
to the person who actually comes to you
for help the truth in a way that he or
she can hear it and it's next to
impossible to tell
that in such a way to two people that
they can hear it simultaneously it's

[24:00]
they can hear it simultaneously it's
very very hard so maybe you need to have
more advanced communication skills than
I currently have um which people
certainly can
cultivate what I
would what what I would counsel you on
is that it's helpful to be really
pragmatic about what
relationships like how what actually
causes relationships to work and to
thrive between men and women
and I just rifted an episode on this
before this call on um that gives an
interpretation of the epilogue from the
book so for those of you who haven't
read the book yet the book is bookended
by a parable on both ends there's the
prologue and there's the epilog and
there's a prologue in the epilogue
called the coin of Caesar which is a
story from the Bible where basically
Jesus is walking in the marketplace and
some Pharisees come up to him and start
complaining about why they have to pay
taxes to the Caesar like isn't that

[25:01]
taxes to the Caesar like isn't that
unfair isn't it unjust isn't it an
exploitation of power isn't it a way of
honoring a secular sense of authority
which is a form of idolatry like
shouldn't we not have to pay taxes to
Caesar and Jesus basically says give me
one of the coins that you pay your taxes
with and they do and he says whose
picture is on this coin and they say
Caesars and Jesus says Render unto
Caesar what is Caesars and unto God what
is gods
okay so there's many different ways to
interpret this Parable I'm not going to
give it to you all on a silver platter
but here's one of them which is you have
to give people what they need and want
like men have a coin that they want to
receive from women and it's not for
women to decide what that coin is it's
for men to decide what they want to
receive Caesar put his picture on what
he wants in return you know what I'm
saying it's not for the villagers and
the and the citizens to decide how they

[26:01]
the and the citizens to decide how they
pay their taxes it's for Caesar to
decide how they pay the taxes you pay it
in this [ __ ] that has my picture on
it you know you can't be putting his
picture on a banana and saying can I can
I pay with this like it has your picture
on it like you put his picture on it
Caesar put his picture on what he wants
so men have things that they want from
women and sometimes women are subject to
thinking oh well I I don't think I
should have to pay that like or that's
disgusting or degrading and or and she
he should be satisfied with this instead
it's like no that's [ __ ] it's like
that's not going to fly in the court of
Caesar you know it's for Caesar to
decide how Caesar wants to be paid and
vice versa for the other way around is
guys might roll their eyes be like man I
shouldn't have to do this [ __ ] for a
woman it's like a so much [ __ ] work
it's so expense it's like yeah but it's
for the women to decide the coin in
which they want to be paid and the
problem comes in so many relationships
where the men give the women what the

[27:00]
where the men give the women what the
men
want and the women give the men what the
women
want that does not [ __ ] work men
should give women what women want and
women should give men what men want and
the more that you can give people what
they want and less of what they don't
the smoother and more satisfying your
relationship becomes it's not that
simple like I talked it is that simple
it's not that hard I talked about this
on um soft white underbelly with James
ston it's like I eat food but I put gas
in my car my car does not eat burgers
and I don't eat gas it's like you have
to give the thing what the thing needs
to survive to thrive and if you don't do
that then what's going to happen is
somebody feels like they're getting less
and they're paying more which is always
the recipe marital or relationship

[28:00]
the recipe marital or relationship
dissatisfaction someone thinks they're
overpaying which means they're under
receiving and what does that lead to
withdrawal
bickering competitiveness and
argumentativeness
cheating it it leads to all the nasty
things now I'm not saying that if you
always just give people what they want
you will never run into those problems
no some people are really [ __ ]
difficult and no matter what you do
they're never going to be satisfied
however you will avoid a lot of those
problems if you give people what they
want and don't give them what they don't
and approaching it from that perspective
as opposed to well we have to understand
each other or we have to communicate
better or we have to respect our
feelings like no you don't you have to
give people more of what they want and
less of what they don't that's how I
would counsel a future marriage
counselor all
right good
thank you for your question next up is

[29:02]
thank you for your question next up is
Kyle lipkey thank you for your
question does your book give you Insight
on knowing if a woman would be capable
of betraying you taking your house
stealing I don't know if she's a bad
woman they could be sweet at first and
then change what signs to look for okay
yeah that is a it's a good question
so there are some bad women out there
just like there are some bad
men and I would say that people tend to
tell on themselves fairly early on in
the
relationship and the reason why people
move forward with relationships even
though there might be red flags early on
in the courtship
process is because they are very
attracted to the person and they've
decided to already choose this person
they've decided to already choose to
emotionally invest I want this woman to

[30:00]
emotionally invest I want this woman to
be my wife I want this man to be my
husband or boyfriend or girlfriend
whatever they've put their emotional
decision ahead of the facts and because
they've decided to do that it's very
easy them for them to minimize or
rationalize the concerning or bad
behavior that in retrospect seems all
too obvious so people are definitely
complicit in their own self-deception
when they get involved with dangerous or
toxic men or women okay and let's also
be real is that
secure high functioning people generally
don't fall prey to toxic men or
women like and I'm not saying this to
victim blame I'm saying this to help you
to take to keep yourself safe moving
forward it's like there might have been
ways in which you were vulnerable to a
certain toxic woman's child arms maybe
you were lonely maybe you had low

[31:01]
you were lonely maybe you had low
self-esteem maybe you were going through
a tough time maybe you were
isolated do you understand and like to
the extent that you might be those
things you might be even more vulnerable
to let's say love bombing a sense of
affection that maybe you've never
experienced before from a
woman do you understand that may not be
uh a sign of a normal secure functioning
woman but could have been a bomb to
whatever wound that might have been
expressed in the beginning of that
relationship
so there are ways of seeing that with
women with respect to betrayal I would
say
that uh you catch her in
lies her story doesn't add up you know
she says she's one place but she
actually might be somewhere
else um
she sometimes even brags about things

[32:01]
she sometimes even brags about things
that she's gotten away with in the past
as if it shows how clever or cunning or
intelligent she
is uh she has a lack of accountability
or self- responsibility uh all of her
bad behavior is Justified because the
people that she did it to were even
worse than she was like those are bad
signs those are signs that she might be
a liability not even further down the
line but sooner as opposed to
later but there's one more thing I want
to talk to on this subject is that it's
not just bad women who are capable of
taking your
house so the issue and why we see so
much divorce in today's day and age is
at least in part due to the incentives
involved
like if I joined a firm as an employee
and as a consequence of that

[33:01]
and as a consequence of that
hiring I could quit at any time for any
reason and still get half of my
salary and it still wouldn't even
prevent me from getting another
job why wouldn't I do that you know it's
like I might swear up and down when I
first get hired that I would never do
that because I have a good work ethic
and I believe in an stays work and I
might truly [ __ ] believe that when I
first get hired but maybe after 20 years
the sheen of being an employee has worn
off I might be disappointed and
disillusioned by the bureaucracy of the
organization I might be exhausted and
burnt out and now this Prospect might be
a little bit more attractive to me and
it becomes harder and harder over time
to not take what is being held out to

[34:03]
to not take what is being held out to
me that I think is more responsible
for divorce especially since we know
that women initiate the line share of
divorces then the fact that there's a
bunch of really toxic deceitful women
who are just trying to take a man for
everything that he's worth I think that
just that the incentives that we set up
just become harder and harder to
resist as time goes on okay that's what
I'll say to
that thank you for your question okay
Kina Canadian 50 I don't know what that
is is that like 10
bucks just kidding most women I've met
who were girlfriend material were too
emotionally immature almost like
children the only way it could work is
if I coach them on the basics I.E your
thesis should I be patient and Coach
them frustrating but I don't want to
breaking
up

[35:03]
um you know it's like pick your
hard there's pros and cons to the
situation my dude like if you can meet
young women who might be immature now
who might not know the basics now but
who are
coachable then with effort and time you
might be able to mold them into very
good girlfriend that you can have a
satisfying relationship with now you
might think well shouldn't I just be
able to expect a woman to show up in
that way and I'm like not necessarily my
dude because the flip side of that is
you could date someone who's a little
bit older who might have some emotional
maturity to her who certainly might be
beyond the basics might even be fairly
Advanced but a woman like that she's
like a puzzle piece with really
interesting edges like it it becomes
harder and harder for her to fit into
your life and it will require more

[36:01]
your life and it will require more
negotiated sacrifices to do so on the
whole so that can be hard as
well so I think it's just choosing the
kind of hard that works better for
you um the the real issue is whether
they're coachable and a woman who is
coachable is in my opinion worth keeping
on if there's enough
there to justify the attraction and the
investment yeah that's what I got for
you on that
one okay here we go the dreamer's
path he Orion probably hey big fan any
pointers for a 20-year-old who struggled
in platonic romantic relationships due
to avoidant and emotionally unav
Tendencies
aha yeah
I do have some advice because I have

[37:01]
I do have some advice because I have
definitely been on the avoidant
Spectrum I think right now I'm pretty
much on the the border between avoidant
and
secure and I do think I'm capable of
secure healthy long-term attachment but
it's taken a lot of work and healing to
get there I was certainly far more
avoidant when I was your
age and so that's the first thing is you
have to understand that an avoidant
attachment style is a defense
mechanism and it could it's often a
defense against a chaotic or an
intrusive and Boundary violating parent
if you're a man it's usually the mother
it's like a mother who
doesn't respect appropriate boundaries
and whose emotions are used to kind of
like get into a a a child or who sees
the child as a narcissistic extension of
her there's many different ways that
this could happen
but like one of the defenses that a

[38:00]
but like one of the defenses that a
child has at his disposal because he
can't leave he can't survive on his own
is just to sort of like withdraw and
become into himself and become
increasingly emotionally inaccessible
because as long as his emotions are
accessible by that potentially
manipulative or narcissistic
or violating parent the more he's going
to suffer as a result so this is a form
of suffering but it might be suffering
than being emotionally available and
being manipulated by the violating
parent so that's generally where that
comes
from now to the extent that that's true
you have to understand that that's
probably the best that you could do when
you were a
kid and it served its
function and you're no longer a kid
anymore you're 20 years old and you're
out of that house I I would think or I
hope if you're not out of the house you
should get out of that house house
because it's you're probably not going
to heal inside of that

[39:02]
to heal inside of that
Dynamic and it's like you can take the
kid out of the house but you can't take
the house out of the kid and so part of
this is understanding that it's not bad
or wrong to be more avoidant that that
was a good thing it kept you
safe it kept you safer than otherwise
anyway and it served its purpose and it
served as function emphasis on the past
tense and that you may no longer need
need to be as avoidant as you once did
to survive emotionally that just because
you encountered that in the past doesn't
necessarily mean that you will continue
to encounter it in the present and the
future and you begin to heal the wound
associated with
that and you can do that through therapy
you can do that through psychedelics you
can do that through introspection you
can do that in a in a close like
confidential relationship with someone
you trust a father a mentor a priest

[40:01]
um and one of the things that comes up
for avoidance is also that uh if you
share some of your own emotional
experience which is a way of saying that
you're emotionally
available that that emotional
information will be used against you
that you will be mocked or taunted for
your
interests that your vulnerabilities will
be weaponized and used against you at
some future
time and or that a woman when she finds
out how you really are what you really
think and how you really feel will be
disgusted or disinterested or leave as a
consequence and so it's probably not for
the best that you keep all that stuff
bottled up but in at least in your
imagination it's better than the
imagined consequence of not keeping it
bottled up I.E losing the relationship
and suffering humil or disrespect or
even emo

[41:01]
even emo
abuse so the the the way to heal that in
tandem is to is to begin to take
calculated risks which is where it's
appropriate to begin to to open up like
to begin to become a little bit more
emotionally available with people that
you
trust it's like start with the bunny
slopes first start with people that you
have good trusting long-term secure
relationships with
and use them for practice like start to
share a little bit more of how you
really think and how you really feel you
don't have to go right to your deep dark
secrets or are the most controversial
takes that you have just start with
sharing maybe what you like or or what
makes you interested or what you are
kind of annoyed by like those are kind
of low stakes thing and of course see
how they respond so a person who is safe
won't mock you won't think that that's
weird won't shut down won't attack you
will kind of like even if they disagree

[42:01]
will kind of like even if they disagree
with you they'll respect that okay
that's what you like and that's what you
think and that's who you are and the
more of those interactions you have the
more you'll realize wow okay
so the whole world isn't
unsafe certainly the whole world isn't
safe but the whole world isn't unsafe
either and um I think that's the the
slow process which is a behavioral
solution that kind of got
me into Security in terms of attachment
Styles good question hopefully that
answers
it
okay all right next question these are
great questions guys keep them coming ad
thank you for your donation I'm
32m and successful but I'm still a total
lover boy all right I just like to love
on women and can't help but get super
excited with them but it inevitably

[43:01]
excited with them but it inevitably
turns them off oh I see what you mean
it's not like you're a player it's like
you're romantic got it pretending not to
be feels inauthentic to me any advice
yeah yeah I know what this is like dude
because I've said this before that I'm a
romantic in recovery I used to be very
very romantic because what's not to like
I mean the women they're so they can be
so beautiful and they smell so good good
and they're so pretty and oh my they
have this aura about them like there's
an Impulse inside I think a lot of men
that wants to adore femininity and the
women in which they find those
qualities and it can feel really good to
surrender to that
impulse however I've discovered in my
own personal experience and in my
clinical practice that that's not very
conducive to relationship success women
and I talk about that a lot in the book
on the balance of Attraction is that

[44:02]
on the balance of Attraction is that
when you're the romantic adorer it
forces the woman in the adored role like
she's up here on the pedestal you're
down here and women they generally don't
want to be there up there because being
the adored is associated with a
diminished emotional experience and most
women come to relationships to feel and
they want to feel excited and thrilled
and in love and happy and they they
can't really feel those things when the
men are prostrating at their feet so it
doesn't
work so I had to be real with myself my
dude and being real with myself was
basically like which
pain do I
prefer because to feel that
impulse to adore the women and to not
act on it to holster it to repress it

[45:00]
act on it to holster it to repress it
will be painful it will feel inauthentic
at least for a while because and it will
feel difficult to do and uncomfortable
because there's really nothing more
uncomfortable than feeling an impulse
and not acting on
it so that's a form of
pain that
said if I refuse to holster that impulse
it looks like I'm going to continue to
feel the pain of dissatisfying
relationships separation and
heartbreak which is absolutely painful
for sure and I had experienced that pain
many many times like I knew for sure
that that road led to that
destination and there was a chance that
this other form of pain which is
holstering the impulse to adore while
painful might actually lead to a more
satisfying conclusion I.E functional
long-term state
relationship and I decided actually

[46:00]
relationship and I decided actually
around your age that I would prefer this
kind of
pain like I I am willing
to feel the pain of that suffocated
impulse in the service of a functional
healthy thriving
relationship and that's why I talk about
in the book how it's often the case that
men have to make a voluntary
sacrifice of their desire to be Ador
so that the relationship can
work this isn't a theory this comes out
of personal and professional
experience and it gets
easier just like
restraining any impulse becomes easier
with
practice now you might not like yourself
as much you might like the version of
yourself that's the lover boy and the
romantic and adoring on women
but that person might not get what he

[47:01]
but that person might not get what he
wants and so you kind of might have to
choose like do I want to get what I
want or do I would I rather be the
person that I want to
be and it's not for me to decide my dude
for you I told you how I decided after
many years of
pain and I can tell you personally it's
one of the best decisions I've ever
made so take that for what it's worth
okay Thunder Drake 13 thank you for your
donation here we go hi Orion do you have
any advice to deal with guilt and shame
sure do I find after an interaction I
carry guilt cringe and beat myself up I
think we've all been there as someone
who wants to be a good communicator it's
emotionally exhausting any
wreck
yes I have several and I'll try to keep
this brief first of all you have to
understand that whatever interaction has

[48:00]
understand that whatever interaction has
made you feel guilty or
cringeworthy the other person has
forgotten about it already like I
guarantee you it's way more important
and prevalent in your memory than in the
person that you're interacting with they
just registered it as a little bit
awkward or off and then they moved on
with their day so they didn't carry it
further past the point of interaction
neither do
you there's this old
parable of two Zen monks who were
walking through the forest one day and
these monks had taken vows of chity like
they weren't even allowed to interact
with let alone touch
women and as they're walking through the
forest they come across a woman who has
been stranded on the shores of a swollen
river that has got
too big from recent RS and she needs to

[49:00]
too big from recent RS and she needs to
cross the other side but there's no
bridge and she's concerned about getting
swept away because the water is running
so high so one of the
monks picks her up throws her over her
shoulder his shoulder and walks across
the
river and then puts her down on the
other
side the woman says thank you leaves and
the two monks walk on and about 2 hours
later the second monk
says you know man you really you
shouldn't have done that we're not we're
not supposed to be touching girls you
know that was a huge
violation and the first monk says I put
that woman down five miles ago why are
you still carrying
her and I think this is useful and it's
definitely useful in the Zen tradition
which is about being in the present
moment it's like that was five miles ago
why are you still carrying that woman
you don't have to like Let It
Go try to be as much as possible in the

[50:01]
Go try to be as much as possible in the
present moment and anything that can
reorient you to the present moment is
helpful and tactics to reorient you to
the present moment are usually grounding
techniques and based in your senses
Because unless you're psychotic your
senses are already always connected to
the here and now just if you're having
trouble let go of the past and you want
to be present just see what your eyes
are seeing hear what your eyes are
hearing touch what your skin is touching
and like reground yourself to the here
and now as much as you can okay and that
will help you shake it
off with respect to guilt and shame um
I'll be brief because there's a bunch of
questions left I made an episode
called emotions are never irrational and
I would encourage you to check that out
if you haven't done so already and it's
true no emotion is irrational because
emotions can't be rational or irrational
only thinking reason can be rational or
irrational emotions aren't subject to

[51:00]
irrational emotions aren't subject to
that same
Criterion and behind every emotion is a
thought there's some sort of stimulating
cognition that incites or elicits or
inflames that emotional
response and once you have the emotion
it's valid like if you're scared you're
scared it's valid that you're scared
okay but it's not always
Justified like people can be scared for
justifiable reasons like there's an
actual threat to their
livelihood and for unjustifiable reasons
something that isn't really a threat or
could even be harmless the fear could
still be real in the second case but the
fear is not justified because there
really is no threat do you understand
and so the way to get rid of emotions
that you don't want to experience is
sometimes to subject them to what I call
justifiability
protocols to see if there's a rational
basis for feeling the way that you feel
now for Guilt which is the emotion that

[52:00]
now for Guilt which is the emotion that
I examined in that video the rational
basis the justifiable reason to feel
guilty is that you have violated your
own moral or ethical code which
basically means that you did something
you said you weren't going to do or you
didn't do something that you said you
were going to do and so you didn't live
up to your word and you're not living in
alignment with your values and your
beliefs okay not that you're not living
in line with somebody else else's values
or beliefs which happens all the time
but you don't have to feel guilty
because those aren't your
values you someone might be disappointed
but did you sign up for that expectation
like maybe they disappointed themselves
for no good reason so that's when I feel
guilty I walk my through myself through
that protocol it's like okay in this
case this person clearly is unhappy with
me okay however is that justified like
did I break my word did I say I was
going to do something I said I wasn't

[53:01]
going to do something I said I wasn't
going to do did I forget
or didn't do something I said I was
going to do if so my guilt is Justified
and I should
probably apologize and make amends
because I [ __ ] up on the other hand if
someone is unhappy with me because I
didn't do what he or she wanted me to do
but I never made a commitment to do that
my guilt is not
justified and the way to get rid of that
is to act in the opposite manner so if
the if acting in alignment with guilt
means that you apologize and make
amends I'm not gonna apologize in this
case and I'm even gonna like double down
and be like you know what I'm don't I
didn't do anything wrong I understand
that you don't like what I did or that
you disagree with it or you disapprove
of it that's your right but like I'm I'm
at peace with my decision and you don't
hide and you don't cringe and you own it
and sometimes
when another person sees that you don't

[54:00]
when another person sees that you don't
feel guilty about whatever you did or
didn't do it causes them to reexamine
their own expectations for this
interaction it's like oh well maybe I do
have
some irrational or unjustified
expectations for this person's Behavior
not always but it can happen anyway
that's what I got for you good
questions make sure I'm getting to
everything here
Ruben Mendes just tip me dude no
question just straight cash what a what
a what a guy uh Ruben I appreciate your
support man if you do have a question
let me
know uh next
question Don Lee sorry if I got the
pronunciation wrong when should men
settle you mentioned that men should
settle in their late 30s when they are
established did I does this not run the
risk of good young women not finding us
attractive if we do not become

[55:01]
attractive if we do not become
attractive successful
enough yes you certainly run the risk at
any age of any kind of woman not finding
you attractive enough that will never
change no man is attractive to all women
that's just the way it is now I don't
recall saying that I believe that men
should settle in their late 30s I do say
that men often don't become husband
material until their mid to late 30s and
so therefore I recommend that men hold
off making any kind of serious
life-changing long-term commitments to a
woman until they're at least 35 as that
gives them a chance to be established to
develop themselves to become successful
because that will give them good
optionality and have a high amount of

[56:00]
optionality and have a high amount of
value with which to trade for better
options in the sexual Marketplace a lot
of men never get to experience that
optionality because they foreclose which
is that they make a decision too
soon okay
so that's what I said it's like the more
that you it's just like the basis of
relationships according to the book is
the transaction of equal Goods of
comparable value if you want a lot you
have to be prepared to give a lot so the
more a man has to
give and he has to be prepared to give
what the other side wants remember it's
the coin of the
realm he can get more of what he wants
which generally makes him more happy and
satisfied in whatever relationship he
ends up with not always but
generally but your first question of
when should men settle is it's kind of
unavoidable the uh the fact of the
matter is is that everybody settles men

[57:00]
matter is is that everybody settles men
and
women when they decide to actually make
a go of it in a real adult
relationship no one gets everything that
they
want that's just the way it
is however if you're are gonna have this
person in your life and not anybody else
you should be
getting a lot of what you want certainly
most of what you
want and the more options you have the
pickier and pickier that you can be with
any given option that you're dealing
with but it's for each person to decide
like what's that line what's the
acceptable like I'm not getting this
thing um because there's always going to
be something there's always going to be
something less than ideal about the
actual man or woman that you're dealing
with however what justifies choosing
them regardless is that you're getting

[58:01]
them regardless is that you're getting
most of what you want and that you
believe that this person has the skills
attributes and qualities that will help
you to fulfill whatever Mission you want
for this
relationship okay hopefully that made
sense okay want to make sure I'm not
skipping everything Highway man oh
wait okay no
sorry about
that
okay all right do a few more questions
here don't want to run over long and
overstay my welcome Tommy tsunami 68
thank you for your donation need your
help Dr T I'm married 27 years and sex
life with wife is crap for years sorry
to hear that my brother my libido is
high so this is a serious problem but my
wife said it's my problem and that I
need more

[59:01]
self-control well
now there's a few different ways that we
can take this the traditional view of
let's say Christian
marriage is
yeah and I talk about this in chapter 12
of the book is that the institution of
marriage is restrictive and frustrating
by Design because it's intention is to
help people self
transcend your wife's not having sex
with you great it gives you an
opportunity to examine your attachment
to lust and to learn how to love in a
purer and more wholesome fashion like
that would be a traditional Christian
response to this marital
problem and that's one way to look at it
I don't think it's the only way to look
at it here's another way of looking at
it
you presumably signed up for

[1:00:00]
you presumably signed up for
monogamy monogamy means you have sex
with one person that's the mono part in
monogamy if your wife is not and and
your wife has decided that she will be
your monopolized one monopolized sex
dealer that's the exclusive monogamy you
can't go anywhere
else but you agreed to that because you
could get sex there with that one
partner like that's the one place where
you can do
business now you signed up for monogamy
presumably you did not sign up for
celibacy that sex with zero people
that's not
monogamy so this is a bit of an
unconventional take but I would
say enforced celibacy in an exclusive
relationship is as much a form of
cheating and a violation of
monogamy as is going outside of the

[1:01:02]
monogamy as is going outside of the
relationship with another partner in
both cases it's someone not having sex
with one person in the first case it's
having sex with zero persons and the
second case is having sex with two
people two people and both of those are
violations of monogamy in my
opinion
so to my mind that leaves the door open
it's like think about most
contracts like the contract that you
have at work there's all these different
Clauses and all these different chapters
Etc and generally near the end there's
this Cil called
severability which basically means that
if there's some sort of violation of the
contract of one of the terms this
contract it doesn't mean the whole
contract is void and null but it does
mean that that Clause is V null and void
do you understand it doesn't mean that
everything else gets thrown out the
window because we can take that and we

[1:02:00]
window because we can take that and we
can sever it from the rest of the
agreement but absolutely that Clause is
is
void and so that's one way to look at
this situation which is that your wife's
consistent and persistent refusal to be
your monogamous sex partner has violated
that term of your exclusive monogamous
relationship
and so that's null and void like you're
not in a monogamous relationship anymore
that doesn't mean that the whole
marriage has to fall apart but you're
not in a monogamous relationship anymore
and you might not have been one for many
many years so you don't have to act like
you're in a monogamous relationship
anymore but you might still keep the
rest of the arrangement in the marriage
together because that is severable from
the rest of the
contract kind of a hot take but that's
what I got for you okay let's let's just
do a few more so please no more um no

[1:03:00]
do a few more so please no more um no
more donations because I want to be sure
to get to
everybody Okay Kevin W looks like you
just sent along some cash man thank you
appreciate your support if you did have
a question let me know
brother next up is Charles
D discussing economic model of
relationships with friends they often
don't care
I guess this will be the same in future
relationships is that we're trying to
find or educate a woman of this view or
does it not
matter I don't think it
matters I don't think it's necessary for
a woman to consciously understand these
principles in order to have a successful
relationship with her you definitely
don't have to
communicate with words that said it
might be very important for you to
understand these principles and to act
act in line with them with your
behavior and if you do that if you act

[1:04:03]
behavior and if you do that if you act
in line with the understanding that
relationships are
transactional and that they Thrive when
people get a lot of what they want not a
lot of what they don't and unequal
exchange of comparable value etc etc if
you if you act in line with that but you
don't talk about it you're going to have
success in your relationships it's not
necessary for even both parties to be
consciously aware of this model if they
were to somehow just organically act in
line with it they would
Thrive so uh I would like the most to be
honest like probably the most effective
successful method is to think the
economic model and to speak the Romantic
[ __ ] like if you actually really
want to be successful with women in
relationships that would work the best
I'm not saying it has a high degree of
Integrity to say one thing and really

[1:05:01]
Integrity to say one thing and really
think or believe something else but it
will
work because your behavior will be in
line with what actually makes
relationships work what actually makes
the plane fly but your words will cover
over the harsh realities of some of that
understanding so think what think in
line with reality but speak what other
people want to hear and you'll be
[ __ ]
Unstoppable uh Emil
shum probably [ __ ] that up but thank you
for your little lemon Emoji the guy
seems very naked and very happy to be
here so thank you for your
support okay couple more Highway man oh
here's your question great I love the
book thank you sir it succeeds in the
difficult task of being both well argued
and ambitious thank you
I'm happy that you've become part of the
public discussion thanks man I hope so

[1:06:00]
public discussion thanks man I hope so
like I have an episode coming out soon
called write your own invitation where I
talk about some of my motivations for
starting psyx like my personal
motivations and one of them was to have
a seat at the table like three some
years ago I was just a guy who had some
ideas about how relationships worked and
you know I was a therapist and a
psychologist and I had my professional
experiences and whatnot but I'd hear
these people talking out in the public
discourse and I
thought I could I could talk about that
like I could have a discussion with that
person or I could hold my own in that
debate and I'd like to be able to have a
seat at that table and so what was
necessary for that to occur is I needed
to write my own invitation because no
one was going to invite me a private
nobody into that
discussion and so pyx was in part a way
of writing that invitation for myself

[1:07:00]
of writing that invitation for myself
and I'm happy to say that it's starting
to work and I am getting invited to talk
to people and to have interesting
conversations on subjects that I care
about which is [ __ ] fantastic like
it's a it's great that it works and is
working and I do hope to be part more of
the public discussion moving forward if
people will have
me okay looks like we got a couple
more William Newell on 100 bucks okay
William gets like the top dog award for
the biggest donation thank you sir I
don't see a question am I just missing
something all right man well thank you
so much for your donation if you did
have a question let me
know okay this guy just became a
psychonaut okay great Blackbeard 10
pound thank you for the quid I'll go
down to the
PO that was
terrible um and now I think we are at

[1:08:00]
terrible um and now I think we are at
the end
of the paid questions so thank you so
much I hope I didn't miss anybody and I
learned my
lessons I think this is a good natural
place to wrap things up um let's
recap the book is out it's been out for
a month it's dense it's difficult at
times I do think it's worth the effort
it might need a couple of read throughs
or listen throughs and I don't think
that the principles that it discusses
are going anywhere anytime soon so I do
think that these
are uh if not like the fundamental Truth
at at least in some
sense more Universal than some of the
things that we're talking about and
dealing with in the current cultural
moment at least that's my hope and I do
hope that if you've benefited from the
book in particular that you'll consider
writing a review on the platform on

[1:09:01]
writing a review on the platform on
which you bought it if you haven't done
so already and share your experience
with others because I don't have a
promoter or a marketer or an agent or a
publishing house and because this is a
complete Grassroots Community effort I
really do rely on that and that's the
best way to get me to write a second
book is for the first book to become
successful the more successful the first
book is the more lik I'm going to write
the next book and you can be
instrumental in that decision by helping
to spread the message to those who might
benefit so that's what I got for you
today thank you so much for joining me
this was a lot of fun and I hope to do
it again soon all
right bye for now everyone thank you for
tuning in
