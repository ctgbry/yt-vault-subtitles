i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
what straits can learn from gays so i'm
a straight man but i was a professional
actor for 15 years and this meant a lot
of my friends and colleagues were gay
lesbian or just queer in general i
learned a lot about gay relationships
during that time today i want to
highlight one thing in particular that i
think straits can learn from gays with
respect to how to conduct relationships

so thank you for your help
one of the biggest issues with straight
relationships is that they operate under
assumptive frameworks
two straight people enter into a
relationship we're married we're
boyfriend and girlfriend whatever
and both people generally assume

[01:02]
and both people generally assume
that they have the same idea with
respect to what that means
they think they both understand the same
thing when they use words like marriage
commitment monogamy and partnership
this is the assumptive framework it's an
amalgamation of archetypes from their
own families of origin
traditional culture and visible models
in a larger society
however
gays just don't have this framework
there is no archetypal model for gay
relationships until 40 or 50 years ago
it was socially unacceptable in
almost every part of the world to even
come out as gay so there aren't visible
traditions or public archetypes for gay
relationships for the individuals to
fall back on
in the vast majority of cases gay folks
can't even look to their own parents and
their families of origin to see models

[02:00]
their families of origin to see models
for what a healthy gay relationship is
supposed to look like do you get what
i'm saying
so when gay folks get together they have
to like explicitly negotiate
everything
nothing is assumed it's like
do we tell our parents do we tell our
friends which friends what do we tell
them is this an open relationship if it
is what's allowed what's not allowed who
can do what with whom when do we want a
family do we want to adopt or use a
surrogate do we get married or have a
civil union or simply live together as
partners who's on top who's on bottom do
we switch
every aspect of sex relationship and
commitment needs to be explicitly
discussed because there is no assumptive
framework to fall back on and gays
being already outside the mainstream in
some respects are also generally more
open to unconventional approaches to all
of these issues as a result
gay relationships have the potential to
be more closely aligned with the actual

[03:01]
be more closely aligned with the actual
needs and values of the individuals
involved on the other hand because of
the assumptive framework there's a lot
of potential for misunderstanding and
straight relationships what's more you
might have two people trying to fit
themselves into an archetypal idea
that predates both of their lives and
may not actually be good fits for either
one of them
however there is a lot of social
pressure to accord with traditional
relationship models
gays by virtue of the fact that they've
already broken with tradition in at
least one other significant way
can be more practiced in resisting this
pressure than straits and more willing
to find idiosyncratic solutions to their
problems
