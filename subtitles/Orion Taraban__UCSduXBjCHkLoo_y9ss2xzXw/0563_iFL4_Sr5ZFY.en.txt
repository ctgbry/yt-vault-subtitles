relationships need boundaries
relationships need rules and definitions
love doesn't give a about any of
those things you think that love will
only love where it's allowed I mean
that's insane right so what I say is
that people need things from other
people and the medium in which value is
exchanged is called a relationship and
you have to provide value in order to
secure a relationship and there needs to
be some kind of exchange at parody more
or less and it's for the two people
involved in that relationship to decide
for themselves what is valuable and and
how much it's valuable Etc but you don't
need a relationship for love because
love is you could say that it's beyond
value or it's value less it's kind of
the same thing from a Zen perspective
and love will will consistently want
what is best for the loved one and think
very little of itself I mean that finds
in my opinion it's apotheosis in like
Christian myth mythology where it's the
sacrifice I'm willing to suffer
everything be out of my love for
Humanity mhm
