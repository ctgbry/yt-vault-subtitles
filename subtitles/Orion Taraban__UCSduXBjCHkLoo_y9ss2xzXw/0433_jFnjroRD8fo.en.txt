I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is get used
to disappointing women
the ability to disappoint women is a
skill and it's a vital skill that men
must learn in order to have successful
relationships with women now
disappointing women can be very
difficult for young guys in particular
because not only do they typically
experience a strong poll to give women
what they want but they also generally
do not have a great deal of options with
women this lack of optionality engenders
a scarcity mentality and this scarcity
mentality leads them to erroneously
believe that if they don't say yes to
what their women want all of the time
then their refusal is going to
jeopardize the foundational basis of the
relationship and I have a couple of
important responses to this perspective
first and foremost it is important to
disappoint women because the more a

[01:01]
disappoint women because the more a
woman likes you the more that she is
interested in you the more she's going
to want more of you
women don't love like men do a woman's
love is more consumptive
a woman in love wants everything she
wants all of your time all of your
attention and if she could she would
crawl inside of your head so she could
know all your thoughts and feelings you
see this kind of reaction in miniature
when women get around babies like oh
you're so cute I could just eat you up
yeah it's like huh in as many different
ways as possible a woman in love wants
to put you inside of her
so that's consumptive feminine love now
as I've said before wanting is free that
is it costs the wanter absolutely
nothing to want things but it costs you
The Giver something to give things this

[02:00]
The Giver something to give things this
asymmetry means that you are under no
obligation to give someone what they
want simply as a consequence of their
wanting it and this is great news
because if this weren't true it would
lead to some devastating consequences
for instance if you were actually
foolish enough to give a woman all of
your time and attention
all the time and attention that she
wanted from you then slowly but surely
you will have stripped yourself of a
great deal of the things that initially
made you attractive to her
this means that paradoxically giving a
woman everything that she wants actually
results in her losing attraction for you
and if that attraction dips too low she
will likely terminate the relationship
leaving you with nothing
as by then you will have voluntarily
surrendered all the other aspects of
your life your friends your hobbies your

[03:00]
your life your friends your hobbies your
personal development your side hustles
your side pieces in the service of her
consumptive love
to maintain a relationship with a woman
you need to maintain a high level of
attraction and to maintain a high level
of attraction you need to continue to be
the person that the woman fell in love
with I understand that it's flattering
that a woman would be so interested in
you that she would want so much of you
and that it might be distressing to see
her disappointed in her wanting
but you cannot allow her desire for you
to diminish your lifestyle why because
your lifestyle as it currently is is
obviously sufficient to raise her
attraction to a fever pitch if it ain't
broke don't fix it my dude
going giving up who you are and how you
choose to live for a woman will not only
mean that you will lose the thing that
you surrender but that you will move in

[04:00]
you surrender but that you will move in
the direction of losing the woman as
well
now before I go any further if you're

channel grow you can also hit the super
thanks button those three dots in the
lower right hand corner and tip me in
proportion to the value you believe
you've received from this episode
because it's your donations that make
all of this happen and I really
appreciate your support
now another thing to keep in mind with
respect to this issue is that women are
complicated like all people they want to
get what they want but on another level
they also don't want to get what they
want
how does this work look if a woman
succeeds in getting what she wants from
you too often whether she's aware of it
or not
she's going to start to feel that she is
more powerful than you
and that is going to start to make her

[05:00]
and that is going to start to make her
feel unsafe
why because if a man can't hold the line
with her who really isn't all that big
of a threat how is he going to be able
to hold the line with someone else who
might legitimately be threatening
a man who can appropriately Hold the
Line against her consumptive love
communicates that he is centered in his
masculine purpose that he can tolerate
her distress at being disappointed and
that he is more powerful than she is
which actually allows her to relax into
the relationship
this is because women's need to feel
safe often leads them to do some pretty
counter-intuitive things like shacking
up with dangerous bad boys or provoking
men to fight with them
women like to test how much they can get
away with which means that they will
sometimes even ask for unreasonable
things just to see if you have the spine
to turn them down
by disappointing women you communicate

[06:01]
by disappointing women you communicate
that you are maintaining frame which
means that she can relax into her
feminine because she is not driving the
ship
and I would highly highly encourage men
to disappoint their women sooner as
opposed to later in a normal healthy
relationship saying no to a request or
not being available or not being
interested
does not lead to the end of the
relationship think about it if your
buddy turns down your invitation to go
to the baseball game with you what's
your response probably something like
hey no problem maybe next time
and then you move on with your life
that is an appropriate response to
disappointment however it is
unfortunately the case that some women
especially more immature women can do a
lot of inappropriate things when
disappointed
things like throw a temper tantrum or
sulk in despondency or keep score in
bitterness or withdraw affection

[07:02]
bitterness or withdraw affection
Etc
and don't you think it would be
important to figure out if you're
dealing with this type of woman early on
in the relationship
it's better to learn this in the first
five weeks than in the first five months
or God help you in the first five years
and this is because continuing on in a
relationship with such a woman basically
means that you'll need to constantly
conform to her expectations of reality
or suffer the consequences which ain't
worth it
and here's one final thing to keep in
mind men a lot of you are nervous about
disappointing your women because you are
afraid that doing so will make her less
interested in having a relationship with
you
do me a favor
think about a time when you've asked a
woman for something and she's said no
as a consequence of that rejection did
you like her more or did you like her
less
you probably liked her more

[08:00]
you probably liked her more
to use an extreme example when your ex
broke up with you you were not suddenly
divested of all the positive feelings
that you had of her if anything her
rejection made you want to pursue more
and try harder
it increased your attraction because she
was fundamentally making herself scarcer
to you do you see if rejection and
disappointment increase your attraction
when a woman does it it will increase a
woman's attraction when you do it she is
not different from you in this respect
saying no rejection disappointment these
things are like spices
food without spice is Bland
food with too much spice is inedible
there is little nutritional content so
just like we like some spice on our food
we like some spice in our relationships
and disappointment is one such spice as
it tends to increase the attraction of
whomever is being disappointed

[09:00]
whomever is being disappointed
whether this should or should not be the
case is irrelevant because that's the
way it is
