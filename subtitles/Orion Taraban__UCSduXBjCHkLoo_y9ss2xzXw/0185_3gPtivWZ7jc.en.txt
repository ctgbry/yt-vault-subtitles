i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to enjoy your life more
the other day i was speaking with a
client who told me that because of some
of the experience he's passed through in
his life he's begun to see life on this
planet as disappointing unsatisfactory
and painful
and in many respects this person in my
opinion
was actually starting to see reality
clearly
life on this planet is
inherently unsatisfactory that's one of
the fundamental teachings of the buddha
there is darkness and pain and suffering
and loss and grief and betrayal and all
kinds of nasty things on this planet but
it's also true that this planet is under
the auspices of duality
if there is darkness there must be light
if there is chaos there must be harmony
if there is ignorance and cruelty there

[01:00]
if there is ignorance and cruelty there
must be wisdom and kindness and so on so
life is a mixture of both
there is no worldly thing that is all
good or all bad and this is symbolized
in the yin yang symbol within the white
there is a spot of black and within the
black there is a spot of white
life is a mixture of the light and the
dark
so if that's the nature of things how
can we enjoy life more
by harnessing the power of focus and
attention remember
focus is like
a magnifying glass
whatever we focus on gets bigger
and as it gets bigger it fills the
content of our consciousness until
that's all we can see so our focus
actually dictates on a very fundamental
level our experience of reality
and if we have some freedom to choose we
can choose to increasingly focus on the
good and less on all the rest

[02:00]
good and less on all the rest
here's how you can think about this
have you ever had this experience i
think we all have
where you're having a really nice meal
at a fancy restaurant and the food is
wonderful and the service is excellent
but the whole time
you're just thinking about the check and
how expensive the meal is going to be
i think we've all been there
and this is unfortunate because the
check is gonna come either way
that's what i'd like you to consider
the check is coming it's
inevitable
you don't have to worry about it and we
all have to pay it one way or another
but in the meantime
we might as well enjoy the meal
because if we don't well
we still have to pay the check and we'll
buy the meal at a much steeper price
that way because it wasn't offset by the
joy and pleasure that we might otherwise
have received from the experience
so that's the power of focus enjoy the
meal that's on your table and pay the
check when it comes

[03:00]
check when it comes
