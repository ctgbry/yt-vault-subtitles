I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is some
problems are their best Solutions look
around you the world is full of problems
it's a very unsatisfactory
situation however the unfortunate
reality is that many of the problems you
see are actually their own best
Solutions this means that trying to
solve the problems you see will create
even more and worse problems than if you
had just let that original problem be
many of the problems that exist in the
world are the best of even more
unsatisfactory Solutions this is because
most problems do not have easy
inexpensive enduring satisfactory
Solutions this is disappointing but
accepting this reality will help you
have more patience and compassion with
respect to these problems and also a
healthy caution about fiddling with

[01:01]
healthy caution about fiddling with
problems you may know little about in
fact it's generally safer to assume that
a problem that you encounter in life is
its own best solution until sufficient
due diligence proves otherwise that is
the burden of proof lies with
demonstrating that a problem is not its
own best solution to clarify what I mean
let me give you a concrete example and
then we'll abstract to the psychological
domain as you might be aware I'm reading
a script when I'm record these episodes
I do this out of respect for you my
audience I've discovered that when
content creators myself included just
Riff to a camera by themselves it's very
easy for them to start Meandering or
hesitating or repeating themselves like
the first 90 seconds might contain an
interesting idea but the next several
minutes are just spent reiterating that
idea in slightly different ways this is
often obscured by the fact that they use
lots of different camera tricks or
editing in order to kind of hide the

[02:00]
editing in order to kind of hide the
fact that the content is boring and
repetitive it's very difficult to
improvise a multifaceted argument that
builds on itself to No One try it out
for yourself if you don't believe me so
most people don't even try to avoid
these problems I script out my talks so
that they can be as concise and direct
and effective as possible I don't want
to waste your time now one of the
liabilities of this approach is that I
must occasionally look down at my script
and away from the camera
and over the years I have received a
number of emails from people complaining
that this is distracting and suggesting
that I get a teleprompter a few of them
have even offered to buy me one in point
of fact I had thought of this idea long
ago and I actually bought a teleprompter
myself to solve this issue however it
soon became clear to me that reading off
my script was a problem that was its own
best
solution the teleprompter allowed me to
look directly at the camera

[03:00]
look directly at the camera
but because I was sitting so close to
the screen my eye movements actually
became even more exaggerated and
distracting to solve this problem I
would need to move far away from the
teleprompter like newscasters aren't
sitting directly in front of their
cameras are they so that the eye
movements wouldn't be noticeable at that
far of a remove unfortunately the web
camera I was using didn't have a zoom
feature this meant that I would either
look very small in a big visual field
which would be awkward and distracting
itself or I would need to buy a new
camera with a zoom lens this in turn
would require that I change my audio
recording setup as well as I could no
longer record the episodes on a single
track and recording on separate tracks
would demand that I either devote the
time and effort to learning how to sync
and master them or find and pay someone
to do this for me in any case I
succeeded in creating several new
problems for myself by solving the
original problem I also considered other

[04:01]
original problem I also considered other
possible solutions that I won't go into
here everything from utilizing AI
filters to memorizing my entire scripts
however in every case the potential
solution created new problems that were
even more distracting effortful or
expensive than the problem I was
initially trying to solve in the end I
decided that the original problem was
the least problematic problem of them
all so you will all have to contend with
me occasionally looking down at my
scripts for the foreseeable
future if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you

[05:01]
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description now without knowing all of
these Downstream consequences it's very
easy to criticize and offer unsolicited
advice and just for the record I'm not
offended by these suggestions I know
they're coming from a good place however
once people understand that every part
of a system is inextricably and often
invisibly connected to every other then
they become more cautious about making
changes this is because many problems
are actually their own best Solutions
but people often only realize this after
they start messing with
things now let's abstract the
psychological domain people are
problematic they can be selfish or
aggressive or victimizing or malc
contend or hypocritical to name just a

[06:01]
contend or hypocritical to name just a
few however it can also be the case that
these negative attributes while
problematic are less problematic than
the problems they would create in their
own resolution as I've said previously
most the word dysfunction is the word
function this means that dysfunction
mostly works and it mostly works by
serving an important role in the life of
the individual in question
remove the dysfunctional behavior from
that important role and at least for a
while the number of problems that
individual contends with is going to
multiply
considerably take being jaded or cynical
while clearly suboptimal this attitude
serves an important role in the life of
the individual in question namely
protection from emotional pain cynicism
creates problems notably it cuts people
off from experiencing certain positive
emotions like Joy or sincerity but these

[07:03]
emotions like Joy or sincerity but these
problems might be less problematic than
the problems that would emerge were the
cynicism to be removed the experience of
disappointment heartbreak embarrassment
mockery and so on simply suggesting that
a cynical individual should say go to
therapy and heal the root causes of his
jadedness while potentially coming from
a desire to be helpful typically lacks
appropriate context for instance therapy
can be expensive will the stress
associated with incurring the additional
expense of therapy be more painful than
the problem he would be using therapy to
solve therapy can also be stressful
things typically get worse before they
get better does the individual have the
time and emotional bandwidth to take on
this project at the present time and of
course even assuming the therapy is
successful which of course is always
doubtful

[08:00]
doubtful
is the resolution of this problem a net
positive like is the pain associated
with greater exposure to negative
emotions necessary for the cultivation
of resilience more than offset by the
pleasure associated with greater
exposure to positive emotions for many
people life is very hard and the
compromised position of cynicism may
actually be the best they can do
believing the contrary may be insisting
on an idealism that may not be grounded
in
reality now this is not to say the
conditions inhospitable to change are
static and don't evolve over time of
course they aren't things are always in
a state of flux and this means that
there may come a time in the future when
the problems created by certain
Solutions won't be quite as problematic
or that certain problems will become
even more problematic than they
currently are but it can also be the
case that whatever problem you've

[09:00]
case that whatever problem you've
identified is the very best solution
that can be implemented at the present
time accept this possibility and people
and the societies they create suddenly
make a lot more
