I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how women
train men to be
angry this is something that many women
do and that many women do inadvertently
and this of course is to be expected as
few women prefer to be in the presence
of male anger in fact most find male
anger terrifying which makes their
contribution to this process all the
more tragic and ironic and this is not
to say that men don't have their share
of responsibility in this after all they
inadvertently allow themselves to be
trained in this way however if women can
come to appreciate how they may be
perversely incentivizing male anger it
will go a long way toward reducing
unnecessary relationship conflict to
explain how this process occurs I'm
going to begin by sharing an anecdote
from my own life now I am by no means a

[01:01]
from my own life now I am by no means a
perfect person however all other things
being equal I'm a fairly patient guy in
the last 10 years I can count the number
of times I've raised my voice on one
hand and all of those times have been
associated with two specific women I was
in a long-term relationship with one of
these women many years ago and I
remember having a lot of trouble getting
through to her and this was really
puzzling to me because I know that I'm
actually an exceptional Communicator I'm
articulate and precise in my words and I
have good command of tone and expression
to clearly indicate my emotion in
general I don't have a problem
transmitting my message to my intended
audience however when I brought certain
issues to her attention for whatever
reason my words just didn't seem to
penetrate her understanding in the
moment it would seem as though she
understood

[02:00]
understood
however when the conversation was over
she'd just go back to doing whatever it
was that she was doing before as if the
discussion had never happened and in the
beginning I just assumed that this was
my fault that I hadn't yet used the
right words to represent how important
this was to me or how disrespectful and
hurtful her behavior was I assumed that
if she understood this she would have to
change her behavior and the fact that
she hadn't changed her behavior was
proof that she hadn't yet understood
therefore the solution was to try again
and to communicate more clearly and
effectively than before and I did try
again many many many many times not only
that I used all the various
communication strategies and
psychological tactics I had at my
disposal to get my point across and none
of them worked I was calm I was patient
I sought to understand rather than be
understood I tried everything I could to

[03:02]
understood I tried everything I could to
let her know that her behavior was
problematic and that I wanted it to stop
all to know
aail until one day after scores of
unsuccessful attempts to get through to
her I had had it I snapped I lost my
temper and I yelled and screamed at
her and guess what happened for the
first time ever in the history of that
relationship ship she apparently heard
what I said and she changed her
behavior and it was at this point that I
realized that I had to take myself out
of that relationship which I
subsequently did why because if the only
way I could be heard in my relationship
was by raising my voice and becoming
increasingly aggressive then I would be
molded into an angry aggressive man over
time neither one of us would have wanted

[04:00]
time neither one of us would have wanted
that outcome but that's what would have
happened if nothing changed that
relationship was headed to a very dark
place as I would have functionally had
to choose between being angry and being
ignored women you have to understand
that the vast majority of men don't
escalate to anger immediately and you
should just leave any man who does
rather the vast majority of men will try
to communicate with their women many
many many times in different ways using
different strategies before resorting to
anger and this is how women
inadvertently train their men to be
angry By ignoring disrespecting or
invalidating them when they attempt to
communicate non-
aggressively and as should be abundantly
obvious this is very very stupid

[05:00]
obvious this is very very stupid

without giving YouTube a cut uh I really
appreciate your support you make all of
this happen thank you very
much now if a man for whatever reason
can't seem to get through to his woman
about something important to him if he
remains unheard time and time again then
there are really only three things that
can happen the first thing that can
happen is that the man will escalate to
anger and aggression For Better or Worse
most men are going to attempt this
strategy first before moving on to one
of the two remaining options

[06:00]
of the two remaining options
in general when people don't feel heard
they get louder this is often
counterproductive especially in
intersexual relationships however it is
one of the remaining options when reason
and understanding fail and just to be
clear this isn't always a bad thing
after all men are socially expected to
be protectors and they are encouraged to
fight for the things that matter to them
typically one of the things that matters
to men are their primary relationships
now when the security of that
relationship is threatened by say a home
Invader few women would have a problem
with their men fighting to defend their
relationships however when it is a
woman's behavior that threatens the
security of the
relationship then men are placed in a
double bind they feel pulled to protect
the relationship but doing so
functionally means they end up fighting
the woman who constitutes that
relationship if they don't fight they
lose if they do fight they lose

[07:00]
lose if they do fight they lose
this is unwise women it is not wise to
put men in double binds unnecessarily
and this is because after most men
escalate to anger and aggression and
find it to be counterproductive they are
left with only two real courses of
action either the man collapses
internally in order to protect himself
from the pain associated with his
continued
invalidation becoming over time a shell
of his former self or he
leaves that's it those are the only
options a man has when dealing with a
woman who won't listen to him he will
either escalate collapse or leave there
are no other
options now women does this mean that
you simply have to cater to men's every
desire absolutely not however it does
mean that it's in your best interests
either to rectify problematic Behavior
as quickly as possible or or to find

[08:00]
as quickly as possible or or to find
ways to ensure that you disagree with
your man in a way that does not leave
him feeling invalidated or
disrespected in general you should take
respectful requests from the men in your
life
seriously because they may not remain
patient and respectful
indefinitely and you wouldn't expect
them to remain indefinitely patient and
respectful if they were dealing with
anyone else who was threatening your
relationship failure to do this
functionally ensures that you will
experience more and more conflict in
your relationship until you end up
either a with the defeated shell of your
man's former self or B alone and how do
either one of these outcomes serve you
and just for the record just like I
encouraged you to Simply leave any man
who immediately escalates to anger I
encourage every man I work with to
Simply leave any woman who refuses to

[09:02]
Simply leave any woman who refuses to
respect his boundaries or listen to his
reasonable requests fighting with a
woman isn't worth it for a man because
there's no way he can win and staying in
a relationship until he is a husk of his
former self is an even more devastating
outcome this means the best possible
move when dealing with such women is for
men to exit as quickly and graciously as
possible I've since learned my lesson
