That's how women get ghosted. It's not
because of the sex. In some cases, that
could be the only positive outweighing
all the other negatives. It's because of
all the they decided the sex
had to come with. Real talk. Women get
ghosted after sex when they make getting
the sex so difficult, painful, or
expensive that men no longer think it's
worth it to engage with them again. But
here's the thing. This phenomenon still
occurs in the context of relationships
where the woman is very attracted to the
man and sex occurs fairly quickly. That
is, the man under goes the same
unconscious calculus to determine the
transacted value of that sexual
opportunity for him. It's just that
these men are anchored at a different
price point. That is when men are
attractive and high value, they
routinely engage with attracted women
for sexual relationships. So they are

for sexual relationships. So they are
used to getting things fairly cheaply.
And this means that even slight
increases in incurred costs may be
detrimental to the woman's long-term
prospects. You can charge more from
people who are used to paying more, not
so from people who are used to paying
less. And that's why I argue that a
woman's best bet is to offer the
richest, creamiest milk she can, high
good times, with as little difficulty or
friction as she can muster. Low hassle.
These women do not get ghosted. And
remember ladies, the more attractive the
man, the lower the margin of error
