[00:00]
so um for most people what ends up
happening the way most people will
develop game in the way same way most
people develop sales skills the same way
most people develop the Hustler
mentality they have to
now some people try to skip this step by
getting money like over there they'll
say I'm not going to date until I get
money so then they don't have any game
the way you develop game is when you're
on the way up especially and even if
you're already there take away some of
what you have don't use it
talk to people
start learning how to actually have
conversations with people and develop a
relationship out of thin air out of
nothing
how do I go up to this person without
all my fanciest clothes on how do I go
up to this person without a
300 000 watch on my wrist how do I go up
to people even people I'm not interested
in on a physical level how do I go up to
people and just start developing
relationships with them they can be
platonic relationships they can just be

[01:02]
platonic relationships they can just be
acquaintances how do I go up to people
and talk to them and have conversations
and start understanding what people
actually want
what do people really want
and what are they willing to do to get
it
when you that's what if you talk to a
hustler or you talk to somebody that's
like a con person a con man con woman
what they are good at is finding out
what you want
exactly what your truest desires are and
when they figure out what you want all
they do is fill in for that what you
really want like most people will say oh
well a woman wants to be on a yacht why
see you bought a yacht because you saw
girls on a yacht why do they want to be
on a yacht
you got to figure that part out and
provide that with you and not just the
yacht
what make is it they're looking for the
experience they're looking for what they
believe a yacht means
the status that a yacht provides the

[02:02]
the status that a yacht provides the
enjoyment the the stuff they saw in the
video where everybody was popping
champagne and they just seemed like they
were having such a good time that's what
they want from that yeah most of them
don't really know what kind of yacht you
got they don't know you know they'll
have much yacht information so would it
be fair to say that because I often say
this to my clients is that if it works
in sales it works in dating
and what is in common in both of those
things is that what really seems to be
successful is the ability to cultivate
an emotional experience
absolutely that is can we say that
that's kind of game in a nutshell is the
ability to cultivate an emotional
experience absolutely absolutely and to
make that experience something that they
feel like they can't get anywhere else
um
for people who grew up in the 80s and
90s that was the crack era right in the
80s and 90s they had this like they had
these people that y'all probably some of
y'all younger people may not even know
about crackheads but they would just be

[03:00]
about crackheads but they would just be
just really on you know just really
after it getting after it and with most
of them
most of them it's not even necessarily
the chemical dependency as much as with
their body and their mind is telling
them is that first high that you got
you're gonna your body tries to chase
that your mind trying to chase that you
chased it on a spiritual level for the
rest of your life they call that chasing
the dragon now because of that that that
experience that you want to get back
over and over again even if you keep
getting a diminished version of it you
keep chasing it over and over again what
a lot of men don't understand when you
go out with women when you deal with
women if you can create that experience
and that feeling
and tag and tap into something
emotionally one time have you ever
noticed that women would date a guy who
has doesn't seem like he has anything to
offer that you're like why do you keep
going back to this dude well they're
chasing the dragon
that dude

[04:00]
that dude
he her really good and that's
part of why she she keeps coming back
and that's certainly part of the uh
small amount a person it's just like
what a girl okay but the worst piece of
you ever have in your life is
still good
but how many guys do you know
are chasing after a woman who hasn't
slept with them in three four five six
years sometimes even more
still chasing still hoping man one day
if I do this she'll come back one day if
I do that she'll come back you might
even look at the girls like she's not
even really that attractive it probably
wasn't even that good or that much
better than the last woman but
she was somehow able to tap into an
experience an emotional connection that
you had and it hit all the factors in
your mind your body your spirit and
because that happened you were going to
chase that for as long as you possibly
can you're gonna you're chasing until

[05:00]
can you're gonna you're chasing until
you have nothing left
and what a lot of guys don't really
understand it with guys who have game do
understand I need to create an
experience and as many times as I can
create that experience
It renews This Woman's attraction for me
I don't need it to create it with money
I don't need to create it by doing
spectacular things that matter so much
it's just I need to find out what makes
that woman Tink and I need to create
that experience some guys created in a
negative way
sometimes how do they figure that out I
imagine
you can't just ask directly because a
lot of people actually don't know
what what they really want do you think
that's true
absolutely it's true when you talk okay
the way um it's like um I actually sold
cars in a couple of different items my
father I always say this my father's the
greatest salesman ever believe

[06:00]
greatest salesman ever believe
um and he got the plaques and everything
to prove it he taught me a lot of stuff
about sales and one of the biggest
things is
to sell somebody something you got to
really listen
not just listen to what they tell you
but also listen to what they don't tell
you
so when you look at somebody and you say
you get it say you get a life a nice
girl that you you find attractive you're
just like what makes this girl tick I
don't understand this woman what is it
that I need to know about her that that
these are the things that make that
matter the most to her
well when you want to figure that out
about somebody
don't ask them what the most important
things are ask them about other things
hey you know what's your favorite movie
figure out what movie they like to go
see do they like to go see romantic
comedies
well that means that they want a lot of
times they want that up and down
uh Boy Meets Girl boy loses girl love
story
um
so a lot of times like if you watch a
guy who likes Spider-Man

[07:00]
guy who likes Spider-Man
he wants that story about the nerd who
meets a girl that's the love of his life
he finally gets super powers you get
what I'm saying you can tell a lot about
a guy by that
so that basically kind of goes on the
psychological premise of identification
that that's kind of how movies work and
stories work
identify with certain characters and
that's easier to do than others and
maybe we identify
um almost wishfully like with the people
that we most want to be or would like
most to be and if we're good at kind of
analyzing those themes or that work we
can kind of reverse engineer a person's
self-concept or or what their yeah
desire might be that's interesting
because because what we normally what we
normally identify with the most is
somebody who is the closest to us
transformed into the best version of us
so when we watch a movie or a show or

[08:00]
so when we watch a movie or a show or
something like that it's normally going
to be the thing like if you like like
look at Rocky
Rocky's not perfect Rocky's kind of slow
witted
um doesn't talk very intelligently he's
poor he's not doesn't have a great
record as a fighter he's somebody who
you say wow this guy's you know he's
kind of a loser he gets this opportunity
this chance
out of nowhere where Apollo Creed says
hey I'll fight you and
the transformation that Rocky takes he
has a he has a mentor and you got to
look and you gotta pay attention to
every piece of the story he has a mentor
that comes in and trains and changes him
into the person that could actually
fight Apollo Creed and be successful
enough to go down to the last second
Rocky loses in the end but Rocky becomes
somebody you can Empire
that wasn't very popular I mean clearly
there was

[09:00]
there was
a dozen sequels but I think he wins in
every other movie it's almost like
people couldn't let the story end with
Rocky losing
that's that's another thing that people
don't think about when they think about
relationships why do a lot of women go
back to a guy who doesn't call them why
they call over and over again it's the
Cliffhanger the story didn't win the way
that I want to people chase the happy
ending just like they did with Rocky
they knew when they made Rocky lose that
fight that you would be so happy to go
see Rocky too
they knew it
