I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is surviving
toxic family during the holidays the
holidays are upon us my friends for many
this is a restful enjoyable time where
they can spend Precious Moments with
loved ones and family
for others it is a landmine of conflict
and despair
this episode is for those in the second
category in the years I spent an
outpatient addiction
I learned the importance of holiday
safety planning and that's exactly what
we're going to do here today there's a
number of things that you can do to keep
yourself emotionally safe while you're
in the belly of the Beast now before I
get into them please remember to like
this episode And subscribe to the
channel it takes less than a second
costs you nothing and it makes a great
stocking stuffer so do the thing
first and foremost it is important to
remember that you can absolutely

[01:02]
remember that you can absolutely
choose not to spend the holidays with
your family yes this might ruffle some
feathers but might those feathers get
ruffled regardless yes they might not
understand but how often do they
understand you anyway
so if you feel like it's not worth it if
you feel like you might not be able to
keep your cool or if you feel that you
have better things to do than suffer
undue criticism and abuse do everyone a
favor and make other plans give them the
gift of missing you this Christmas and
maybe things might be different in the
future you have no obligation to spend
your time with people who devalue or
disrespect you even if or especially if
they are family super important to keep
that in mind now if you do choose to
spend time with your family

[02:00]
spend time with your family
the very best thing that you can do is
to secure your own transportation this
is non-negotiable rent a car I
understand that this is an additional
expense but not having to rely on
someone to take you out of a nasty
situation if things go sideways is well
worth it
without the ability to move around
freely you will likely feel trapped when
things go sour that's going to make
everything very much worse very much
more quickly how having your own car is
an emergency exit you might also
consider getting your own place to stay
this might feel strange to some folks
but then again so might feeling like a
prisoner for a week in your childhood
bedroom
let's be honest that's not really a
place for adults if you're an adult you
can secure adult accommodations
it will take some of the pressure off
your hosts and will subtly communicate

[03:01]
your hosts and will subtly communicate
that this is an adult to adult
relationship
and it will also give you some place to
go if things get heated again have an
exit strategy at minimum this means a
place to go and a way to get there yes
this can be expensive
but so are therapy sessions
next you might consider reducing the
duration of your trip just because you
have a week off doesn't mean you have to
spend a week with Mom and Uncle Jeff
that's a vacation you might need a
vacation from spending a couple of days
with family is perfectly acceptable you
can even just show up for Christmas
dinner and leave after dessert after all
it's your holiday too there's no need to
surrender all your time to appease
guilt-tripping relatives who won't be
happy anyway
and finally I would strongly recommend
that you lay off the booze alcohol is

[04:01]
that you lay off the booze alcohol is
almost always involved in big family
blow-ups I understand that folks can
reach for the bottle in order to make
spending time with family more tolerable
but it's a risky strategy if things get
bad they're more likely to get real bad
if alcohol is involved remember no one's
ever proud that they drink too much so
to recap get your own transportation
secure your own lodgings reduce the
duration of your trip and lay off the
booze what do you think got any tips of
your own let us know in the comments
