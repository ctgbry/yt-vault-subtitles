i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is the disconfirming emotional
experience
this is a somewhat technical term the
disconfirming emotional experience
and i'm here to explain what it is and
how it's actually at the heart of the
therapeutic process
so people come to therapy because as a
result of their experiences
they develop beliefs or models of
reality
that attempt to make sense of what
happened to them in the past
and that may no longer be entirely
aligned with reality in the present
so for example let's say a particular
client
his father abandoned the family when he
was a boy
and in his child appropriate egocentrism
he developed the belief that the
father's leaving was really his fault
because he was too weak and needy
maybe even his his mother led him to
believe that to be true

[01:00]
believe that to be true
keep in mind that this needn't be a
fully conscious belief in order to exert
influence on an individual's behavior
consequently this client may then have
extrapolated a rule from this belief
designed to protect him from future
abandonment something like
if i show weakness or vulnerability i
will push people out of my life
and therefore i must not show any signs
of weakness or vulnerability
in any of my personal relationships so
you see it makes
a kind of sense this belief and it
served the function of allowing that
child to feel
as though he had some measure of control
over his circumstances which was helpful
as children are generally in such
powerless dependent states of
via v their caregivers the issue is that
it's not entirely aligned with reality
most likely the father in this case left
the family for reasons that had nothing
to do with the child's expressed
vulnerability
and if an address this belief can come
to loggerheads and adult interpersonal
relationships especially

[02:00]
relationships especially
romantic relationships so what does this
have to do with therapy
such an individual could potentially
arrive in therapy
probably because he's been having
unsatisfying relationships
and the treatment could just focus
exclusively on understanding
where this belief came from or
explicating the psychodynamic process of
the fear of abandonment
or exploring the client's emotional
experience
and this person could literally be in
therapy for
decades without anything appreciably
changing
all of this discussion is just prelude
to the emotionally disconfirming
experience which as i've said
is at the core of the therapeutic
process basically
what this means is that the client
actually needs to go through the feared
experience
and come out the other side feeling that
things are going to be okay
that's it so in the context of this
hypothetical example
it would mean this person would need to
be willing to take the risk
to show vulnerability in a relationship

[03:02]
to show vulnerability in a relationship
and to feel not to understand rationally
but to
actually feel that he hasn't been
punished as a result of doing so
that it's actually okay or that it could
even potentially have strengthened the
relationship
and this person might have to do this
not just once not just
twice but 10 or 20 times in order to
disentangle the behavior from the feared
outcome
it's not a cognitive thing it's not an
intellectual thing
it's an emotional thing it was really
scary to do
i was terrified that the feared outcome
was gonna transpire but it didn't
oh wow and it didn't enough times that i
can kind of begin to trust
that this belief that i created to
protect myself in the past may no longer
be necessary because it's not ultimately
based in the reality
of my new present experience
so if you're not having disconfirming
emotional experiences in the context of
your therapeutic work you may need to

[04:00]
your therapeutic work you may need to
reconsider what you're doing there
so that's all i have to say if you have
a topic you would like discussed in a
future episode or would like to set up a
consultation
