I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
emotional gym
the emotional gym is a metaphor that has
personally helped me enormously over the
past 20 years as I've attempted to
cultivate certain emotional virtues like
patience forgiveness or kindness so if
you're on a similar trajectory yourself
then please keep listening
the cultivation of any virtue requires
intentionality and effort you have to
put in the Reps in order to strengthen
that attribute so in a way developing
emotional virtues is really not much
different from developing physical
strength if you want to get physically
stronger you have to identify certain
behaviors that Target specific muscle
groups and you have to put in the Reps
to do this a lot of folks go to the gym
they put their workout clothes in a bag
get in the car and drive to the gym they
are aware that they are going to the gym
and they are going to the gym with the

[01:00]
and they are going to the gym with the
explicit intention of getting physically
stronger and once they start working out
the sign that they're actually
accomplishing that goal is some degree
of pain
pain to some extent is a signal of
growth if you're lifting weights without
ever getting sore you're probably not
building any muscle if you're running on
a treadmill without ever feeling your
lungs get burning hot you're probably
not developing your anaerobic cardio Etc
obviously there's little point to
pushing ourselves to the point of injury
however some measure of pain is
typically a good sign that we're
actually doing something meaningful
the same premise holds true for
developing emotional virtues you have to
put in the Reps and to some degree you
have to be willing to tolerate the pain
which is actually a sign of emotional
growth however the pain that we're
talking about here is a little different
it could be a racing heart it could be a
clenching in the stomach it could be a

[02:01]
clenching in the stomach it could be a
rising temper or it could be a flurry of
incoherent thoughts
these are signs that you're working out
emotionally
and until you experience those signs
that you're working out emotionally
you're probably not yet building
emotional strength
now before I go any further if you're

now the main difference between the
regular gym and the emotional gym is
that as I've said you consciously choose
to go to the gym you decide when you
want to work out
on the other hand the emotional gym
comes to you
you do not get to decide when you're in

[03:01]
you do not get to decide when you're in
the emotional gym you only get to choose
whether you put in some reps while
you're there
you will understand that you're in the
emotional gym because of the signals of
pain that you are now experiencing these
have come upon you whether you want them
there or not whether you have something
better to do or not whether you believe
you've already put in enough practice or
not
irrespective of your plans or intentions
the emotional gym has come to you
so you might as well lift some weights
while you're there
the idea here is to reframe whatever
moment you're passing through as an
opportunity to develop a certain
emotional virtue
this is what has helped me so much in my
own self-development there's this old
joke about a Catholic with a bad temper
every day he prayed to God to give him
patience and every day he'd fly off his
handle and his wife and his co-workers
at the people in the marketplace however
he remained undaunted and every day like

[04:00]
he remained undaunted and every day like
a good Catholic he got down on his knees
and prayed once again for patience until
as it happens one day the man died and
he was granted the right to ask God in
heaven one question and his question was
God what was the story every day I
prayed to you for patience and every day
I lost it did you not hear my prayers
and God replied my son every day I heard
your prayers and every day I sent you an
opportunity to practice patience
your wife your co-workers the people in
the marketplace they were all put in
your life by me
as the Fulfillment of your prayer the
opportunity to grow that emotional
virtue
for without that practice how could the
man possibly have gotten stronger that's
kind of like just praying for muscles
without lifting any weights that's not
really how God seems to operate he just
doesn't go around making people swole we
have to be active participants in our

[05:00]
have to be active participants in our
own salvation and the idea here is that
all those things that tend to get under
your skin or cause you despair or
exacerbate your worry all of those
things were put in your life as
opportunities to practice their
complementary virtues which in this case
would be patience or hope
or courage
and without those opportunities to
practice you will not get stronger
because it is literally not
psychologically possible to get stronger
without effortful repetition
understanding this changed the way I
perceived my entire life the physical
gym exists only in a particular place
however the emotional gym is coincident
with my entire life there is no part of
my life that is outside of the emotional
gym the things I was struggling with the
things I was rubbing up against became
the weights that I was lifting in order
to create emotional strength and over
time slowly and imperfectly I became

[06:01]
time slowly and imperfectly I became
much stronger as a result
the key is to recognize the signs that
the emotional gym has come to you and to
see that moment as an opportunity to put
in some reps to build a particular
emotional virtue do this consistently
and how could you fail to become
stronger
