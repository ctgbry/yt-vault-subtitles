now once an emotion is present calling
it illogical or irrational is useless it
has already manifested itself so this is
just a kind of name calling that refuses
to accept reality and all feelings are
valid regardless of the emotion anxious
or angry or jealous or proud that
emotion exists and your experience of
that emotion existing inside of you is
valid but here's the thing not all
emotions are Justified valid and
Justified are two different things
emotions are valid but the thinking on
which those emotions are based might not
be entirely aligned with reality in fact
big emotional swings are generally a
sign that one's thinking is not well
aligned with reality as reality doesn't
tend to change significantly from one
moment to the next it more or less
continues on as it always has so the
more a person's thinking is in line with
reality the fewer egocentric emotions
tend to flues which is generally
experienced as peace
