i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is values
and decision making
as i've mentioned in previous episodes
values can actually be pretty expensive
so why bother having them i mean it's a
fair question because if we're going to
pay the cost associated with having
something we need to be sure that we're
getting our money's worth
my argument is that values are generally
worth their cost because they're
actually really useful in helping us
make decisions
every day of our lives we stand at
crossroads these are moments in time
that require us to ask ourselves what
should i do
these can be difficult questions and
we're forced to respond to them
constantly that's the human experience
we're a species of deciders and we can't
not respond as choosing to not respond
is itself a response on some level we're
all called to respond to life even if

[01:00]
all called to respond to life even if
it's against our will
so how do we do this effectively how can
we choose which path to take at the
crossroads of life
well one way to do this is to use values
values are like
lenses
they're like lenses through which we can
view
appropriate paths forward at any given
crossroads
and without these lenses it can look
like there's just an overwhelming number
like even an infinite number of possible
paths forward
and it can be very difficult to make a
decision in the face of that kind of
optionality so what these lenses do is
they filter out the vast majority of
pathways at any given crossroads as
being incongruent with the specific
focus of that lens so for example you
could be faced with a certain
predicament that prompts you to ask
yourself what should i do how should i
respond
well you can break out your values and
look through their lenses at the array

[02:01]
look through their lenses at the array
of possibilities for instance you could
ask what is the courageous response
and if you look through the lens of
courage
90 percent of the possible paths forward
will just immediately vanish
because they're incongruent with courage
they're just invisible now
in fact there's likely going to be only
a couple of options that would actually
facilitate a courageous response
or you could ask what is the wise
response and you can bring the lens of
wisdom to your eye and
a different set of potential pathways
forward are now visible to you as you
look through that filter
what's the kind thing to do what's the
just thing to do what's the
self-respecting thing to do etc and
we'll see that the courageous response
isn't always the kind response which
isn't always the just response and so on
so it's important to be intentional and

[03:00]
so it's important to be intentional and
conscientious about which values you're
using to make your decisions to move
forward because whatever pathway you're
walking down
you'll move further and further in that
direction
so if you're moving down the pathway of
courage you may be getting closer to
embodying that value but also further
from embodying other values kind of no
way around that
so identify what your values are or at
least what you'd like them to be and use
them consistently to make intentional
decisions at the crossroads of your life
and that's how you get your money's
worth
