I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
make a connection with anyone
the ability to form a sincere genuine
emotional connection with people opens
up your life more than almost any other
skill the world is full of people and if
you can forge an emotional connection
with these people you're going to have a
more interesting rewarding and exciting
life full of potential friends partners
and lovers it's kind of the master skill
of life and I'm going to tell you how to
do this however before I do so please

so how do you form an emotional
connection with anyone it basically
involves empathy but most people don't
really understand what empathy is so
I'll need to spend a little time here
most people think that empathy is sort
of like putting yourself in another
person's shoes and imagining how you
would feel in that person's
circumstances
sounds reasonable enough right but the
issue is that that doesn't really work
and why doesn't it work well because the
same stimulus can create vastly
different emotional responses in
different people hell the same stimulus
will create vastly different emotional
responses in the same person at
different times one statement will make
somebody Roar with laughter and another
person offended in Furious so imagining
yourself in another person's
circumstances and considering how you
would feel doesn't often work to forge
an emotional connection in fact it can

[02:00]
an emotional connection in fact it can
often leave people feeling alienated and
judged
let me explain about using a concrete
example let's say that you come across a
crying child and this child is upset
because his favorite toy has been broken
now if you were to put yourself in this
child situation you might think
well
come on kid it's just a toy yeah it's
disappointing that your toy broke but in
the scheme of things it's really not
that important nobody's dead nobody's
hurt it's not that expensive there's
plenty of toys in the world and it might
even be repairable I don't really see
what the big deal is and I think you're
overreacting
as you may imagine that response is
unlikely to lead to any kind of
emotional connection with that child
and if you try to explain to the child
that it's just a toy and that he can get
another one that is if you try to
address the problem on the level of its
most superficial content namely the toy

[03:01]
most superficial content namely the toy
is broken
you're not going to get anywhere in fact
you're probably going to make the
situation worse however this is the
likely response of an adult imagining
how he would respond under identical
circumstances
on the other hand instead of imagining
yourself in the exact same circumstances
as this individual a better idea is to
remember a situation in your own life
that has created the same emotional
reaction in you
you should then be able to better guess
at what might actually be going on for
the other person by extrapolating
backward from the emotion to the
circumstances instead of the other way
around
in this case you might consider asking
yourself
what was going on in my own life the
last time I was crying inconsolably
oh well that was when my mother died
and why was I so upset
because I felt that I had permanently
lost someone very precious to me

[04:04]
what's going on here
on one level the child is crying over a
broken toy
however on another deeper more Universal
level the child is crying because he has
lost something that he loved
in fact given his age and experience
this could be the biggest loss of his
life the loss of his most cherished
treasure
not everyone has had the experience of
losing their favorite toy and trying to
imagine what that would feel like could
be a cold approximation at best
however almost everyone has had the
experience of losing something precious
to them
this is the universal experience that
makes it possible to forge a connection
with even radically different people
no matter how dissimilar the stories of
Our Lives the underlying themes remain
largely the same in this case

[05:00]
largely the same in this case
approaching the child with the attitude
of I too have lost something that I
loved is much more likely to produce an
emotional connection than it's just a
toy
the fact of the matter is is that ideas
tend to divide people and emotions tend
to unite them
we all know what it feels like to be
hurt
to be relieved to be furious to be
anxious to be consumed by desire
however what hurts you might not hurt me
and vice versa it sounds weird but the
key to connecting with others is to kind
of not pay too much attention to what
they actually say
this is circumstantial detail and
remaining on this level is what keeps
conversation factual and uninteresting
the idea is to understand that what
people are saying is not really the end
goal but a door through which you can
enter into the living pulsing emotional

[06:00]
enter into the living pulsing emotional
reality of the other
if you can access that reality in
yourself and approach the other with
that understanding then you're actually
being empathetic
and if you can succeed in doing that
then you can forge a real emotional
connection with pretty much anybody
what do you think have you used this
skill in your own life let me know in
