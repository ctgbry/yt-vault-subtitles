most relationship needs are really
relationship wants the fact of the
matter is is that human beings need very
little in order to thrive one of those
things is some measure of psychological
or emotional safety or security so
abusive relationships are an exception
to this rule because
those abusive relationships are
violating a basic human need but in the
vast majority of cases when people say
that their needs aren't being met it's
actually probably more honest to say
that their their wants aren't being met
and I think the conflation of needs and
wants does two things one it makes the
other person out to be worse than they
are because not giving somebody
something that they need feels and
sounds a lot worse than not giving
somebody something that they want and
two it imbues the other the feeling of
the other person with this intensity
because if you confuse what you want for
what you need there's going to be this
like existential threat of survival to
not getting what you want
