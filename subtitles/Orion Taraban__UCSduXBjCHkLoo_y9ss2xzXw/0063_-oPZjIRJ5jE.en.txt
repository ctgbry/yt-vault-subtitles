i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
don't ignore air resistance do you
remember high school physics
all the problems you were probably asked
to solve require you to assume these
unreal ideal conditions for instance
they asked you to ignore air resistance
and aerodynamics problems or to ignore
friction and motion problems
and while helping students understand
the essential forces of nature by
reducing the level of complexity
involved might be a useful intellectual
exercise this is not at all how the real
world works in the real world there is
friction in the real world there is air
resistance
now if we're used to approaching
problems from an ideal perspective
then we're likely going to become
frustrated when resistance presents
itself inevitably in the course of our
action
furthermore we will probably
underestimate the amount of time energy

[01:00]
underestimate the amount of time energy
and resources required to obtain our
goals
where there is friction and air
resistance more time and energy is
always required to overcome those forces
in the movement forward this is a
universal law of nature
refusing to account for the presence of
these forces will likely result in poor
planning which has serious consequences
this is sort of akin to estimating how
long it will take to get from point a to
point b without traffic
not a very useful projection during
evening rush hour so you see this kind
of selective inattention can really
cause problems for folks
now it's also important to keep in mind
that some things require friction and
air resistance
planes fly because of air resistance
this force is basically what provides
the lift that keeps the plane in the air
so without air resistance we couldn't
have flight
primitive fire making requires friction
in these cases the resistant forces

[02:00]
in these cases the resistant forces
actually become the means to the end ah
very clever
take a moment to consider how you might
be able to use the resistance you
encounter in your life in the service of
your goals
so
not only is it not a good idea to ignore
resistance in the real world because it
will likely increase your susceptibility
to frustration and reduce your capacity
to plan realistically
but also because doing so will de facto
simply prevent you from achieving
certain ends which require resistance to
function
on the other hand if you expect
resistance you can factor that into your
calculations to make more prudent
estimates
you can also better keep your cool when
things go sideways because on some level
the resistance was part of your plan all
along
