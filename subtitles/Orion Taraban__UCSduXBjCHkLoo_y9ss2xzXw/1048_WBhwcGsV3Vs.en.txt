One of the mystical properties of life
is that it is the medium in which dreams
can be fulfilled. Of course, they don't
get fulfilled just by wishing. We
typically have to work very hard to
realize them. But at least life makes
that possibility possible. Now, on some
level, it's very difficult to get
anywhere in life if you can't cultivate
a go yourself attitude. To paraphrase
Alan Watts, if you can be talked out of
something, you deserve it. Here's an
unpopular truth. If you really want
something in life, your goal will almost
certainly not be fully understood and
supported and may even be criticized and
actively opposed by the people around
you, your friends, your family, your
girlfriend, your co-workers, etc. If you
allow these people who do not share your
dream and who therefore will not bear
the weight of regret should it go
unfulfilled to talk you out of what you

unfulfilled to talk you out of what you
really want then you deserve it.
Everything in this world has a cost and
if for whatever reason you are unable or
unwilling to pay it then the good in
question remains closed. And one of the
most common costs we pay in the pursuit
of our dreams is the support and
approval of those close to us. To
achieve your dreams, you have to be
willing to say go yourself. And this
means foregoing the support, approval of
and understanding of those who do not
share your vision. This is true even at
the highest levels of reality. Like some
Zen texts maintain that even should you
encounter the Buddha on your path, you
must be willing to strike him down if
necessary.
