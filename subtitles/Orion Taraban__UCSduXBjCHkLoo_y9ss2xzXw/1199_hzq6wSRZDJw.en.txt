What do I want and how should I live my
life are questions that become acutely
relevant to all of us at certain points
in our lives. This episode is about
those points in time. Contrary to
popular belief, the question, "What do I
want?" is not an easy one to answer. We
too often assume that people know what
they want and that's not actually true.
This is because most people's desires
are not their own. They are introjects
from their culture, their family, their
social media algorithms, etc. What they
are so often trying to satisfy is not a
desire that spontaneously arose inside
of themselves. Which is why when they're
fortunate or unfortunate enough to
satisfy these desires, they're often
left feeling disappointed and empty in
the aftermath of that satisfaction. They
often don't know why they feel this way.
But I do.
