i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
what men and women look for
in sexual partners
look men and women want different things
and one of the primary fallacies that
both men and women operate under in the
modern dating scene is believing that
what they want is also attractive to the
opposite sex
and so they signal the kinds of things
that they themselves would find
attractive in the opposite sex and it
generally doesn't work
now i'm going to paint with some very
broad strokes here but i hope to be able
to demonstrate that there is some truth
to these stereotypes how i usually
explain it is like this
men
want the barbie doll
women want all the stuff the ken doll
comes with
understand
now these preferences can obviously go
to a pretty dark place if taken to the

[01:00]
to a pretty dark place if taken to the
extreme in either direction
and i actually think that this is one of
the proofs of the truth of that
statement because we can see how these
extremes align neatly with the
complaints that men and women most
commonly have about each other for
instance women complain that men just
treat women like sex dolls like sex
objects
they don't care about her personality or
interests or feelings they just want to
use her body
on the other hand men complain that
women exploit their resources they're
happy to accept gifts and drinks and
dinners and assistance of all kinds but
they always seem to have a headache at
bedtime
what's interesting is that it's never
the other way around and and that's how
we know there's some truth
to what i'm saying i've never heard a
woman complain that she's providing
everything for her man and still not
getting laid
or a man complained that a woman is just
using him for sex
i'm sure either can happen but they

[02:02]
i'm sure either can happen but they
don't happen nearly as often as the
converse now i'm not here to make a
moral judgment about how men should be
like this or a woman shouldn't be like
that
i'm just telling you it is generally
attracted to men and generally attracted
to women
which means that if you are a woman
looking to attract a man's attention
you do not need to signal that you have
an mba
or that you've traveled around the world
or that you have a black belt in judo
those are impressive things in their own
right but they generally don't make you
more attractive to men
whether you like it or not your visuals
will do more to attract men than your
professional title or your personal
accomplishments
on the other hand if you're a man
looking to attract a woman's attention
you can cool it with the shirtless picks
man i'm not saying that your six pack
isn't impressive just that women don't
sort for the body the way that men sort

[03:01]
sort for the body the way that men sort
for the body as i said they sort for all
the stuff
the ken doll comes with
they don't care about the doll the doll
is identical they want all the cute
accessories women want a complete and
emotionally compelling lifestyle that
they can enter into and that's why there
are different flavors of ken
differentiated by lifestyle and
occupation there's malibu ken and cowboy
ken and stockbroker ken and astronaut
ken and quarterback can
they want the trappings and
opportunities of a specific lifestyle
and that's why some ugly ass dudes can
attract some very beautiful women
now if we're feeling cynical we can say
all men are pigs and women are gold
diggers because at the extremes that's
always how the exploitation happens
but most folks aren't so distorted
however that doesn't mean these biases
go away and if you're smart you can use

[04:02]
go away and if you're smart you can use
this awareness to your advantage
understand that the opposite sex wants
different things than you do and that
that's okay
when i go fishing i don't put what i
think is delicious on the hook i put a
worm on the hook not a piece of filet
mignon
learn to bait your hook properly and
you'll have an easier go of it in the
dating market
