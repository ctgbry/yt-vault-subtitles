i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to hunt for a partner
in a previous video i described how
there are really only two approaches to
finding a partner you can hunt or you
can fish one is not necessarily better
than the other however each one involves
a different skill set that is useful at
different times and in different
situations so it's good to understand
how they diverge today i'm going to be
talking about hunting
however before i do

so what is hunting
hunting is when you target a very
specific individual for your romantic
intentions you've made your decision
even before the approach and go directly
after that target
the idea here is that you go after what
you want
and then hope that the other also wants

[01:01]
and then hope that the other also wants
you in return and this is why hunting is
inherently a gamble you never really
know if the other will be sufficiently
interested in you to make something
happen
and that's why i said that in general
hunting is a more effective strategy the
higher your value in the sexual
marketplace why
because
statistically speaking you will have a
better chance of the other person
wanting you in return if you can clearly
indicate that you possess the traits
that are typically selected for by the
sex to whom you're attracted
as an obvious example a very physically
attractive woman is going to have better
luck hunting men with a cold approach
than a woman who is not as physically
attractive because on the whole
physical attractiveness plays a huge
factor in women's sexual marketplace
value to straight men
however if you want to be a successful
hunter you can't just be generally
attractive to the sex to whom you are
attracted
why
because you're not targeting the entire

[02:00]
because you're not targeting the entire
sex you're targeting one specific
individual and that specific individual
is going to have specific needs
interests and desires
needs interests and desires that may
even radically diverge from the
conventional expectation
so if you are targeting one specific
individual
you need to do your research
the way to successfully hunt is to
present yourself as either
a
the incarnation of the other's desires
or be
the solution to the other's problems
and to do this well you will need some
information
what does she like
what are his goals in life
where is she in pain
what can he not do on his own
when you answer these questions you can
begin to cultivate in yourself a
presentation that effectively
communicates that you are what the other
person is looking for
keep in mind that these questions are

[03:00]
keep in mind that these questions are
best answered through observation
than through direct inquiry and that
effective communication is often subtle
and indirect rather than blunt and
obvious
think of hunting like targeted marketing
the more you can tailor your
presentation to your potential customer
the more likely you're going to get a
sale
however to do this
you need both relevant information
on your target
and
a willingness to be flexible in your
approach
some people are going to hear this and
they're going to think
i am what i am take me or leave me i'm
not going to change myself to try to get
somebody else and to that i say
that's fine
but that's not targeted marketing
hunting is not really something that you
can do casually it takes effort and
preparation however if you put in the
work you'll get better results
