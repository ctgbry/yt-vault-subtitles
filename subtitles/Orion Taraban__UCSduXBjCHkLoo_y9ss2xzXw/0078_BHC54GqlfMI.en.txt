i'm dr orion taraban and this is cycax
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is
don't try to change the weather
why not
well among other things it's really not
possible to do so
rather than working to change the
weather focus on becoming a better
sailor
the better sailor you become
on some level the more irrelevant the
weather becomes
and this is because skillful sailors can
use most conditions to further their
goals
what's more since improving your
seamanship is actually within your
domain of control
you're much more likely to make progress
toward your identified goal this way
of course you'll use due prudence wise
sailors don't plunge heedlessly into
vicious squalls without good reason but
in general
skillful sailors are concerned about
prevailing conditions in inverse
proportion to their level of competence
in sailing
more competence less concern

[01:01]
more competence less concern
so this of course is a metaphor for
internalization and externalization
when we externalize we attempt to
control the environment in order to
cultivate or preserve preferred
emotional states or conversely to reduce
or eradicate unpreferred emotional
states
however this is an expensive exhausting
and ultimately futile endeavor
predicated upon an unrelenting campaign
of manipulation and control
since such methods tend to alienate and
offend others over time
they're also not a good long-term
solution despite the seductiveness of
their apparent short-term effectiveness
on the other hand when we internalize we
accept the environment for what it is in
order to cultivate or preserve preferred
personal virtues
or conversely to reduce or eradicate
unpreferred personal vices
we see each circumstance as an
opportunity to rise to the occasion

[02:00]
opportunity to rise to the occasion
whatever that occasion might be
rather than put our trust in prevailing
conditions
internalization empowers us to put our
trust in ourselves
and in our ability to overcome
difficulties and tolerate discomfort
such methods tend to attract and inspire
others over time
so they are a good long-term solution
despite the fact that they might take a
while to get off the ground
so let the weather do what it wants
focus instead on continuing to become a
better sailor
that's what i have to say for today if
