I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is winning
to lose so this is an important concept
to keep in mind when it comes to
relationships and it's a concept that is
relevant to both men and women here it
is I wish I had better news for you but
it's often the case that you can have
the person you want or you can have the
relationship terms you prefer but you
might not be able to have both this
means that you might not be able to have
the terms you prefer with the person you
want or you might not be able to have
the person you want with the terms you
prefer the only people who get both are
either very very attractive or very very
lucky now this doesn't mean that you
can't have a relationship with the
person you want but that this very often
comes at the price of the relationship
terms you would prefer

[01:00]
terms you would prefer
when this occurs I call it winning to
lose because on the surface you won
hooray you got the baddy or the alpha
but the costs associated with winning
are so high that the victory is often
AIC one What You've Won is a Perpetual
defeat you lose when you win and this
typically occurs in one of two ways in
the first case this can happen when
people put the person they want ahead of
the terms they prefer they have their
sight set on one person they're monom
maniacally focused on one specific
individual I want that man I have to get
that woman and that is the path of pain
why well since people are functionally
communicating with their behavior that
it's this one person or nothing or what
is b basically the same thing

[02:01]
is b basically the same thing
communicating with their behavior that
they're willing to do anything for this
one person they Place themselves over
the barrel with respect to the
relationship negotiation process if you
take that path you kind of can't bulk
later on that you aren't enjoying the
terms that you prefer because if you had
made the relationship conditional to
begin with you might not have succeeded
in securing the relationship at
all on the other hand it's good practice
not to focus on any one person until he
or she is consistently showing up in
your life in the way you would like that
person to show up in your life otherwise
you're effectively watering the weeds by
reinforcing behavior that you don't
prefer the issue is of course that the
person in question might not ever
consistently show up in your life in the
way that you would like that person to
so if you don't give up on that that

[03:00]
so if you don't give up on that that
person you'll have to give up on how you
would prefer that person to show up
because something's got to give right
however this can be dangerous when you
put the person ahead of the terms you
often lose when you win let me give you
a concrete example guys let's say that
you have your sights set on a real
Baddie I've got bad news for you
gentlemen it's extremely unlikely that
this woman is going to be pursuing you
it's extremely unlikely that this woman
is going to be proactively showing up in
your life in the way that you would like
her to you'd have to be an underwear
model or a professional athlete or a
billionaire or all three or something
like that to get her to move to you now
this doesn't necessarily mean that you
can't have a relationship with this
woman you'll probably still have to be
very above average for this to work but
it's not technically impossible it will
only be impossible if if you're only

[04:00]
only be impossible if if you're only
above average and expect her to show up
as you would prefer this means that you
will likely have to bait your hook you
might have to bait your hook with gifts
and trips you might have to bait your
hook with doing a bunch of you
couldn't care less about you might have
to bait your Hook by being her social
media photographer or couple's content
creator you might have to bait your Hook
by playing games with your interest and
attention you might have to bait your
Hook by being effusive and persistent
and pedestalize her contrary to popular
belief this can work from time to time
generally when a woman is getting out of
a relationship with someone else who
didn't do any of those things it's sort
of like a pallet cleanser a little
refreshment before she attacks the next
course so there are lots of ways to bait
your hook but you're going to have to do
something and it's probably something
that you wouldn't even consider doing
for a less attractive option that's just
how it is the issue is that if it works
you will kind of have to do what works

[05:02]
you will kind of have to do what works
forever in order to maintain the
relationship and the more the
relationship revolves around what the
woman wants that is the more frame is
seated to secure the relationship the
more expensive that relationship becomes
in the long term for the man trying to
rest that frame back or to get your own
needs met in the relationship will
invite instability and conflict because
that is not what that woman signed up
for you lose when you
win if you're interested in taking your
understanding to the next level I would

information hope to see you
aboard now the second way that people
can win a Perpetual defeat in their
relationships is by negotiating with
highly desirable men and women this is
independent of whether people choose to
put the person ahead of the terms as
previously discussed as I've said before
you can't have any relationship with
anyone for whatever reason people
believe that they should be able to have
the terms that they want with the person
they want to have those terms with and
that might not be true in fact getting
what you want from the person you want
to get it from is exceedingly
rare the more desirable a person is or
to put it another way the higher their
sexual Marketplace value the more likely
you are going to be the less powerful
person in the negotiation process and as
the less powerful person it will be
expected of you to seed ground consider

[07:02]
expected of you to seed ground consider
doing business with an A-list movie star
or a top tier athlete you might have to
give way more than you personally feel
that person is worth in order to get
them to sign with your team or project
furthermore you might have to give into
a host of ancillary demands their own
trailer a personal bodyguard top billing
champagne and caviar every night Etc
just to seal the deal this is the cost
of doing business with a highly desired
terrible individual why because this
individual knows that if you don't give
them what they want they can easily find
someone else who
will so highly desirable people can
functionally dictate their terms let me
give you a concrete example from the
other side ladies a lot of you are
cooked because so many of you are
targeting such a small subset of Highly
desirable men this not only increased es
your intrasexual competition

[08:01]
your intrasexual competition
dramatically but it reduces the
likelihood that any one of those highly
desirable men a wash as he is in sexual
optionality will commit to any one of
you as I discuss in the way it all ends
fewer than 1% of you will succeed in
this endeavor and this means that if you
want to secure the relationship with
such a man you will be expected to seed
ground this is the cost of doing
business why because this person knows
that if you don't give them what they
want they can easily find someone else
who will in the vast majority of cases
you will only succeed in securing a
relationship with such a man if you
allow him to dictate the terms of your
relationship and this generally but not
always looks like a willingness to
share the number one cause of commitment
hesitancy in in men has to do with the

[09:01]
hesitancy in in men has to do with the
surrender of his sexual optionality and
the degree of his hesitancy is
proportional to the amount of his
optionality now like the man in the
example I gave earlier you might
conclude that a relationship on
non-preferred grounds isn't worth it and
that would be your right but that might
mean that you will need to give up on
that person if you want relationships on
your terms then look to those who find
you very desirable and make peace with
the fact that it will be unlikely that
you will also find them very desirable
in return you can get what you want at a
price or you can take what wants you at
a discount and that's the
