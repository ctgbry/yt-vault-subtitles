I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is my needs
aren't being met
this phrase my needs aren't being met is
complete and utter
in fact it's worse than as not
only does it not tell the truth it
replaces the truth with a dangerous lie
big words I know but bear with me as I
give you my argument now before I spell
out why I dislike this phrase so much
please remember to like this episode And
subscribe to this channel it takes less
than a second it costs you nothing and
it's a great way for you too to stand
against the
so what's the problem with this phrase
so many problem it turns out it's
absolutely true that people have needs
however the needs of human beings are
surprisingly small human beings do not
need that much in order to thrive to be

[01:02]
need that much in order to thrive to be
happy and to have satisfying
relationships
one of the things that human beings need
is some measure of psychological or
emotional safety or security and when
that need isn't met we call that an
abusive relationship
so uh why did you and Cynthia break up
oh well my needs weren't really being
met
what do you mean well she yelled at me
all the time tracked my movements and
tried to get me fired by spreading lies
about me behind my back at my job
oh
when someone is in an abusive
relationship they don't say my needs
aren't being met they say I'm in an
abusive relationship and this means that
when people say my needs aren't being
met
they are not in an abusive relationship
because if they were they would say I'm
in an abusive relationship an abusive
relationship is one in which you don't
get what you need
so what are people actually saying when
they use this phrase what they are

[02:01]
they use this phrase what they are
really saying is I'm not getting what I
want in this relationship
this is so much more honest and it's a
more useful statement for a number of
reasons first of all if you're going
around telling people that your needs
aren't being met it makes your partner
or your ex out to be worse than they
probably are why is that because it's
one thing to not give somebody what they
want
and that's another thing altogether to
not give somebody what they need what a
cruel and neglectful ogre he must not
have had a shred of human decency you
poor thing and what does this do well it
gives the person saying this a little
patina a victimhood a patina that they
likely would not be entitled to if they
were more honest and said I'm not
getting what I want leaving a
relationship because you are not getting
what you need is blameless and

[03:01]
what you need is blameless and
courageous leaving a relationship
because you are not getting what you
want is callous and selfish at least
that's what we tend to think as a
society though in my own personal
estimation what better reason can you
give for leaving a relationship than the
fact that you're not getting what you
want
that's why you entered into the
relationship to begin with right you
didn't go there to get what you need you
went there to get what you want so if
getting what you want is sufficient
reason to start a relationship not
getting what you want should be
sufficient reason to end one
now reframing this statement I'm not
getting what I want
is much more useful than insisting that
I'm not getting what I need for several
reasons
there's really only one reason why
people don't get what they need they're
in Cruel oppressive and uncaring
environments

[04:00]
environments
however there are many reasons why a
person might not get what they want
one of which is they don't know how to
get it
and that wouldn't necessarily be the
other person's fault now would it
another is that they couldn't afford it
we why complain that a steakhouse is
unaffordable to most people it's a
steakhouse eat somewhere else if the
prices are too high
do you see when people go around saying
my needs aren't being met they're kind
of publicly not admitting their role in
that outcome and this means that such
people cut themselves off from the
possibility of learning why they are
they might not be getting what they want
which reduces the likelihood that they
ever will get what they want either in
this relationship or the next
finally when people conflate wants for
needs then people's wants become imbued
with this kind of existential urgency

[05:01]
with this kind of existential urgency
any possibility of not getting what you
want then becomes a threat to basic
survival which is what would happen if
they don't get what they need
and this is almost certainly a
hyperbolic Distortion of the actual
situation in which they find themselves
adding this kind of urgent intensity
to simple preference
can make relationships unstable
exhausting and manipulative
not a good idea
in general it's useful to be honest with
others but it's even more useful to be
honest with yourself
and it's actually very empowering to
admit yeah I'm not getting what I want
here
I'm gonna go someplace else
it's closer to the truth and it allows
for some degree of responsibility for
the creation of that outcome
what do you think let me know in the
comments below and thank you for
listening
