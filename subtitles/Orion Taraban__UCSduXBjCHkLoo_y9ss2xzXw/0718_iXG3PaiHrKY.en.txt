indeed the idea that women might have to
learn some skills and acquire some
knowledge and change their behavior in
order to get what they want from men is
ludicrous if not offensive to the
majority of Western women and to be fair
women probably don't have to earn a PhD
in men mostly because men are far less
complicated than women are men are often
oversimplified like it actually takes
more than sex and a sandwich to win us
over but they are far far simpler than
women so women wouldn't need to devote
several years of study to understand men
but you know they could get a
certificate in men like an associatees
degree in men that's reasonable like
some period of dedicated study would
probably be helpful even if it's
significantly shorter than men's
equivalent course and why is this study
required because just like the pickup
artists women can learn what words what
tones what actions what behaviors work
in order to increase the likelihood that
men will be interested in giving them
what they want
