I'm Dr. Orion Taban and this is Psychax
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is sex and
attention.
Okay, so within my economic model,
people enter into relationships when
they exchange unequal goods of
comparable value. And when it comes to
sexual relationships between men and
women, what typically occurs in the
value exchange is that men trade
resources for sexual opportunity and
women trade sexual opportunity for
resources. Now, it's sometimes the case
that people interpret this word
resources very rigidly and they think
that I'm just using this as a term
synonymous with the word money. This
leads them to conclude that I think that
all women are gold diggers or that I
think that all women are just interested
in designer handbags and the soft life.
And that is not the case. Certainly,
these women exist and sexual
relationships between men and women are
enthusiastically transacted every day
for these things. But this is only the

[01:03]
for these things. But this is only the
narrowest interpretation of the word
resources possible. Frankly, it suffers
from a lack of imagination.
The fact of the matter is that there are
many many different kinds of resources
and most of the important ones at least
when it comes to transacting sexual
relationships aren't material resources
at all to which one of the most
important resources for which women
transact their sexual opportunity is
attention.
And today I'm going to be talking about
how this particular resource attention
leads to all kinds of strange power
dynamics in the context of modern
relationships.
I'm going to say this as clearly and
directly as possible.
Sex is the most reinforcing thing you
can give to a man
and attention is the most reinforcing
thing you can give to a woman.

[02:01]
thing you can give to a woman.
Can't make it any simpler than that. And
this is really important to deeply
consider as it means that each sex has
the ability to really influence the
behavior of the other. For instance,
women could actually significantly
change male behavior on like the
population level. They would just have
to [ __ ] the men who do the things that
women insist they want them to do. You
hear this all the time in modern
culture. Women want men who are, say,
emotionally available or men with green
flags or men who make an effort. But
here's the thing. Women don't [ __ ] these
men. And men know this. Most men start
out in the sexual marketplace as good
faith actors. That is, they listen to
women and attempt to give them what they
say they want in order to receive what
they want in return.
But they eventually realize that this
doesn't work and they are forced to
acknowledge that other men who don't do

[03:00]
acknowledge that other men who don't do
these things get laid. Women might
complain about narcissistic men and
[ __ ] and [ __ ] boys, but despite
their complaining, they [ __ ] them. So
these types of men, or really this type
of behavior isn't going away anytime
soon. This is because sex is the most
reinforcing thing you can give to a man.
By the same token, the most reinforcing
thing that you can give to a woman is
attention.
And this inequality, the fact that the
most reinforcing thing isn't the same
for both genders, leads to a lot of
asymmetrical value exchange in sexual
relationships. For instance, as
previously mentioned, women complain
about [ __ ] boys. Why? Because they get
away with receiving their most
reinforcing good, sex, without
reciprocally providing the woman with

[04:00]
reciprocally providing the woman with
her most reinforcing good, attention,
and the validation and consideration and
commitment that often attends attention.
And this wrankles women because they
feel like they got the fuzzy end of the
lollipop in that exchange. But they
still [ __ ] [ __ ] boys. How else could
they be [ __ ] boys? Which is what keeps
them around.
Now, as common as this transaction may
have become in today's day and age, it
is not nearly
as ubiquitous and commonplace as the
converse. namely men providing women
with their most reinforcing good
attention without receiving their most
reinforcing good sex in return. Like men
are giving women attention, validation
and consideration without receiving sex
in return on the scale of billions of
people every day. And this has radically

[05:02]
people every day. And this has radically
changed the topography of the sexual
marketplace.

This situation doesn't just change
dating. After all, if a woman is already
receiving her most reinforcing good from
hundreds or thousands of other people,
then why does she need to transact with
any particular man in the sexual
marketplace? It fundamentally changes
committed sexual relationships between

[06:00]
committed sexual relationships between
men and women as well. Let me explain.
A lot of what is negotiated in committed
relationships are the boundaries that
separate the couple from the rest of the
world. Now, individual organisms have to
be delineated from the rest of the
universe to exist as individuals. And
good fences make good neighbors, right?
But what is often not discussed is how
often and to what extent these
boundaries have more to do with power
and control than maintaining the
integrity of the relationship. For
instance, if I'm able to eliminate your
options, which are my competition, while
simultaneously preserving my options,
which are your competition,
then I'm definitely going to be the more
powerful player in the relationship.
And I think this has a lot to do with
the fact that in the vast majority of
committed relationships, the women are

[07:00]
committed relationships, the women are
the more powerful players. And to
understand why, we have to move away
from a very rigid interpretation of
equality that expects a perfect symmetry
between what a man does and what a woman
does. That would make sense if men and
women were the same.
And that's what the last 60 years of
social programming have encouraged us to
believe.
But they're not. Men and women are
different and they want and need
different things from each other in
relationships. And one of these
important differences is the asymmetry
between men and women's most reinforcing
goods. As previously discussed,
women tend to be the more powerful
players in committed relationships
because the general expectation here is
that in committed relationships, there
is symmetrical sexual exclusivity.
And this would be fair if both parties

[08:00]
And this would be fair if both parties
valued sex equally,
but they don't.
It is a far more important and
reinforcing good for men than it is for
women. So what's the problem? Well, in a
symmetrically sexually exclusive
relationship, both parties agree to
relinquish their optionality and become
each other's exclusive sex dealers. But
the power inherent in that exclusivity
is directly related to the perceived
value of the good in question. Like no
one might bulk if there's only one yarn
store in town because people don't
really need to knit. But look what
happens when there's only one gas
station or supermarket. The prices are
always higher. Women in sexually
exclusive relationships are like the
company store. Her monopoly on a desired
good tends to significantly inflate
prices. Now, women might bulk at this

[09:01]
prices. Now, women might bulk at this
and say, "Well, I'm sexually exclusive,
too, Orion. So, whatever inconvenience
or expense the man experiences, I
experience as well. It's equal."
And it's like, "Ah, no, no, no, it's not
equal because the exclusivity in
question is related to his most
reinforcing good,
the primary thing that he's in a sexual
relationship with a woman to obtain.
So goods of comparable value are not
typically exchanged in these
arrangements.
So what would be equal? Well, you should
be able to figure that out by now. If
appropriate boundaries in a relationship
are predicated on each party becoming
the monopolized dealer of the other
parties most reinforcing good,
then an equal arrangement would be if a
woman became a particular man's
exclusive sex dealer and a man became a

[10:02]
exclusive sex dealer and a man became a
particular woman's exclusive attention
dealer.
Oh [ __ ]
Okay, let's review. The most reinforcing
good to a woman is attention in the
sense of being seen, being heard, being
emotionally valued and validated, etc.
That is like sex to a woman. And women
will do all kinds of things, including
offering sex to secure that attention
from the men they want to receive it
from. However, when a woman doesn't
relinquish other sources of attention in
the context of a committed relationship,
then what she has functionally done is
succeed in eliminating the man's
optionality while retaining her own.
That is, the man is constrained from
seeking sex elsewhere,
but the woman remains free to receive
attention and validation from other
sources.
This leads us to conclude that a woman

[11:01]
This leads us to conclude that a woman
who receives validation and attention
outside of her relationship is actually
comparable to a man who gets sex outside
of his relationship.
And this optionality asymmetry directly
contributes to power asymmetries in the
relationship.
And this asymmetry is protected by a
good deal of entitlement. That is, a
woman's attempt to constrain a man from
having sex outside of a committed
relationship is considered healthy,
justified, and appropriate boundary
setting.
But any attempts from a man to constrain
a woman from receiving attention and
validation outside of a committed
relationship is considered toxic,
controlling, and manipulative.
It's a sign of his insecurity and
fragile masculinity to boot. And so in
the wake of this shaming, many men often
tacitly consent to this optionality

[12:00]
tacitly consent to this optionality
asymmetry. And this keeps women the more
powerful players in the majority of
relationships.
And this is actually very difficult to
fix. Like most women are going to
receive attention and validation
passively as they move through the
world, but they absolutely can also seek
out attention actively through social
media, clubbing with the girls,
entertaining their orbiters, etc.
It is very difficult, if not impossible,
to constrain a woman's ability to
receive attention and validation from
society at large. Because what would
that look like? It would look like, why
is your account public?
Why are you going out dressed like that?
Why are you spending time with those
men?
These are all attempts by men to control
their exclusive access to the resource
for which she is primarily transacting
the relationship.
In fact, and you might think this is

[13:01]
In fact, and you might think this is
totally nutty, but some cultures have
gone so far as to put women in a literal
sheet from head to toe so that they're
not able to receive passive attention
and validation from outside sources as
they move through the world. But I think
Western women are about as likely to
surrender their social media accounts as
they are to wear a burka. And why would
they? After all, no one surrenders power
willingly.
My point here is that what is equal
isn't always fair, and what is fair
isn't always equal. And as long as men's
sexuality in committed relationships is
constrained, but women's
attention-seeking behaviors are not,
women on the whole will continue to be
the more powerful players in their
sexual relationships.
