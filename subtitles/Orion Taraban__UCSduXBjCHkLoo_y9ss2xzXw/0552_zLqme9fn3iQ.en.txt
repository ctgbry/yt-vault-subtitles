I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is higher
slow and Fire fast so this is a rule of
thumb in corporate Human Resources if
you are vetting applicants for an
important well-paid job at your company
then you are likely going to be hiring
slow and firing fast in this context
hiring slow means that it's probably
going to take several months to move
through this process
will likely undergo several interviews
over that time some will be structured
some will be unstructured some might be
formal tests of ability some might be
informal assessments of character and
these applicants will likely be vetted
by many different stakeholders and if
anyone of those stakeholders identifies
something that doesn't sit right then
the whole process stops on a heartbeat
that's firing fast and this is wise
because most applicants will not be the
one the companies higher so defaulting

[01:01]
one the companies higher so defaulting
to rejection is the safer bet
statistically and the company may have a
lot to lose by taking on someone who is
neither competent nor virtuous so it's
appropriately
self-protective in general if it works
in business it works with women and this
is no different when it comes to vetting
a woman for a relationship it is
imperative that you hire slow and Fire
fast allowing yourself to become
emotionally involved with with a woman
before you've appropriately vetted her
for that relationship is a risky
proposition that is unlikely to produce
the desired outcome why because most
women will not be a good fit for you so
defaulting to rejection is the safer bet
statistically and you absolutely have a
lot to lose by entering into a
relationship with someone who is neither
competent nor virtuous so it's
appropriately
self-protective if you don't hire or

[02:00]
self-protective if you don't hire or
slow then you will likely be misled by
your emotional needs and or your sexual
attraction to foreclose prematurely in
which case you will likely only have
brought on someone competent and
virtuous through sheer dumb luck
relationships are always a role of the
die gentlemen but we can do things to
even the odds as I've previously
discussed it's your job men to resist
the urge to emotionally invest in a
given woman maturely and to that end
you're going to want to slow down the
hiring process as much as possible there
are several really good reasons for this
among them is the reality that when it
comes to women you can always escalate
but you can never
deescalate what does that mean well
let's take something simple like
frequency of contact when I first get
involved with a woman all I'll let about

[03:00]
involved with a woman all I'll let about
a week go by from the previous
interaction before I contact her again
this creates a long Runway to move
toward regular daily communication too
many guys make the mistake of falling
into daily communication with a woman
too soon and this is a mistake because
you leave yourself No Escape Route if
you train a woman to expect constant
communication from the very start then
even responding a few minutes later than
you otherwise would is going to create
problems what's going on is everything
okay why are you ignoring me and you
created this problem by training her to
expect a certain Cadence of attention
and
interaction However the fact of the
matter is that this frequency of contact
is only warranted with someone you trust
someone who makes your life better and
someone who you've already integrated
into your lifestyle St and someone

[04:01]
into your lifestyle St and someone
you've just met almost by definition is
not this someone if things are going
well you can always decrease the space
between subsequent contacts you can
always escalate but you can never
increase this space you can never
deescalate at least not without creating
unnecessary difficulties in your life
remember the easiest way to make a baby
cry is to give it a lollipop and then
take it away if you never give it a
lollipop to begin with you won't have a
problem on your hands and if you do
decide to give it a lollipop only do so
if you're pretty sure you're not going
to want to or have to take it away
later now before I go any further if
you're liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this episode to someone
who might benefit from its message
because it's Word of Mouth referrals
like this that really help to make the
channel grow you can also hit the thanks
button and tip me in proportion to the
value you feel you've received from this
episode it's your contributions that
helped make all of this happen I really

[05:01]
helped make all of this happen I really
appreciate them thank you very
much it's actually fairly normal not to
give too much attention to someone you
just met like don't you have other
things to do do you really have so
little going on in your life that you
can afford to chat for hours with
someone who just a short time ago was a
complete stranger to you my brothers
even if you don't have something better
to do which is a problem that you should
address sooner as opposed to later you
have to act like you have something
better to do because if you don't you're
not going to leave any space for that
something better to eventually come into
your life it's just going to be filled
with the first woman who showed some
degree of interest in you and the jury
is still out on her so this isn't really
playing a game as much as it is acting
like a mature adult who has interests
responsibilities and an emotionally
compelling lifestyle so that's an
example of higher slow in the context of
d

[06:00]
d
on the other hand Fire fast means that
as soon as it becomes clear that a woman
shows a red flag whether it's a
concerning Behavior or a toxic
personality trait you stop investing in
her
emotionally that means that you either
disengage from her entirely or you Silo
her into a casual sexual relationship
and you keep a tight rate on your
emotions men it is your fault if you
allow yourself to become emotionally
involved with untrustworthy women or
emotionally disregulated women or
aggressive disrespectful women like I
understand that there are some good
liars out there and many of those good
liars are women but not all liars are
good in fact most of them aren't these
women tell on themselves all the time
ask any man who has been through the
ringer of a dysfunctional relationship
and if he's honest with himself

[07:00]
and if he's honest with himself
he can generally look back and identify
signs of that dysfunction very early on
in the courtship process he saw the red
flags and he ignored them or
rationalized them away typically because
he had already decided to emotionally
invest in this particular woman and
typically because she was either really
hot Andor she was him really
good their sexual attraction or their
lack of optionality functionally Trapped
them in a situation
that they understood was not in their
best interests but that they hoped might
nevertheless and what facilitates the
ability to fire fast a very large
applicant pool some companies are
constantly interviewing applicants even
if they're not actively hiring do you
understand if you wait to interview
until you have an opening you're
basically planning to have a disruption
in your operations and this is something

[08:00]
in your operations and this is something
that successful companies can easily
avoid with a little forethought a large
applicant pool allows companies to hire
the right person for the job instead of
the first person to show
interest optionality makes it easier for
people to act with dignity in their
relationships because it functionally
enables them to not have to choose
between being alone and being
respected women kind of have this
optionality
passively like by default since the
majority of men will have sex with the
majority of women a woman could go out
tonight and get something going if she
wanted to it might not lead to a
committed relationship but at least she
will be desired she will be accompanied
and she will have her foot in the door
the same is not true for men men have to
create their optionality it takes time
and effort to do so but trust me it is
worth it when a woman shows her true

[09:00]
worth it when a woman shows her true
colors it's optionality that will help
you to tell her to go pound sand
allowing you to fire fast and it's
optionality that will make you more
patient and less hungry about moving
things along allowing you to hire slow
