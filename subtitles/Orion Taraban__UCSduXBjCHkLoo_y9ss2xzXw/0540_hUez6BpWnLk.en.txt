when it comes to fighting with a woman
the only winning move is not to play the
greatest Victory is that which requires
no battle and this is a worthwhile goal
because let me tell you gentlemen my
life has been so much more peaceful so
much more loving and so much more
enjoyable since I figured out how to do
this and I'm here to share my secrets
with you today if I can do it you can do
it too this may go without saying but
enjoying a conflict free relationship
with a woman starts with appropriate
selection at this stage of my life I now
believe that 90% of a successful
relationship is choosing the right
person as I've discussed previously you
can't have any relationship with anyone
what does this mean well in the context
of this discussion it means that you
cannot have a peaceful and easygoing
relationship with a woman who is
disagreeable or provocative or addicted
to drama or unable to regulate her own
emotions Etc it's just not possible
