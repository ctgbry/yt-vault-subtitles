as Jesus said only in his hometown among
his relatives and in his own house is a
prophet without honor this quote from
Jesus also suggests that the same
Prophet might be honored outside of
these circles the good that you do is
generally recognized by people outside
of your immediate family and friend
group where that recognition will not be
experienced as personally threatening as
a narcissistic injury and this is why
your biggest fan is probably someone you
haven't met yet the last place in the
world that may celebrate what good you
bring is where you came from the tragedy
here is that just because when people
start to stand up they are not
recognized and supported or even that
they are chastised and censured by the
10 or 20 people closest to them these
people believe that there's nothing
particularly special about them or that
they don't have anything of value to
give and it may be that their value may
be ignored or discounted because it is
threatening to the other people's
egocentrism or their vanity
