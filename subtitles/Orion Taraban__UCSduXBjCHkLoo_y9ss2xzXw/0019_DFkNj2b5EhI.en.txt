i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is
don't blow the whistle on yourself
so obviously i'm taking this metaphor
from
professional sports if you're engaged in
the flow of any sport
you're focused on the play you're
focused on the ball you're focused on
moving further down the field you're
shouldn't be focused on making sure that
you
are 100 within the rules of the game
within the boundaries of the field
obviously that's something you need to
keep in mind
but that shouldn't be your priority
there's somebody else on the field whose
job it is to make sure that you're in
bounds and playing by the rules that's
the referee
you can't be both the mvp and the
referee
at the same time you have to trust
that if no one is blowing the whistle on
you

[01:00]
you might still be in the field of play
the play is still active keep running
down the field
if there's a significant problem if you
go out of bounds
people will let you know your co-workers
your partner
your friends they'll call your attention
to the fact that you've stepped out of
bounds
now i'm not advising that you go out
there and
let's say flagrantly foul people to do
things that you know are just
against the the rules and the spirit of
the game
but on some level if you're not fouling
you're not playing the game optimally
it's like how successful could you be as
a basketball team if your commitment was
is to never foul anybody fouls are part
of the game
and you don't foul willy-nilly you foul
strategically
in the service of your goals so
the i'm not asking you to do anything
that's that's against
uh your own conscience or to do

[02:01]
uh your own conscience or to do
something that is spiteful or
technically against the spirit of the
game but if you're policing yourself
then that's energy and effort and focus
that could be better
expended in the service of your goals
trust that there will be people around
you
whose job on some level is to give you
the feedback
that hey you might need to pick up the
pace on this project a little bit
or you know you've been slacking off
over here or that wasn't cool what you
did
people will tell you this makes me think
about machine learning
optimization according to research the
optimal
rate of success for machine learning
is 85 if it's more than 85
they're not really learning these
machines they're just demonstrating what
they already
know and if it's a success rate of less
than 85
they're kind of struggling and most
likely are going to make inappropriate
or incorrect conclusions
but if they're incorrect 15 of the time

[03:01]
but if they're incorrect 15 of the time
that gives them space
to actually learn and to grow
and to develop progress so on some level
are you making mistakes 15 of the time
are you stepping out of bounds 15 of the
time that's optimal
because the more that you do that the
more you learn how to kind of
walk the line if you if you notice any
professional athlete at the height of
his or her game the action is always on
the line
it's like in tennis the service what's
right on the inside of the line
the the wide receivers in professional
football games they're going down the
sidelines
and they're like putting toes on the
field the more masterful you get
the more you you learn how to work with
the boundaries
because that's where the proficiency and
the
excellence really occurs thanks for
listening
we'll talk more in future episodes bye
