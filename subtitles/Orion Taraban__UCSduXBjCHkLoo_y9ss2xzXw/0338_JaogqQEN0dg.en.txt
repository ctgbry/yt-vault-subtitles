I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the invisibility of loss
when you pass through a significant
tragedy death disease betrayal
it changes who you are and it changes
how you see reality you cannot go back
to the person you were before which is
part of the grief associated with
tragedy it means in part grieving the
loss of the person you used to be
and the change is so great that we can
basically say that there are two groups
of people those who have passed through
tragedy and those who haven't passed
through tragedy
yet
I say it like that because nobody
escapes being touched by a loss at some
point in their lives so everyone ends up
in the first category over a long enough
timeline but until that happens there
are these two groups of people now
before I explain the importance of this

[01:01]
before I explain the importance of this
distinction please remember to like this
episode And subscribe to this channel it
takes less than a second costs you
nothing and it's an easy way for you to
show your support so do the thing
now
these two groups
fundamentally separate Humanity it's
almost like they live in two different
realities for better for worse I
experienced a great deal of death and
loss and suffering from a young age
and sometimes I would try to talk to my
friends about some of the things that I
was going through
and they would simply blanch
look uncomfortable and change the
subject
and I eventually understood that they
just had no frame of reference to begin
to comprehend some of the things that I
was going through like they literally
could not think them because they were
so foreign to their experience
I learned that talking about certain
things with certain people just made

[02:00]
things with certain people just made
them uncomfortable and I wouldn't be
understood anyway so I just stopped
talking about them and buried them
inside of me I used to think that I was
cursed to have gone through so much pain
and loss and suffering now I understand
that I wasn't the only person to pass
through tragedy and many people have it
much worse than I did
just that I was one of the first
people to pass through tragedy in my
generation
and this in fact might be of some
benefit to me for two reasons first it
may allow me to be of some real help to
others when they do inevitably pass
through loss in a way they might not
have been able to be of help to me and
second it potentially allowed me to
understand at an earlier age what was
really important in life
sometimes people only figure that out at
the end of their lives and that's a real
tragedy
now as I've said passing through tragedy

[03:01]
now as I've said passing through tragedy
changes who you are and how you see
reality and that means that certain
aspects of reality are just invisible to
folks until they've also been touched by
loss and there's a really great example
of this psychological truth in Harry
Potter of all places so allow me to
share it with you
when Harry and the others first come to
Hogwarts they get off the train at the
station and they get loaded into these
apparently magical self-driving
carriages that Ferry them from the
station up to Hogwarts proper how
delightful now Harry is no stranger to
suffering however it's not until the end
of the third year when Harry Witnesses
the death of his Godfather that he comes
in to direct conscious contact with
death
and when he gets off the train to start
his fourth year he sees that the magical
carriages rather than driving themselves
to Hogwarts are actually hitched to

[04:00]
to Hogwarts are actually hitched to
these terrifying creatures called
thestrals they're these black skeletal
horses with bat wings and they totally
freaked Harry the frick out and he tries
to point them out to Ron and Hermione
who seem totally chill about these
things and they just think Harry is nuts
and that's because they can't see them
apparently none of the kids can see them
none of the kids except for Luna whose
mother died a few years back so Luna has
seen the thestral since day one and she
tells Harry yeah only people who have
been touched by death can see the
thestrals people think I'm crazy
but that's okay I know that they'll see
them eventually
so innocence is a kind of guardianship
but in this role innocence also prevents
people from seeing the true nature of
reality the festrals are real it's their
invisibility that is the illusion

[05:00]
invisibility that is the illusion
because it's and it's absolutely useless
to point that out to people until they
pass through loss themselves as they
very literally can't see something
invisible
but don't worry
it's only a matter of time before they
do so it's generally a good idea to be
kind to each other
