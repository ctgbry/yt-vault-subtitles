there's nothing wrong with young men per
se but in general women don't want them
they have no wealth or status or
experience and there's nothing wrong
with older women per se but in general
men don't want them they're not as
physically attractive as their younger
competition so what you have are two
gendered classes at two different stages
of their lives that are generally
equivalent with respect to their
normalized sexual Marketplace values so

older woman

family is probably not in the cards um
and that works both ways the woman
probably isn't going to want to
reproduce with a young guy in his early
20s who may not have a job or a career
or much in terms of material prospects
and vice versa the man probably isn't
going to want to take on that kind of
responsibility with a woman who's
nearing the end of her biological window
