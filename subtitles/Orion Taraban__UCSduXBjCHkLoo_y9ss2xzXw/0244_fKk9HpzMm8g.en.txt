in my episode why bad habits persist mo
dickens comments their vice is to that
particular person absolutely we call
this a process addiction not all
addictions are to external substances
like opioids and alcohol some are too
endogenous or internal substances like
dopamine a great example of this is
gambling gambling is a very serious
process addiction
that creates dependency
on internal reward circuits
created by the variable reward schedule
of gambling
now we can also see this in toxic
relationships toxic or abusive
relationships have
cycles just like gambling where there's
a lot of desperation followed by jackpot
sometimes there's a big blow up
fight
followed by cruel separation but then
also
tearful forgiveness and joyful reunion
and
this can happen many times over again it
can be very addictive
