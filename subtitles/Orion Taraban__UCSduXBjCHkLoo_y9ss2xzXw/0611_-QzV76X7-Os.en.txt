it was a miracle when Jesus walked on
water because given our understanding of
buoyancy that just shouldn't have been
possible these events are considered
miraculous primarily because basis of
comparison is our understanding of the
laws of physics however if the basis of
comparison is say the nothingness of the
infinite void then everything becomes
miraculous relative to the nothingness
of no time no space and no matter
everything in the observable universe is
miraculous water flowing downhill is
just as miraculous as water flowing
uphill because on what basis can we
reasonably assume the existence of water
hills and flow frankly the direction of
that flow is probably the least
miraculous aspect of the whole shebang
from this perspective it doesn't really
matter what we're talking about a tree a
cloud a broken shoe everything is
miraculous and everything is beautiful
it's an amazing way to go through life
it's also an overwhelming way to go
through life but it gets easier to
navigate with practice
