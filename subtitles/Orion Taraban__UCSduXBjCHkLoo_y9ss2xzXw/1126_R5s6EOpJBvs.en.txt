Kylen Mbappé says he'd pay so much money
to be a normal human being. Speaking to
Envoy Special, he said, "Going to buy
bread at the bakery. I'd pay so much
money now to be able to do this kind of
thing, which is normal for most people."
He added, "I've lost spontaneity, the
spontaneity of being a human being."
Asked what he would do if he could
become invisible for 48 hours. Mbappy
replied, "I'd spend my 2 days outside.
That's for sure. I can say that without
thinking. Go eat quietly in a brazerie.
Go out, go with friends, party quietly
without anyone to come see me. The next
morning, a nice brunch in the sun on a
terrace. There you have it. Simple
things in life.
&gt;&gt; And I think that's wonderful to keep in
mind because the life that the ordinary
person lives is what the hyper
successful,
most wealthy and powerful people in the
world envy.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's strange the things that you
get rid of. I came up with this idea,
prompted by that in the Uber this
morning on the way to the gym. came with
this idea of a Titanic problem, which is
an issue that everyone says you're in

[01:00]
an issue that everyone says you're in
such a privileged position to deal with.
And this is a quote from my friend Adam
Maserioni. He says, "This is an extra
special type of tragedy. A tragedy that
unfolds while while everyone cheers like
being on the Titanic after the iceberg,
water up to your chin, with everyone
telling you that you're so lucky to be
on the greatest steam ship of all time.
And the Titanic is indeed so huge and
wonderful that you can't help but agree.
But you're also feeling a bit cold and
wet at the moment.
