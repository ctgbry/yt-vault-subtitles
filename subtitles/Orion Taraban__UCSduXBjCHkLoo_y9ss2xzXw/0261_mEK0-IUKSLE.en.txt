and you've got to feel it to heal it mo
dickens comments when sober reality is
magnified you realize how boring and
mundane life so often is absolutely
especially after the rollercoaster ride
of an act of addiction with the
terrifying highs and the dizzying lows
once addicts get off the roller coaster
they feel that life is insufferably dull
and that's one of the prime triggers to
relapse in addicts of all kinds
and i've gone through this phase in my
own recovery uh when i stopped using
drugs i did feel like life was boring
and dull and flat but that was a
temporary phase that i passed through i
realized that it was just dull and flat
by comparison to the unsustainable
roller coaster that i was on and as the
months went on i could see that there
was variability and ups and downs
and variety and novelty in sobriety it's
just um on a smaller and more subtle
scale
