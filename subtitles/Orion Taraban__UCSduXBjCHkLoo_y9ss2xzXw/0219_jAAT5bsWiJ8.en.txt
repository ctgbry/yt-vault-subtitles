i'm dr o'brien taraban and this is
psych's better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the fundamental romantic
misunderstanding sounds very official
doesn't it well i've given this a lot of
thought and i've counseled a lot of
people and so there's a good reason why
i'm calling this the fundamental
romantic misunderstanding it's the
misunderstanding that tends to trip
people up most often in the context of
their romantic relationships
so what is it
very simply the fundamental romantic
misunderstanding is that one's
attraction due to circumstances
has been mistaken
for one's attraction for a specific
individual i'll say it again
the fundamental romantic
misunderstanding is that one's
attraction due to circumstances
has been mistaken for one's attraction
for a specific individual

[01:00]
for a specific individual
what does that mean
look there are lots of things that
increase attraction
circumstantially
these are things like rejection
obstruction
distance
unobtainability
uncertainty
mystery emotional polarization
etc
these things tend to increase attraction
whether we like it or not it's just the
way that attraction works
and sometimes these circumstances
conspire to dramatically increase a
person's attraction
the fundamental romantic
misunderstanding is believing that your
attraction
is for the actual person
in instead of understanding that your
attraction is a response to the
circumstances around that person
it's really really important to exercise
careful discernment in the dating
process when you find yourself becoming
romantically attracted to someone ask
yourself why am i attracted to this
person

[02:00]
person
is it because of her virtues or his
sense of humor
or her beauty
or his drive or her sweetness
characteristics that actually inhere in
the other person
or do i keep thinking about this person
because he hasn't responded to my texts
or she's playing hard to get
or he turned me down or she gave me
mixed signals
because these things tend to increase
attraction whether we like it or not
and this is dangerous because let's say
you actually succeed
in entering into a relationship with
this person yay
right well
think again
who do you actually end up with at the
end of the game if you are more
attracted to the circumstances around
the person than the person him or
herself
you may end up with somebody that you're
not actually attracted to
it might be someone you don't even like
and that's a problem

[03:00]
and that's a problem
because
then you're either going to create drama
in the relationship in order to keep the
feeling alive
or you're going to walk away from that
relationship having wasted your time
when it comes to attraction you have to
look real
closely to see the truth
something to consider
