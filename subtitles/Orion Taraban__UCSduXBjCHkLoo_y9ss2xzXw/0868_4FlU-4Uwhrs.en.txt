You'll hear people nowadays talking
about how a man should grind throughout
his 20s. What are your thoughts on that?
Yeah, I saw an interesting quote from
Alex Hermoszi on this where he basically
says that you're going to misspend your
20s and I agree with this. That's why
I'm bringing it up. Um there's there's
like two ways that you can misspend it
according to him. One, you can misspend

and the diversity of experience or you
can waste it by grinding. And it's a
waste either way because let's say you
take the path of fun at 30. You might
have had all these experiences. You
might have lived a lot, but now you're
behind in respect to the material game
of money and status and wealth. By the
same token, if you grind in your 20s,
you might actually have a pretty decent
income or a license in a coveted
profession or something along those
lines. But you might also be like an
interpersonal idiot. You might not have
had any kind of relationships. You might
not have experienced anything of the
world. You might not even really know

basically. I think that those people
often end up sometimes having midlife
crises further down the road because
they're like, I I can't just work my
whole life. I can't just do what other
people expect me to do. That's what I've
done my whole life. What mommy wanted,
what my teacher wanted, what my wife
wanted. I want to live. and they've 40
45 years old.
