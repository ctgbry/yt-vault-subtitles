People nowadays complain about not being
able to find someone who is worthy of
dating in terms of serious
relationships. Where should people go to
find a partner? Yeah, I hear that a lot.
I hear that both on the men's side and
on the women's side. I actually have an
episode that's coming out. It's called
How to Meet Women. There are really only
four places to meet women in today's day
and age. There are dating apps, cold
approach, social circle, and social
media. And I rank those four ways in
that order because they go from the
fastest, easiest, hardest way, like the
least successful way to the most time
consuming, difficult, highest success
rate way. You can spin up a dating app
in 30 minutes. It costs nothing. You
want the premium, you throw a few bucks
at it, and suddenly you get access to
thousands of singles in your area, but
the success rate with dating apps are is
very low. On the other hand, you move in
the direction towards social media. You
can get a following of a few hundred
thousand or a few million on certain

thousand or a few million on certain
platforms and suddenly it's like a
non-stop funnel of interest towards you.
The script is flipped, especially as a
guy, but it can take many years to
develop that kind of platform or stage
for women to find you. So, it's a much
higher success rate. There's nothing
that works better in today's day and age
than social media game.
