Conservatives have a hard time with
evolution because it it goes against
what's in the Bible. Liberals have a
hard time with evolution because it
defines gender norms or it defines that
there are two genders or that genders
had certain roles historically. And so
it kind of puts it in this strange place
in the middle where you can somehow
offend both sides.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think the the liberal side is
to split hairs between sex and gender.
Yeah. is that there's biological sex and
then there is gender which they consider
to be a social construct. Yeah. And
there might be some truth to that. Uh
&gt;&gt; well there's truth in it if they believe
there's truth in it but it's not based
specifically in a scientific finding.
&gt;&gt; No, it's more theoretical than anything
else. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But you can create survey data to
substantiate and reify certain concepts.
Like that's easy to do.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh it's also interesting like when
I taught my class on emotion, I had some
text from Darwin to initiate the course
because where do feelings come from?

[01:00]
because where do feelings come from?
It's like not all organisms demonstrate
the capacity to feel.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like it's really seems to be mammals,
creatures with limbic systems that seem
to be able to process and communicate
emotion. And Darwin wrote a whole book
about where emotions come from. And we
think that they're just like intrinsic
to us, but they really served survival.
