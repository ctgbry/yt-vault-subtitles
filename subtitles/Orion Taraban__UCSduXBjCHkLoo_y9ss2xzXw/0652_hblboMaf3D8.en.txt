no matter how well you vet a woman no
matter how much due diligence you
perform you will ultimately be rolling
the dice with respect to that particular
relationship there's no way around it so
what you have to understand is that all
relationships with women are a form of
gambling you can learn the rules and do
your research but you still have to roll
the dice and this means that on some
level you should approach women like you
approach gambling and the first
unbreakable rule of gambling is that you
never ever ever under any circumstances
ever gamble with more than you can
afford to lose this is the fundamental
rule of gambling all professional
gamblers have their Kitty the money they
play with and they have the money they
need to live and support their
Lifestyles the two must remain separate
and distinct when a gambler starts to
play with the money he needs to live is
precisely the moment he crosses over
into a gambling addiction
