Another question is why are so many
successful women unhappy? The concept I
waited longer to have children, got the
master's degree, made a lot more money,
but yet they seem to be reporting a lot
of them seem to be unhappy, maybe
unfulfilled.
&gt;&gt; Uh there's probably lots of reasons for
that. Uh I think potentially on the
deepest level is that they haven't been
enacting their own life choices. They
have been doing what their teachers and
their parents and their society have
incentivized them, encouraged them, and
rewarded them to do in much the same way
that maybe traditionally a man would
very quickly get a college degree, get
married, have some kids, and then at 40
have a midlife crisis and say, "Holy
I've done everything I was
supposed to do, but none of these ideas
actually came from me."
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And maybe that's the source of
some middle-ag, which is this limonally
conscious recognition that the life I'm
living was not really chosen by me
&gt;&gt; and I'm fulfilling potentially someone
else's dreams. It's not very authentic.

else's dreams. It's not very authentic.
That that's a a deep level. It could
also be that, you know, it's like women
have been fighting very hard for
generations to have careers and to
compete in that arena with men.
&gt;&gt; And their victory is that
congratulations, you now get to work
until you're 65, 68 years old, which men
have only done out of necessity. Like
most people are working to make enough
money so they don't have to work
anymore. The idea that I'm going to work
and have that be a badge of honor or as
something that is the meaning and
purpose of my life is kind of absurd.
Like that's a very recent belief if it
even exists today, right? But women have
fought very hard for that right and now
they they have it and it's not
everything that it's cracked up to
