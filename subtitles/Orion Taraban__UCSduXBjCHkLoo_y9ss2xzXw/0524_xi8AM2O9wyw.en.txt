I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych
haacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to understand people now on some
level everyone is a psychologist because
everyone is trying to understand other
people specifically they want to
understand other people because they
want to be able to predict their
behavior and to get what they want from
them and this is a worthwhile Pursuit
because the more you understand yourself
and the more you understand other people
the more you can get what you want from
life now there are many many popular
Frameworks for understanding people that
exist in the world today these are
things like attachment Styles Myers
Briggs personality types and Love
Languages just to name a few there are
literally thousands of formal and
informal measures of individual
personality a few of these enjoy a
robust body of substantiating evidence
like attachment Styles but even these
tend to be inappropriately

[01:00]
tend to be inappropriately
overgeneralized the vast majority of
these measures however are basically
glorified horoscopes and they are
popular for the same reason astrology is
people love hearing about themselves
some of them are interesting and most of
them are harmless but it's probably best
not to put too much stock in them that
said trying to understand other people
through the lens of the individual that
is through the lens of his or her
personality or int psychic Dynamics is
kind of a trap
it doesn't really work the idea for
example that if I understand my
partner's Big Five personality traits or
their Love Languages or their Myers
Briggs or their star signs I will then
be able to successfully navigate a
relationship with them and get what I
want is fundamentally flawed in the vast
majority of cases this doesn't
work and that's because all of these
personality metrics they kind of only
exist in a vacuum to the extent that
they work they describe a

[02:01]
they work they describe a
person divorced and isolated from
culture context and Circumstance and
that is not the world in which people
operate and it's not the world in which
we actually have to navigate
relationships For Better or Worse a much
much better predictor of behavior than
any of those other metrics are
incentives if you can understand the
incentives under which other people are
operating then you will be able to
predict their behavior with far greater
accuracy than you would if you had all
that other personality data combined
this is because the vast majority of
people respond to specific incentives in
exactly the same way we're most of us
not as unique and individual as we think
we are to use a very extreme example the
vast majority of people would give you
what you wanted if you were to put a gun
to their heads introvert or extrovert
high in neuroticism or low and

[03:01]
high in neuroticism or low and
conscientiousness INTP or ENFJ sun in
Leo or moon in Capricorn they're all
going to hand over their wallets and it
would be hard to predict which in a
group of people wouldn't act this way
just given their personality data and
please do not put guns to people's heads
my point here is that when the
incentives are sufficient to motivate
action none of that other stuff really
matters so to understand other people
you have to understand the incentives
under which are currently operating and
when it comes down to it there are only
two things that motivate action the
carrot which is reward and the stick
which is punishment or to put it another
way Pleasure and Pain different people
consider different things rewards and
punishments and that's the origin of the
variability in human action but all
people navigate the world according to
these two po stars now before before I
go any further if you're liking what

[04:01]
go any further if you're liking what
you're hearing please consider sending
this episode to someone who might
benefit from its message because it's
Word of Mouth referrals like this that
really help to make the channel grow you
can also hit the thanks button and tip
me in proportion to the value you feel
you've received from this message I
don't do corporate sponsorships or
product placements so I really do rely
on your contributions to help keep all
this running I really thank you for your
help now the first thing you have to
understand about incentives is that
they're not equal as I discussed in the
balance of Pleasure and Pain these two
things are
asymmetrical for whatever reason humans
have been constructed such that pain is
more painful than pleasure is
pleasurable this means among other
things that people will do more to avoid
pain than they will to secure pleasure
this is why according to John gottman's
research a relationship must have at
least five pleasurable interactions for
every painful one to justify its

[05:00]
every painful one to justify its
continued existence so if we were to
kind of extrapolate from that finding we
can tentatively conclude that pain is
like five times more painful than
pleasure is pleasurable and that
probably means that the stick is five
times more motivating than the carrot is
it is what it is in any case this means
that if you understand the various
incentives the rewards and punishments
under which people are operating then
you can predict their behavior with a
high degree of accuracy without knowing
anything else about them now the second
thing you have to understand is that
most people don't see reality clearly
they don't in fact most people are kind
of sleepwalking through life in a kind
of Quasi hypnotic state so what does
this mean this means that with respect
to what we're talking here a stick
doesn't really have to be a stick a
carrot doesn't really have to be a
carrot in actuality a stick only needs

[06:01]
carrot in actuality a stick only needs
to be a stick in someone's mind to
function as a punishment and a carrot
only needs to be a carrot in someone's
mind to function as a reward and in many
cases psychological sticks and carrots
are far more effective than our actual
sticks and carrots in
reality this means to Be an Effective
psychologist you have to be able to see
the world through the framework of a
given individual's perception within
that perception there will be
psychological carrots and psychological
sticks that do not exist in objective
reality but that nonetheless exert an
enormous influence over that
individual's Behavior to give just one
concrete example consider how people
pleasing behavior develops in certain
individuals because these folks have a
distorted view of other people's
disappointment that it is far more
dangerous or threatening than it likely
is in it that person is going to

[07:01]
is in it that person is going to
experience the disappointment of others
as this enormous stick the stick doesn't
really exist in objective reality but
that doesn't matter it only needs to
exist within the framework of their
perception and once you appreciate the
magnitude of that stick then their
behavior makes sense within their
psychology they are appropriately
responding to avoid an enormous
punishment that would otherwise befall
them if they were to disappoint an
important other their reasoning is
fairly rational what's irrational is
their
perception a lot of the work I do as a
psychologist has to do with helping
people see that a lot of the carrots and
sticks that they're responding to only
exist in their perception and not in
let's say veritical reality and this is
the key to understanding people if you
can understand the incentives that exist
within their perception then you will be
able to predict their behavior Behavior

[08:00]
able to predict their behavior Behavior
very accurately it's also the key to
getting what you want from other people
apply the right carrots and the right
sticks at the right time and you can get
pretty much anything from anyone you're
really only limited by the punitive
function of society and your own
conscience and understanding which
sticks are punishing and which carrots
are rewarding to specific others is far
more useful than understanding that they
are an anchor or an infj or any other
label floating around in popular
psychology that's almost all
incentives are what matter if you
understand incentives you understand
people what do you think does this fit
