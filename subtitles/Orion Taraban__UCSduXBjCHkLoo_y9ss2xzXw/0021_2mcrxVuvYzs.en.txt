i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology the
subject of today's short talk is
follow the function okay i'm kind of
stealing this from
um investigators police investigators
who often say okay you want to know who
the culprit is
follow the money who stands to benefit
as a result of this crime
so if you want to potentially look at
your life and you see certain habits or
certain behaviors
that on the surface seem to cause a lot
of harm or distress or difficulty for
you but
you still have trouble getting rid of or
changing to a more
adaptive version follow the function
what is this behavior
doing in the context of your life it has
to serve a function or else it still
wouldn't be there
even if it's dysfunctional remember most
of the word dysfunction
is the word function most of what is
dysfunctional
is functional it just creates additional
problems
on top of the problem that it's been

[01:01]
on top of the problem that it's been
designed to solve
so in the vast majority of cases
maladaptive habits vices behaviors
they serve a function that in the mind
of the individual
is a net positive so for example
i often work with people who are chronic
worriers
they worry about things all the time
hundreds of times a day they know
rationally that most of the things
they're concerned about will never
happen and yet they sort of feel
powerless
to to block this compulsion
and they often resist efforts to
intervene and address the issue
and this has to do with the function
that that behavior is serving in that
person's life
which is within their own subjective
experience they believe
at a deeper level that the worrying
behavior keeps them
safe that if they weren't worrying about
things in the future
they would be even more exposed and
vulnerable than they already are

[02:00]
vulnerable than they already are
so even though they understand that the
worrying corrodes their quality of life
they believe you know as a sum total
that behavior to be a net positive
because the preventative or safety be
um associations with respect to that
behavior
outweigh the negative deleterious
aspects of that behavior
so they keep it because it's a net
positive and that's true for pretty much
any quote unquote dysfunctional behavior
that you have in your life
is it's still around because on some
level you believe it to be a net
positive
that it's preferable to giving it up
which might expose you to more distress
or more harm
do you see what i'm saying so that means
to address for example the issue of
chronic worry you have to find some
other more adaptive behavior
that still meets that function i.e the
function of reducing my feeling of
vulnerability
or the function of increasing my feeling
of safety
in my life both of which are important
needs the issue is that

[03:00]
needs the issue is that
this behavior meets those needs while
creating a lot of
other problems in the in the meantime so
if you're having difficulty
understanding why
something persists in your life despite
it causing you pain or distress
follow the function what is it doing in
your life how
is it on some level a net positive
within your own
subjective understanding that's what i
