Do you think that someone's past
relationships can skew their
expectations in a way that can damage
their future relationships?
Well, yeah, sure. Absolutely. I mean, we
we only have a limited amount of
experiences. Most people have only had a
few relationships in their lives by the
time they get to even like 30 years old.
That's subject to the law of small
numbers. I mean, if I just randomly
chose five people off the streets of Los
Angeles and had a conversation with them
or had a relationship with them, what
kind of data would that give me about
what to expect from the sixth? I don't
think very good or reliable data.
There's so many different kinds of
people in Los Angeles. So, even if I
talk to five radically different people,
it doesn't necessarily mean the sixth is
going to be a chimeic conglomeration of
aspects of the five. But that's what I'm
going to expect just because I haven't
sampled sufficiently. Does that I mean
that should make sense to you as a
doctor, right?
So I think humans can't avoid it. We are
pattern recognition machines. We are

pattern recognition machines. We are
meaning making machines and we're always
trying to predict the future in order to
be safe and to secure our desired
outcomes. And we're going to make those
predictions based on our past
experiences. And for better or for
worse, if we've only had a couple of
past experiences, whether they're good
or bad or indifferent, that is going to
inappropriately give us confidence in
what to expect Next.
