i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's brief conversation
will be to be to have a peaceful garden
it's necessary to be a ruthless gardener
okay so if you want to be able to enjoy
a quiet
and well-ordered garden where
things flourish in proportion to each
other
where the herbs and the flowers um
you know pour forth their redlands and
their bounty
where everything is sort of sweet and
lively it's actually behind the scenes
required to be
a ruthless and cruel
gardener to everything that isn't
conducive to that environment we don't
just like
you know cut cut the weeds down a good

[01:00]
you know cut cut the weeds down a good
gardener
pulls the roots out from its the weeds
out from their very roots there's this
great word called deracinate which means
to pull out from the roots
and it does it even when it's small and
soft and vulnerable it cruelly
and callously takes it out of the earth
which is you know
the medium of cultivation for it to grow
so there is a sort of discipline around
being a gardener which is that you
can't allow weeds to proliferate
and the longer you wait the more of a
problem you tend to have on your hands
it's not like the weeds will ever really
go away by their own accord the problem
only gets bigger
and more extensive as time goes on
so the idea here is to know what type of
garden you want
and to take action in defense and in
support of that
environment because you know a weed is
determined
it's the unwanted flower there's nothing

[02:02]
it's the unwanted flower there's nothing
necessarily
inherently bad about that plant it's
just that it's not wanted
at that time in that place in that
vision of a garden
so what uh what is a wheat is defined by
our vision
if we don't have a vision then it's like
what's a weed uh what's a flower
you know anything can kind of grow there
and it's just this sort of
you know chaos this profusion of
undifferentiated life
so once you have a vision of what you
want then implicitly you kind of have an
idea of what you don't want
and what is not conducive to its
realization
so in order to def defend
to guard against um the encroachment of
chaos
we have to be vigilant and disciplined
with the deracination
of that which undermines our vision
kind of no exceptions it needs to be
pulled out by the roots
it needs to be you know exterminated at
its source

[03:00]
its source
so this is something that
we can do specifically in our own minds
so this is a metaphor for our own
psychology our minds are like gardens we
can
live inside of them in an ordered and
peaceful way but in order to do that we
have to
be very disciplined and energetic
about exercising the weeds which are the
the
thinking the thoughts the cognitions
that contribute to undermining that
order and peacefulness so that's what i
have to say about that
