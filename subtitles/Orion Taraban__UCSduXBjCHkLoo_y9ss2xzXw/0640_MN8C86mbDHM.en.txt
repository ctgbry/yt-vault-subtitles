so there's been kind of like a a a
gradient ramping us up to the current
wokeness and I think along the way was a
lot of this kind of like oh men you're
not supposed to be stronger better more
competent whatever than a woman you're
supposed to be equal and so do you think
that has something to do with men's lack
of Courage like like they were talked
out of being C courageous Sur surely
there's all these other peripheral
factors like if you're watching porn all
the time you never have to muster up the
courage to actually talk to a woman I
mean yeah from a very young AG AG I was
taught men and women are equal men and
women are equal men and women are equal
and that can be interpreted as in many
many different ways the the correct
interpretation in my opinion is to
understand like the way that we use that
language in say the Declaration of
Independence which is that all men like
the human race men and women all men are
created equal like we're all equal
before some sort of higher authority
that from a spiritual level no one
person's life has more value or dignity
than any other person's life
