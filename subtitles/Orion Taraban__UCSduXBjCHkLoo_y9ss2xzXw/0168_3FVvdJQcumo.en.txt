i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to stop having panic attacks without
medication
this is hard to summarize in just five
minutes so this will be the first of two
episodes on the subject as a
psychologist i've helped dozens of folks
stop having panic attacks the process
generally takes two to three months and
it can be done without resorting to
anti-anxiety medications and this is
great because those medications well
beneficial in some respects
also come with a host of liabilities and
should be used very sparingly if at all
i've also personally suffered from panic
attacks so i know what they're like and
i know how terrifying and awful the
experience can be
i really wouldn't wish them on anybody
and so the strategies that i'm going to
talk about in these videos have worked
for me personally and have worked for
many of my patients so here goes
what i'd like you to consider
is that panic disorder is fundamentally

[01:02]
is that panic disorder is fundamentally
a dysfunction
in the mechanism of your attention it's
an attention problem
what do i mean by that
well
usually the first time you have a panic
attack it seems to come out of the blue
and it's extremely terrifying and
upsetting
and after experiencing that people are
understandably anxious about the
prospect of the panic attack returning
they don't want it to come back
and since they don't really know what
caused the first one they basically
believe that it could return at any
moment so they're kind of constantly on
the lookout for signs that the panic
attack is coming back
so what they do
is they engage in checking behavior
relative to the early onset symptoms of
panic attacks
for me personally
my early onset symptom was that my heart
would start to race so my checking
behavior was that i would check my pulse
a lot
for other people it's a feeling of being
hot so they check their temperature or

[02:00]
hot so they check their temperature or
feel their forehead do you understand
now
this checking behavior is motivated by a
desire to keep us safe
to kind of reassure ourselves the panic
attack isn't happening
or to prepare ourselves in the event
that it is
but here's the issue with this
what we go looking for
we find
if your doctor performs a number of
tests on you it's highly likely that at
least one result will come back abnormal
even if you're otherwise perfectly
healthy
so if you go looking for early onset
symptoms of panic attacks you are going
to find early onset symptoms of panic
attacks
and what makes this even more
problematic
is that when we pay attention to our
natural unconscious physiological
processes we change them
as a way of demonstrating this
i'd like you to take a moment and just
notice your breath
you see

[03:00]
you see
you changed the way that you were
breathing whether you wanted to or not
you were breathing smoothly and
regularly just a moment ago when your
breathing was unconscious and when you
brought your conscious attention to your
breath you changed the way that you were
breathing and this change could be
considered an abnormality in the context
of your normal functioning
and what makes this most problematic is
that when we attend to these changes
we increase the intensity of those
changes
i'd like you to consider that attention
is like a magnifying glass
whatever we attend to gets bigger
and the more we attend to it the more it
fills the container of our consciousness
and the more that's all we see
finally we have the cherry on top
the attribution that this intensified
abnormality brought on by our checking
is something very negative it's a
judgment like oh no my heart is racing
the panic attack is starting again i'm
having another panic attack or even this

[04:01]
having another panic attack or even this
is bad
i'm having a heart attack
if you validate this attribution with
your belief then congratulations you've
just given yourself a panic attack
so that's the recipe for a panic attack
we constantly check for signs the panic
attack is about to return
in the act of checking we change our
unconscious physiological processes such
that they're more likely to now be
abnormal
by attending to that abnormality we
increase its intensity
we interpret the meaning of that
intensified abnormality in a highly
negative light and finally
we believe our own interpretation is
true
so
now you should understand why i call
panic disorder an attention disorder
paradoxically it's through our efforts
to keep ourselves safe that we put
ourselves in harm in harm's way
and now that we understand what this is
i'll talk about more what to do about it

[05:02]
i'll talk about more what to do about it
