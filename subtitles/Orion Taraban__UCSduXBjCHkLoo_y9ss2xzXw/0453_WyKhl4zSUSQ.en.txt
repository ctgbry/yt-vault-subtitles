I'm Dr Orion terband and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is most men
are
Romantics so this statement flies in the
face of what most people believe isn't
it the women who are interested in
flowers and candlelit dinners and
Wedding Bells Etc turns out that this is
only the most superficial
conceptualization of Romanticism once I
reveal the belief at the core of
romantic love you'll understand that
most men on this planet today are
Romantics especially in the western
world let's get to it in the sexual
Marketplace things are not always what
they seem for instance many women are
romantic on the surface and pragmatic at
their core they are making cold rational
decisions about who to mate and date and
often do a great deal of social Research
into their target

[01:00]
into their target
and use all kinds of strategies to
secure the best possible deal for
themselves among their available options
on the other hand men tend to be
pragmatic on the surface and romantic at
their core there's even this popular
machismo that strut surrounding crows
man I don't care I don't even need women
they are Stone Cold up until the girl
walks out the door and then they're a
mess for weeks or months afterwards
never trust a woman generally means of
course that the man in question once in
fact trusted a woman probably because he
was under some illusions with respect to
how women love a lot of angry men are
actually spurned Romantics who still
cling to their beliefs about how things
are supposed to
be and this becomes even clearer when we
appreciate the most common male romantic
belief it's not what you expect but but

[02:00]
belief it's not what you expect but but
if you can understand why this one
belief might be true then it opens the
door for everything else that I've been
teaching on this channel about
intersexual Dynamics this is key and
it's going to hurt me to say it because
it's actually a really beautiful idea
it's just not based in reality and here
it is the most common male romantic
belief is I can be loved for who I am
that's it this is a romantic belief and
it's a romantic belief because it's
based on fantasy it's a beautiful
fantasy mind you the idea that you can
be loved just for who you are or
accepted as intrinsically enough and
deep down that's what most men want let
me tell you women out there it would be
so easy to get any man that you wanted
all you have to do is cater to this
romantic fantasy I don't need any of

[03:00]
romantic fantasy I don't need any of
that stuff those other girls need I'm
not materialistic I love you for you and
I love you just the way that you are
just being with you is
enough every man in his heart of hearts
wants to hear this from his woman and
that's the fantasy the fantasy is as a
man you can just
be and that who you are can be
sufficient to secure the love and
loyalty of a woman
and it's not I really really wish it
were but it's not you can have that kind
of relationship maybe with your parents
though not all of us are that lucky
maybe with your dog you can have it with
God but you cannot have it with a woman
that you're in an adult relationship
with the fact of the matter men is that
you have to provide benefit to a woman
in order to justify her choosing you
over all of her other available options

[04:00]
over all of her other available options
she's there because of what you do for
her in terms of resources and lifestyle
opportunity and of what you do to her in
terms of Attraction and emotional
experience a woman is not going to
choose a man for the love in his heart
or the beauty of his soul or the
understanding in his
mind that's not how women operate they
even have trouble considering a man's
potential it's what he does that counts
now before I go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this video to someone
who might benefit from its message
because it's Word of Mouth referrals
like this that really helped to make the
channel grow and you can also hit the
super thanks button it's the three
little dots in the lower right hand
corner of the screen and tip me in
proportion to the value you believe
you've received from this message
because it's your donations that make
all of this happen I couldn't do it
without you and I really appreciate your
support so here it is men have to

[05:00]
support so here it is men have to
provide value in order to secure mating
and dating
opportunities if you can accept the
truth of this one statement then
everything else that I've been talking
about with respect to the behavioral
economics of relationship starts to make
sense it is essentially the red pill in
one sentence on the other hand the blue
pill is fundamentally romantic ideology
that I can be loved for who I am that my
loyalty and my virtue and my love can
and should be enough to satisfy a woman
it's not women like romance but they
don't need it what they need is value
what men when men don't have that to
offer they try to compete with the men
who do by offering love Instead This is
why I said that romance is for men the
idea that the intensity of my devotion
or the the purity of my love is

[06:01]
or the the purity of my love is
something more noble more refined than
anything that can be bought or anything
that a man with means and success can
provide and therefore should be prized
higher than those things in a woman's
decision-making is ultimately a
marketing strategy it's an attempt to
influence the perception of the target
audience to increase demand for the
commodity in
question in reality we all know that
it's not enough for a man to be loved by
just being himself because if it were
every man would be in a
relationship every man would have women
talking to him every man would have
options with women remember there's more
of them than there are of us so simple
supply and demand should be working in
our favor and that is clearly not the
case what happens is that the top level
men are securing the vast majority of
female attention

[07:00]
female attention
and they do this not because of who they
are deep down inside but because of what
they've built and of what the women
believe they could provide as a
consequence of their status and success
that's why the women are there and once
you come to terms with that you kind of
have to grieve the idea that a purely
romantic love with a woman is possible
grief I think it really is a grieving
process and this is hard for a lot of
guys because it's actually a beautiful
dream if that's how the world worked
maybe the world would be a better place
a comment on one of my former videos
sums this position up nicely the person
wrote wouldn't it be great if we could
just be who we are and people would love
us for that instead of playing all the
psychological
games maybe it would be great but that's
not the world we live in my friend and
abiding in a fantasy ultimately causes
more pain than accepting reality

[08:00]
more pain than accepting reality
ever could something to consider one
final word of advice if you'd like to
learn more about this I would highly
recommend that you check out my playlist

romantic love that together conspire to
create tragic and unfulfilling outcomes
