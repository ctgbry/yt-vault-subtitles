I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic today short talk is the importance
of sex in relationships so this is one
for the ladies out there both men and
women have a hierarchy of priorities
when it comes to what they're looking
for in a relationship and while sex is
important to women
it's typically not as important as it is
to men and I'm going to try to explain
why sex is so important to men in this
video and to do that I'm going to use
the analogy of professional
relationships because
counter-intuitively what works in
business is often what works in
relationships but before I offer this
analogy please remember to like this

here we go let's start with professional
relationships what distinguishes a
professional relationship from all the

[01:02]
professional relationship from all the
other relationships on the planet like
what is the one thing without which the
professional relationship does not exist
even if everything else is present
that thing is the receipt of money
a job is your money relationship in the
vast majority of cases it's the only
relationship that people have in which
they receive money it's the defining
feature of a professional relationship
without which the professional
relationship does not exist consequently
it makes sense to prioritize the
financial elements when considering
entering into a professional
relationship sure you can want to be
passionate about your work but the truth
is you can get passion elsewhere
you can want your work to be meaningful
but you can get meaning elsewhere do you
understand most people are not going to
get money elsewhere so it makes sense to

[02:01]
get money elsewhere so it makes sense to
prioritize that in the scheme of needs
when entering into a professional
relationship all right now let's
transition so what distinguishes a
romantic relationship from all other
relationships on the planet one is the
one thing without which the Romantic
relationship does not exist even if
everything else is present you guessed
it that thing is sex
a romantic relationship is your sex
relationship
in the vast majority of cases it's the
only relationship in which
people have sex and in an exclusive
relationship it's the only relationship
where people are allowed to have sex
it's the defining feature of a romantic
relationship without which the Romantic
relationship does not exist consequently
it makes sense to prioritize sexual
elements when considering entering into
a romantic relationship do I find this

[03:02]
a romantic relationship do I find this
person attractive do we have chemistry
how frequent is the sex what kind of sex
are we having it's like you can want an
understanding partner
but you can get understanding from a
confidant you can be
emotionally supported but you can get
emotional support from a friend
on the other hand most people are not
going to get sex elsewhere and in a
committed relationship your partner is
kind of your exclusive sex dealer
like the company store at which you have
to do your shopping so it makes sense to
prioritize sexual elements in the scheme
of needs when entering into a romantic
relationship now the pushback I
generally get from this position is
basically well Orion this just sounds so
mercenary like all you care about is
money all you care about is sex and
that's not actually what I said
these aren't the only things to care

[04:00]
these aren't the only things to care
about
they're just the most important things
to care about in certain contexts I
don't care what other reasons you have
for going to work if you stopped getting
a paycheck you wouldn't show up on
Monday
as passionate and fulfilled and aligned
with the mission statement as you were
you probably wouldn't work for free
by the same token if the sex in a
relationship dries up it's highly likely
that the guy eventually won't be
reporting for Duty especially if he
isn't married to you hopefully that
makes sense
