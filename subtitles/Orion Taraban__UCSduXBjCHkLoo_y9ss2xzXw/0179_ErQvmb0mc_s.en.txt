i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is a
surprising insight from harry potter
so today we're going to take another
dive into pop psychology a few days ago
i was thinking about one of my previous
talks on self narrative the episode was
called change your narrative in case
you're interested
in which i made the argument that the
only difference between the story of the
victim and the story of the hero is the
final chapter
like the victim the hero goes through
all kinds of hardships and suffers all
sorts of losses
he just emerges victorious in the end
and without that hardship and loss he
could hardly be considered heroic
a great example of this is harry potter
i mean look at how we first meet harry
both of his parents have been murdered
he acts as a servant to an emotionally
abusive family that's been gaslighting
him his entire life

[01:01]
him his entire life
and he lives in a crawl space beneath
the stairs
i mean there are plenty of things in
harry potter's origin story that if he
chose to he could have been hung up on
for the rest of his life any one of
those things could mess somebody up the
hard part is breaking free of the
impulse to victimize yourself
because it's sometimes the case that in
the course of our lives we have to deal
with hardship and unfairness and tragedy
and loss
how do we deal with this without
becoming victims
the story of harry potter has a
surprising answer
in the story the entities that intervene
between harry and his tormentors
are the owls
owls that carry letters from dumbledore
about hogwarts and the truth of who
harry is
and it's interesting that rowling
decided to use the image of the owl
to do this
maybe it's just a convenient narrative
device to build attention and anticipate
hagrid however

hagrid however
a bird like an owl is an interesting
symbol psychologically the bird is a
messenger between the heavens and the
earth
that's why in traditional christian
iconography the holy spirit is
traditionally depicted as a bird usually
a dove
a bird is a go-between a messenger that
maintains the connection between what's
above and what's below
now i don't know if rowling intended any
of this but there's kind of a lesson
here
how do we resist the urge to
self-victimize when confronted with
hardship
well we have to be on the lookout for
our owls
the part of ourselves
that is still connected to the divine
and remembers who we really are
and to do that
you have to kind of listen real close
because this part often speaks in a
small quiet voice especially if you're
not in the habit of listening to it
and this part has and always will have

[03:01]
and this part has and always will have
commerce with the divine aspect of your
being
and by connecting with that voice
which will tell you the truth of who you
are and what you're going through
you can begin the process of overcoming
whatever circumstances you happen to
find yourself within
you are never so alone that this
messenger is unavailable to you
if you're willing to listen
what do you think was this too much of a
stretch
