I remember in my 20s, I would ask a
whole bunch of women, "What are you
looking for? Just tell me." Cuz out of a
good faith desire to just give a woman
what she wanted. I thought that if I did
that, it would increase my chances of
getting into a fulfilling relationship
with one. That's what I wanted. And I
would get those I like loyal men. I like
kind men. I like to feel safe. And I was
thinking, well, Jesus, I'ming those
things. Like, why am I having such a
problem? And I realized the part that
women always leave out is they they do
want those qualities, but they want
those qualities from men that they're
already attracted to. It's like if
they're not attracted to a man, him
being kind and gentle and committed and
loyal is not going to transform her
indifference into desire. The attraction
always has to come first. And what's
interesting is she can't possibly know
if that attractive man is loyal or kind
or gentle. So that takes she has has to
interact with him and relate to him to
figure out kind of those personality
characteristics. So whatever factors go
into determining female attraction, they
don't have to do with what she says with

don't have to do with what she says with
her mouth because on some level she's
already decided, I'm attracted to that
guy. I sure hope that he's kind and
loyal, etc. But the attraction comes
first. And so that's why, and this is
the part that always that women always
leave out, which can kind of mislead men
because it can make men think, well,
I'll just be romantic. I'll be kind.
I'll be patient. I'll help her. And they
don't understand that these kinds of
nice guy tendencies don't work to
transform indifference into desire.
