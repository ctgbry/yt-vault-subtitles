I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
get any man you want the hook all right
so this is the second of a three-part
series addressed to women who are
interested in having the relationships
they want with the men they want to have
them with the three caveats are the same
if you neither need nor want a man then
this episode is not for you this is not
about getting any man but about getting
high value men that you actually want to
be in relationships with and this is not
a moral or ethical exhortation for women
to act in certain ways but a discussion
of effective pragmatic strategies let's
get to it as I discussed in my first
episode a woman can get any man that she
has direct access to and the master key
to unlock that relationship is being
useful this means providing value that
is instrumental in helping the man

[01:00]
is instrumental in helping the man
question achieve his goals and fulfill
his mission understand that the
responsibilities you take on in this
regard are a privilege because they are
what allow you more intimate access to
the man you have in your sites if you
can succeed in integrating yourself into
the day-to-day Logistics of his life it
will be next to impossible to extricate
you which is a de facto commitment just
like men have to earn their sexual
optionality with women women need to
earn their SI
commitment optionality with men however
this by itself is not enough to seal the
deal especially in the Modern Age
there's one other thing you have to do
and this is why you need to have direct
access to the man in question the second
thing that women have to do to get any
man they want is they have to be the
nastiest [ __ ] version of themselves
they can possibly

[02:01]
they can possibly
I'm not kidding a lot of women will do
the right thing with the wrong men
they'll sleep with a cute guy but one
with no real chance of a future on a
first date but when they meet a man with
potential they'll say that they're
dating intentionally and they're looking
for something serious and want to take
it slow it should be the other way
around ladies the less interested you
are in a committed relationship with any
given man the longer that person should
wait for sex and vice versa why is that
because sex is reinforcing it's a reward
for men and there's no point in acting
like you don't understand this because
you tend to withdraw it as a punishment
so you're aware that sex is reinforcing
you just typically go about applying
that reinforcer not in the most
intelligent Manner and I'm here to tell
you that if you like a man if you're
attracted to him and you can see a
potential future with him you need to
throw the good stuff at him as much as

[03:01]
throw the good stuff at him as much as
you can as fast as you can there are
several reasons why this is a good idea
in the first place withholding sexual
opportunity doesn't work with men with a
lot of options as I discussed in the
episode how to have a fulfilling sexual
relationship if your Diner is closed
your customers aren't just going to wait
around in hunger they're going to go to
another restaurant the only man on whom
this strategy Works tend not to have
other places to eat and it works because
they reason that waiting at that
restaurant will still get them fed
faster than finding another option
elsewhere however since people want what
other people want I'm going to go out in
a limb and predict that the man that
you're targeting as your best option
isn't going to be one of these guys
women desire in groups if you want him
other women do too so this strategy

[04:00]
other women do too so this strategy
isn't going to work with this guy he's
just going to move on to someone who's
open for business some of these guys may
have thousands of options you need to
get to the point think of the sexual
opportunity as your elevator pitch you
may only have a very small window of
time within which to demonstrate value
and that window may not open again
anytime soon in the second place unlike
women men have what's called a a
refractory period I'm sure you ladies
have encountered this in your dating
lives most men are thinking about sex
constantly thinking leads to looking
looking leads to finding finding leads
to acting the only time men aren't
thinking about sex is immediately after
having it now men have a thing for
novelty and variety which are as rooted
in their sexual instincts as strength
and symmetry are in women's so while
throwing sex at him isn't a guarantee he

[05:01]
throwing sex at him isn't a guarantee he
won't look elsewhere it is by far your
best possible strategy to prevent that
food isn't interesting when you're full
so you don't want the man you're
targeting to eat at another restaurant
right so be sure he doesn't leave the
house hungry if you can provide that at
a Cadence that matches his libido then
you will functionally acquire a monopoly
over his sex life this gives you de
facto sexual exclusivity so this is how
you get any man you want you integrate
yourself into the day-to-day mechanics
of his life by providing instrumental
utility so it would be difficult to get
rid of you and you generously and
proactively keep him sexually satisfied
so he doesn't look elsewhere got it now

on this channel I don't take corporate
sponsorships or do product placements so
this is how I stay independent and how I
do what I need to do to keep this
channel going thank you so much for your
support now it's important to appreciate
that I'm not advising you to just have a
lot of sex with the man that you've
targeted that's good but it's not
foolproof the language I used was to be
the nastiest [ __ ] version of
yourself as possible this technically
doesn't mean you even have to have
intercourse because this is relative to
your previous sexual
experience this means that if all you've
ever done with a man is whole hands then
you better be prepared to do the nasty
[ __ ] handh holding of your entire

[07:02]
[ __ ] handh holding of your entire
life like all stroking his fingers and
rubbing the back of his hand reel soft
and giving it little squeezes do you get
it like no matter what you've done you
have to do more with the man you really
want and this is because a man is going
to compare your sexual behavior with him
against your previous sexual history as
a means of measuring how attracted you
are to him no man especially a high
value man with lots of options is going
to feel good about moving forward with a
relationship if you've treated other men
better in the sexual department and I'm
using this word better from the
perspective of men because remember it's
the cat who decides what milk is good
they are going to feel like a schmuck
committing to a woman who has given away
the same or a better sexual opportunity
more freely more quickly and more cheap
L to someone else so your current sexual

[08:02]
L to someone else so your current sexual
behavior is titrated to your previous
sexual history this means that if you've
had sex with a guy on the first date
before guess what you're gonna have to
do that with this guy because if the guy
you want finds out that you made him
wait you're going to have trouble why
because regardless of your feelings
those other guys were able to access the
same or better sexual opportunity more
cheaply this means that if the guy you
want requests C certain sexual behaviors
and you tell him that you've tried them
before with other men and you don't like
doing them you're going to have trouble
why because regardless of your
preferences those other guys apparently
got a more sexually open and adventurous
version of yourself presumably without
even the cost of commitment think about
shopping how would you feel about paying
more for Less not great right this is

[09:03]
more for Less not great right this is
how men see it so if you did certain
things in certain ways with guys you
wanted less from you have to be prepared
to do at least as much and probably much
more with the guys you want more from
men are going to be
enthusiastic about moving forward with
Commitment if they feel like you give
them
more than they've given anyone else that
you like them more than you like anyone
else and the way that most men feel that
liking is in the bedroom since sex is
rewarding to men if the sex isn't
Bountiful and forthcoming he's going to
feel as though you're not interested and
he's probably right and why would he
give you what you want if you're not
giving him what he wants and to be
honest women generally understand this

[10:01]
honest women generally understand this
they can be creative with their body
accounting and they have ways of making
a man feel like he's the best she's ever
had every woman who's fudged her numbers
or screamed a little louder in the
bedroom than was warranted does so in an
attempt to manipulate this feeling in
men it's that
important the primary way that we men
feel as though you women like us more
than anyone else is that you're willing
to do things with us sexually that
you've never done with anyone else and
not just willing that you like
enthusiastically participate in them
like you even initiate those things that
will get you in so much easier than just
like being willing to do what the guy
wants like be bold Drive the
relationship sexually and that also
helps you to channel it into behaviors
that you are more comfortable doing this
means basically that you should be
prepared to be at least as kinky and

[11:01]
prepared to be at least as kinky and
open and available and daring as you've
been with any other man that you've been
with when you're targeting a man for
commitment and this is related to the
first key which is to make yourself so
useful that it would be difficult to
replace you this might hurt some
feelings but especially in this market
sex is cheap it's easy to replace and
it's easy for the high value men with
options that you're targeting for
commitment to get of course people have
their own preferences and comfort levels
but the more your sexual menu includes
things that other women wouldn't
ordinarily
do the harder it will be to replace you
in the bedroom just like women want a
bad boy who's good just to them men want
a good girl who is just bad for them
when you're going for the kill you need

[12:00]
when you're going for the kill you need
to be your baddest most generous most
willing and most adventurous sexual
selves okay and this is because your
sexual behavior is not only being
compared with your own sexual history
it's also being compared with his sexual
history Chris Rock once said that a
woman cannot go backwards in lifestyle
and a man can't go backwards sexually
that's right once you date a man with a
car you're not going to move forward
with the guy with a bus pass right by
the same token once a guy has gotten
used to certain sexual behaviors and
frequencies and attitudes he's not going
to move forward with a woman who doesn't
offer him that optionality so not only
do you have to do things that you've
never done with any other man you have
to do things that he's never done with
any other woman and that's how you
become like invaluable and irreplaceable
to that guy the advice that Patrice
O'Neal gave women
which was good advice was to think of

[13:01]
which was good advice was to think of
the nastiest dirtiest thing they could
possibly do in the bedroom and to do
that how you beat out your competition
for the high value man you've targeted
well consider an auction house lots of
people are competing to buy the same one
lot who wins the one who pays the most
the willingness to do what no one else
is doing is the cost of winning by the
same token this is how you out compete
all the other women who are vying for
the same man you do what no one else is
willing to do because that is the cost
of winning of course you don't have to
but sellers also don't have to transact
at lower price points do they and as
before this is another way in which
women's Pride tends to trip them up they
believe they shouldn't have to do these

[14:00]
believe they shouldn't have to do these
things in order to secure the commitment
that they want but that's tent amount to
believing that they shouldn't have to
bid more than anyone else in order to
win the lot they want I guarantee you
the sellers do not share this
belief being useful is how you draw
closer to a man but providing this
sexual fulfillment is how you seal the
deal you do these two things you can get
a celebrity a CEO a millionaire an
athlete really any man that you could
possibly want basically you take on
responsibilities so that you secure more
regular consistent access to the man and
then you bombard him with wild frequent
brain melting sex so that he has no
interest or hope of finding something
better elsewhere men are not complicated
do these two things and you can have any
man that you have access to the only
thing standing in the way is

[15:02]
thing standing in the way is
