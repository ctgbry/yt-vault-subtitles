I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
respect means different things to men
and women
so I'm going to be presenting this idea
in the context of some feedback that I
frequently receive from women both in
real life and on this very Channel I
often hear them complaining about the
fact that in their eyes it seems like
men
don't really know what to do with them
they don't seem to take the initiative
they don't seem to lead the relationship
they might seem awkward or inept at sex
and seduction and they don't seem to
pursue women with any sort of real
purpose I hear them say where are all
the men who know how to treat a woman
it's a great question and I can
understand from a female's perspective
how this would be a frustrating
experience so I'm here to help I've
given it some thought and this episode
is what I've come up with now before I
explain why this phenomenon might exist

[01:00]
explain why this phenomenon might exist
please remember to like this video And
subscribe to the channel it takes less

world thanks for your help oh and be
sure to watch the end of the episode
because I've saved the most important
reason
for last
now back to it I think that this
experience of women can be attributed
largely though not entirely to different
comprehensions of the idea of respect
respect means something different to a
man than to a woman and this is
something that we haven't really
appreciated as a culture because it may
create unintended consequences such as
the ones that we're discussing when you
tell men to respect women this is
something we drill into boys from a very
young age you have to respect women you
have to respect women
but respect might mean different things
to men than it does to women let's look

[02:02]
to men than it does to women let's look
into this further
first of all let me make very clear that
I'm not advocating that anyone should be
taught to disrespect women
I'm not saying that that said if you
don't respect somebody it doesn't
necessarily mean that you're
disrespecting them for instance just
because you're not giving me respect
doesn't mean that you're actively
disrespecting me you may just be feeling
neutrally towards me and as I've said in
a previous episode it's always best if
people earn your respect and your
disrespect at the end of the day I think
it might be a better idea to teach boys
that they shouldn't disrespect women
that would potentially create less of a
problem here so what's the issue
there are three actually and they relate
to how men understand respect so what
does respect mean to a man first respect
means that I look up to you

[03:00]
means that I look up to you
there's an element of admiration to
respect
it's not really possible to respect the
cross and it's certainly not possible to
respect down remember we're not talking
about respect in the sense of basic
human dignity men tend to associate
respect with admiration of Excellence
so when a man respects a woman he puts
her on a pedestal
this tends to create a lot of
difficulties in the courtship process
this is because it puts the woman in the
position of the adored and the Man in
the position of the adorer and this robs
the woman of the opportunity to have the
more emotional experience in the
relationship and if you want to know
more about these terms please check out
my series on the balance of Attraction
links in the PIN to comment below
women are generally more emotional than
men and so they prefer to go to
relationships to feel to have emotional
experiences and they're going to feel

[04:00]
experiences and they're going to feel
much more if they're in the position of
the Adora not in the position of the
adored however they are put there when
men go out of their way to demonstrate
their admiring respect so that's one
unintended consequence that women might
be going out with these men who put them
on a pedestal which in turn prevents
women from feeling much with respect to
these men
second to the masculine mind respect
means deference
when you respect someone you tend to
defer to their judgment or expertise you
ultimately won't be making the decision
because you acknowledge that the other
person might be in a position to know
better deference means humble submission
tell me what you want and I'll make it
happen
this might sound nice in theory but in
practice it means that a man exercising
deference isn't going to be making plans

[05:02]
deference isn't going to be making plans
setting up dates making decisions or
driving the relationship he's going to
be deferring to what she wants to do
because he's trying to show that he
respects her do you see
and the third thing the final thing
that's tricky with respect to the
masculine mind the thing that exerts an
enormous influence on the phenomenon
we're discussing here is that it's very
very difficult for respect
and sexuality to coexist at the same
time
think about it in any situation where
respect is socially expected at
graduation a ceremony a funeral
sex is completely inappropriate
sexuality in these contexts would
actually be disrespectful
respect is not arousing if anything it
nullifies the sexual impulse men think
that they have to suppress their

[06:00]
that they have to suppress their
sexuality in order to be respectful
because we would never express our
sexuality in any other situation that
calls for respect
but the upshot here is that you can't
really respect someone
and want to [ __ ] them at the same time
a man can respect his woman like as a
person but on some level he has to be
able to turn that off in the bedroom in
order to [ __ ] her
it is what it is and this seems to be
true from the woman's perspective as
well I mean correct me if I'm wrong but
when a woman is sexually satisfied I
don't think her primary emotional
experience is that of feeling respected
like whoa oh you respected the [ __ ] out
of me last night it's like
that's not typically how it works in the
bedroom
this means that for men respect and
assertive masculine sexuality are at
odds with each other
this might not be a problem for women

[07:01]
this might not be a problem for women
when it affects men that they're not
attracted to in fact it's probably a
benefit to them however when it affects
men that they are attracted to it can
leave them feeling confused frustrated
and disappointed a man showing respect
will not also be showing sexual intent
the two are mutually exclusive in a
man's mind
so those are three ways that the idea of
respect might be tripping men up with
respect to dating women and why women
might experience a dearth of confident
initiative coming from Men in the sexual
Marketplace
I think that a better word to use here
might be consideration women want their
feelings and their preferences to be
taken into account but they typically
still want the man to initiate contact
set up the date make the plans initiate
sex be assertive and generally lead them
in the direction of a desired
relationship
consideration influences but it does not

[08:00]
consideration influences but it does not
determine what the man does and this
consideration can be expressed through
self-initiated action
hopefully that makes sense
what do you think let me know in the
