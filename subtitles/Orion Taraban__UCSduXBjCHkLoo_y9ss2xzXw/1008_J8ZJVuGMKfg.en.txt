that I saw a funny video the other day.
It was a video of a husband and wife
trying to act normal after they had done
quote unquote feral things to each
other. And I thought that's that's good.
That's a good relationship. They're in
the bedroom. They're both consenting
individuals. They're using each other
for pleasure. They're giving each other
pleasure. And then they come back into
quote unquote society or, you know, like
like more sophisticated or whatever and
act the way that they should. But I
think there's a misconception about what
should happen behind closed doors and
what should happen in the bedroom.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I made an episode a while back
called every woman is two women. And
what I argue is that there's the
front-facing woman that you see at work,
at the grocery store, going about
society, and then there's the woman in
the bedroom. And they're very rarely the
same person. And men fall into all kinds
of fallacies when they believe that the
woman's going to act in the bedroom like
she acts in society. And this can go a
couple of ways. First of all is you get

couple of ways. First of all is you get
the idea that this is a competent,
confident, successful woman. Maybe she's
a boss type of a woman. That
doesn't necessarily mean that she's
going to be dominant in the bedroom. She
can, but you don't know. like it's
almost impossible to tell by the
&gt;&gt; I wonder if she may not even want to be
that because she is so much that energy
in public life that she needs something
to balance that out in a way.
&gt;&gt; I would say that that's probably more
likely, but you never know the
individual case until you're actually
there and you're exploring that and
you're communicating about that. So you
can make a reasonable assumption but you
know people hate to be the object of
incorrect assumptions
