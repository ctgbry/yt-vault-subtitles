we can learn a lot about patients by
examining animals and to my mind a horse
in the rain is about as good of a symbol
for patience as they come ever wonder
why we call people in hospitals patients
because what primarily defines their
role in that setting is the necessity
for them to abide in suffering there's
only so much doctors can do to
accelerate the healing process so the
principal virtue of a patient is
patience I.E the willingness to abide in
suffering long enough for the treatment
to take effect and the suffering to
diminish and a big part of patience is
not doing anything to make your
situation even worse than it already is
which is exactly what you will succeed
in doing if you attempt to avoid
unavoidable suffering it takes a kind of
radical acceptance to be able to
consider the possibility that at least
for now things are bad or painful or
unfavorable to action a horse that beat
the ground and thrashed against the
fence and tried to outrun the storm will
not only still be wet but will be wet
and injured or exhausted
