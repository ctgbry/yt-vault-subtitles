Functionally, every contemporary
marriage starts as a one night stand. If
sex precedes commitment, then you cannot
get commitment without first initiating
sex. Which means, at least for a time,
you will need to tolerate sex without
commitment. There's no way around this
in the modern sexual marketplace. And
this means that you need to make your
peace with the fact that your future
husband will likely begin as a one night
stand. And if this is true, ladies, then
answer me this. If you're not willing to
have one night stands, then how are you
going to get married? It's a
non-rhetorical question. I'm really
interested to know what your strategy
here is. Do you have one? All right. If
you've accepted that what I'm saying
might be true, that is that functionally
every marriage begins as a one night
stand, then the appropriate next
question becomes, how can I increase the
likelihood that a one-off interaction
will lead to a repeat performance? This
is the same question businesses have

is the same question businesses have
with respect to generating recurring
revenue. And the answer I would give to
a woman is the same I would give to an
entrepreneur. To generate repeat sales,
you need two things. A good product and
good customer service. If you have a
good product supported with good
service, you will get repeat sales. If
you do not have a good product supported
with good service, you will not get
repeat sales. It's that simple. And
remember, the cat decides what milk is
good. It's not for you to decide that
your product is good. It's for your
clients or customers. And they are
giving you that feedback not with their
mouths but with their feet and their
wallets.
