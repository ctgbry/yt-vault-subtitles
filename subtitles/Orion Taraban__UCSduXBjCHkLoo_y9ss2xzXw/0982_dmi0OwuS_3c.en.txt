The first really significant difference
between male cheating and female
cheating is their respective
correlations to relationship
satisfaction. According to the research
I've read, there is no statistically
significant difference in reported
relationship satisfaction between men
who cheat and men who don't. This means
that the philanderers were just as happy
or unhappy with their primary
relationships as the men who stayed
loyal. On the other hand, there is a
substantial and statistically
significant difference in reported
relationship satisfaction between women
who cheat and women who don't. That is,
the women who cheat report significantly
higher rates of relationship
dissatisfaction in their primary
relationships. To put it another way,
women who are satisfied with their
relationships are much less likely to be
disloyal, though they still can be. This
finding by itself is interesting, but it
also suggests that men and women tend to
have different motivations when they

have different motivations when they
cheat. Most notably, men don't seem to
cheat in order to replace their partners
or to get needs or desires met outside
of their primary relationship. If they
did, we would likely see differences in
relationship satisfaction between
cheaters and non-cheaters, right? On the
whole, I think most of the men who cheat
do so because they a have the
opportunity to do so and b believe they
can get away with it. In fact, they tend
to see the infidelity as a sexual outlet
that has nothing to do with their
primary relationship.
