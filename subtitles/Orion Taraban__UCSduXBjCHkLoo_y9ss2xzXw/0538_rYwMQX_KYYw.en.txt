I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is couples
therapy almost never works so I might
take some heat for this one but I am not
a big fan of coup's therapy I have not
seen it associated with a high degree of
positive outcomes and I think this is
true for a number of reasons several of
which I will be discussing in this
episode so let's Jump Right In first and
foremost what many folks who have never
been to coup's therapy often fail to
appreciate is that in most couples
therapy the client is the
relationship the client is not the two
individual people in the room the client
is the relationship between them as such
the therapist is going to be advocating
for the best interests of the
relationship this means that the
therapeutic intent is typically to
perpetuate the relationship or in rare
cases when both parties are on the same

[01:01]
cases when both parties are on the same
page with termination to help dissolve
the relationship harmoniously so why is
this problematic well in the first place
it means that one or both of the parties
might be supported to stay in a
relationship with someone they
absolutely have no business being in a
relationship to begin with a couple's
therapist is not going to turn to the
man in the middle of a session and say
my dude you need to get as far away from
that woman as poss possible personality
disorders hardly ever go away entirely
and it can take years of hard work just
to get them under control you'd be
better off cutting this off and finding
someone else as quickly as you can by
the same token the therapist is not
going to turn to the woman in the room
and say this guy is never going to
commit to you no matter what sacrifices
you make for the relationship if you
want a family you are wasting your time
here and let me tell you in certain
situations this is precisely the the

[02:00]
situations this is precisely the the
feedback that people need to hear
withholding this feedback because your
client is the relationship irrespective
of the best interests of the individuals
in that relationship does not sit right
with me personally now in the second
place when the client is the
relationship it means that working
through problems generally requires some
measure of negotiated concession if
you're not already aware I'm not a big
fan of compromise especially in Intimate
Relationships compromise is two people
not getting what they want at which
point you have to ask what is the point
of this relationship anyway in my
opinion it's a better idea to be selfish
and to find someone else whose
selfishness you can live with on the
other hand compromise suggests a
negotiated process which is often
counterproductive for two obvious
reasons first and this may come as is a
shock to you but the people who show up

[03:02]
shock to you but the people who show up
to couples counseling have often been
acting very badly in their relationships
the reason why a relationship is
dysfunctional could be that at least one
of the people involved is acting like an
emotional terrorist throwing Tantrums
being bullying and aggressive hijacking
family events threatening to leave if
demands are not met etc etc and you know
what it's not a good idea to negotiate
with
terrorists coming to the bargaining
table only when the other side behaves
sufficiently badly only reinforces bad
behavior and functionally guarantees
that you will see more bad behavior in
the future appeasement didn't work for
the Nazis and it's probably not going to
work for your
relationship now if you have The
Misfortune of being in a relationship
with an emotional terrorist then you
likely need to take a long hard look at

[04:03]
likely need to take a long hard look at
the person in the mirror because this is
your fault at least to some extent after
all you're the one who chose to be in a
relationship with this person for some
reason you likely have some unhealed
emotional wound that left you vulnerable
to such an individual and that healing
is something that you could more
effectively do in your own individual
therapy because as you'll recall the Rel
relationship is the client in coup's
therapy get that sorted out yourself and
your path forward in the relationship
might just become clearer on its own now
before I go any further if you're liking
what you're hearing please consider
sending this episode to someone who
might benefit from its message because
it's Word of Mouth referrals like this
that really help to make the channel
grow and you can also hit the thanks
button and tip me in proportion to the
value you feel you've received from this
episode I really depend on your support
I don't do a lot of product placements

[05:01]
I don't do a lot of product placements
or corporate sponsorships I don't do any
of them uh so I really depend on your
support to keep all of this going I
really appreciate it thank you very much
all right and the second reason why
negotiated concession often doesn't work
in couples's therapy is because one of
the most common issues that couples
typically bring into the counseling room
is their sex life or their lack thereof
and you cannot negotiate desire you
cannot say get more sex more often in
exchange for doing more of the housework
it doesn't work that way now you can
increase desire in a relationship but
the pathway to doing so is almost
completely antithetical to the couple's
therapy process it involves less
communication less time together more
mystery greater spontaneity etc etc and
this can be accomplished

[06:00]
this can be accomplished
unilaterally that is if you just change
how you show up in the relationship it
will force a shift in the dynamic of the
relationship and you definitely don't
need your partner's permission to be
more attractive in your own relationship
so just focus on doing that as opposed
to talking about the lack of desire
which typically only makes the problem
worse now here's yet another thing to
consider as a therapist I can tell you
that it's actually very difficult to
tell the truth to a person in a way that
he or she can hear it the truth is
generally tough for people to hear it's
bitter medicine so it typically requires
some finesse to be able to speak the
truth in such a way that it isn't
automatically rejected and while it is
very difficult to tell the truth in a
way that one person can hear it it's
almost impossible to tell the TRU truth
in a way that two people can hear it

[07:02]
in a way that two people can hear it
simultaneously the best way for one
person to hear this truth will not be
the best way for another person to hear
it and the upshot of this is that the
truth is typically what gets compromised
the truth is diluted to the point that
two people can hear it and this is often
not nearly as effective as just giving
it to each person individually in their
own
way here's another reason coupl therapy
is more or less predic on the belief
that most problems that people
experience in their relationships are
just based on some lack of understanding
or some failure of communication so the
solution of course must be more
communication and mutual understanding
and in my experience this is not the
case on some level it's not important to
understand why say one person is
throwing temper tantrums it's important
that the temper tantrums

[08:00]
that the temper tantrums
stop perpetuating the belief that say a
woman is throwing a tantrum because she
doesn't feel sufficiently validated or
cared for is gaslighting because there
are plenty of women who don't throw
Tantrums when those same conditions or
Worse are met and the person who may
believe that these are sufficient
grounds for a tantrum would likely be
better served in individual therapy
anyway the point is that certain things
don't need to be understood
they just need to change and
understanding does not by itself
inevitably lead to change some things
just don't have a place in a healthy
loving relationship and acting as though
the real issue is a lack of appreciation
for the reasons why bad behavior exists
as opposed to the bad behavior itself is
to my mind Shifting the blame to the
other person in the relationship
unfortunately this can happen in coup's

[09:00]
unfortunately this can happen in coup's
therapy I imagine that Coupes therapy
could be helpful to certain people
dealing with certain classes of problems
however I haven't seen it produce
positive outcomes in the vast majority
of cases what do you think does this fit
