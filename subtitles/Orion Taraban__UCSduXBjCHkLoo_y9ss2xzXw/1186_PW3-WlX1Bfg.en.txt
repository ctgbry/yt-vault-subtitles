Sometimes people know what they want,
but they're not allowed to say it out
loud because they will be judged for
being superficial. I have another
episode called the superficiality of
desire. And a lot of those superficial
variables that go into attraction are
actually rooted in evolutionary
principles that have to do with sexual
selection. And it's like, wow, maybe
facial symmetry is a sign that this
child when it was a fetus was exposed
[music] to fewer bacterial or viral
attacks, you know, so it's actually a a
healthier developmental process. These
cues that we think are just superficial
could actually in many cases communicate
that this person is healthy, that this
person is youthful, that this person is
ready to reproduce. Not always. We have
a lot of false cues these days,
especially with the cosmetic industry.
But that's just one layer. The second
layer is that people don't even know
what they want. They think that they
know what they want.
&gt;&gt; Like this woman that you mentioned,
they're aware of, I think, kind of an

[01:01]
they're aware of, I think, kind of an
ego ideal of what they should want, but
they think it's what they actually want.
If you want to observe or understand
what people actually want, you have to
notice who they hook up with, who they
actually enter into relationships.
That's what they want, regardless of
what they say with their mouths.
