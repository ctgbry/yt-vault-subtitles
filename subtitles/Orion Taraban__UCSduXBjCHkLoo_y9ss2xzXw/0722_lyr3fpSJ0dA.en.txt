I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is being
right doesn't matter this is something I
wish I had learned a long time ago as it
would have dramatically improved my
relationships with women deeply
understanding like emotionally
understanding this lesson is one of the
secrets to Pleasant filling stable and
satisfying
relationships the fact of the matter is
that it doesn't matter if you're right
with women by the same token it also
doesn't matter if you're not wrong which
while related isn't quite the same thing
men can do nothing wrong they can be
completely right and they can still
encounter friction conflict and
withdrawal from their women and I'm here
to shed some light on why this might be
the case first of all it's important to
understand that there are games and
there are
metagames metagames are the bigger games

[01:00]
metagames metagames are the bigger games
in which smaller games are embedded
people are generally aware of the games
they are playing but they're not always
aware of the meta games that they're
playing and this is because while
subject to certain rules and goals like
games the rules and goals of metag games
are typically more abstract indirect and
non-explicit
now the existence of both games and
metagames creates an opportunity for
interaction effects like it's possible
to win both games or lose both games but
it's also possible to win the game and
lose the metag game let me give you an
example of what that might look like
imagine that you're playing a game of
tennis and over the course of five sets
you completely trounce your opponent
fair and square in such a case it's
right that you should have won as you
were clearly the better player so you
won the game of tennis however if in

[02:00]
won the game of tennis however if in
your Victory you started to gloat you
started to brag about how amazing you
clearly are and you started to rub your
superiority in your conquered opponent's
face then you would lose the metagame of
sportsmanship you are clearly right like
you are objectively the better player
and your bragado doio would actually be
founded on verifiable empirical evidence
but that wouldn't matter and this is
because For Better or Worse we don't
live in a complete or even a mostly
merit-based world it's not always the
best players who get to play like other
people still have to like you enough or
at least not dislike you enough in order
to deal with you and while the better
you are the more people will put up with
you everyone kind of has their limit in
general it's a good idea to prioritize
the highest metag game you can
conceptualize because what happens if
you prioritize the game over the metag

[03:02]
you prioritize the game over the metag
game if you win the game but lose the
metag game then your Victory is going to
be circumscribed at best and invalidated
at worst it can even be more beneficial
to lose the game and win the metag game
than the other way around like to
continue my tennis example if your
defeated opponent were to shrug it off
seem unaffected by your antics and even
praise humbly your Superior form then he
might become a popular hero in the
tennis world the worse you treat him the
better he looks he might not be very
skilled at the game but he might get
more chances to play than you will if
you continue to act in such a boneheaded
way do you understand sometimes it's
more effective to lose well than to win
poorly the trick is to be strategic and
intentional with your priorities do not
delude yourself into thinking that
earning points in the game entitle you

[04:02]
earning points in the game entitle you
to points in the metag game and vice
versa arguing that this isn't the way
the world should be is a waste of breath
it is the way it is you can either
accept that and learn to be successful
in reality or you can continue to fight
against it by insisting that your ideals
should take precedence over your
achievement if you appreciate the
insights on this channel I would highly
encourage you to get your hands on a
copy of my book the value of others over
the course of 432 pages I delve deep
into my economic model of relationships
and explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook Audi book and
paper back formats the links are in the

[05:04]
paper back formats the links are in the
description so let's bring this back
around when it comes to dealing with
women men can win the game they can be
right they can be not wrong and they can
still lose the metag game and being
right or not wrong in the game means
[ __ ] all in the metag game the game in
this case could be whatever objective or
empirically verifiable thing you happen
to be arguing about while the metag game
could be a peaceful and harmonious
relationship what gets points in one
game might not get points in the other
and vice
versa this might be a helpful way of
thinking about it there is no wrong way
to pet a cat like there are no laws
prohibiting certain pets or regulations
mandating certain other pets there is to
my knowledge no morally right or
ethically wrong way to pet a cat like
you can pet a cat a 100 different ways

[06:01]
you can pet a cat a 100 different ways
there are no rules about how you go
about doing so so how can you really do
it wrong that said if you choose to
stroke a cat against the direction of
its fur the cat's probably going to
bristle and you're going to get the
claws now does that mean that you did
anything objectively or morally or
ethically wrong it would be hard to
argue that you did but does that matter
when you're all scratched up on the
other hand stroking a cat in the
direction of its fur doesn't necessarily
mean that you're doing it right or that
you're a good person or that you are
Vindicated by objective reality these
concepts are all incomprehensible to a
cat however if you choose to pet a cat
in this way it will tend to purr and
snuggle up in your lap and you can enjoy
a satisfying interaction with a feline
are you following
me men a lot about having satisfying
relationships with women comes down to
learning how to stroke the cat petting

[07:02]
learning how to stroke the cat petting
them in a different way doesn't make you
bad doesn't make you wrong but you might
end up with the Clause regardless and on
some level this is fair you can't really
pet the cat however you'd like to pet it
and expect the cat to like it
irrespective of what you might do like
that's T amount to assuming cats have no
preferences which is obviously untrue as
I'm fond of saying the cat decides what
milk is
good at times men can get so hung up on
what is objectively right or what is
demonstrably wrong that they build a buw
workk on that principle and defend it to
the end such men win the battle but lose
the war that is they win the game but
lose the metag game and that isn't much
of a victory in my book it sounds a bit
strange but there is a way to stroke a
woman and this way is neither right nor

[08:02]
woman and this way is neither right nor
wrong it's just what they tend to prefer
women are the way women are and men are
the way men are and the more both sides
can kind of learn the preferences of the
other the smoother relationships tend to
go of course individual preferences
exist and you may need to learn the
idiosyncrasies of your particular cat
some like to be tickled behind the ears
others like little chin
scratchies over time you kind of learn
what your particular cat tends to prefer
the idea is to prioritize
Effectiveness what works to get the
results you want and this might require
some flexibility and a willingness to
step outside of what you think should be
the case otherwise you might end up like
our vain glorious athlete who
confidently snatches defeat from the
jaws of
success what do you think does this fit
