i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
escaping approach avoid conflicts
so let me explain what i'm talking about
here
an approach avoid conflict occurs when
we're ambivalent about something
for instance we might really want to
have a certain kind of relationship with
a specific individual
at the same time that we recognize the
same individual often behaves in highly
aversive and unwanted ways
that said the desire to have the
relationship remains
so the person who feels this way is
stuck
in an approach avoid conflict a part of
him wants to move forward and the part
of him is repelled by what he finds
there
this can be very exhausting it can look
from the outside that this person isn't
doing anything
because he doesn't seem to be making
movements one way or another
but on the inside the person might be
vacillating back and forth and
experiencing a good deal of inner

[01:01]
experiencing a good deal of inner
turmoil and this can be quite
emotionally exhausting
i have two recommendations for escaping
this kind of situation
the first is all of the things being
equal i recommend prioritizing the
actual reality of the situation over and
above the desired potential of the
situation
this latter component may be projected
under the circumstances in question or
may even pre-exist those same
circumstances
that's like kind of wanting to buy a car
before seeing what's on offer
we generally should give precedence to
what is
over what could be or what might be this
can be very challenging
especially if you're already emotionally
engaged but it's typically the wiser
course of action
and the second recommendation is to
allow yourself to make decisions for now
decisions are irrevocable you can't go
back in the past and make a different
decision
however you can course correct your

[02:00]
however you can course correct your
decisions on a real-time basis moving
forward
you can say something like based on
where i am right now and how i see the
situation this is what i'm deciding is
best for me for the time being and then
as you move forward you can collect data
with respect the consequences of that
decision which will allow you to
evaluate the wisdom of that choice
and if it doesn't seem like you're
moving in the direction you want to go
you don't have to double down on that
decision you can course correct if and
when it seems necessary
so this can help relieve the pressure in
certain approach avoid conflicts you
don't have to make forever decisions
instead you can make for now decisions
that can be amended as future outcomes
warrant
