The cycle of wealthy lifestyles is you
start off poor and you work really hard,
you make some money and then you become
you the private jets and the yachts and
if you actually become a royal, what do
they do in their spare time? What do
they do for fun? They put on disguises.
They pretend to be poor and they go
about the hoy. You know what I'm saying?
So it's like people want what they don't
yet have. Alan Watts kind of talked
about this in a spiritual way, which is
what if you were this kind of entity
that could have any kind of experience
that you wanted? Like what if you were
actually in control of the life that you
were experiencing? Well, at some point
it wouldn't you'd go through these lives
where okay, I I was a king and I was all
powerful and I got everything that I
wanted. And that would kind of lose its
luster. It would lose interest to you.
And so you'd kind of like up the stakes
in order to feel something, which would
mean giving up control and giving up
awareness that you ever had that you
chose this to begin with. And so you'd

[01:01]
chose this to begin with. And so you'd
put yourself like further and further
out there so that you could have an
emotional experience, which is really
what life is all about.
&gt;&gt; People want to feel things. People will
pay all kinds of money to feel things.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true. And I suppose a a
boundless existence due to the fact that
it's so boundless doesn't it doesn't
give you if there are no limits placed
on anything then there's no value placed
on anything. There's this quote uh
Peterson uses a good bit where he says
if we created a sufficiently idilic
world the only desired lack would be for
the want of lack itself. Sure.
