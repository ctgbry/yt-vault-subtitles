I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the lens
of
Attraction this could very well be one
of the most important episodes for men
to hear men it is essential that you
understand the lens of Attraction if you
want to have peaceful satisfying
relationships with women let's get to it
so just what is this lens of Attraction
you ever see those eyeglasses that
automat ially change based on ambient
light levels like they look like
ordinary glasses indoors but transition
into dark tinted sunglasses when you go
outside what we're talking about is a
similarly adaptive lens that exists in
the minds of women the lens of
Attraction doesn't cover her eyes it
covers her Mind's Eye and everything
that she perceives is perceived through
this mental lens

[01:01]
this mental lens
why is this important because the same
behavior will be perceived in radically
different ways depending on the tint
that currently exists on her lens of
Attraction as I discuss in the book High
attraction is associated with the
emotion of Desire whereas low attraction
is associated with the emotion of
disgust like desire and disgust actually
exist on the same axis which is kind of
wild but this means that when a woman's
attraction levels are high then she will
perceive your behavior in a positive
generous and admiring light and when her
attraction levels are low she will
perceive your behavior in a negative
critical and disparaging light even if
and this is the important part even if
what she perceives is the exact same
behavior the upshot is that if you want
to have a peaceful satisfying
relationship with a woman

[02:00]
relationship with a woman
then as a man your number one priority
must be to maintain her attraction at a
very high level this must come before
everything else because when this starts
to decline the problems start coming in
hard and fast and there is good news and
bad news about this the good news is
that maintaining a woman's attraction
actually doesn't cost that much don't be
fooled by people who tell you you need
to be a millionaire and have a six-pack
maintaining attraction mostly requires
time and effort but not necessarily
money and a six-foot
stature on the other hand the bad news
is that maintaining a woman's attraction
is a constantly evolving NeverEnding
task there is nothing you can do once to
keep a woman's attraction at a permanent
and enduring level it never [ __ ] ends
but if you fight this one battle men you

[03:01]
but if you fight this one battle men you
can often avoid dozens of more costly
and painful
conflicts why is this the case because a
woman with a high level of attraction
like a 10 out of 10 is absolutely ride
or die she will break every Rule and be
down for anything she will lie to the
cops and help you bury the body she
would walk in on you [ __ ] her best
friend and she will blame the girl for
taking advant of you like a highly
attracted woman is on another level she
will show up she will make the effort
she will fight for the relationship and
a woman who is fighting for you isn't
leaving you do you understand on the
other hand a woman with a low level of
attraction is absolutely insufferable
she will complain she will nag she will
compare you unfavorably to her
girlfriend's Partners everything you do
will be wrong in some way way nothing

[04:01]
will be wrong in some way way nothing
you do will ever be good enough and the
more you try the more she doesn't like
it as your functionally giving her even
more material with which to be disgusted
she will be flaky and disrespectful and
disloyal and she will ultimately leave
you and feel entirely justified in doing
so it is what it
is if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audio book and

[05:00]
now available in ebook audio book and
paperback formats the links are in the
description now perhaps you've heard it
said that the things that people fall in
love with are the same things that drive
them crazy once the relationship has
been established why might that be well
it can't be that the thing in question
has changed after all people don't
change all that much and when they do
it's typically a slow and gradual
process so let's assume that people are
largely the same across this time
Horizon
so what's changed what's changed is that
her attraction has dipped the behavior
that was once one of your more Charming
attributes is now a toxic trait that she
can stand to give you an idea of what
that might look like let's offer a few
concrete examples in the beginning she
might love how funny you are oh you're
so light-hearted and easy to get along
with and oh my God you're hilar ious you

[06:00]
with and oh my God you're hilar ious you
make me laugh so much 6 months later she
might loathe your sense of
humor is everything a joke to you are
you just like this clown performing to
an imaginary audience like no one's
laughing have you talked to your
therapist about
this okay here's another one in the
beginning she might love how ambitious
you are he is such a hard worker when he
wants something he doesn't stop until he
gets it like his focus is so
sexy 6 months later she might despise
your work ethic oh my God all he cares
about is work once again I had to eat
alone last night since he had to work
overtime I think he might be a
narcissist overcompensating for his low
self-esteem with
achievement and here's another one in
the beginning she might love how sweet
you
are I love how sensitive you are like
you actually can express your emotions

[07:00]
you actually can express your emotions
how refreshing you should teach a class
I'll make All My Exes
enroll 6 months later she might find
your vulnerability
unbearable yeah I don't think I'll be
able to make it to the picnic this
weekend um it's not you it's me any girl
would be lucky to have you and I hope
you find the love that you
deserve do you understand in the
beginning she's attracted six months
later for whatever reason she's not
avoiding undue criticism of your
personality or lifestyle from a woman is
not about doing the right thing or even
a different thing because as we've seen
the same thing can be both a positive
and a negative to the same woman it's
about her level of attraction for you
this means that you probably don't need
to change whatever Behavior she has
decided to take issue with as much as
you might need to change whatever
behaviors are lowering her attraction
change those behaviors and voila the

[08:03]
change those behaviors and voila the
other thing suddenly won't be as much of
a problem men spending time energy and
money to increase and maintain your
attractiveness is your single greatest
Roi in your relationships with women and
every man can be more attractive than he
currently is so that's your mission
jents learn the principles of Attraction
Implement them in your relationships and
don't ever take your foot off the gas
more than anything else this is your
best bet at having the types of
relationships worth having with women
