I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the myth
of completion completion
is a myth it doesn't actually exist in
reality and that's because nothing is
ever finished it just transitions into a
different form a great example of this
is evolution evolution is never finished
and that's because Evolution doesn't
actually have a static goal it's basic
intention is to constantly provide the
best fit between organisms and their
surrounding environment but as the
environment changes the concept of best
fit changes as well which in turn
changes the environment odd infinitum
like most things in life evolution is a
never-ending process so why do people
think that completion exists now before
I explain this tendency please remember

for your help
all right the reason why people believe
that completion exists is due to a bias
inherent in perspective
and the best way to illustrate that bias
is to examine the difference in
perspective between Creator and observer
let's take a famous piece of art like
the Mona Lisa for instance now from the
observer's perspective the Mona Lisa is
a finished work of art we have we all
have an idea of what it is and we can
examine and count and tabulate all the
brush Strokes that went into its
composition from this perspective from
the perspective of the Observer the Mona
Lisa is complete
however it's a different story from the
perspective of the Creator there was no
objective sign given to Leonardo da
Vinci that not a single additional brush
stroke was necessary to complete his

[02:01]
stroke was necessary to complete his
masterpiece it might be hard to imagine
the Mona Lisa different from how it is
however that is an observer problem Da
Vinci didn't have that problem
creators like Da Vinci know all too well
that something can always be added and
something can always be taken away
and if he had decided to do so then that
would have been the Mona Lisa that we
would now all think is complete the idea
of completion lies entirely in our heads
as an artifact of our perspective by us
as Observers
creators understand that they never
really complete anything
they just sort of decide that they're
done
the thing itself is not finished it just
looks finished to the outside Observer
they could always do more and they could
always do less
however it's this perspective bias that
facilitates the myth of completion and
it really messes people up especially
with respect to their relationships

[03:01]
with respect to their relationships
the truth is that it's always going to
feel like there's something more you
could have said or there's something
more you could have done
just like there is always another brush
stroke that could have been added to the
painting
relationships are never finished
people just decide to stop working on
them
and there's no objective sign that tells
the people involved when to stop
it's a subjective decision and only the
creators of the relationship can know
when to move on
what do you think
