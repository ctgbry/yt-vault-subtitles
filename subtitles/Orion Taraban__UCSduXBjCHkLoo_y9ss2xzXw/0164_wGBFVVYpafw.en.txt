i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
emotions are living things so this is a
metaphor that i like to use with my
clients
it's helpful to conceptualize emotions
as living things like little creatures
they have their habits they have the
things that they like they have the
things that they don't like and more
than anything else just like any other
living creature
they want to continue to exist
they want to survive they want to keep
living
this is important to understand
when an emotion becomes predominant
once you're touched by anger or
despondency or fear or stress your
entire psychology gets reshuffled for
example when you're feeling depressed
you become lethargic you want to isolate
from other people you want to listen to
elliot smith songs you remember all the
times you've been rejected and your
expectations of the future see you dying
alone in some musty and forgotten corner
of the world

[01:00]
of the world
do you see
every part of your psychology has been
influenced by these by this emotion your
behavior your motivation your
preferences your memory your attention
your imagination your reason it's all
been affected
and here's the important part
if you were to relent to all of these
impulses if you were to isolate and
ruminate and listen to elliot smith then
your depression would continue to exist
which
as a living creature is what depression
wants
it wants to continue to exist so in
order to ensure its own survival it's
going to try to get you to do what it
needs you to do for that to happen
relenting to the impulses of depression
makes depression very happy
because not only is there no threat to
its existence it's going to thrive under
those circumstances
the fact of the matter is
when we become touched by an emotion
all the suggestions that our mind gives

[02:02]
all the suggestions that our mind gives
us
serve the emotion that we're feeling
they allow that emotion to continue to
exist
and in some cases those suggestions
serve that emotion
more than they serve ourselves
so we should be mindful of that
now if we don't like that if we would
prefer not to feel the way that we're
feeling then on some level we have to do
the opposite of what our minds are
suggesting to us in that moment
and this can feel very strange
and it's going to feel stranger the more
powerful the emotion this is because the
emotion is like hey hey what are you
doing stop that if you do that i'm going
to die you know
and so it'll turn up the volume to try
to get you back in line because you know
its survival is at stake
i mean what would we do if we were
cornered and our lives were at stake
pretty much anything we could do to
continue to live
and that's what emotions will do if you

[03:01]
and that's what emotions will do if you
let them
so we can kind of expect that our
emotions will intensify when we decide
to take opposite action but opposite
action is absolutely essential to begin
to counteract the impulses that
perpetuate the undesired emotion
