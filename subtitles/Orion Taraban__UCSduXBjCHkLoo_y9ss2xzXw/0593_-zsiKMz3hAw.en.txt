I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is women do
the right things with the wrong men so
I've already done this episode from the
men's perspective today I'll be
discussing this phenomenon from the
women's perspective because boy oh boy
do women do the right things with the
wrong men make sure that you listen to
the very end okay to illustrate what I
mean by this let me share an anecdote
from my personal life many years ago the
woman I was dating had a girlfriend come
into town and the three of us went out
to dinner together and over the course
of this meal it became apparent that
this woman didn't yet have a place to
stay for the night the woman I was
seeing invited her to stay with her but
This Woman's solution was to text a guy
she had gone out with a few months ago
the plan was to meet him out for a drink
go back to his place spend the night
with him and then get on with whatever
it was that she came into town to do now
the doesn't know this yet this is just

[01:01]
the doesn't know this yet this is just
the woman's plan for the evening when we
expressed Our concern she tried to
reassure Us by saying oh it's fine I
don't really like this guy so it's okay
if I just use him for the night and I
remember turning to the woman I was with
and asking her if she might try liking
me a little
less so this was a joke but like all
good jokes there was some truth to it
ladies if you call me up invite me out
for a drink come back to to my place
have sex with me all night leave in the
morning and don't communicate with me
until you're ready to do that again I
guarantee I won't feel like you don't
like me what's more I will feel very
positively about you from the man's
perspective that woman's plan had an
extremely high good times to hassle
ratio the interaction was easy
effortless fun inexpensive convenient

[02:00]
effortless fun inexpensive convenient
and sexually satisfying if you treat a
man like this I guarantee that he will
want to see you again this is because
men do not encounter High good times to
hassle ratio women very often frankly
y'all can be a real handful so if you
give a guy a lot of what he wants and
not a lot of what he doesn't he will
text you back he will answer your phone
call and in the vast majority of cases
he will attempt to replicate that
encounter sooner as opposed to later
because you gave him an extremely
positive experience even if only once he
will often go to Great Lengths and
expense to make it happen again and
isn't that what you want a guy to go to
Great Lengths and expense for you
unfortunately this woman kind of wasted
this experience yeah she got a place to
stay for the night so she saved a few
hundred bucks but she didn't really like
the guy remember in fact she didn't even

[03:02]
the guy remember in fact she didn't even
live in the same town so it would be
difficult for her to get much more out
of the relationship even if she did like
him imagine if she had done this with a
guy she actually did like and who was in
a position to offer her a relationship
she could have saved a few
hundred, bucks while spending her nights
with a man she actually felt positively
about that's the power of a high good
times to hassle
ratio but what do Wom do when they meet
a guy they actually like first and
foremost they often want to take it
slow women seem to have this belief that
having sex too soon somehow disqualifies
them from a long-term relationship it
does not on the contrary as we'll see
it's waiting too long that generally
does however what taking it slow
functionally does is make the courtship
process significantly more expensive for
the

[04:00]
the
like expensive in every possible way
it's expensive by way of time attention
money effort opportunity and often
frustration men do not feel liked when
you make them jump through hoops to get
sex men do not feel liked when you give
them less of what they want and more of
what they don't men do not feel liked
when interactions with you are difficult
effortful serious expensive inconvenient
and sexually frustrating are you
listening and in the second case when a
a woman meets a guy she actually likes
it tends to arouse her
insecurities because she is now in an
emotionally risky situation after all if
the guy she didn't really like doesn't
like her back she might not bad an
eyelash however if the guy she does like
doesn't like her back she might be
significantly distressed so women
attempt to shore up their insecurities
in a number of ways including testing a
man's interest demanding commitment

[05:00]
man's interest demanding commitment
seeking reassurance provoking arguments
etc etc and all of this Behavior
significantly increases the hassle
associated with dealing with these women
especially since the man she doesn't
like and who doesn't therefore arouse
her insecurities doesn't have to deal
with any of this

back to
it between taking it slow and all of the
annoying things that they're subject to
doing when they're feeling insecure
women significantly decrease the good
times to hassle ratio with the men they

[06:01]
times to hassle ratio with the men they
actually like this is experienced as
punitive by men who will not
consequently make an effort to get you
or keep you in their lives ladies if you
like a man then reward him with fun
times and good sex and then leave him
alone leave him alone I guarantee that
men do not forget these women you willar
from these men again maybe not quite as
soon as you'd like but you will trust me
it's like I still remember that corner
in Brooklyn where I found 80 bucks 20
years ago I will probably never forget
that place for as long as I live and I
definitely walked by that place more
than once to see if I might find
something else there in any case ladies
if you want to NAB a big fish you have
to ensure that the hook is firmly in
place before you start reeling it in and

[07:01]
place before you start reeling it in and
this is how you set the hook fun times
good sex leave them
alone so this is what I mean when I say
that women do the right things with the
wrong men they have good times that
don't really count with the men they
don't really want relationships with and
they hold out and act nutty with the men
they do want to have relationships with
I'm telling you if that guy has any
optionality whatsoever and he probably
does if he's a high value man he's not
going to wait around just to pay more
for
Less now the rebuttal I usually hear
from women when I talk like this is
something like that's not true Orion
it's not true if a man really liked me
he'd be willing to wait so if he's not
willing to wait that must mean that he
doesn't really like me he probably just
wanted to use me for sex so this
strategy helps me weed out the [ __ ] boys
after all I don't want to just be used
for sex all right let me respond to this
leaving aside the fact that women often
in intentionally allow themselves to be

[08:01]
in intentionally allow themselves to be
used for sex remember the woman in my
anecdote allowed herself to be used for
sex in order to have a place to stay for
the night the problem with this rebuttal
is that it's too
inclusive like as a discrimination
strategy it will produce far too many
positive outcomes like yes if you make a
[ __ ] boy wait he won't stick around
correct this is because waiting makes
the same sexual opportunity increasingly
more expensive although the things being
equal and a [ __ ] boy is trying to
transact a sexual opportunity as cheaply
as possible however not every man who
won't write around is a [ __ ] boy okay
let me
explain let's imagine that you have an
all-time favorite restaurant the food is
phenomenal the Ambiance is exquisite the
service is exceptional like everything
everything about this place is wonderful
you love everything but let's also
Imagine that you live two hours away and

[09:02]
Imagine that you live two hours away and
that word has gotten out about how great
this place is so it's extremely
difficult to get a reservation and in
order to even make a reservation you
first need to join some kind of Diner
club that requires a steep Initiation
fee and an interview process how like
would you how would how often you eat
there be an accurate reflection of how
you feel about the place probably not
you love this restaurant the problem is
there are all of these obstacles in the
way of you going there more frequently
if you were to confess this to the
manager and he were to say well if this
really was your all-time favorite
restaurant you wouldn't have an issue
driving two hours to eat dinner and you
would make it a priority to secure a
reservation because that's what people
do when they love things they go above
and beyond they make an effort they're
willing to wait and the fact that you
aren't willing to do those things means
you probably couldn't care less about
this
establishment like if he were to say

[10:01]
establishment like if he were to say
this to you I don't think you'd feel
very heard and
understood the problem was not your
level of interest in the restaurant the
problem was the number of [ __ ]
obstacles in the way of eating there
women if you like a guy do not put
obstacles in the path of eating at your
restaurant make the guys that you don't
really like weight and allow the men you
want to keep around to cut to to the
front of the line do this and you will
have much more success with men okay
