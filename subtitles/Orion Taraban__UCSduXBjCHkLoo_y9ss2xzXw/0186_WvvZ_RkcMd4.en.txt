i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the nature of evil in games
so this will be a continuation of a
previous episode entitled life and the
concept of the game so if you're new to
this channel you might want to check out
that episode first
in that episode i described life as a
series of nested games and i defined a
game as anything with rules and a goal
today i'm going to be talking about the
nature of evil in the context of this
framework the concept of the game
as previously discussed
when there's too much order or too much
chaos there is death
only where the two intersect which is a
game
can life happen
this means on some level the purpose of
any game
is to create and maintain the conditions
that allow play to continue
while the game is afoot we're alive and

[01:00]
while the game is afoot we're alive and
living when the game is over we all go
home
so life is associated with the game and
anything that furthers the game
is good
by contrast death is associated with
anything that ends the game
and anything that works to end the game
is evil
and we all understand this intuitively
both chaos and wanton destruction
and oppression and overreaching control
are considered evil
because too much of either is not
conducive to life you can't continue to
play and we all know this
the question therefore becomes
if we all know this
how does evil exist
how does it operate in the world through
human action
well
evil
doesn't look evil
at least in the early stages
in fact evil kinda has to present itself
as the good
or else no one would follow it

[02:01]
or else no one would follow it
so what does it look like
in most cases
when it comes to the games that humans
play with each other whether in their
intimate relationships on the stage of
geopolitics
evil looks like this
one side says
the stakes are high
higher than they've ever been
we cannot afford to lose this battle
if we lose evil will win
therefore we are justified in doing
whatever is necessary to make the world
safe for good
this sentence this belief
is the seed of human evil
human evil is born from the desire to
make the world safe for good
because what that belief suggests is
that the other side is too dangerous or
too threatening or too evil
to continue to exist
therefore we are justified by the
necessity of our actions to oppress and

[03:01]
necessity of our actions to oppress and
control and destroy we have to win
otherwise the game will stop and life as
we know it will end
the issue is that winning
brings the game to an end
so this thinking is actually in the
service of death it's evil thinking
but it's hard to see that when you're
wrapped up in the belief
ironically
most
human conflict
is never truly the battle between good
and evil
and that's because generally both sides
think they're good
most conflicts are a battle between good
and good
or at least two perceived goods
which in this framework might actually
be a battle between two evils
two forces that want to win the game and
make the world safe for itself
this situation only creates suffering
and death through unmitigated
destruction or totalitarian control

[04:03]
destruction or totalitarian control
on the other hand that which is in the
service of life
is anything that allows the play to
continue
this thinking is tolerant it's adaptive
it's strategic and creative
and if it has to fight its goal is not
the total annihilation of the other
as that would bring the game to the halt
a great example of the force of life in
action is the process of evolution
it keeps moving and flowing and adapting
and that change is essential to the
continuation of life under all kinds of
circumstances
the upshot is that we have to use our
discernment to carefully examine what is
good and what merely looks like it
and that in the vast majority of cases
this town really is big enough for the
two of us
