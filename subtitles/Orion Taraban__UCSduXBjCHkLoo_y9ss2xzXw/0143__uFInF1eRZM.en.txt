i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
don't expect recognition
this is a tough one for folks which is
why it's going in the unpleasant truths
playlist
people have this deep psychological need
to be recognized and acknowledged i have
it you have it we all have it
unfortunately i'm here to tell you that
it's rarely reasonable to expect
recognition
and here's why
recognition requires
some degree of mastery
for instance if i were to put 10 chess
boards in front of you with the pieces
arrayed in different patterns and
combinations
would you be able to point out the game
that was being played by the grand
master
probably not
i mean if you just have a basic
understanding of chess all those chess
boards are going to look pretty much the
same to you

[01:00]
same to you
brilliance could be staring you in the
face but you would lack the ability to
recognize it
it would require somebody who's pretty
much at master status to be able to
recognize the game being played by the
grand master
some measure of expertise is required to
recognize competence and mastery without
it mastery remains completely invisible
to the uninitiated
and most people whether you like it or
not will be forever
uninitiated into your specific field of
competence and mastery that's just the
way it is
so to expect the uninitiated to be able
to recognize masterful behavior is
unreasonable
you might be able to receive some
recognition from a small subset of
individuals who exist within your domain
of mastery and who aren't corrupted by
nvn resentment but you can't reasonably
expect it from people on the whole
it's a bitter pill to swallow but it's
the truth
