This is very important. Listen to me. If
there weren't an underclass of women
willing to satisfy men's sexual needs
cheaply and easily, well, I doubt that
men would long put up with the lady's
nonsense. What does that mean? In my
opinion, one of the main reasons why
gentlemen were willing to put up with
the extended courtship of the lady and
the lifetime of matrimony that followed
was that they weren't really going to
ladies for sex. There were prostitutes
for sex both before they got married and
after. Ladies were about reproduction
which obviously involved sex and the
consolidation of resources across one's
bloodline which given uncertain
paternity was a big reason why men
themselves preferred that ladies but not
women in general put sex on the other
side of marriage. After all, they could
get sex elsewhere. Why else would they
jump through all the ridiculous hoops
and constraints involved in courting a
lady, especially in a society where they

lady, especially in a society where they
had like all of the power? Prostitutes
were social sacrifices that ensured the
lady's survival. And that's a deeper
psychological explanation for the
animosity between these two groups. No
one likes being a sacrifice for someone
else's good against their consent. And
no one likes being reminded of their
role in this iniquity.
