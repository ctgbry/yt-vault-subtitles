I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych
haacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to get any man you want the
unbreakable rule okay so this is the
third episode in a three-part series
entitled how to get any man you want
this series is for the ladies and it was
created in response to your popular
demand here's the thing men are not that
complicated if you are single and you do
not want to be it is your fault ladies
it all begins with accepting
responsibility for that fact just like
it's the man's fault if he cannot be
sufficiently attractive to a woman to
secure the sexual opportunity it is your
fault if you cannot be sufficiently
attractive to a man to secure the
commitment opportunity it's on you
fortunately I'm here to help now to get
any man you want you only really need to
do three things in my first episode I

[01:02]
do three things in my first episode I
talked about the first thing you need to
be useful it's by being useful that you
can insinuate yourself so completely
into the day-to-day operation of a man's
life that it would be next to impossible
to get rid of you that's de facto
commitment in the second episode I
talked about the second thing you have
to be the nastiest [ __ ] version of
yourself possible it's by doing things
with him sexually that you have done
with other men and ideally that he
hasn't done with other women that you
will most effectively communicate your
interest and attraction satisfy his
libido proactively and due to the
refractory period you've got de facto
exclusivity and in this episode I'm
going to talk about the third thing the
unbreakable Rule now I'm sure a number
of you women watched those first two
episodes and said to yourselves Orion
that's not it I did both of those things

[02:00]
that's not it I did both of those things
look at me I look good no man has ever
had complaints in the sexual Department
I take care of all that and I do
everything for my man I cook I clean I
look after his kids I do his taxes I
mean like Orion you do not know what you
are talking about I've done both of
those things and it still doesn't
work
okay I believe you if you did the first
two things and it still didn't work
there are only two real possib
possibilities here the first possibility
is that you have a love savior complex
this is basically the female equivalent
of the white night complex in men you
choose messed up project men who you
think you can improve through the
healing power of your love this is the
Beauty and the Beast delusion and it
doesn't work I mean it's a fairy tale
ladies it's not meant to be taken
literally if this is you just like those
white- knighted men you have to take a
deep Long look at yourselves and heal

[03:01]
deep Long look at yourselves and heal
whatever part of you believes that you
are not enough fix yourselves and you
won't have to fix men so that's the
first possibility but to be honest the
second possibility is much more likely
if you're still not with the man you
want it's very likely that you're in
this situation because you violated the
unbreakable rule this means that you did
the one thing that you absolutely
positiv weren't supposed to do which is
what this episode is about this rule is
a trump card if you violate this rule it
doesn't matter if you do the other two
things and I know for a fact that there
are a lot of you out there breaking the
unbreakable rule you might be doing it
right now that's how common it is so
what's this unbreakable rule to
paraphrase Solomon purportedly the
wisest man who has ever lived a wise

[04:00]
wisest man who has ever lived a wise
woman builds a house with her hands and
tears it down with her
mouth with her mouth the reason ladies
why you are still single after doing the
other two things is because you ran your
mouth the unbreakable rule is that you
can't ever disrespect the man you want
to be with period you have to remove
every single iota of disrespect from
your communication it's a going out of
business sale it's all got to go this
means not a single critical word or a
contemptuous glance or an impatient sigh
it's all got to be exercised from your
communication and if you don't do this
you will continue to snatch defeat from
the jaws of success time and time again
now before I go go any further if you're

[05:00]
now before I go go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this episode to someone
who might benefit from its message
because it's Word of Mouth referrals
like this that really help to make the
channel grow you may also consider
hitting the thanks button and tipping me
in proportion to the value you feel
you've derived from this episode it's
your support that helps make all of this
possible I really appreciate it now let
me go off script for a moment and give
you an example of what I was talking
about many years ago uh a female who was
close to me gave me a
all distraught apparently her boyfriend
had taken her out for dinner on
Valentine's Day and as they were eating
dinner in the middle of the restaurant
apparently this man just decided to
start yelling and screaming at her and
berating her and criticizing her before
storming out of the
restaurant and this woman was distraught
and wanting to know how she might
navigate this situation and I began by

[06:00]
navigate this situation and I began by
responding okay I don't really believe
that that's how things went down she
said well what do you mean I said I
don't know this guy but I doubt that
he's psychotic and a normal adult man
does not just sit in the middle of a
public restaurant and start yelling and
screaming at his woman on Valentine's
Day so there must I'm not saying he
should have been screaming at you I
wasn't there but there had to have been
something that you said or did
that triggered that interaction and that
suggestion that there was something that
that woman might have said or did to set
this guy off set her off again and she
started yelling and screaming at me why
you take this man's position I can't
believe you would take his side and she'
hang up on me and and that was the end
of that so it's like not only do women
often not appreciate that they might be
contributing to their own difficulties
they don't want to hear how they might
be contributing to their own
difficulties even when they ask for how

[07:02]
difficulties even when they ask for how
they are contributing to their
difficulties so I'm going to take one
for the team here because I'm on a
screen so you can't really you know come
after me um because I'm going to tell
you the things that a lot of men might
have tried to tell you in the past but
you might not have reacted um in a
positive way to that feedback okay all
right women the [ __ ] I have heard you
say in my lifetime if I were to say to
another man I would get knocked into
next [ __ ] week you have to understand
that a man is like both an angel and an
animal we're not all good and we're not
all bad and the animal is going to
respond how you would expect an animal
to respond disrespecting criticizing or
attacking a man is going to arouse the
animal in him expressing contempt for a
man well at the same time expecting that
he exercise perfect Angelic patience and
self Transcendence with you doesn't make

[08:02]
self Transcendence with you doesn't make
a lot of sense does it you wouldn't go
around slapping rattlesnakes or mocking
grizzly bears or shaming wild dogs would
you we wouldn't say there was anything
fragile about those animals if they were
to respond in line with their Natures
would we now I am definitely not
advocating that men respond to women's
attacks in kind in any way men should
never fight with a woman ever it's just
not worth it because there's no real way
to win so if men can't really respond
and women continue with the disrespect
what's the only thing that men can
do
leave which is what they do no amount of
sex or assistance is enough to
compensate for a disrespectful woman and
it's a very stupid woman who forces a
man to choose
between her and his own Peace of Mind

[09:03]
between her and his own Peace of Mind
especially since other women exist who
will not force him to make that
decision now does this mean that you
have to like everything that your man
does no does this mean that you have to
agree with everything your man thinks no
does this mean that you have to turn a
blind eye to every mistake he makes
definitely not but does this mean that
you have to find ways to differ disagree
and correct without disrespecting him
ABS [ __ ]
lutely and you can do it respect is a
quality of action if you can do
something disrespectfully I guarantee
that you can do the same thing
respectfully so you're going to need to
remove all the disrespectful components
of your Communication in order to get
and keep the man that you want and for
the record this doesn't just mean
communication with the man in question
it means all of your communication about
the man in question to your friends your

[10:02]
the man in question to your friends your
family your co-workers do not complain
about your man to other people it's a
bad look ladies because who the [ __ ]
chose that man did he Bonk you on the
head and drag you off like a caveman it
was your choice to be with that guy you
worked to get him in most cases so
talking [ __ ] behind a man's back only
makes you look foolish and of course all
of that talk eventually gets back to the
guy anyway
the way to keep yourself safe here
ladies is to pretend that you're talking
to whoever you're talking about again
pretend you're talking to whoever you're
talking about follow this advice and it
will be much much harder for you to
break the unbreakable rule finally women
you may need to appreciate that you
could be communicating disrespect to men
in unintentional ways remember in this
case it doesn't matter whether or not
you think something is disrespectful it
matters whether he thinks something is
disrespectful the cat decides what milk

[11:03]
disrespectful the cat decides what milk
is good you can see my episode respect
means different things to men and women
for more on this topic the easiest way
to approach how men understand respect
is to examine the military militaries
are created by men for men and they
codify all kinds of masculine ideals
honor Duty status and respect and the
easiest way for anyone to mentally test
whether or not some Behavior could be
construed as disrespectful is to imagine
whether or not you would do that with a
superior officer ladies if you wouldn't
say that in that way to your boss or
your Co then do not say that in that way
to your man that's the unbreakable rule
you can't ever disrespect the man you
want to be with not once this means
words this means gestures facial
expressions tones of voice this means
things you do and things you passively

[12:01]
things you do and things you passively
aggressively don't do get rid of it all
you can keep your man or you can keep
your disrespect but you may not be able
to keep both the choice is yours so
let's recap women can get any man that
they have direct access to even if
they're not extremely attractive the
master key the way to get your foot in
the door is to be useful because that
allows you to enter into progressively
more intimate dimensions of his life
once you're there the hook the way to
capture a man is to be the nastiest
[ __ ] version of yourself because
this is the principal thing a man can
get from you that he can't get anywhere
else and finally you keep your position
by honoring the unbreakable rule
eliminating every single form of
disrespect from your communication if
you follow these three steps then you
too can get any man that you want
