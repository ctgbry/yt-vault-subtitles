i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
how to make better
decisions okay so when i talk about this
subject with my clients i usually
usually use the metaphor of the
crossroads so you know what a crossroads
is
past diverging out in different
directions
we know that we're at a crossroads in
our day-to-day lives
when there's some sort of somatic
experience that lets us know oh this is
a
crisis point this is a choice point
where the decision that we're about to
make
actually has important emotional
consequences for ourselves
and it's it's somatic for me it means
that my heart starts to race a little
bit
and maybe i have a queasy feeling in my
gut
and those are signals i've learned that
the next thing i'm about to do is
actually an important decision that i'm
making now
in that moment most likely i know

[01:01]
in that moment most likely i know
what i feel like doing it's my default
action it's what i've done hundreds if
not thousands of times
i'm nervous in a social interaction so
i'm gonna get out i have a craving to
use so i'm gonna
smoke etc i know
what that emotion that somatic
experience
prompts me to do and i also know where
that
road at the crossroads leads it
predictably leads
to me feeling ashamed to leave being
addicted
to me suffering some sort of negative
outcome
and to really understand and appreciate
that roads only go where they go
it's impossible for a road to go
anywhere other than where it goes
i can't go down that road and expect
that it's going to lead anywhere else
and i've gone down that road tens of
thousands of times do i really need to
go down that road
ten thousand and one i know every house
on that road i don't have a brick in the
wall on that road there are many other
roads in the world i'm gonna go down

[02:00]
roads in the world i'm gonna go down
some of these other ones
anyway how to make better decisions is
to use that somatic experience to
understand
oh i'm about to make a decision with
consequence
and to feel the emotional impulse to
move in the default direction
and to exercise the intentional courage
to move in a different desired direction
in that case it's generally a good idea
to have the replacement
behavior already kind of
on deck in your mind what i'm going to
do instead
of smoking what i'm going to do instead
of seeking reassurance what i'm going to
do instead
of overeating what i'm going to do
instead of cutting or whatever your
your problem is and it's going to
feel really really weird because it's
going against
every emotional cell in your body in
that moment
but this actually is a decision with
consequence
arnold schwarzenegger once said in a i
think a commencement speech
that he only starts counting his sit-ups

[03:00]
that he only starts counting his sit-ups
when it starts to hurt
because only when it starts to hurt that
he's actually building a muscle and
making progress up until the pain starts
it's just preamble if he's if he were to
stop
before the pain started he wouldn't be
making any real progress
so this thematic experience that lets us
know around the crossroads
illustrates that we're actually at a
position where if we make a decision now
if we keep going
it will make a difference it will
actually build a muscle and create a
different outcome for us
so that's what i have to say on the
matter uh please like and subscribe
we'll talk more bye
