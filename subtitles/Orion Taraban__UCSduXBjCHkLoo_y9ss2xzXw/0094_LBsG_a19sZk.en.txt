i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the problem with passion
passion is a concept that is thrown
around a lot
particularly with respect to people's
work
i would suggest that if passion is
appropriate anywhere it's in the context
of your romantic relationships but this
is the world we live in
people really feel like it's important
to feel passionate about what they do
for a living and i have a problem with
passion because i understand the origin
of the word
etymologically
passion means
suffering
i'll say it again passion means
suffering
this is the key to unlocking certain
spiritual principles such as the passion
of the christ
without this understanding it really
doesn't make any sense why we would call
the humiliation and crucifixion of jesus
his passion

[01:00]
his passion
everything about that story goes against
what people generally associate with
that word and that's how the word has
actually been utilized until recently
for hundreds of years passion means
suffering
now potentially
passion is a kind of exquisite suffering
that facilitates self-transcendence
towards a higher ideal which you could
argue is what happened on the cross but
this isn't generally something that's
appropriate for your nine-to-five
passion is historically a
self-annihilating vocation
like the years michelangelo spent
painting the ceiling of the sistine
chapel this was both an agony and an
ecstasy that permanently damaged the
artist's eyesight
however his passion for the project
supported his obvious suffering toward a
self-transcendent goal
if passion is missing from your everyday
life
that isn't actually a problem and that's

[02:01]
that isn't actually a problem and that's
because passion rightly has no claim to
the tasks of daily life
it is better understood as a spiritual
aspiration
few people are truly touched by passion
in their lives
and they are inevitably destroyed in the
process
it is associated with glory sure but not
with stability and material success
so if you're looking for passion it's
important to be aware that you're
actually chasing after suffering a
self-destructive form of suffering
so you know be careful what you wish for
personally i much prefer to like what i
do as opposed to love what i do when we
love things we generally over identify
with them which puts us on the roller
coaster we're over the moon when things
go well and we're inconsolable when
things go poorly this is the over
identification when the job is good
we're good when the job is bad we're bad

[03:00]
we're good when the job is bad we're bad
but when we like things we generally
keep enough daylight between ourselves
and the liked object to maintain our
objectivity and emotional equilibrium
this means that our well-being can exist
largely independent of our professional
fortune at any given moment
which is psychologically healthy
that's what i have to say for today
