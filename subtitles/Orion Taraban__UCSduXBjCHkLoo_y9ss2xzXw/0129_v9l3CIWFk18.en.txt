i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
the balance of attraction is a concept
that i came up with to explain certain
emotional dynamics within romantic
relationships
the concept is predicated on a
fundamental axiom which is
no two people can like each other
exactly the same amount
seems reasonable enough yeah no two
people can like each other exactly the
same amount
now one of the corollaries of this axiom
is that
in any romantic relationship
one person likes the other more
and one person likes the other less
if you accept that attraction is unequal
this conclusion is inescapable
we can call the person who likes the
other more
the adorer
and the person who likes the other less
the adored

[01:01]
the adored
the adorer
and the adored
adorers get to be with the one they love
and the adored get to be loved by the
ones there with i'm going to say that
again adorers get to be with the one
they love
and the adored get to be loved by the
ones they're with
it's not possible for one person to
occupy both of these positions
simultaneously
that said in any given relationship it's
certainly possible for each person to
vacillate between these two positions
from day to day or even from moment to
moment
however it is also generally the case
that over time
the dynamics of a given relationship
tend to become fairly established
that is in most relationships there is
the person who tends to occupy the
position of the adorer more often
and there is the person who tends to
occupy the position of the adored more

[02:01]
occupy the position of the adored more
often
and here's the thing
these two positions are actually value
neutral
it's not better to be the adored than
the adorer and vice versa there are pros
and cons to each position it may not
seem that way but as we'll see in future
episodes the desirability of any one
position is really based on two things
what a given person is looking for in a
relationship
and which provides a better fit for that
person's personality and temperament
so stay tuned
