in general we know that individually if
you control for all other things women
will select this quality over this other
quality like in general if all of the
things are being every other part of a
man's personality lifestyle and
presentation are exactly the same and
one guy's significantly wealthier than
the other they're going to choose the
wealthier guy because why not choose the
wealthier guy if two guys are completely
identical in all other respects but one
guy is 6'2 and the other guy is 5'4 why
not choose the 62 guy so we do know that
that women typically want men who are a
little bit older who are stronger who
are taller who make more money who are a
higher status who are more successful
and are capable of inviting them into an
emotionally compelling lifestyle that's
part of what women are attracted to what
they want also depends on their goals
contrary to popular belief some women
just want to and when they're looking
for that they prioritize a different
subset of qualities than when they're
looking to say get married and settle
down
