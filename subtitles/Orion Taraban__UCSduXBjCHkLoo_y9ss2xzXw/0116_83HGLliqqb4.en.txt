i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
love and the alphabet
there's this parable from judaism that i
love i might get some of the details
wrong but here's the gist of it a family
is going to temple to make an offering
to god
and all the family members take turns
placing something of value on the altar
dad put some money on the altar
mom offers some food
the eldest son offers his favorite toy
but the youngest child maybe he's two or
three
he's sad
because he has nothing so he has nothing
to offer
so what the child decides to do
is to recite the alphabet for god
because that's the one thing he knows
how to do
and according to the parable this was
the offering that was most highly prized
by god
and i think there are two reasons why
this was the case in the first place as

this was the case in the first place as
offerings go it was pure
simple and sincere
and these things are generally pleasing
to the divine in most traditions
when it comes to devotion and love
it's really the sincerity of the gift
that matters most of all
and in the second place i think the
youngest child's offering was the most
valued by god because
the child
alone
gave all that he had
the others just gave a part of what they
had the dad had more money
the eldest son had more toys
the youngest child gave all that he had
and who could possibly give more than
all
so i really like this parable because it
opens up a door to some of the
possibilities of love which kind of
turned the values of day-to-day life
upside down
and it's a way to enter into deeper
relationships with both god and others
