Why do men often pretend to be interest
I mean I know the answer to this
question because you just touched on it
but I think this is fascinating. [music]
Tell me why men often pretend to be
interested in long-term relationships
and women often pretend to be more
interested in sex at first. I think both
of them are trying to display what they
believe the other party wants. And I
mean we could call that lying and in
some cases it is but it could also mean
kind of putting your best foot forward.
Is it lying when you go to a job
interview and say, you know, I really
believe in creating shareholder value
and I'm really excited to be a part of
your team to help you reach your goals.
Like the not it's not a lie. It's just
that the unspoken part is as long as you
compensate me handsomely and don't treat
me like crap. And you know that same job
that you're jumping through your butt to
get and are enthusiastically [music]
celebratory when you receive it is the
one that you about further down the road
and you're looking for something better
once you get acclimated to that uh

[01:00]
once you get acclimated to that uh
position or opportunity. So I think it's
just both parties believing that they
know what the other party wants and
showing I can do that. I can give that
to you because that's basically the
basis of relationships is that you have
to want something from me. If you don't,
you don't deal with me at all. You won't
even talk to me because that's an
opportunity cost. You could take your
time and attention elsewhere where it'd
be more profitably deployed.
