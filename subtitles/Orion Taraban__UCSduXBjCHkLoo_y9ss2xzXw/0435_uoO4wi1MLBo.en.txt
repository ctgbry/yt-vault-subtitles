women are complicated like all people
they want to get what they want but on
another level they also don't want to
get what they want how does this work if
a woman succeeds in getting what she
wants from you too often whether she's
aware of it or not she's going to start
to feel that she is more powerful than
you and that is going to start to make
her feel unsafe a man who can
appropriately Hold the Line against her
consumptive love communicates that he is
centered in his masculine purpose that
he can tolerate her distress at being
disappointed and that he is more
powerful than she is which actually
allows her to relax into the
relationship women like to test how much
they can get away with which means that
they will sometimes even ask for
unreasonable things just to see if you
have the spine to turn them down by
disappointing women you communicate that
you are maintaining frame which means
that she can relax into her feminine
because she is not driving the ship
