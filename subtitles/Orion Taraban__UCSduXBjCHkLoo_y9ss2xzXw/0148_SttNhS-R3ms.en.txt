i'm dr orion taraban and this is
psychatz better living through
psychology and the subject of today's
short talk is how to do something you've
never done before
so every day is a challenge that brings
with it new and unexpected difficulties
to overcome and sometimes it can be
intimidating when you're confronted with
a problem that you've never worked
through in the past so i'm here to offer
you two tips for overcoming new problems
in your life whatever they may be
the first is to look around and ask
yourself
are there any other people who have
successfully dealt with this problem
for example i've worked with a lot of
new parents in my practice and some of
them understandably experience anxiety
over their new roles after all taking
care of a child might not be something
they've ever done before
so i asked these folks hey look around
do you see any other people who have
successfully overcome this problem
yes there are literally billions of

[01:01]
yes there are literally billions of
people on this planet who have become
parents more or less successfully to
their children
and then i think
if these people can do it then so can i
i'm no better and no worse than any of
these people who have managed to
overcome the same problem so if they can
do it i can definitely do it
the second tip is to refocus attention
on your own ability your own capacity
for example i'll look back over the
course of my life and remember hey
there's been hundreds if not thousands
of times in the past that i've
encountered a novel problem
without precedent in my life and
here i am today
so i must have been able to overcome it
one way or another
this means that the experience of
overcoming an unprecedented problem of
doing something i've never done before
actually has a great deal of precedent

[02:00]
actually has a great deal of precedent
i've gone through that hundreds or
thousands of times in my life the
details are different but the underlying
experience is the same
so i can feel confident in my ability to
respond appropriately to a novel problem
because i've done so consistently in the
past
in the words of the carthaginian general
hannibal i will either find a way or
make a way
and this novel problem is in actuality
nothing new
