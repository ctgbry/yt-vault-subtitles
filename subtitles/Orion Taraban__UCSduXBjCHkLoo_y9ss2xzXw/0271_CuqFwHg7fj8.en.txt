i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
balance of creation and destruction
so this talk will be somewhat similar to
my episode on the balance of pain and
pleasure because similar to those other
concepts there's not really a balance
between creation and destruction at all
in fact there is a dramatic and
irreducible asymmetry between the two
and before i explain what i mean by that
please remember to like this video and
subscribe to this channel it takes less
than a second costs you nothing and it's
how you can support me in my mission to
deliver free high quality content to the
world thanks for your help
the asymmetry between creation and
destruction is something that we all
understand something that has taken
years decades or even centuries to
create through effort and diligence
perseverance and talent can be destroyed
in seconds with sufficient malice and
power
this is why impatience is always
destructive you can't create much of

[01:02]
destructive you can't create much of
anything in the span of time it takes to
destroy
now destruction is clearly necessary in
the scheme of things
in its most useful aspect destruction is
like a forest fire that can purify a
land of stagnant growth and provide the
fundamental nourishment for that which
we'll come after
a world without destruction would
quickly become choked with the sheer
mass of stuff which paradoxically would
make creativity destructive by
suffocating space and exhausting
opportunity
that said it's just incomparably more
difficult and time-consuming and
requires substantially more effort and
talent to be creative
especially if you strive to create
something enduring and worthwhile
nsa symmetry is very easily observed in
social media
as the producer of my own little podcast
i
can attest to the fact that it takes a
great deal of effort and some degree of

[02:00]
great deal of effort and some degree of
courage to stand out from the crowd
to use your real name and face and say
this is what i believe and while on the
whole the response to the channel has
been extremely positive
i think it's no coincidence that those
who seem to disagree most forcefully
with my positions
hide behind anonymity
they use pseudonymous screen names they
don't show their real faces and
likenesses
and as far as i know none of them have
channels of their own
which would offer a more compelling
response to my ideas than a dashed off
comment
however that would require
of course time
energy
effort to create and potentially expose
them to the impatient destructiveness of
others
all of which suggest that whatever the
detractors believe they believe to a
point
namely to the point
that courage and effort would be
required to substantiate their beliefs
in reality
that said should any of them decide to

[03:01]
that said should any of them decide to
create such an alternative then we might
be able to have a dialogue on more equal
footing consider it a friendly challenge
