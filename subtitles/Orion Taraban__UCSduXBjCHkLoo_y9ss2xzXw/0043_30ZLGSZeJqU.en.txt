i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
want versus
need
this is a very useful construct with
respect to the block and replace
technique will also help you do some
ruthless gardening in your mind
so let's talk about some of the
differences between both the words and
the concepts of want
and need
need
at the end of the day is associated with
survival
there are very few things that we
actually need
we need some food
we need water
we need some measure of safety and
shelter
and living in society we need some money
to accrue these things
and beyond that there's not much that we
need
the concept of need being associated
with survival is psychologically
associated with dissolution and death
the threat of dissolution and death

[01:00]
the threat of dissolution and death
on the other hand the concept of want
desire
is psychologically associated with
assimilation and life
in many respects
need and want are kind of like two sides
of the same coin
however which side you choose to focus
on can make an enormous difference in
the experience of your everyday life
so i would encourage you to be
increasingly mindful of your let's say
inappropriate use of the concept of need
which would be in situations outside of
the realm of survival
and block and replace this cognition
with another thought that uses the
concept of want so for example
a person might harbor the belief i need
to be rich
if you feel into this statement you can
sense
like a low-grade anxiety permeating
through this belief
and that's because with the concept of
need there's an implied threat that if
this doesn't happen something very bad
will occur
you can almost imagine this mental slave

[02:00]
you can almost imagine this mental slave
driver whipping the person in question
into shape in order to avoid the
presumed catastrophic outcome
of not being rich in this case
now contrast that with the belief i want
to be rich
the truth is that you don't have to
avoid a negative outcome
in order to want to make money
rich people
want to make more money
i like this reframe because it doesn't
require it doesn't invite in the
negative as a necessary motivating
factor there is no ill to be avoided
just a good to be acquired
by transforming need statements into
want statements
we learned to focus more and more on the
positive things in life that we want to
secure and this is important because
what we focus on becomes the content of
our consciousness the stuff out of which
our reality is literally constructed
moment to moment
if we focus on ills to be avoided by
misapplying the concept of need then

[03:01]
misapplying the concept of need then
reality becomes a dangerous place
full of evils lurking around every
corner
and how would that not exacerbate a form
of generalized anxiety
on the other hand if we focus on the
good to be acquired by utilizing the
concept of want then reality becomes an
abundant place full of resources and
opportunities
so instead of looking for what you need
to avoid
search for what you want to find
and a good way to do that is to be
increasingly mindful and intentional in
our use of these two important concepts
