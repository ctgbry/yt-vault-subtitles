I want to touch on this idea. I think it
was from the book about awareness like
sometimes awareness is it's a
disadvantage like knowing what we're
doing gets in the way of what we're

Yeah. talk about that in chapter one
about the which is probably the most

billions of little weighted calculations
that our perception is recalculating a
new dozens of times every second. We do

the individual in reality. Should I
approach this? Should I run away from
this? And what I posit is that all of
these calculations sort of get
transmuted into an emotion. And as long
as we're aware of what we're feeling, we
don't really need to be aware of what
caused that feeling to fluores inside of
