I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is staying
for the
kids this is potentially going to be a
controversial episode because there are
no easy answers with respect to the
circumstances I'm going to
describe however the issue has come up
enough in my consultations and has been
requested enough over the years to
deserve its own
episode let's get to it
the Crux of the situation is that the
man is in a very toxic or abusive
marriage sometimes this is emotional
abuse yelling name calling controlling
contempt sometimes this is physical
abuse hitting slapping kicking and
sometimes this is neglect passive
aggression emotional withdrawal sexual
foreclosure in such cases the man
typically admits that his marriage is
and it has been for years

[01:01]
and it has been for years
but in his very next breath he tells me
that he can't leave because there are
children
involved now when I ask the guy why this
would matter I typically get one of two
responses on the one hand they believe
that divorce is like inherently bad for
children and that the experience will
mess them up emotionally or
psychologically and on the other hand
they believe that staying together
protects the children usually in one of
two ways either staying together means
the man can kind of serve as a buffer
between the woman and the children that
wouldn't exist if he were to lose full
custody or staying together means that
some other man won't be raising his
children in a blended family stepfather
Arrangement further down the road
basically as bad as their marriages are
these men generally believe that the
costs are off set by the protective

[02:01]
costs are off set by the protective
factor that staying married affords
their
kids again there are no easy answers
here and not everyone is going to agree
with what I'm about to say but I'm going
to spend the rest of this episode
responding to these arguments first and
foremost it's important to understand
that divorce is not necessarily bad for
children like it's much better for kids
if their divorced parents respectfully
co-parent than if their married parents
fight all the time spending years in a
toxic or abusive household is much much
worse for children than navigating a
parental
separation obviously shuffling between
single parent households every few days
is not
ideal but neither is staying mired in
chaotic conflict or an icy Cold War so

[03:02]
chaotic conflict or an icy Cold War so
if the adults for whatever reason can't
find a way to get along with each other
I think it's often better for everyone
involved if they go their separate
ways in my own personal experience when
my parents got divorced things did get
worse like it does take time to
accommodate to The New Normal and to
grieve the loss of the
family but then they got a whole lot
better and I think they got a whole lot
better for everyone involved like the
existence of a legal contract is not a
protective Factor against the effects of
physical or emotional abuse or neglect
like I've never heard anyone say yeah my
mom beats and berates my dad but hey
they're still married so at least we got
that going for us what's best for
children is to be raised in peaceful
loving stable

[04:00]
loving stable
relationships however of these three
factors the first two are the most
important because without the first two
the third factor is hell like you don't
win points if your conflictual and
abusive relationship is
stable so if it's easier for parents to
individually provide peaceful and loving
environments then we shouldn't
necessarily tied the family structure
for being unstable in any case divorce
is not inherently bad for kids but
conflict and chaos and abuse and
addiction absolutely
are if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and

[05:01]
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description now let's address the
protective Factor argument
unfortunately unfortunately the fact of
the matter is that there is little a man
can do to prevent these potential
outcomes like your woman could come home
with papers today and there is nothing
you could do to prevent a divorce and
its
consequences marriage in today's day and
age is a completely at will relationship
it does not provide nearly the amount of
security that people somehow still
believe believe that it does and the

[06:01]
believe believe that it does and the
default Arrangement barring severe and
documented abuse neglect or incompetence
irrespective of the reasons behind the
divorce is that the woman receives at
least half custody of the children at
least and however that person chooses to
parent the kids when she has custody
including involving a stepfather as long
as it's not illegal and not in violation
of the agreement is kind of none of your
business and trying to make it your
business will likely create a power
struggle that would be very difficult to
win I'd like to submit that every man
should understand that this is one of
the possible outcomes that he could face
if he decides to have children with his
wife he needs to accept the possibility
not only that this could occur but that
there is functionally nothing he could
do to prevent it should his wife one day
have a mind to behave this way

[07:00]
have a mind to behave this way
and if he can't accept that possibility
he probably shouldn't get married and
have kids preventing this outcome is
just it's just not in his domain of
control my point here is that putting up
with abuse neglect or physical violence
does absolutely nothing to prevent this
outcome like a woman can neglect and
abuse you and still divorce you the two
variables don't actually have anything
to do with one another pretending that
they do is a coping mechanism it's a way
of feeling that you have some measure of
control over something that ultimately
is completely out of your
control and frankly it isn't all that
much different from what children do
when they grow up in abusive households
the dysfunction is outside of their
control so they inappropriately take
responsibility for it mommy and daddy
fight because I'm a bad boy because even

[08:02]
fight because I'm a bad boy because even
though this turns the child against
himself that condition is less painful
than the powerlessness he currently
feels putting up with things that people
have no business putting up with does
not prevent the feared outcome because
the feared outcome has always ever been
outside of their control and in the
absence of any real consequences
relations will likely continue to
deteriorate as well listen to me listen
to me regardless of your real intentions
you should
never ever ever allow your partner to
believe that you will stay with them no
matter
what
like imagine how your workplace
performance would change over time if
you understood that you could never be
fired no matter what you did or didn't
do too much safety is dangerous as the

[09:00]
do too much safety is dangerous as the
lack of appropriate consequences tends
to make people monstrous not a good
idea
finally this is the best point here it's
important for men in such situations to
deeply consider what they are teaching
their kids by choosing to stay in a
toxic or abusive
relationship for
them because your kids are paying
attention even if they don't know the
extent or the specifics of your marital
dysfunction trust me they know that
something is wrong which can be even
more crazy making because they can't put
their finger on the source of their
distress what are you really teaching
your
kids imagine in 30 years time your
little girl comes to you and says
daddy my husband hits me when he drinks
too
much be honest with yourself are you

[10:00]
much be honest with yourself are you
going to reply well sweetie you made a
vow and it's going to be really hard on
the kids if you separate so you might
need to suck it up and take one for the
team
here probably not right but that's
precisely what you'd be teaching
her to do by staying in a toxic or
abusive relationship for her sake and
because she grew up in that abusive
environment and because you communicated
with your behavior that abuse is
tolerable trust me she is far far more
likely to end up in this hypothetical
scenario than if you had behaved
differently by staying for the kids you
ultimately teach your children that
their happiness doesn't
matter their health doesn't matter their
safety doesn't matter as soon as they
become apparent

[11:00]
become apparent
you teach your children that it's right
and good to make a sacrifice of your own
life so that someone else might
potentially be happy but look at your
kids now are they
happy like does that sacrifice even work
I don't think it does I don't think
happiness can be transferred through
sacrifice it it can't so not only does
this not work but it imparts some pretty
dangerous teachings to children that
they are much more likely to replicate
in their adult
relationships ultimately the idea here
is to act in such a way that you would
hope your children would act if they
were in the same situation that you're
currently in does that make sense
because if you do any less you're not
actually doing much long-term good for
your kids if they end up in the exact
same situation you're in and they make
the exact same decisions that you're

[12:01]
the exact same decisions that you're
currently making how would you feel
about
that how would you feel about
that something to
