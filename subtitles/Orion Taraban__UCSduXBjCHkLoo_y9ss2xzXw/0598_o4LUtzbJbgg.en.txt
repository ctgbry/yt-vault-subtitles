I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
not be part of the problem so if you
look around you will see that there are
a lot of issues facing the world today
and that perception is subject to making
a lot of people upset however I am here
to tell you in no uncertain terms that
the last thing the world needs is
another angry person
now I appreciate that some of you out
there may have heard that statement to
mean Orion thinks that there's nothing
in this world worth getting angry about
and that means that Orion must be fine
with the way things are however Orion
did not say that and Orion didn't mean
those things what I said was the last
thing the world needs is another angry
person stop like don't think past that
just consider that one statement the

[01:01]
just consider that one statement the
last thing the world needs is another
angry
person are there issues in the world yes
are there things to get angry about yes
and are there many other ways of more
effectively responding to those issues
than getting angry ABS [ __ ]
lutely when you perceive the problems of
the world and you become angry usually
impotently angry because you are not
generally taking constructive action in
response to your subjective anger you
actually become part of the problem one
of the biggest problems facing the world
today is this epidemic of anger and
outrage on both sides it's destroying
people's Health it's destroying people's
relationships and it motivates people to
do all kinds of crazy irrational things
it's a real problem now we don't want to
be part of the problem now do we we want
to be part of the solution

[02:00]
to be part of the solution
and one of the best ways that we can do
that is to maintain our emotional
equilibrium so that we can work to solve
problems in a reality based way anger
typically isn't required and it
generally situates people as part of the
issue now a lot of this has to do with
the fact that in today's day and age
it's like socially required to have the
correct opinion about things one way or
another like in order to maintain your
relationships with your friends and your
relatives and your colleagues and your
communities it has become increasingly
necessary to hold the correct read same
opinion as those around you anyone who
doesn't is increasingly at risk of being
cancelled or fired or cut off and this
is crazy in these last few years I have
seen people turn their backs on their
long-standing friends

[03:00]
long-standing friends
I've seen family members cut each other
out of their lives I've seen companies
fire hardworking employees not for
abuse not for incompetence not for
negligence or corruption or criminality
or any of the serious problems that
unfortunately still exist in society
today but because of a difference of
opinion and that is
insane but that's where we are today
the necessity is not just to have an
opinion but to have the correct read
same opinion as those around
you this necessity is directly
responsible for making Society more
polarized and fragmented directly
responsible so how do we fix this to be
honest it's probably asking too much to
encourage people to be more courageous
and to maintain their positions
irrespective of the social consequences
though that would certainly help to

[04:00]
though that would certainly help to
solve the issue most people just aren't
going to do that some people will most
people won't so I'm not going to
recommend that as a solution because a
solution that most people won't do isn't
really a solution so the solution I'm
going to recommend instead is something
I call the cognitive shelf so what is
that well before I Define that if you're

if you want to opt in you can do so on
my website let's get back to it okay I'd
like you to imagine that there is a
shelf in your mind where you can put
things

[05:00]
things
that you haven't made up your mind about
yet like when you hear something when
you take it inside of you you don't
immediately have to swallow it and you
don't immediately have to spit it out
that is you don't immediately have to
decide whether you accept or reject
whatever it is that you heard and this
is fortunate because in the vast
majority of cases that decision will
require deliberation research and
consideration and people are skipping
over all that when they just decide to
swallow things uncritically or to spit
things out the moment they come into
contact with them and that's because for
a lot of people those are the only two
options that they know but I'm here to
tell you that there is a third option
and that's the cognitive shelf so if
you've already heard something if you've
already put something inside of you and
you haven't yet decided whether you want
to swallow it or spit it out you can
just put it on this shelf in your mind
for for a while you acknowledge that it

[06:01]
for for a while you acknowledge that it
exists but you neither accept nor reject
it people seem to have forgotten that it
is okay not to have an opinion about
something it is okay to defer having an
opinion until you have sufficiently
examined the issue in fact it's kind of
ethically imperative that people do that
otherwise more likely than not they are
adding to the
problem most people don't have a
cognitive shelf like this is not
something that is talked about socially
most people don't even know that it
exists but I'm creating it inside of you
by talking about it now now you know
that it exists and now you know that it
exists inside of you and now you know
that this is another possibility for you
when you're confronted with one of the
many extremely nuanced and complex
issues that populate the world today
because let's be honest

[07:00]
because let's be honest
you probably don't know much about that
issue like that's the default of all
people at all times we don't [ __ ]
know much about anything so most things
if we're being intellectually honest are
things that we're not yet prepared to
either accept or reject they go on the
shelf and I think that this could be
part of the solution because the social
risks associated with implementing the
cognitive shelf are much lower than
those associated with say
actively and courageously pushing back
on things and keep in mind that actively
and courageously pushing back on things
as a big group like in massive protest
or exhibiting the acceptable outrage of
the moment aren't usually very
courageous courage is one against a 100
it's not a 100 against one people will
say or do all kinds of bold things in a
group that they wouldn't dream of saying
or doing on their own

[08:00]
or doing on their own
the true measure of Courage is taken
when the individual engages the majority
not when the majority engages the
individual the former is courage the
latter is
bullying that is why Mark Twain said
whenever you find yourself on the side
of the majority it's time to pause and
reflect in any case the cognitive shelf
might help to reduce the polarization of
society which is making more and more
people angry which is turning the world
into one big powder kick ask yourself do
you think the world is better for people
having become
angrier do you think it's more peaceful
is it safer are people healthier and
happier has quality of life gone up I
mean to me the answers are obvious but
apparently the questions need to be
asked something to consider or at least
something to put on the
Shelf what do you think does this fit
