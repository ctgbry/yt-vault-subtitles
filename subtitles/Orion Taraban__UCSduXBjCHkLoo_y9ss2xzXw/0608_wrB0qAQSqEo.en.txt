limitations make you better the easiest
way I found to explain how this works is
to talk about Batman Bruce Wayne the
handsome brooding billionaire and this
guy can pretty much do what whatever he
wants he's jacked he's rich and he puts
on a costume and flies around the city
he lives above the law which is a
conscious choice on his part to do and
which kind of puts him constantly at
odds with the police but that's how he's
decided to live now Batman's Nemesis is
Joker and despite their differences in
appearance the two are actually fairly
similar Joker also puts on a coste gy
and flies around the city and lives
above the law as a conscious choice and
Joker pretty much uses every opportunity
he can get to remind Batman of this fact
and this is dangerous for Batman because
were he to cross a line a line that
really only exists because he drew it
himself his precarious relationship to
self would crumble into chaos without
these rules he would be no different
from Joker or rather he would be worse
than joker as he would be a
self-righteous deluded hypocrite at
least Joker doesn't have any Illusions
about himself
