the great benefit to light which we can
say collectively is knowledge wisdom or
Revelation is that it can be
communicated to other people pain cannot
be communicated to other people not
really like if you've never broken your
leg how can I really tell you how that
feels the only way you could possibly
approximate it is if you've broken your
leg and it still wouldn't be exactly the
same thing but at least we're kind of in
the ballpark right so pain is a very
personal and subjective experience and
it can't really be communicated or
transmitted which if that were the only
option would suck because that means
that every person has to like start over
and learn all the lessons from scratch
and we wouldn't get anywhere light can
be transmitted light can be communicated
which is fantastic and that's like the
best resource that we have collectively
to fight back against the darkness and
to reduce the amount of unnecessary
suffering on this planet and the light
that I can transmit is my own transmuted
pain it's me potentially saying with my
words I've learned this hard lesson from
the teacher pain and I'm going to try to
teach it to you so that you don't have
to learn the same lesson that I did
