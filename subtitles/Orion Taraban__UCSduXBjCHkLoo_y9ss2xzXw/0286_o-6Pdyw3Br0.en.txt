in my episode Humanity changes slowly if
at all Australian girl asks what is the
best way to stay safe in an unsafe world
this is an excellent question the world
is very unsafe there are no safe spaces
that exist in reality and on some level
the best way to stay safe is not to seek
after safety which doesn't truly exist
and puts you in kind of a prey animal
flight and defensive posture relative to
the world and reality on the other hand
the best way to stay safe in an unsafe
world is to develop your capacities for
strength for perseverance for competence
and to learn how to be
not harmless
to learn how to be
somewhat dangerous yourself and in this
way you can rise the occasion and be a
fully adult mature individual that can
deal successfully with all of the
eventualities that this world is likely
to throw at you
