I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is you are
two
men so today I'm going to address the
guys out there and I'm going to share
with you a concept that has helped me
personally to accelerate my growth as a
man it's this idea that every man is
actually two men in the sense that every
man contains two radically different
irreducible cell
and that both of these selves deserve
attention and cultivation and that one
is ignored to the detriment of both
let's get to it so every man is two men
we're going to call the first man the
worldly man this is the man who is
involved in games of status power wealth
and women these are social games and or
games that involve stuff or matter and
you can call the second man the

[01:01]
you can call the second man the
spiritual man this is the man who is
involved in games of virtue meaning
self-actualization and Enlightenment
broadly defined these are psychological
games and are games that involve
abstractions or
Spirit the domain of the worldly man is
the domain of matter and the domain of
the spiritual man is the domain of
spirit and everything you encounter can
be classified in either one domain or
the other how it's actually very simple
if you use it and have less of it you're
dealing with matter on the other hand if
you use it and have more of it you're
dealing with spirit for example if you
spend a dollar that is if you use it you
will have one fewer dollar so money is
in the domain of the worldly man
conversely if you use courage to face

[02:00]
conversely if you use courage to face
your fear you will have a little more
Courage the next time you need it so
courage is in the domain of the
spiritual man make
sense now these two selves are like
railroad tracks close up they seem to
run on completely parallel tracks and
even appear to be diametrically opposed
to one another however as the tracks
approach the horizon or the limits of
our vision they meet at a single point
of convergence at the highest levels of
comprehension the two selves are really
one however it is useful to consider
them as separate and distinct until we
arrive at that understanding and that
shouldn't be too
difficult because that's our everyday
experience of them like being rich
doesn't make you good and being good
certainly doesn't make you rich and this
is because in our everyday experience
the game of wealth has little if
anything to do with the game of virtue
the rules and methods of the one are

[03:00]
the rules and methods of the one are
very different from the rules and
methods of the other unfortunately this
means that practically speaking what is
good for one self is not necessarily
good or may even be detrimental to the
other so what typically happens is that
men develop veryy
asymmetrically they are out of balance
they either heavily invest in their
worldly success or less commonly their
spiritual
success those with worldly success can
look down on the spiritual man as naive
idealistic and soft-headed at best and
losers and failures at worst the worldly
man is proud to have dispensed with his
Illusions and gains no small measure of
Confidence from his demonstrated ability
to successfully compete in Zero Sum
games for specific
Goods on the other hand the spiritual
man often possesses a measure of
contempt even if it skillfully disguises
compassion passion for the worldly man

[04:02]
compassion passion for the worldly man
he's immature and superficial taken in
by appearances and driven by Craft
materialism unlike the spiritual man the
worldly man has no conception of what is
truly important in life and has been
corrupted by venality and pleasure and
though it may be difficult for him to
admit it the spiritual man is often
envious of the worldly man for enjoying
the success that he believes would be
his just desserts in a fair and
Equitable
world if you're interested in taking
your understanding to the next level I

[05:02]
see you
aboard now I'm here to tell you that
this antagonism between the worldly man
and the spiritual man is misplaced and
dangerous the two selves actually
support each other and at the highest
levels merge into one for instance a man
who has overly developed his worldly
self at the expense of his spiritual
self is unlikely to enjoy sustained
success this is because its virtues like
prudence and wisdom that keep a life of
worldly success from going completely
off the rails failing to cultivate the
spiritual self is ultimately
self-defeating for the worldly self why
go through the trouble of Conquering the
castle if you can't keep it by the same
token what is the point of becoming good
if you lack the power and influence to
do anything about it failing to
cultivate the worldly self is ultimately
self-defeating for the spiritual self
who would like to see some measure of

[06:00]
who would like to see some measure of
positive change in the world whether
it's healing or teaching others or
writing some intractable social
wrong Spiritual Development without
worldly influence is kind of solipsistic
and masturbatory it believes that it's
good to cultivate good for its own sake
but that's not ultimately what good is
good for if we want our world to look
different we need to imbue good men with
worldly power and authority but that
depends first and foremost on the
willingness of good men to not turn
their backs on that
domain there are a lot of spiritual
virtues things like perseverance
trustworthiness and discernment that
facilitate worldly success in many ways
in which worldly concerns like
attractiveness Aesthetics and
feasibility can support spiritual growth
so the two selves actually support each
other like I've said however

[07:00]
other like I've said however
their differences are also extremely
useful why well because the two selves
are so different because their domains
of action are so separate that no matter
what life throws at you you can use it
as an opportunity to strengthen either
the worldly man or the spiritual man
like no opportunity no experience no
event exists outside of the domain of
either one or the other
this means that literally everything
that you experience can be Grist for the
mill nothing is wasted and everything
can fuel your development one way or
another the idea is to switch from one
mode to the other as circumstances
dictate when you're dealing with stuff
with things that decrease with use it's
a good idea to prioritize the worldly
man and the worldly man wants things to
be

[08:00]
be
easy why because ease is a sign that
things are working the way they are
supposed to work the problems come for
the worldly man when things are
difficult and it's his work to transform
ineffectiveness inefficiency and
obstruction into Effectiveness
efficiency and progress once this occurs
the worldly man doubles down on what is
working as this will serve as the source
of even more worldly success too much
difficulty cripples the worldly
man on the other hand when you're
dealing with spirit with things that
increase with use it's a good idea to
prioritize the spiritual man and the
spiritual man wants things to be
hard why because difficulty is a sign
that there is an opportunity to
strengthen and preserve The Virtuous
self the problems come for the the
spiritual man when things are too easy

[09:03]
spiritual man when things are too easy
and it's his work to seek out challenge
and difficulty to stimulate growth and
self-development this creates a virtuous
cycle in which the spiritual man is
increasingly emboldened to overcome even
more difficulty and contend with even
more powerful adversaries too much
comfort cripples the spiritual
man if your life is nothing but
difficulty and obstruction it's going to
be very hard to make progress from a
worldly perspective it takes time and
consistency for the Harvest to come in
but by the same token if your life is
nothing but ease and comfort it's going
to be very hard to develop yourself from
a spiritual perspective a sword rusts in
its Scabbard fortunately men can do both
as the situation warrants when things
are easy become the worldly man and
double down on what is working and when
things are hard become the spiritual man

[10:01]
things are hard become the spiritual man
and lean into the difficulty in this way
no experience is wasted and you will be
able to accelerate your growth
considerably you will also increasingly
understand that the two men are one man
as the selves converge in their highest
