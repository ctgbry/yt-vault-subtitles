i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
what
is the sexual marketplace
the sexual marketplace is
everywhere
and we're all in it
and we all have whether we like it or
not
a perceived value within that
marketplace and just like the stock
market that perceived value fluctuates
from moment to moment
increasing or decreasing depending on
context demand and the perception of the
potential buyer
more than anything else it's our
perceived value within the sexual
marketplace that determines our
optionality with respect to potential
sexual partners at any given time and
that's just the way it is
in this talk i'd like to introduce a
metaphor that i often use to help people
understand how the sexual marketplace
works it goes like this i'd like you to
consider that the sexual marketplace

[01:01]
consider that the sexual marketplace
is like a harbor
a pier
a place where all the boats are okay
and that men and women have different
roles within this metaphor
we'll discuss each in turn starting with
the men
men
it's kind of a good news bad news
situation my brothers
in this metaphor you have three tasks
three things you need to do
and none of them is easy
you also won't be getting a lot of help
if you're a man there's no free lunch
you should expect that without these
things women aren't going to really look
your way and men will step over you on
the street so what are these tasks first
you need to build a boat
second
you need to learn to sail
and third
you need to chart a course
do you understand you have to have
resources
you need to be competent

[02:00]
you need to be competent
and you need to have an overarching
purpose
only then
can you dock your boat in the harbor of
the sectional marketplace and
successfully attract the attention of
women in earnest
this is bad news because any one of
these tasks is a lot of work that could
take years to accomplish however it's
also good news because anything you
spend that much time mastering is yours
by rights and cannot easily be taken
away from you
and what about all the women well in
this metaphor the women get to go down
to the harbor and look at all
the boats
they get to kick their proverbial tires
and look at the cabins and examine the
manifests and interview the captains the
captains are all standing in front of
their boats looking for passengers hey
hey hey do you want to get on this boat
how about a ride
fancy a cruise my dear i'm going to
hawaii well i'm going to australia i'm
going to hong kong
you're welcome to come on board

[03:00]
you're welcome to come on board
the women have their pick of it
and this isn't as easy as it looks
because they know
that each captain is going to advertise
his particular boat in the best possible
light
so the women have to test her available
options and conduct some due diligence
before making their decision
which boat is the most seaworthy will it
stay in one piece out in the open seas
which captain is the most trustworthy
will he take me where he says he's going
to go which boat is the most comfortable
will i be able to live on board for an
extended period of time
these are important questions
and eventually she's going to make her
choice i like this boat i trust this
captain i want to go to that destination
let's do it
and if the man accepts her choice he
welcomes her on board and the two sail
off into the sunset
i mean not really of course but this is
just the introduction to the metaphor
however that's basically how the sexual

[04:02]
however that's basically how the sexual
marketplace works if you're a man you
gotta build a boat
learn to sail and chart a course
and if you're a woman you gotta examine
the boat
test the captain and confirm the
manifest
and what happens after the boat leaves
port
well that's the topic for another
