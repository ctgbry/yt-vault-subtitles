I'm Dr Orion taraband and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how did
we end up here
so many folks are lamenting the current
state of affairs between men and women
especially with respect to mating and
dating and a common refrain that I hear
echoed in the comments and in my
personal life is how did we end up in
this situation like it didn't used to be
this way right how did things get so bad
how did they go off the rails so much
how did we end up here
it's an interesting question and I have
an answer to this question that comes
from a rather unlikely place and if you
can follow me in a spirit of willingness
and open-mindedness I will explain what
I mean
the answer to this question can be found
of all places
in the movie Crouching Tiger Hidden
Dragon
this is just an incredible film because
it has something for everyone on the

[01:00]
it has something for everyone on the
surface it's this really fun martial
arts movie with dazzling visuals and
great acting however the story also
contains several profound psychological
messages that I just wasn't equipped to
appreciate when I first watched the
movie over 20 years ago and if anyone
out there Knows Mr Ang Lee I would be
delighted to know whether he thought the
following interpretations had any Merit
at first blush the film script seems
almost superficial like it's just the
pretext for the action scenes and most
the characterization is accomplished
through subtle suggestion and indirect
reference however this is a clue that
we're actually dealing with archetypes
aspects of human experience that
transcend time and space in fact
Crouching Tiger is a very modern romance
and it's setting in medieval China
allows it to comment on Modern
intersectional Dynamics without being
found out
so what exactly is the underlying

[02:02]
so what exactly is the underlying
message of the movie in so many words
The Narrative relates the story of the
painful and ultimately tragic
relationship between the masculine and
The Feminine both in society as a whole
and in the life of an individual
if you haven't seen the movie I would
highly recommend that you watch it it is
worth two hours of your life as my
analysis will largely assume familiarity
with the characters and the story
the main action of the film revolves
around the green Destiny in ancient
sword wielded by Limu by a powerful Monk
throughout the film Lee represents the
masculine principle he is strong
competent and disciplined and the sword
which is an obvious phallic symbol
represents the legitimate authority of
the masculine in so much as it Accords
with the natural green Order of Things
destiny
we are reminded by Julian Lee's love
interest that he has used the green

[03:01]
interest that he has used the green
destiny justly that is to destroy evil
and protect the defenseless
these coincidentally are the two edges
of the sword to destroy and to protect
without which the sword functionally
could not exist as such
however the movie begins with Lee's
decision to give up the green Destiny by
making a donation of it to his
benefactor
and he does this essentially because
he's tired as he tells Julian the blade
only looks pure because blood washes off
it so easily he's tired of the conflict
and the trouble because it turns out
maintaining Law and Order is a
Relentless struggle and accepting the
unsolved case of Jade Fox the woman who
killed his master there seems to be no
real evil Brewing owing in no small part
to his efforts so it seems like a good
time to retire
this is the first real action that
catalyzes all the subsequent events in a
moment of relative peace the masculine

[04:02]
moment of relative peace the masculine
voluntarily abdicates his power and
authority
it's important to understand that it
would never have been possible for Jen
who represents the feminine principle to
have stolen the sword if it was still in
Lee's possession just think of how
effortlessly he takes the sword back
from her at the waterfall she is only
able to take possession of the power and
authority represented by the sword
because the masculine first abdicated
both
now this abdication of the masculine
created an opportunity for the feminine
in the symbol of gen to seize power and
Jen steals the green Destiny from the
benefactors compound and The Feminine is
motivated to do this because it has
suffered under the masculine both
socially in the form of patriarchal
control and individually in the
suppression of feeling and emotion
I really don't like that word
patriarchal and I think it is woefully
misapplied today however we can see

[05:02]
misapplied today however we can see
examples of it throughout the movie
all three of the main female characters
Julian Jade Fox and Jen
uh have all been negatively impacted by
male dominated uses of power
Lee's Master refuted refused to teach
Jade Fox who was clearly competent
because she was a woman though
apparently he had no problem sleeping
with her
Julian is bound to a life of honor-bound
Chastity when her fiance is killed
preventing her from having a real
relationship with a man and Jen is being
married off by her father to secure his
political advantage in spite of the fact
that she loves someone else
Julian and Jen confess to each other
that neither has ever felt free in her
entire life whereas the freedom of Jade
Fox is that of a fugitive a life of
Perpetual hiding
now the real question of the story is
how is Jen going to end up
the two possibilities are reflected in

[06:00]
the two possibilities are reflected in
the lives of the older female characters
Will she end up like her adoptive older
sister Julian who has submitted to
masculine Authority who tries to teach
Jen about the importance of rules and
respect and who reminds her that the
green Destiny belongs to limubai or Will
she end up like her guardian Jade Fox
who is in open Defiance to that
Authority who has been corrupted by her
pain and who tries to recruit Jen into a
life of open Rebellion most of the movie
is Jen trying to figure out who she is
that is it asks the question of how the
feminine will relate to the masculine
moving forward in light of its suffering

in proportion to the value you feel

[07:01]
in proportion to the value you feel
you've derived from this episode I
really appreciate your support
in any case Jen steals the green Destiny
as a mischievous last hurray before she
submits to her fate
in the process however Jen gets her
first taste of death and killing and
realizes that real life isn't like one
of her martial arts novels she comes
into contact with one of the aspects of
reality that the patriarchy had
protected her from that life is
dangerous and Lawless without the
masculine ordering principle and she is
so frightened by the encounter that she
returns the sword as she does so she is
confronted by Lee who offers to take her
on as a student to provide her with
guidance and structure unfortunately in
this offer Jen only hears submission to
yet another male Authority
of the superiority of the masculine over
the feminine and she refuses to accept
parroting Jade Fox's words of contempt
for rudon the patriarchal institution

[08:01]
for rudon the patriarchal institution
that had snubbed Fox years ago this is a
really important point the pain of Jade
Fox's unfulfilled potential and
unrealized dreams has corrupted her
her revolt against the institutions that
she blames for her pain makes a kind of
sense and even requires a respectable
measure of Courage however despite
everything she may have suffered at the
hands of the patriarchy
nothing causes her more pain than Jen
whose talent and potential surpass her
own and seem to have found a receptive
audience in limubai
Jade Fox indoctrinates Jen into her
contempt for men generally and wudon
specifically not because it is in Jen's
best interests but because it allows her
Jade Fox to maintain a precariously
Superior position Visa vijen a younger

[09:00]
Superior position Visa vijen a younger
more competent adversary
Jade Fox's indoctrination is not done
out of kindness but out of envy
Envy for everything gen could be that
she could not
we know this because even though the
poison that Jade Fox uses a compound
called Purple Yin purple meaning wounded
like a bruise and Yin meaning femininity
or poisonous symbolically her wounded
femininity even though this poison
ultimately kills Limu by Jade Fox
confesses that it was actually intended
for Jen
in a real sense Jen's physical poisoning
would have been the culmination of a
lifetime of emotional poisoning through
different methods however at this part
of the story Jen has yet to really
encounter the consequences of this
indoctrination
now a few days after returning the sword
on her wedding night face to face with
the prospect of consummating a marriage
she doesn't want to a man she doesn't
love Jen tilts over into full Defiance

[10:01]
love Jen tilts over into full Defiance
and steals the green Destiny in earnest
to Jen the sword masculine power and
authority is the ability to be
self-determined to do what one wants
she does not understand the
responsibility that comes with it Jen
has not been taught discipline and
responsibility though to be fair she has
not been willing to learn and the sword
in her hands becomes an instrument of
the unsurrendered will
it's as if Jen the long-suppressed
feminine says enough and a powerful
force the chaotic upsurgence of feeling
begins to Ripple through the story
in the original myth of Aladdin and the
lamp the genie isn't grateful for being
released he is homicidal for having been
pent up for so long and that's right the
longer a feeling has been suppressed the
more violent its Resurgence when it is
ultimately expressed and let's be clear
this isn't all bad on some level the

[11:02]
this isn't all bad on some level the
upsurgence of the feminine of the yin
principle was necessary and inevitable
after all after the Sun at the sun's
Zenith it has already begun to set
for example the feminine was what was
missing from the life of Lee mubai who
is Yang incarnate Lee is so disciplined
and so controlled that when he finally
arrives in Enlightenment he can feel no
joy or Bliss because he is so completely
suffocated his feeling state
as has benefactor says even great Heroes
can be idiots when it comes to emotions
indeed the only time we ever see any
kind of sensuality from Lee is when he's
dancing with his sword in the Moonlight
a kind of masturbatory surrogate for
Julian
however it's through contact with Jen
who represents the
insuppressible feeling state of
femininity that he finally finds the
courage courage Lee's word from the word
cure meaning heart that he finally finds
the heart to admit his feelings for

[12:02]
the heart to admit his feelings for
Julian accept himself fully and redeem
the life that he himself believed he
would otherwise have wasted
in any case now the genie is out of the
bottle
Jen goes on her war path unwilling to
submit to any higher authority than
herself what does she do
she puts on men's clothing
takes up the phallic symbol of the
masculine and does whatever she wants
which to her means becoming a man
Jen gleefully humbles The Bullying
machismo of a whole mob of men fancing
herself an indestructible sword goddess
it's the Triumph of a woman who is no
longer holding back and who can beat men
at their own game
she destroys an entire building in the
process enjoying herself the entire time
this is the feminine wielding the power
of the masculine without submitting to
an ordering principle and this is why
when he confronts her by the waterfall

[13:01]
when he confronts her by the waterfall
Lee commands her to kneel as he
presumably did for his own Master but
this of course is precisely what she
cannot do she cannot do it because she
is indoctrinated by Jade Fox's
resentment because she considers
submission to the masculine to be the
death of her individual life and because
on a purely conceptual level Yin chaos
can't ever submit to order otherwise it
wouldn't be chaos
this is why order must always be imposed
on chaos that might be an uncomfortable
fact for some people but it is the truth
fortunately as I mentioned earlier
Jade's fate Jen's fate is still
undecided and the possibility remains
that she will choose to surrender her
willfulness to impose order on her own
chaos once she recognizes the true
nature of that chaos
unfortunately this generally only occurs
when we encounter the consequences of

[14:01]
when we encounter the consequences of
our actions and the whole movie
functionally consists of saving Jen from
the consequences of her actions let's do
a quick inventory shall we over the
course of the movie Jen tries to shoot
low with a bow knocks him unconscious
with a rock stabs him in the chest the
Tracer host trespasses in his private
rooms steals his property beats up
dozens of people destroys a restaurant
slices Julian with a sword spreads lies
about Lee mubai attempts to seduce him
and openly insults taunts and
disrespects people who are continually
going out of their way to help her what
a charmer so why does she experience
zero consequences
because one of the traditional attitudes
towards femininity is Indulgence in the
sense of leniency forbearance and
protection it's a privilege that
femininity enjoys as a consequence of
being traditionally deprived of power
and authority after all if women could

[15:00]
and authority after all if women could
not on a certain level control their own
actions it would be cruel and
unreasonable to hold them responsible
for the consequences of their actions
hence Indulgence as a uniquely feminine
privilege
the issue here is that Jen the feminine
principle has taken up masculine power
and authority has assumed her
self-determination and the rest of the
world doesn't know what to do with her
she has the sword should we treat her
like a man but she's not a man so should
we treat her like a woman
trust me this would have been a very
short movie had a man stolen the green
destiny that guy would have been cut
down by Limu by as the thief and traitor
he was in the first five minutes but no
one really knows what to do with a woman
who has abdicated the feminine and
assumed the masculine with a woman who
will not submit to any Authority Beyond
her own Caprice
and this is where we find ourselves
today
again we're discussing how things

[16:00]
again we're discussing how things
between men and women ended up the way
they have so let's recap first the
masculine abdicated his power and
authority next the feminine sees that
power because she was poisoned by the
Envy of an older generation who in turn
was corrupted by resentment over
patriarchal suppression
then the feminine is maintained in her
Rebellion by her unwillingness to submit
to any structure or authority outside of
herself and by a society that literally
doesn't know what to do with her and
treats her with an Indulgence which may
no longer be appropriate
on the one hand she can't really Advance
she cannot truly embody the masculine
and she will likely eventually be
consumed by the chaos and destruction
she has wrought and on the other hand
she cannot really Retreat she can't go
back to the feminine as her Defiance has
made returning to the way things were an
impossibility so we're at a kind of a
standstill

[17:00]
standstill
so what ultimately happens well Jen
finally experiences the consequences of
her actions when they lead to the death
of Lee mubai the masculine principle
only then does she appreciate that her
actions may have far-reaching permanent
and irreversible consequences both for
her and importantly other women
Jade Fox would have her believe that men
are women's natural enemies but the
defeat of the masculine is a source of
grief for the feminine Jen has after all
deprived shulienne of her love which
results in an implacable feeling of
guilt when she is reunited with her own
lover low
only then does Jen surrender her
willfulness and make a sacrifice of her
life
but then again maybe this is just a fun
movie about Kung Fu what do I know so
this was a long analysis with a lot of
interrelated parts so I hope you were
able to follow it I do hope that you
watch this movie for yourself if you
