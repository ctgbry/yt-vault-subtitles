mothers and fathers tend to do different
things in an ideal situation I think
ideally mothers more or less love their
children unconditionally when mothers
are good that's like that no matter what
you do you'll always be my baby and I
love you no matter what and I'm so proud
of you fathers on some level they
represent the larger world and they have
to look at the Children's Behavior a
little bit more critically I think
they're looking at it more objectively
which is like yeah your mom might love
that drawing but it actually is kind of
shitty and maybe you need to work on
your form which is probably true like
the little kid scribbling isn't going to
make it to the tape so I think you kind
of need both if you just have the
mother's unconditional love you can
almost become like so wrapped in this
I'm so great I can do no wrong and I'm
entitled to everyone's kind of approval
and love and if you only have the father
then you could be so focused on
achievement that you sacrifice
everything in the service of that like
you see that in some famous athletes
stories I think Tiger Woods had a very
problematic relationship with his father
for example
