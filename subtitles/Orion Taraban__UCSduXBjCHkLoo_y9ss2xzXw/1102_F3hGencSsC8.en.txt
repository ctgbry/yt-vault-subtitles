And you brought up the idea of marriage
as well. I know how you feel about
marriage personally, but do you think
marriage in the modern day is still
worth it? And for who does it make more
sense for and who does it make not so
much sense for?
&gt;&gt; Well, it makes in many cases a lot of
sense for women. I I mean marrying could
be the best thing that can happen to a

safe because if it didn't work out, I'm
going to be taken care of. It's like I
it's a win-win. It's a no- lose
situation for me. But because women tend
to mate and date up and not mate and
date down, the man often assumes
disproportionate amount of risk when
they enter into the marriage contract.
And I just don't think that that's uh in
a lot of men's best interest to
