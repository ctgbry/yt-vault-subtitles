i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
the sexual double standard
so basically the sexual double standard
is that it is acceptable or considered a
positive for a man to have multiple
sexual partners
but that is unacceptable or considered a
negative for a woman to have multiple
sexual partners
now i believe this is a real thing it is
a double standard and it does exist in
reality and i believe that a lot of this
double standard is culturally determined
but
not in the way that most people think
and i'm going to explain what i mean by
that
using the framework of behavioral
economics
it kind of goes like this
the outcome that can be accomplished
through no action
will always be valued less
than the outcome that can only be
achieved through the application of
skill and effort this is inherently true

[01:03]
skill and effort this is inherently true
people don't become better richer
stronger etc by doing nothing
they generate value through the
application of effort and skill
reasonable enough right
now
let's apply this principle to the topic
under consideration
if a man does nothing
he does not have sex
the average guy can sit alone at a bar
day after day
week after week month after month and he
will be approached by
no one
not complaining because there are pros
and cons to this just stating the fact
to my knowledge
no culture in human history has ever
celebrated
male virginity
and i think it's for this reason a man
can do nothing and remain a virgin
so it can't really be celebrated
for a man to acquire a sexual partner
which is to say for a man to be sexually

[02:02]
which is to say for a man to be sexually
selected by a woman
this requires more effort and skill than
we are generally than we generally would
like to admit both in the short-term
process of seduction and in the
long-term process of mate selection
now compare this with the experience of
a woman
how long would she be able to sit alone
at a bar undisturbed
now
i'm not saying that she'll be approached
by the person she would prefer to be
approached by
however i am saying that she will likely
be approached by someone sooner as
opposed to later
in fact some women are prepositioned
both in direct and indirect ways
many times a day
every day of their lives
surrendering to every man who would have
her doesn't require as much skill and
effort as say appropriately filtering
her options
and discerning the high value men who
might be the best investments of her

[03:00]
might be the best investments of her
inherently limited time and energy
and discernment is a skill that requires
some experience and let's say social
savviness
because it requires effort and skill not
to believe every tom dick and harry who
crosses her path with a proposition
value is created in a woman's reticence
so the situation is reversed for men
action is generally required to make
something happen
and for women inaction is needed to
prevent the squandering of her resources
and this is especially true for people
in their 20s when a lot of pairing
occurs and here's the kicker this isn't
actually inherent to men and women per
se
rather it's a reflection of the observed
distribution of perceived value and
optionality behavioral economics for
instance you'll find the same thing in
business
those with no money have to hustle to
get it
those with money have to find a way to
resist squandering it on everyone with a

[04:00]
resist squandering it on everyone with a
two-bit investment opportunity who comes
their way
so the sexual double standard is largely
cultural but not in the way that people
think it's not simply a superficial
attitude like a belief
that can be changed with education and
awareness
it's deeply embedded in the rules that
govern who approaches whom
who propositions whom
and who is valued for what and these
rules probably aren't changing anytime
soon
until the day arrives when it is it is
as easy for an average man to find a
willing sexual partner
as it is for a woman to find the same
the sexual double standard will exist
and it will exist because of behavioral
economics
the value added through effort and skill
a key that can open any lock is a good
key
but a lock that any key can open
is a bad lock
so those are my two cents

[05:01]
so those are my two cents
