I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why
successful men use escorts this is the
first part in a three-part series on
this subject so you'll need to be
patient to hear the whole story I'm
going to begin this talk by explicitly
stating this is not an endorsement for
prostitution personally I have never
hired an escort or a prostitute in my
life and to be honest when I was younger
I used to be very judgmental with
respect to the men who did in so many
words I thought such men must be losers
who for whatever reason couldn't
otherwise get access to women unless
they paid for it and while I'm sure
there are some unattractive or even some
revolting men who use prostitutes for
this reason I actually don't believe
they constitute the majority of an
escort's
clients in fact I've since radically
changed my opinion of these men

[01:00]
changed my opinion of these men
in part due to numerous conversations
I've had with men who have used escorts
and in part due to my own experiences in
the sexual Marketplace as I've become
more
successful though I can't say that I
endorse the use of escorts I can
certainly understand it and this talk is
specifically addressed to women to help
them comprehend the types of problems
unique to highly successful men who are
presumably the kind of men they would
most like to Target for a long-term
relationship by understanding how the
economics of dating change as a function
of success women can better position
themselves to secure the type of men
with whom they most want to meet and
date provided they like me can move past
the reflexive judgment they may carry
with respect to the topic under
consideration let's get to
it the fact of the matter is regardless
of whether you're a man or a woman the
higher your normalized sexual

[02:01]
higher your normalized sexual
Marketplace value the more traditional
dating becomes increasingly
expensive in fact the most attractive
women and the most successful men often
end up pricing themselves out of the
dating Market this is why for example
it's probably best for a woman to be
like an 8.5 if you're an 8.5 you're
definitely attractive enough to get
plenty of attention and prefer
treatment however because you're not
like a worldclass beauty you actually
avoid a lot of the downsides and
liabilities associated with being
fabulously attractive these are problems
that less attractive women don't even
know exist and never have to deal with
they might roll their eyes at this Suite
of problems and say oh poor baby can't
handle being beautiful I wish I had her
problems but frankly that's really an
Envy reaction the problems of really
beautiful women are real problems

[03:01]
beautiful women are real problems
they're not problems of survival but if
we're honest neither are the problems
that their haters are contending with
beautiful women receive little to no
sympathy for their difficulties not
because their difficulties aren't real
but because there are so few other
people who have experienced them the
same thing holds true for men The Sweet
Spot for being a man is probably earning
High six low seven figures a year that
is more than enough to provide a comfort
a and enjoyable lifestyle for yourself
and your family anything more than that
and Men start to deal with a suite of
problems that less successful men don't
even know exist and never have to deal
with and if anyone Garners more unearned
hatred than the beautiful it's the
wealthy people scoff at the champagne
problems of the rich but the problems of
really successful men are real problems
and these men experience even less
sympathy for their difficulties than
beautiful women do not because their

[04:01]
beautiful women do not because their
difficulties aren't real but because
there are so few other people who have
experienced
them now you might think that being a
highly successful man would be a
wonderful liability in the sexual
Marketplace and you would be correct
after all if a man has wealth and status
and fame he typically enjoys very good
optionality with women so why would a
man like this use escorts it isn't as
though there are a there is a dir of
women who would be interested in dating
him is it really true that all these men
are just immature narcissists who
Delight in the objectification of women
or might there be another explanation
for this not uncommon Behavior among
this particular
demographic but before I answer these

if you're interested in booking a paid
consultation the links to everything I
just talked about are in the description
below so check them out all right let's
get back to
it the reason why so many of these top
tier men use prostitutes is because it
becomes prohibitively expensive to date
traditionally once you cross a certain
point let's examine why this might be
the case one of my good friends is a
corporate lawyer and he bills his time
at $1,300 an hour now that may sound

[06:00]
at $1,300 an hour now that may sound
like a lot but it's kind of the going
rate for a partner at a top tier Law
Firm by the same token there are folks
in Myspace online who charge $2 to
$3,000 an hour for a consultation and
then you get into the rarified realm of
Bank presidents celebrities tycoons and
professional athletes who can easily
command tens of thousands of dollars or
more for an hour of their time however
to make this talk more accessible let's
just use the lawyer rate as the standard
of measurement so let's assume a man is
making 1,300 bucks an hour like my
friend in the traditional dating
pipeline what would be expected of him
well first he'd have to spend some time
making something happen maybe he has to
go out to a bar on a Saturday night and
RIS up a girl and this is hardly a sure
thing even at the local meat market so
he'll have to have the energy and the
emotional resilience to deal with the
rejection that inevitably stands between
him and an actual Prospect or or he'll

[07:00]
him and an actual Prospect or or he'll
have to spend time creating a dating
profile on an app that won't land him in
the invisible 90% functionally ignored
by all women and swiping on hundreds of
accounts in order to get some matches
either way once he succeeds in getting a
number he'll need to spend more time
playing the text game in order to help
the woman feel sufficiently safe and
sufficiently attracted which is not an
easy balance to strike to meet up for an
actual date of course he'll be expected
to plan the date which will almost
certainly occur at some neutral location
as opposed to his house several days or
even weeks out on the date he'll be
expected to cover all the expenses but
as we'll see this is the most
inexpensive part of dating for him the
meeting itself will probably last two
maybe three hours with potentially an
hour of commuting to and from the
location so he likely has to block off
an entire evening and busy successful
men may only get one evening off a week
if that and given all this time and

[08:00]
if that and given all this time and
effort and expense there is of course
absolutely no guarantee that the man
will even be attracted to the woman in
question let alone succeed in securing a
sexual encounter and irrespective of the
moral or ethics involved this is
frustrating because since men attempt to
exchange resources for sexual
opportunity in the sexual Marketplace
this is why he's
there so even if we ignore all the
monetary expenses associated with the
date itself which are potentially not
insignificant a 3-hour date bookended by
an hour of travel at $1,300 an hour is
$5,200 this means this guy is paying
five grand in terms of the cost to his
time to go on a date with you and this
does not include any of the time and
effort that went into securing the date
this may come as a shock but most women
do not just show up into a man's life

[09:00]
do not just show up into a man's life
with an intention to make his life
easier for most men it's a lot of
[ __ ] work to get sex and
relationships from women you hear a lot
about the emotional labor that women
perform for men but it's absolutely true
that men perform a great deal of
emotional labor for women it's just that
the man's labor typically has to do with
getting laid and securing and
maintaining the relationship to do this
men often have to be Charming or funny
or cool they have to stimulate your
emotions and arouse your attraction they
have to listen to you talk about your
day and care about the woman inside your
body and they have to do all this
without giving the slightest impression
that this isn't anyway work for them or
that they could possibly want to do
literally anything else with their time
and attention because if you get the
impression that they're just doing this
because it works and not because they
authentically want to do it you won't
[ __ ]

[10:01]
[ __ ]
them this is not easy to do even the
most successful casanovas strike out
more often than they get on Bas women
are extremely complex and most men do
not even begin to approach an
understanding of how you operate in any
case dating you requires a lot of time
energy money and emotional resilience
and if you're working 80 hours a week
you just might not have the bandwidth
for that dating just feels like another
job but a job that you pay to
work I understand that women have their
own frustrations with the dating process
but that's not why we're here today
we're looking at dating from the
perspective of successful men in these
episodes we'll get back to you later so
that's the end of part one what do you
think does this fit with your own
experience let me know in the comments
below as always I appreciate your
support and thank you for listening
