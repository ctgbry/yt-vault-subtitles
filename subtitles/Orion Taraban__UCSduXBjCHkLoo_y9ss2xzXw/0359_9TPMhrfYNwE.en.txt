I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
deal with gossip
so to start off this episode I need to
confess that I learned these tips like
many others on this channel the hard way
many years ago I was a member of a
community in which I became the target
of malicious gossip in the beginning it
was hard to know what was going on
something felt off but I couldn't put my
finger on what that might be and it
wasn't until several months went by that
one of my friends finally pulled me
aside and said hey Orion people are
saying XYZ about you and I thought you
should know
now this belief was not true and I
immediately understood who was spreading
it and why and in that moment other
inexplicable events over the past
several months finally made sense
that said as you may appreciate at the
moment I was angry to learn that this
was happening and hurt that other

[01:00]
was happening and hurt that other
members of my community might actually
believe this about me
especially because I prided myself on my
reputation both generally and within
this particular community
so I came up with a plan on how to
address the issue
now before I tell you what I did and
what the results of my efforts were
please remember to like this episode And
subscribe to this channel it takes less
than a second costs you nothing and it's
something positive you can do behind my
back so do the thing
all right so what did I do about the
gossip
I decided that I would approach members
of the community
sit down with them individually and
attempt to clear my name with evidence
and transparency my belief was that if I
dealt with people face to face and
brought the issue into the light of day
that we could get to the bottom of
things and they would see the truth of
the matter
I thought I could restore my good name

[02:00]
I thought I could restore my good name
in this way
and I ended up talking to a few dozen
people over the next several weeks about
this topic and I discovered some really
surprising things these are the three
tips about dealing with gossip that I
learned the hard way and that I hope to
impart to you today
the first is to accept that people don't
care about the truth
and this was the case on both sides both
the people who liked me didn't care
about the truth and the people who
didn't particularly like me didn't care
about the truth when I approached some
of my friends about this issue they
would generally stop me pretty early on
and say something like hey don't worry
about it Orion I knew that wasn't true
as soon as I heard it I believe you and
you've done nothing to prove to me and
this of course was reassuring however by
the same token the folks who didn't
particularly like me didn't care about
the truth either even when I was able to
prevent and present evidence that
completely refuted the gossip they would

[03:01]
completely refuted the gossip they would
say something like I don't know Ryan
yeah that's not what I heard and why
would somebody lie about something like
this
the fact is that both groups of people
had already decided how they felt about
me before the rumors were spread
All the gossip did was push people in
the direction they were already headed
it made my friends more friendly and my
enemies more antagonistic
and in this way the ordeal was actually
very useful for me because it helped me
to clarify who my friends really were
some people I thought were my friends
were actually in this second group they
would smile at me but they were wearing
a mask and seeing past this veneer was a
very painful experience but ultimately a
beneficial one
so that's the first thing it's a bitter
pill to swallow but it will help you
pass through that moment if you accept
that people don't care about the truth
and this is because there's this
knee-jerk reaction when you learn that
someone is spreading lies about you to

[04:01]
someone is spreading lies about you to
go out and like prove your innocence
and nobody cares nobody cares
the second tip which is another bitter
pill to swallow is to accept that your
reputation
is not in your control
true I can do things or not do things
that may influence how other people
think of me but my reputation ultimately
exists as an idea in other people's
minds and what people think of me in the
privacy of their own minds is ultimately
beyond my domain of control
on some level through this experience I
came to understand that other people's
opinion of me is actually none of my
business
and because it's none of my business and
because it's outside of my control I can
adopt an attitude of indifference toward
it and this cut both ways indifference
with respect to fame and popularity like
positive reputation and indifference

[05:00]
positive reputation and indifference
with respect to gossip and ignominy like
negative reputation
both are Phantoms without substance that
exist solely in the minds of other
people
and finally the third tip for dealing
with gossip is to understand that other
people have already moved on
it's hard to find yourself in the rumor
mill it's a painful place to be when
you're the target of malicious gossip
it's sometimes all you can think about
but that's not true of the people you're
concerned about most likely they haven't
even given it a second thought and
that's because you're actually just a
supported player in the story of their
own lives their minds are full of
themselves
and if other people have already moved
on
why not join them
so that's what I got for you today I
hope you found these tips useful do you
have any of your own if so let me know
