i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
beware of attraction proxies
now i've spoken to thousands of people
in my tenure as a clinical psychologist
and i'm consistently amazed by how many
people put faith in attraction proxies
which is generally not a good idea so
what is an attraction proxy an
attraction proxy is something that a
person uses to secure love or sex in an
indirect way
perhaps the most common example of this
is a man who is convinced that he will
be more successful with women if he has
more money
in this case he's using money as an
attraction proxy now it's certainly true
that broadly speaking having more money
is preferable to having less money and
that access to resources generally will
make men attractive to a broader swath
of women
however it is definitely not true that
simply having money

[01:00]
simply having money
makes men more successful with women
i've worked with men who have become
extremely wealthy and bought sports cars
and extravagant apartments and who have
become increasingly angry that these
strategies either a did little to
nothing to effortlessly attract women to
them
or b succeeded only in attracting women
who seem to care primarily about
material wealth i.e gold diggers and of
course material wealth was the bait he
was using so it's kind of inappropriate
for him to complain that he caught the
fish that was attracted to his bait
the point is that attraction proxies
don't reliably work
so stop using indirect approaches
six-pack abs or a seven-figure bank
account or a flashy wardrobe can be nice
but they will not reliably and
effortlessly attract women
those things will reliably do other
things but not that
the only way to reliably attract women
is to get good at attracting women

[02:01]
is to get good at attracting women
the only way to reliably attract men is
to get good at attracting men
learn the game of attraction and the art
of seduction
this is the direct approach
and this direct approach will not only
save you a great deal of time energy and
money but it will increase your overall
chances of getting what you want as well
