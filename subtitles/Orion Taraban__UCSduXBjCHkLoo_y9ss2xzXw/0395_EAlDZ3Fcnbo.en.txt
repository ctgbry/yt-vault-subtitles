I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
complaint of modern women
so this is something that I often hear
both from my female clients and also
from the women with whom I'm personally
acquainted it's kind of a general
complaint about the modern dating scene
and it has two elements on the one hand
women Lament The dearth of high value
men who are looking for committed
relationships and that is in fact a
problem
on the other hand women also complain
about the distasteful Prospect of
partnering with a lower status man
and on some level that might be the
inevitable reality for many women in
Western society as they collectively
become more successful relative to men
women's hypergamy motivates them to mate
and date men who are higher status than
them however as women increasingly have

[01:00]
them however as women increasingly have
better educational outcomes as they
begin to out earn men as they occupy
more positions of power and authority
they will naturally encounter a smaller
and smaller dating pool from which to
select appropriate men
the alternative is to resign themselves
to a relationship with a lower status
man
and what exactly might that look like
well if she has a job and he doesn't or
if she makes significantly more money
than he does that will likely mean that
she will pay for most if not all of the
material conditions of the relationship
and if she has more skills and
competence than he does that will likely
mean assuming responsibility and
Authority within the relationship and if
she is higher value than he is that will
likely mean that the transaction of
value and resources will generally flow
from her to him
and many women consider this scenario
and they think

[02:00]
and they think
what the [ __ ] am I getting out of this
situation
I provide the money and the lifestyle
and the responsibility what am I getting
for my time energy and money how does
this help me
I'd rather just be single or pay a
surrogate to have my baby
and hearing a woman talk like this warms
the cockles of my heart because once she
finishes venting her spleen I typically
hit her with a line that never fails to
make her jaw drop and that line is
welcome to being a man
because her complaint is precisely the
experience of men especially high value
men for hundreds if not thousands of
years
as the man you were expected to provide
them money and the lifestyle and the
authority and the responsibility the
transaction of value and resources has
in billions of instances flowed from him
to her and there has been little to no

[03:00]
to her and there has been little to no
sympathy for his complaint if he ever
had the temerity to voice it out loud
what the [ __ ] am I getting out of this
situation and to be honest given
traditional gender roles he likely got
more out of the situation a hundred
years ago than he does today
perhaps for the first time in history a
large sample of the female population is
in the position to occupy the role
historically occupied by men
and they don't particularly like the
idea
but that's how it is the higher status
you are the more likely you end up with
someone lower status than you it's just
simple math
now before I go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this video to someone
who might benefit from its message it's
Word of Mouth referrals like this that

can also hit the super thanks button and
tip me in proportion to the value you
feel you derive from this video I
appreciate your support

[04:00]
appreciate your support
now women
I can understand you want to mate and
date with men who are taller stronger
smarter richer higher status more
responsible and more competent however
if I'm that guy if you have to
understand that my reward for giving you
what you want is that I end up with a
woman who is shorter weaker Dumber
poorer lower status less responsible and
less competent
not a very attractive Prospect when it's
put that way is it and that's precisely
why you bulk at settling down with a
lower status man being the boss isn't
always what it's cracked up to be
and when a woman tells me well Orion I'd
rather just not date at all than settle
for a man who isn't really giving me
what I want I don't get angry
all the power to you sister I like that
perspective in fact I adopt it myself
indeed more and more men are struggling

[05:02]
indeed more and more men are struggling
with this very issue this is the real
meaning of the oft repeated phrase the
juice isn't worth the squeeze being the
higher status person in a relationship
is very expensive while women
traditionally have been trying to secure
the best deal
men have resigned themselves to
minimizing loss
just keeping it real
now when a woman arrives at success
she is well aware of all the struggle
and effort and toil she put in to arrive
at that place her status and resources
are not something that she is going to
hand over lightly well the same is true
for a man he is well aware of the
struggle and the effort and the toil
that went into his success however there
has been a social and historical
expectation that men hand that over to
be the provider protector and part with
their hard-earned status and resources
and I'm not sure women have ever seen

[06:02]
and I'm not sure women have ever seen
that to be a problem
however now that women increasingly find
themselves in a situation where the
roles might be reversed the overwhelming
responses I prefer not to
well no [ __ ]
and what does this Behavior say about
how women perceive relationships I'd
like to submit that they perceive
relationships
clearly
their behavior aligns with my own
definition of a relationship as the
medium of transacted value between
people
if you're not getting what you want in a
relationship if the relationship isn't
making your life better than it was then
absolutely why are you in that
relationship
and potentially for the first time in
history a large sample of the male
population is allowing themselves to ask
this question
what a time to be alive
so what's the upshot My Hope Is that

[07:02]
so what's the upshot My Hope Is that
women might use this as an opportunity
for some perspective taking this could
look something like well if I don't want
to enter into a relationship where the
flow of value and resources is from me
to my partner
why would a man be enthusiastic about
doing that for me
especially in today's day and age
how are we going to move forward
because my own behavior reveals that I
don't believe that this is the
appropriate basis of a relationship
