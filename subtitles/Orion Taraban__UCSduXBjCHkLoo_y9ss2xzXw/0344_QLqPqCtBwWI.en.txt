I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the Trap
of a good enough life
one of psychotherapy's Dirty Secrets is
that the variable that is most reliably
predictive
of patient Improvement
is patient misery
this means that the more unhappy
dysfunctional or miserable people are
when they show up for therapy the more
likely they will benefit from therapy
and this kind of makes sense well life
can always get worse it's more likely
that life will get better
if life is particularly difficult
already this is called regression
towards the mean over time circumstances
that are bad tend to improve kinda on
the balance of things
and this means that if you're going
through a tough time the risk reward
profile is in your favor the worse your
life is the more likely a change will
increase the quality of your life which

[01:01]
increase the quality of your life which
means low risk High reward the issue is
that this works in the other direction
as well
now before I explain the Crux of this
problem please like this episode And
subscribe to the channel
it takes less than a second costs you
nothing and has a very favorable risk
reward profile so do the thing
now what's the issue here the issue is
that the better your life is the more
likely a change will decrease the
quality of your life and at the very
highest levels of performance people
strive to keep things as solid and
consistent as possible
this is because the better your life is
the more unfavorable the risk reward
profile associated with change becomes
which means high risk low reward
now at any given moment most people
aren't in a really bad spot
and even fewer are in a really good spot
in fact most people are living a good

[02:02]
in fact most people are living a good
enough life
if we were to give the lives of most
people a grade like in school they're
living a kind of B minus life
they look around and they say okay it
could be better but it could definitely
be worse
and because they're living a good enough
life and because of the principle of
regression towards the mean
contemplating A Change Is risky
I mean there are more grades below a B
minus than there are above a B minus so
all things being equal A change is more
likely to make the situation worse
that said there are very few people who
are going to feel proud and fulfilled
with a B minus life
and living a B minus life can be
associated with neurotic symptoms of
anxiety depression and quiet desperation
so not taking a risk is also a risk
on some Level A B minus life is actually

[03:00]
on some Level A B minus life is actually
more dangerous than a d plus life
because as we've seen misery is actually
highly unstable and very motivating
people in acute pain are much more
likely to take action to change their
situation and changing their situation
is more likely to result in an
improvement because of regression
towards the mean on the other hand a B
minus life is pre-stable
and does not motivate action as change
in this situation is more likely to
result in a depreciation
the D plus life is looking to secure
gain
the B minus life is looking to prevent
loss
as a result the B minus life traps
people in action with the fear that
things could be worse which is certainly
true but it's also true that inaction
won't allow things to get better
a B minus life is like standing on 16 in

[04:01]
a B minus life is like standing on 16 in
blackjack
if you hit there's a high chance you're
going to bust if you stand there's a
high chance that you'll be beaten by the
house it's not a great position to be in
the objective here is to live a life
that you can look back on without regret
and you cannot live a B minus life and
Achieve that objective
such a life is exemplary
achieving that objective requires a
response to life that is risky
adventurous and unconventional
however nothing ventured nothing gained
beware the good enough life
