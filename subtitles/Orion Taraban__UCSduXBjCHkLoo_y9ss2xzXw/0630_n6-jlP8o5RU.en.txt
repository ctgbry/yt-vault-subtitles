the vast majority of issues do not need
to be resolved right then and there this
perception of pressured necessity tends
to force discussion which generally
leads to suboptimal results if you're
emotionally activated then anything you
say or do will be colored with that
emotion which could very well create
more problems than it solves especially
when it comes to anger so if you can
resist the urge to force the issue right
then and there if you can resist the
impulse to engage in unproductive back
and forth then you will be in a much
better position if and when the
individual in question comes back for a
discussion and in my experience most
people do come back after they've calmed
down especially if you chose not to
engage them in kind this is because your
unwillingness to enter into their
emotional world will cause their
behavior to exist in stark contrast to
yours they very clearly will have
stepped over a line because you didn't
step over it with them
