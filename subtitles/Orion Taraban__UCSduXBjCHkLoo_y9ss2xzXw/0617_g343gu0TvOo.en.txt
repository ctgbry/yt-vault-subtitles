I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych
haacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to drop a handkerchief so this is an
episode for the ladies I've been doing a
lot of consultations with women these
days and the subject of these
consultations is always the same every
single woman I've talked to wants to
know how they can find a man to get
married a lot of women's day are
despairing of the possibility of getting
married because men don't seem to
approach them and they're not happy with
their Pro ects on dating apps well
ladies I'm here to help it turns out
that you women have way more control
over this process than you might think
and today I'm going to advise you on how
to make good use of your power to begin
with you need to appreciate that for
hundreds of years women were generally
the ones who initiated the courtship
process not men apparently a lot of you
women have forgotten this fact

[01:00]
women have forgotten this fact
however unlike men who tend to initiate
contact with women directly women
initiated contact with men indirectly
using methods involving plausible
deniability the title of this episode
how to drop a handkerchief alludes to
the stereotypical way that women used to
do this in Victorian England when a
woman walked past a man to whom she was
attracted she would accidentally drop
her handkerchief in front of him this
would motivate him to pick it up up and
run after her and boom she would now be
in a conversation with an attractive man
with plausible
deniability now women today don't carry
around handkerchiefs anymore so it would
probably be weird if you tried something
like this today but there are modern day
equivalence of dropping a handkerchief
the reason why it's important for women
to drop a handkerchief is that it
provides men with a pretext for
interaction it's actually fairly risky
and intimidating for most men to

[02:01]
and intimidating for most men to
approach women at the very least it
violates a tacit social rule which is
the right to be left alone men need to
have the confidence to transgress that
social Norm to initiate an interaction
and why would they do that without any
sign that the woman in question would be
open to a conversation that's nothing
but a parent risk with no hope of reward
do you understand what I talk to women
about this I always ask well why don't
you approach men and ask them out and
they invariably say well I'm nervous
well what are you nervous about I guess
I'm nervous about being rejected it's
like you don't [ __ ] say the same is
true for men men are also afraid of
being rejected and frankly the risks
associated with men approaching women
these days are much higher than the
risks associated with women approaching

[03:00]
risks associated with women approaching
in men and yet you women still don't do
it do you so if you're not going to
approach men then at least make it
easier for the men you like to approach
you the more signs you give a man that
you are open to a conversation the more
signals you give him that you would say
yes if he asked you out the more likely
he is going to approach you this is
because these signs will significantly
impact his risk reward assessment of
transgressing that social norm and guess
what you're in control of these signs
you can give them or not to the men you
happen to meet as you move through life
and the best part is that it costs you
nothing to send these signals except
potentially the time and effort needed
to learn how to transmit them
effectively by far the easiest way to
drop a handkerchief is through eye
contact

[04:00]
contact
women if you haven't done so already you
need to master eye contact back in the
day they used to call this the come
Heather stare which is the look that you
give a man to communicate that you want
him to approach you the come Heather
stair works because eye contact is very
intimate some of you ladies might not
know this but if I were to sit at a bar
and look directly into the eyes of a man
I did not know for 3 seconds just 3
seconds of unbroken direct eye
contact we might have a fight on our
hands making that kind of eye contact
with a man you don't know is aggressive
why because eye contact is intimate I
could be on the other side of the bar
but with that kind of eye contact I'm
going to feel so inappropriately close
to him that he's going to want to assert
a boundary what's going on buddy do we
have a problem here

[05:00]
have a problem here
this is because most men don't want to
be that intimate with another man and so
they will take action to push back on
the familiarity that it entails That's
The Power of eye contact now before I go

a paid consultation link is in the
description okay let's get back to it
all right so I'm going to teach you
women how to utilize this power if you
do it right you can get a man to
approach you just using your eyes so
this is how it goes once you identify a
guy that you think is attractive and who
you want to approach you what you need
to do first is kind of like catch each

[06:02]
to do first is kind of like catch each
other's eye this is important because if
you go straight to direct eye contact
out of the blue it's going to feel
pretty overwhelming so you need to catch
him looking at you first this is
equivalent to like waving to someone
across the room it communicates that I
see you and you see me and I see you
seeing me and you see me seeing you so
we now know that we exist in this space
in relation to each other very important
to establish this groundw work first
next you need to make direct eye contact
you're going to want to look directly
into his eyes not in his general
direction not in his nose not in the
corners of his eyes but directly into
the blacks of his pupils for three
seconds once you do this you'll turn
away with your whole head and then
glance back with just your eyes for one
second with a slight smile on your face

[07:01]
second with a slight smile on your face
after this don't ever look at him again
that's all you have to do it costs you Z
and takes 10 seconds three
seconds that's
it okay this is the clearest sign that
you can send a man that you are open to
a conversation he probably won't get up
and just stride across the room right
away however ever if he is at all
attracted to you he will move in your
general direction and initiate a
conversation and if he's not attracted
to you he won't but don't sweat it you
didn't actually get rejected because you
didn't actually ask for anything that's
one of the best things about being a
woman you can get away with asking for
everything indirectly so you never have
to get rejected if you don't want to so
use that to your advantage finally if
the guy ends up coming over and you
change your mind about him you can just
apologize and tell him that you must
have mistaken him for someone else
plausible

[08:01]
plausible
deniability by using eye contact
appropriately you can communicate to the
men you want that you are not risky
since you won't enforce the social Norm
that he would need to transgress in
order to approach you women if you
master this look and I have no doubt
that you can do it better than I can you
can control not only who interacts with
you but where and when they interact
with you as well a woman who understands
this power is like a beautiful flower
she is rooted in place and the whole
world comes to her but in order to do
this she has to give off an alluring
scent which effectively calls the bees
and the butterfli and all the other
pollinators to without this scent it
doesn't work as well but by selectively
releasing this scent flowers can
effectively travel the world without
moving an inch women you do not need to
be be passive and if you're over 30 you

[09:01]
be be passive and if you're over 30 you
cannot be passive stop waiting for guys
to do everything if you want to make
something happen then you have to learn
to drop your handkerchief if you think
about it it's really the minimum
necessary effort required to get what
you want what do you think does this fit
