So, I recently published an episode
called The Plow Horse, in which I argued
that the ultimate purpose of marriage
was to harness a man's productive labor
to the benefit of a particular woman. I
compared the life of a single man to a
wild mustang and that of a married man
to a beast of burden. If I'm correct and
this is the true end goal of marriage
and not as some believe some deviant
aberration, then we are presented with
an obvious question, namely, why do so
many mustangs willingly leave the open
range for a life in the stables? The
answer is simple but
unflattering. Not everyone is built for
the open range. Just like some horses
are better suited for the yolk than for
the wild, some men are absolutely better
suited for marriage than for a life of
freedom. These men are happy in
marriage. They want nothing more in life
than to wake up, go to work, and come
straight home to their wife and kids.
Odd infinitum. This is the structure of
their lives. And narrow and confining as

their lives. And narrow and confining as
it might seem to others, it is
preferable to a lack of structure
altogether, which is what these men
would face in the absence of their
marriages. This is actually
representative of a much deeper and
universal human problem.
