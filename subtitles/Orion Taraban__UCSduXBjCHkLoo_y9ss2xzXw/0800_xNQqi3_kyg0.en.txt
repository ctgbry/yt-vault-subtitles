I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is men don't
want a challenge at least when it comes
to their relationships with women so
I've been doing more and more
consultations with women almost all of
whom are interested in securing
long-term romantic Partnerships and it
has come to my attention through these
consultations that many women Harbor a
lot of incorrect ideas about men both
what they want and what they respond to
to make matters worse many of these
incorrect ideas are widely espoused by
popular culture this leads to the
unfortunate outcome in which women tend
not to get what they want despite doing
what they're supposed to today I'm going
to talk about one of these ideas in an
attempt to undo some of this damage in
my own little way an idea that needs to
be expunged from the female

[01:00]
be expunged from the female
Consciousness is that men want a
challenge this is not correct the idea
here is that if a woman is too easy that
is if she gives the man what he wants
without playing games with her interest
and her availability and her sexual
desire if she doesn't withhold her
affection and respect until the guy has
jumped through a number of Hoops then
that man is going to take her for
granted and exploit her as a sexual
opportunity and otherwise not not
consider her to be a viable long-term
partner now like most ideas that have
permeated the general Consciousness
there is some truth to this however so
we don't get confused I'm going to ask
you the listener to create two different
compartments in your mind a Chase and a
challenge okay a Chase is not
necessarily a challenge and a challenge
is not necessarily a Chase men don't
want a challenge but they do want a

[02:00]
want a challenge but they do want a
Chase and it's women's conflation of
these two ideas that sometimes leads to
their lack of success in any case I'll
speak to the idea of a chase a bit later
in the
episode for now it's extremely it's
extremely important for women to
understand that most men's lives are
[ __ ] challenging enough
already I'll say that again most men's
lives are [ __ ] challenging enough
already in fact they are more
challenging than most women could hope
to understand though it might be more
accurate to say that they are more
challenging than they would care to
understand there's even a fairly
well-known corroboration of both of
these facts Nora Vincent was a lesbian
feminist who was convicted as many women
are that being a man with all of our

[03:00]
are that being a man with all of our
male privileges was sort of like living
life on easy mode so she decided to cut
her hair and pass as a man for 18 months
as a kind of social experiment she ended
this time by checking herself into a
mental institution by her own admission
she had absolutely no idea how difficult
it was to be a man and she was
particularly surprised and disheartened
by how badly women treated men in the
sexual Marketplace she concludes her
book self-made man with the following
quote men are suffering they have
different problems than women have but
they don't have it better they need our
sympathy they need our love and they
need each other more than anything else
they need to be together so good on
Norah for being willing and able to
correct her understanding in light of
new
information so I'm just going to go
ahead and say it for a third time just
in case it didn't get through most men's
lives are [ __ ] chall alling enough

[04:01]
lives are [ __ ] chall alling enough
the last thing a man needs is to come
home to another [ __ ] challenge life
challenges men every single day no one
gives a man an inch people literally
step over men on the sidewalk no one
gives a [ __ ] about their suffering and
their struggles particularly with women
are always somehow framed as their fault
sure she might have been having anair
fair and she took half his wealth but
you know if he really cared about her he
wouldn't have been working so much etc
etc if you're interested in taking your
understanding to the next level I would

hope to see you
aboard so this is not the way ladies but
I want to be honest with you this is not
the way not because these things can't
work unfortunately these things can work
at least for a while they work on a
depressing number of men this is not the
way because behaving in this way is
ultimately unsustainable and
self-defeating playing games like hard
to get hot and cold and picking fights
can capture men's attention the issue
here is that when they do work you lose
when you win because what you win is a
relationship that's perpetually
predicated on you creating unnecessary
drama and difficulty in order to
maintain the attraction of a particular
man who whose complimentary wound or

[06:01]
man who whose complimentary wound or
social programming resonates with that
kind of
treatment for instance daming is a
tactic that works on a number of men
especially those of the Romantic
persuasion because it gives those men
the opportunity to feel useful and
heroic however that feeling disappears
as soon as the woman is no longer in
distress which could very well be why
this wounded or soft-headed man was in
the relationship to begin with that
means if she wants to retain his
attention a woman would need to keep
that feeling more or less perpetually
active probably by putting herself in
arbitrary and unnecessary difficulties
financial difficulties physical
difficulties emotional difficulties
interpersonal difficulties to provide
him a pretext to swoop in on his White
Horse and frankly that's a recipe for a

[07:00]
Horse and frankly that's a recipe for a
pretty [ __ ] up relationship it's bad
for the woman who kind of needs to be
distressed in order to maintain the
man's attraction which is predicated on
the self-experience of his own
usefulness and it's bad for the man who
has to spend unold resources putting out
unnecessary fires furthermore this
particular game only tends to work on
men who don't already feel somewhat
strong courageous or heroic and these
typically are not the type of men that
most women want to be in a long-term
relationship with a more secure or
competent man would have given a woman
who played this type of game a hard pass
a long time
ago as I've said repeatedly no man wants
a challenge from a woman because his
life is challenging enough already
however men do want a
Chase healthy men are at least part L

wild animal and some wild animals are
notoriously difficult to keep in zoos
which let's be honest are functionally
cages some cages are larger than others
but a cage is still a cage at the end of
the day wild predatory animals are
deeply unconsciously programmed to hunt
for their food that's why when the
zookeepers put out meat in a
basket these animals don't even
recognize it as food food is not a steak
it's a gasping gazelle that is slowly
bleeding out this can make people
uncomfortable particularly if they
identify with the gazelle but that
doesn't change what's good for the lion
it is what it is and if that's true of
the apex predator on the Savannah it
remains true for the apex predator on
the planet namely the human male we
don't like to talk about it because it

[09:01]
don't like to talk about it because it
can make some women uncomfortable but
men want they may even need the chase
despite many men's complaints about how
difficult it can be to get sex from a
woman if it were delivered up to them on
a silver platter they wouldn't know what
to do with it it would be like stakes in
a basket many would become uncomfortable
and disinterested some might not even be
able to get aroused it's that
important now that said there's a big
space between handing it over on a
silver platter and playing a lot of
unnecessary and complicated games right
so let's not just fall into this
dichotomous
thinking women I'd like you to consider
that the chase is like male foreplay
women aren't the only ones who need
foreplay men need it too it's just a
different kind of foreplay than the kind
that women need and like good foreplay
it's designed to make the other person
feel receptive and excited as it works

[10:03]
feel receptive and excited as it works
toward a foregone
conclusion that's the fundamental
difference between a Chase and a
challenge in a challenge the outcome is
uncertain whereas we both kind of know
how this Chase is going to end and both
parties are enacting it for the pleasure
of the other which is mutual and
complimentary the joy of conquering and
the joy of being conquered Aeros and
Agape a good Chase is like a dance in
which it is a pleasure to lead and a
pleasure to follow a challenge on the
other hand is a kind of
Confrontation aggressive competitive and
hostile it should go without saying but
these are not qualities that anyone
should go out of their way to inculcate
in their Intimate
Relationships something to
