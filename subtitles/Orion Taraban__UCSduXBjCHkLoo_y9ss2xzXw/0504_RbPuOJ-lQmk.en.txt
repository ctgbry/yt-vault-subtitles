now the second piece of wisdom pertains
to how the snail is going to go about
his task oh snail climb Mount Fuji but
slowly of course the snail is going to
climb Mount Fuji slowly it's a snail so
the second piece of wisdom contained in
this poem is that you have to do things
in the way that you can do them the poem
doesn't say oh snail soar to the top of
Mount Fuji or swim to the top of Mount
Fuji or leap to the top of Mount Fuji it
says to CL slowly because of whom it's
addressing a snail so the first two
things are kind of in jux opposition to
each other the idea is to dream big to
Aspire beyond your capacities but to
achieve that dream within your
capacities the goal is beyond you but
the means are within you the poem is an
acknowledging that the only way for a
snail to climb Mount Fuji is slowly by
analogy the only way that you can
achieve your dreams is in a manner
amenable to your nature
