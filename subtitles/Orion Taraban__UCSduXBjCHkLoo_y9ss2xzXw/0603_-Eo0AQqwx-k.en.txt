I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is women
over 30 so I wanted to make this episode
because I've done a few consultations
with women over 30 recently and I found
them all to be inappropriately
pessimistic about their chances of
finding a husband which is what they
were all interested in doing they all
thought that purely because of their age
they were functionally screwed in
today's dating market and though this
might not J with some of my male
audience that's not really true as I
discussed in my episode the way it all
ends in which I reviewed the various
outcome scenarios for women in
relationships most women turn out okay
that is most women end up in a decent
relationship they may not end up in the
relationship with the man they would
prefer but most of them are not going to
die alone neglected and forgotten that's
a much more likely scenario for men so
most women end up in a workable
situation and they're much less likely

[01:01]
situation and they're much less likely
to fall through the cracks than men are
and any man who is disappointed to hear
this is probably suffering from some
measure of unhealed wounding that
eagerly awaits a woman's comeuppance
irrespective of how Justified that
comeuppance might be this anticipatory
shoden Freud creates a bitterness that
you have to deal with so I would
encourage you to find a way to resolve
it for your own piece of heart in any
case these women were in my opinion
inappro
pessimistic about their prospects and
when I would tell them this they would
sometimes cite things that I said in my
episodes like but Orion you said that
the game changes at 30 because after 30
the average man's sexual Marketplace
value is higher than the average woman's
sexual Marketplace value so if I don't
have a husband by 30 I'm never going to
find one and well it is true that the
game changes at 30 and well it is true
that most women are going to be
operating under a relative disadv vage

[02:00]
operating under a relative disadv vage
from that point forward this does not
mean that women can't get married after
30 people can still get what they want
even when they are subject to a
disadvantage and the proof of that is
that most men are at a disadvantage
throughout their entire 20s that's a
Whole Decade of disadvantage for men in
the sexual Marketplace and yet every day
men in that age cohort finds ways to get
laid get into relationships and get
married despite their disadvantage the
point is that having a disadvantage
doesn't mean that you can't win it is of
course far easier to win while you still
have an advantage but you're not doomed
without it what it does mean however is
that you can't expect to win at a
disadvantage without making an
effort as I say the game changes at 30

[03:01]
effort as I say the game changes at 30
this means that in order to get what
they want women have to change their
strategy in their 30s and just like a
team that is down a few points with the
clock running out women typically have
to adopt a more aggressive approach to
get what they want think about it how do
men in their 20s get what they want
despite their relative disadvantage they
[ __ ] make an effort ladies they
hustle they have to work to make it
happen were you just handing out sex and
relationships to every man who wanted
those things from you in your 20s I
doubt it and who got those things from
you the men who went after them in the
right way the same is true for you men
are not going to be handing out marriage
and relationships to every woman who
wants these things in their 30s
especially because a lot of these guys
put up with a lot of your [ __ ] in
their 20s the women in their 30s who get
the things that they want are the ones

[04:01]
the things that they want are the ones
who go after them in the right way women
in their 20s can kind of get away with
just
waiting and they can get away with this
strategy not because they are inherently
some priz or precious Jewel but because
they occupy a privileged position in the
sexual Marketplace it is an attribute of
the position not the gender the problem
with women in their 30s is that they
haven't yet changed their strategy you
can't wait you can wait you can wait if
you're in the advantaged position
however if you wait in the disadvantaged
position you are [ __ ] you're [ __ ]
like this does not work women can still
win in their 30s but they have to make
an effort and just like the successful
men in their 20s they have to make an
effort to engage the attention of the
opposite sex by learning the suite of
skills that work on their target

[05:02]
skills that work on their target
audience men who have optionality with
women are not just lucky they typically
worked very hard to enjoy that
optionality they experiment and grind
and study and transform it's a lot of
effort now before I go any further if

telling you all this ladies because you
don't usually see men's effort you just
see the outcome an interesting smooth
Charming charismatic and confident man
is genely the result of a good deal of

[06:00]
is genely the result of a good deal of
work you too can be the sweet sexy
supportive endearing and feminine women
that has optionality with men but it's
going to take a lot of work most likely
you will need to make an effort and
expecting that a man should love you or
wife you up despite the absence of these
qualities is equivalent to a man
expecting that a woman should just [ __ ]
him even if he is awkward anxious boring
rude and creepy it does not work just
like men generally have to transform
themselves to be attractive to women
women generally have to transform
themselves to be attractive to men and
just like men generally need game to get
laid women generally need game to get
married do you understand now your age
is going to give you a rough estimate of
how hard you're going to have to work
ladies it's not perfect but for ease of
understanding let's imagine a 20-year

[07:01]
understanding let's imagine a 20-year
period from 20 to 40 with 30 at the
midpoint so if you're a 32y old woman
you might have to bust your ass a little
to make things happen at this point the
switching Advantage is still fairly
recent and the Gap is still fairly small
many of you won't even have noticed a
change at this point however if you're a
38-year old woman you might have to bust
your ass a lot to make something happen
this is because there's a kind of
symmetry to the whole arrangement a
38-year-old woman is kind of equivalent
to a 22-year-old man and a 22y old man
gets [ __ ] all for being a 22y old man do
you hear me he has to go out there and
bust his ass every day to make something
happen otherwise too bad so sad the
world passes him
by now in today's digital economy there
are some 22-year-old men who are
absolutely killing it they are making
seven figures a year and have already

[08:00]
seven figures a year and have already
built interesting and emotionally
compelling Lifestyles but they are the
exceptions most men are struggling if
not functionally invisible in the sexual
Marketplace at this point in their lives
by the same token there are some
38-year-old women who are still slaying
it out there they're getting serious
offers from all kinds of successful men
and they have the support and the
resources to start a family later in
life but they are the exceptions most
women are struggling though not quite as
invisible in the sexual Marketplace at
this point in their lives this is why
the default mode for women is to act
while they still have the advantage and
the default mode for men is to wait
until they have the advantage why
because it's easier to get more of what
you want when you occupy a privileged
position so if waiting is no longer a
viable strategy for women in their 30s

[09:01]
viable strategy for women in their 30s
what should they do ladies you have to
remember that for many centuries women
were actually the ones who initiated the
courtship process they just did so in an
indirect manner that retained plausible
deniability to protect their honor in
Victorian England for example the
stereotypical way a woman used to do
this was to accidentally drop her
handkerchief in front of the man she was
interested in initiating a conversation
with this gave the man a [ __ ] reason
to talk to her
regardless of how attractive a woman is
few men are going to stop a woman out of
the blue and pick her up unless she
gives him an invitation to do so so a
woman would provide him with that
invitation by dropping her handkerchief
that way he could pick it up and go oh
Excuse Me Miss I believe you dropped
this and she could Giggle and say oh my
how terribly clumsy of me I'm ever so
grateful and boom she is now in a
conversation and the great part of all

[10:00]
conversation and the great part of all
of this was if the guy turned out to be
adult she could just say well thank you
so much for the handkerchief but I
really must be going I'm already late
for tea with great aunt Melba and go on
her Merry way because she had plausible
deniability women you need to find the
modern day equivalent of dropping your
handkerchief like that's the bare
[ __ ] minimum amount of effort needed
to make something happen and if you're
not willing to do even
that you're going to have a tough time
out there change change your strategy
you can still win despite your
disadvantage but you need to make an
effort and I know that this is true
because men do this all the time what do
you think does this fit with your own
experience let me know in the comments
below as usual I appreciate your support
and thank you for your understanding and
