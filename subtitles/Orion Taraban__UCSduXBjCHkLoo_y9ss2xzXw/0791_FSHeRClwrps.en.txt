here we are in the new year and many of
you will be motivated to make some
changes in your lives this could be
starting a new good habit or stopping an
old bad habit though as I've said before
you'll get more bang for your disciplin
buck by stopping that bad habit than
starting that good one in any case today
I'm going to be speaking on where the
battle for this behavioral change is so
often won or lost and how best to emerge
Victorious now in my personal and
professional experience a lot of the
issues that people run into with respect
to behavioral change take place in this
10c window of time before they decide to
do or not do something the outcome of
this 10-second battle often determines
what people will do for the next hour or
so and what people do for the next hour
or so can either solidify a behavior
into a habit just a little bit more or
undermine good progress made up until
that point both virtues and vices are
habits
