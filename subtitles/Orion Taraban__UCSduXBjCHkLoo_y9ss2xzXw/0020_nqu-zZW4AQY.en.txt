i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax
better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
how over
what what does this mean so a little
while back i posted a video that was
called everyone is
completely unique and totally
replaceable and that's
the paradox of human interpersonal
relationships
but let's dive a little bit deeper into
this idea what
aspect of our relationships is the
unique part and what aspect of our
relationships is the replaceable part
and i think it breaks down pretty cl
evenly
cleanly along the concepts of how versus
what
so in our relationships there's always a
what
component like what's the function that
we perform
within this role in the relationship
professionally it could be i'm here to
oversee this team of 10 people
i compile according to reports i perform
the financial analysis
et cetera you know romantic
relationships it could be i provide
emotional support
i provide sexual intimacy i provide

[01:01]
i provide sexual intimacy i provide
instrumental support and counsel
etc the thing is is that the
what that we bring to a relationship is
actually the replaceable aspect of that
relationship
do you think you're the only person to
compile a quarterly report
no way there are millions of people who
could probably do that
you think you're the only person to
provide sex and intimacy get out of here
there's
literally billions of people that could
perform that role
so we need to not ignore the what
because that's basically how we earn the
privilege of remaining
in that role in that relationship by
discharging the what the function
of that role but if we if we prioritize
that
and neglect the other components we
leave ourselves vulnerable
to being more easily replaced when it
becomes convenient or expedient for
someone else to do so so what's the
unique aspect the unique aspect is the
how
yeah you might compile quarterly reports

[02:01]
yeah you might compile quarterly reports
but if you bring your own
unique perspective or insight or flare
or
elocution to that report that's
something that they're not going to be
able to find anywhere else
yes you can have sex and intimacy with
lots of other people
but what's the quality the emotional
quality of that experience
that might be something that is very
unique and
special to that dynamic of people
so if you want to maintain a
relationship
not only do you have to discharge the
the what
but you have to prioritize increasingly
the how
um what is your attitudes your
values your perspectives your insights
your vibe for lack of a better word that
you're bringing to a relationship
because the more that they
you give people the opportunity to feel
that and to experience that
the more likely they're going to
associate you with something
um that especially if they if they
resonate with it with something that
they need to keep in their lives

[03:02]
they need to keep in their lives
and they're going to focus more and more
on on that vibe as opposed to the
functions
that you are um let's say discharging as
a matter of course
so that's my thoughts on the matter
