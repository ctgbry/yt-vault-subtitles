i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is how to
get what you want in life and can you
believe it i'm going to give you the
secret in three minutes or less are you
ready
there are three things you need to do in
order to consistently and reliably get
what you want in life here we go
number one is you need to know what you
want
if one does not know to which port one
is sailing no wind is favorable if you
don't know what you want how can you
move in a direction to obtain it so the
first step is to clarify in as much
detail as possible exactly what you're
aiming for you want a house great how
many bedrooms what's the price point
where's the neighborhood does it have a
backyard what does it look like who are
your neighbors how good is the school
district
you want a girlfriend great what does
she look like what are her values is she
introverted or extroverted how does she
feel about children what does she do
with her spare time with whom does she
associate what is her relationship like
with her family

with her family
try to really nail down what you're
looking for
until you do it's kind of functionally
impossible to proceed
now
once you know what you want you gotta
move into step two
you need to be willing to wait
patiently
a lot of people they might know what
they want but because they're impatient
they end up foreclosing which
means making a premature sub-optimal
decision basically they settle
they know what they want but they're
tired of waiting for it so they
foreclose to escape their own impatience
if you want good things you have to be
willing to wait for the right
opportunity the tides are not always
favorable to set sail
now
let's say that you know what you want
and that you're willing to wait for it
now you're ready for step three
you need to act without hesitation or
apology
once you encounter an opportunity that
seems to satisfy the majority of the

[02:01]
seems to satisfy the majority of the
criteria associated with what you want
you need to pounce
you need to act without any doubt or
ambivalence to move forward with
confidence and certainty and you should
have those things because you've already
very clearly defined what you want and
you've likely already waited quite some
time before encountering this
opportunity so
if you know what you want
you're willing to wait patiently
and you act without hesitation or
apology when a favorable opportunity
presents itself
then you will be a very successful
person in any domain of life
