what makes relationships so challenging
is not that they are transactional in
fact if we were collectively more
accepting and explicit about this
reality we would all probably have an
easier time with things what makes
relationships so challenging is that the
goods being transacted are typically not
explicitly negotiated and acknowledged
and are subject to all kinds of change
and fluctuation over time my
relationship with my power company is
easy because we're both consciously
exchanging one thing for one thing and
that holds true over time now imagine
you're exchanging many things of
fluctuating value outside of both
parties conscious awareness the fact
that some people find a way to do this
indefinitely is nothing short of
miraculous however one of their secrets
might be in how these people count how
people calculate how much they give and
how much they get is subject to all
kinds of squirl this is because in
general people overvalue what they give
and undervalue what they get
