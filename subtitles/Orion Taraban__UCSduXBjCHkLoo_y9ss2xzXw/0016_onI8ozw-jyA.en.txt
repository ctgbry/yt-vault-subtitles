i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is and is expensive
the concept of and drives
cost what do i mean by this very simple
example you go into your local cafe
you say i'd like a cup of coffee please
they said that's three dollars and
you're like wait a minute
well what if i want a cup of coffee and
i want some steamed milk
inside of it they say oh that's a latte
okay well that's going to be four
dollars well wait a minute
what if i want a cup of coffee and
there's steamed milk
and there's some sort of caramel flavor
oh well that's going to be a
caramel frappe whatever that's 450. you
get what i'm saying
every time you say and
there's going to be a greater cost
associated with
getting more of what you want now this
isn't necessarily an
issue so long as you're prepared to pay
more
every time you say the word and this is

[01:01]
every time you say the word and this is
a very obvious example when it comes to
cafes but think about it both your
personal and your professional life
sometimes i coach folks who are trying
to level up their careers or take a new
trajectory
professionally and they think okay well
i want
a high paying job and i want to be my
own boss and i want to work with whoever
i want to work with and i want to do it
everywhere in the world
and i don't want to have to go back to
school and it's like well
it's going to be very you can get all
those things
but it's going to it's going to be very
very expensive
not in terms of money though obviously
that could be one of the costs
but in terms of time sacrificed in order
to obtain the desired result remember
value is derived by sacrifice i i made a
video about that a while back
and the biggest sacrifices that we can
ever make are time-based sacrifices
there's also sacrifices of effort there
are sacrifices associated with

[02:00]
are sacrifices associated with
discomfort letting go of comfort letting
go of certainty
same thing in your personal life okay
i'm looking for a relationship okay i
want this person to be
a nine or a ten i want them to be
working out three or four times a week
i want them to be making six figures i
want them to have a house
i want them to have their life together
they need to be emotionally available
they can't smoke it's like okay
you can have all those things but what
are you prepared to sacrifice
to obtain the desired result which in
this case would be
what are you doing to make yourself more
attractive
to the kind of person that you want to
have into your life like if you want all
those things okay
well if you demand eight things of your
hypothetical partner
then are you prepared to meet his or her
top eight demands
for his or her hypothetical partner if
not
then it's kind of an unreasonable
request
you know what i'm saying so you're free
to want whatever you want but you can't
want whatever you want at the price that

[03:01]
want whatever you want at the price that
you would prefer to pay
every time you say and the price goes up
so that's my thoughts on the matter
