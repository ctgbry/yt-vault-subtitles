i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
look for solutions
it's easy to look for and find
problems
they're all around us
this is because the world is inherently
unsatisfactory
that's one of the core attributes of
reality according to the buddha at least
the world is unsatisfactory and we're
surrounded by problems
therefore
it is not a testament to your
perceptivity
cleverness or intelligence
to identify problems
that's like finding sand at a beach
it's very easy to do
looking for problems is not emblematic
of any positive virtues
on the other hand it is very much a
testament to your perceptivity
cleverness or intelligence to identify
solutions
generally identifying solutions requires

[01:00]
generally identifying solutions requires
a good deal more concentration diligence
and creativity than does identifying
problems looking for solutions is
emblematic of positive virtues
and it's important to understand that if
you can find problems
then you can find solutions
the action finding
is the same in both cases what you're
doing doesn't change
the only thing that changes is the
object of your doing instead of looking
for one thing you look for another the
looking remains the same
and this is good news if you're
habituated to looking for problems it
shouldn't be a difficult problem to fix
on some level it's like a compass that's
exactly 180 degrees off
if you turn around and just walk in the
opposite direction then your compass
actually suddenly becomes a reliable
instrument of action with no additional
retooling
now looking for solutions requires a
certain degree of attentional discipline
however the ability to identify a
potential solution from among an

potential solution from among an
abundance of problems
is a mark of the exceptional individual
refining this capacity will redown to
your benefit
