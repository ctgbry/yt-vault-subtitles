i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
to be loved
you must allow yourself to be known
this is extremely important
it's often the case that by the time we
enter into full adulthood we've been
hurt by relationships we've had bad
breakups or experienced betrayal or
suffered other losses
and as a consequence there is this
tendency to sort of emotionally clench
in new relationships
in order to protect ourselves from being
hurt again
the fear here is that if someone were to
know who we truly were
and they were to judge us negatively as
a result of that knowledge
then not only would they leave us but
their flight would be all the more
painful because it would be based on an
accurate observation of who we actually
were
and so to defend against this outcome
many people protect themselves from
really being seen
from really being known
unfortunately this is counterproductive

[01:02]
unfortunately this is counterproductive
as it's not possible to love something
you don't know about in fact we can only
love to the depth of our knowledge
noodle on that one for a while
it's also counterproductive because most
people are not going to break out their
hammer and chisel and work to undo the
layers of defensiveness that you've
constructed around your heart
that might not be how they want to spend
what could very well be their one and
only life on this planet so they might
try once or twice before moving on to
somebody else who might not be so much
work so
in this framework the other person
leaves either way if you allow yourself
to be known they might not like what
they see and leave and if you don't
allow yourself to be known they might
get exacerbated with your defensiveness
and leave and even if for some strange
reason the other person were to stick
around and appreciate you you would
probably still feel unsatisfied within
that relationship as their appreciation

[02:00]
that relationship as their appreciation
couldn't be based on an accurate
understanding of who you were which
would make for a pretty unsatisfying
relationship
and since we apparently can't seem to
win
that's our clue that we may actually be
within an emotional construct created by
our past hurts
as opposed to objective reality allowing
yourself to be known is a risk and it's
one that should be taken gradually as
the relationship develops
but it's a risk that is absolutely
essential for certain kinds of
relationships if you want to be loved by
others you have to show yourself to them
so that they have something to love
