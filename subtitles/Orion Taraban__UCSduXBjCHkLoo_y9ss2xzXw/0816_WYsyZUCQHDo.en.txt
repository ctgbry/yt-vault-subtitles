there are no small ponds in for a long
time it was okay to be a big fish in a
small pond you grow up in your little
Hometown you might be the high school
quarterback you might have a respectful
small business you could be the most
eligible bachelor in town that doesn't
matter anymore because the rest of the
world is so excess not just you know
like geographically you can travel
around the world in a day but
interpersonal like you can have access
to pretty much every other man or every
other woman on the planet so when folks
are interested in potentially partnering
up they're not just thinking who's the
most eligible bachelor who's the most
attractive lady in my hometown they're
now comparing that man and that woman
against all the other men and women that
they see on TV on Instagram etc etc so
everyone is swimming in one gigantic
ocean in today's day and age so each man
is competing for the girl next door with
every other man on the planet and every
woman is competing for the most eligible
bachelor in her hometown against every
other woman on the planet and that's
really tough because there's always a
bigger fish you know what I'm saying
