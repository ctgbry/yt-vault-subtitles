in a comment to my recent video the fear
of commitment australian girl asks what
causes commitment issues in women
look one of my first girlfriends in
college
eventually admitted to me years later
that when i first asked her out she
turned me down because she didn't want
to date somebody who still lived in the
dorms
one of my best friend's wife confided in
me that she rejected her future
husband's first proposal because he
still lived in a trailer and had a
part-time job
the fact of the matter is is that women
reject
offers of commitment for the same
reasons that men do that they are
perceived as not being good enough for
that particular individual
the double standard is that when a woman
turns down a man's offer for commitment
that woman is not generally labeled as
having a fear of commitment whereas the
converse is true for men and that was
one of the core points of my video
