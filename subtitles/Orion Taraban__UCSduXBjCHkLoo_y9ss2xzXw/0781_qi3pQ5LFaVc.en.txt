I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is wrestling
with the
angel my guys it is necessary to
struggle to achieve anything of value in
this world just think of how difficult
it is to get money consider how much
time and effort and perseverance goes
into making a buck and frankly money is
one of the most common and fungible
Goods on this planet in the scheme of
things it's really nothing
special so if it takes that much work
and focus and dedication to affect any
meaningful progress with respect to your
finances what makes you think that
meaningful progress with respect to your
mind and heart will be any easier just
because these things aren't tangible in
point of fact abstract intangibles are
even harder to obtain than their

[01:01]
even harder to obtain than their
concrete counterparts and I'm here to
tell you that things like peace and
contentment and
self-actualization and love require a
significant effort from us to attain
this is what I call wrestling with the
angel the angel as a symbol being the
benefactor of real goodness and value to
humanity there's a story in the Bible
about Jacob he meets an angel who starts
to fly off to heaven and before he can
get away Jacob grabs him tightly and
says to him I'm not letting go unless
you bless me and does the angel bless
him [ __ ] no this is because the Divine
is not Santa Claus that is some Childish
fantasy that just dos out presence on
demand that's not the way reality Works
my friends and it's a good thing that's
not the way reality works I shudder to

[02:01]
not the way reality works I shudder to
think how decadent and degraded the
human race would become if everything of
value were available on
demand in any case the angel tries to
shake Jacob off and climbs higher and
higher into the sky the two are
wrestling in midair which at this point
has become Mortal Combat since Jacob
would not survive a fall from that
height however it's precisely this
willingness to go all in that gets
results Jacob demonstrates with his
behavior that he is willing to fall
willing even to die in order to obtain
the Angel's blessing that's how badly he
wanted it and as a consequence of this
struggle and courage and perseverance
Jacob eventually receives the Angel's
blessing he did not receive it because
he wanted it he did not receive it
because he asked for it he received it
because he survived the struggle to a
achieve it this is the secret to getting

[03:03]
achieve it this is the secret to getting
anything worth having in
life now in the process of wrestling
you're going to shed some things
physical wrestling like actually
grappling with an opponent is an
extremely difficult activity and because
it's difficult the more you do it the
more you're going to discard anything
that isn't instrumentally related to
success in this domain for example the
more you wrestle the more you will lose
flab and weakness and
lassitude and what a miraculous symmetry
the more flab and weakness and lassitude
you lose the more muscle and strength
and stamina you will gain so in the
process of wrestling you lose precisely
those things that are antithetical to
success in wrestling pretty cool huh we
can of these things that you lose as the

[04:01]
can of these things that you lose as the
cost of success in wrestling like if you
want to get really good at the physical
active grappling you will need to pay
for that achievement with your flab and
your weakness and your lassitude because
best of luck becoming a champion
wrestler while you're still flabby and
weak and tired it's just not possible
and I'd like you to consider that it's
not possible because like the fabric of
reality does not allow allow for
theft it's not that you're not supposed
to steal you literally can't do it you
can't obtain an intangible of value
without paying the requisite
cost this is just one manifestation of
universal
justice if you appreciate the insights
on this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course

[05:00]
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description all right just as we shed
weakness when we grapple with strong
physical opponents we shed things
antithetical to their particular success
when we grapple with the angels of Love
or peace or contentment for instance in
the act of wrestling with the angel of
love you will shed
resentment hatred bitterness and
selfishness and the more you wrestle
with this Angel the more you will lose

[06:01]
with this Angel the more you will lose
these things because these things are
the cost of love like you cannot be a
loving person while you still Harbor
resentment hatred bitterness and
selfishness it's not that you're not
supposed to feel these things you
literally can't feel them and love at
the same time it's not possible where
the first emotions are the other isn't
and vice
versa now this isn't going to happen
overnight you can't just hand over your
resentment and egotism and expect to
receive love in return why because these
things are deeply subtly and vigorously
lodged inside of
you removing these threads is like
untangling a really stubborn knot it
will take time and effort and care and
discernment you will have to wrestle
with yourself

[07:00]
with yourself
only after a while will these elements
be sufficiently disentangled that you
will be able if you so desire to make a
sacrifice of your egoic self which is
ultimately the cost of Love Like Jacob
we have to be willing to die to self in
order to enter into the highest echelons
of love which is a kind of divine
blessing we can say comparable things
with respect to attaining other things
of value for instance in the act of
wrest wrestling with the angel of Peace
you will shed Envy jealousy impatience
and anger the more you wrestle with this
Angel the more you will lose these
things because these things are the cost
of Peace you cannot be a peaceful person
while you still Harbor Envy jealousy
impatience and anger where the first
emotions are the other isn't and vice
versa starting to make sense so what
should you do if you're struggling with

[08:01]
should you do if you're struggling with
anxiety then grab on to the angel of
courage and don't let go if you're
struggling with addiction then grab onto
the angel of temperance and don't let go
if you're struggling with depression
then grab onto the Angel of Hope and
don't let go there is always a way out
my friends but it is not [ __ ] easy to
get there and you can only leave if you
pay the appropriate
cost again
you will likely need to wrestle with
these angels for quite some time they
will test you up to the last ounce of
your strength and
endurance but let me tell you it's
[ __ ] worth
it things like peace and contentment and
love are real true Goods they are so
much more valuable than money like all
the money in the world cannot buy by
peace of mind all the money in the world

[09:02]
peace of mind all the money in the world
cannot buy you a contented heart and
think of how much work and effort would
be necessary to make all the money in
the world do you understand if hell
exists it's life without those things
and the way out is to drop the
unnecessary weight that keeps us from
ascending to the
imperion the secret to success here is
contained in the story of Jacob
there is a mysterious power in being
willing to do whatever it takes to
achieve your goal to not let go no
matter what the people who are willing
to do that actually make [ __ ]
progress these are the people who get
the good things in life because if you
just do it until it becomes
uncomfortable or difficult or
inconvenient then my friend it probably
would have been better if you never made
the attempt in the first place why

[10:02]
the attempt in the first place why
because when you quit you not only will
have wasted time and energy but you're
going to feel like a schmuck because you
couldn't stick with something that you
said you wanted to
do it's like Bukowski's excellent poem
If you're going to try go all the way
otherwise don't even start I'll put a
link to the author reading the whole
poem in the description below because it
is so good in any case if you're not
willing to suffer pain and difficulty
and
inconvenience it's best if you just
tolerate your circumstances for the time
being these are part of the cost of
attaining anything of real value in the
world what do you think does this fit
