i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychex
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is if you
can do it once
oftentimes
i talk to folks they're in jobs they're
in relationships they're good but
they're not great and while they're not
entirely contented many of these folks
can be afraid that if they were to leave
their positions
they wouldn't be able to find something
better
now it's true if your job or
relationship is pretty good well
all things being equal there is more
room for things to get worse than for
things to get better this is kind of
regression towards the mean
indeed the next opportunity that comes
your way might actually be less
satisfactory that's a definite risk
however what i usually say when i
encounter this thought process is that
if you can do it once
you can do it twice
you've already demonstrated that you are
capable of achieving that outcome so
it's clearly in the realm of possibility
that's irrefutable

[01:00]
that's irrefutable
the question now becomes can you achieve
that outcome consistently and that my
friends takes practice
if you can get into a satisfying
relationship with a person who is warm
and supportive and loving and attractive
then there is no reason why you couldn't
do it again
if you could do it once you can do it
twice
and the second time could be even better
because that's generally what we find
when we practice something right we get
better at it
if you are able to find a satisfying
fulfilling and well-paying job once
then you can do it twice
for you satisfying fulfilling and
well-paying jobs are a realizable
outcome if you can do it once you can do
it twice and if you can do it twice you
can do it repeatedly
the key to moving beyond the fear of
letting go of something decent
is trusting your capacity to achieve as
informed by your previous experience
and if you've never done it before well
the good news is that you don't have

[02:00]
the good news is that you don't have
much to lose only to gain so you might
as well get out there and see if you can
make something of yourself
and at the end of the day if you can do
it once you can almost certainly do it
again
so don't settle for decent prematurely
