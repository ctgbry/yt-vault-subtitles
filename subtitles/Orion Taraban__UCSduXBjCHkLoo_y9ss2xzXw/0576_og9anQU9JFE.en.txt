many people actually don't want to know
the truth because if they knew the truth
they might have to actually do something
about it which Beyond just requiring
effort might very well be painful and
discomforting besides and this is why
people who start telling the truth are
almost universally punished by their
communities to begin with the truth
creates a necessity for change which is
uncomfortable and expensive and
potentially something no one else asked
for the truth might also require giving
up certain benefits or privileges that
inhere in the status quo this often
produces a kind of implied understanding
between the people in the relationship
namely I'm not really going to show up
or ask about your truth and you're not
really going to show up or ask about my
truth and we're both going to pretend
that neither one of us knows about
either one of us knowing about this
arrangement
