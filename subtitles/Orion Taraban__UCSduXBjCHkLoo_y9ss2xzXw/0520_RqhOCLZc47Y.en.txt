this is where a lot of guys get into
trouble because men in part due to their
temperament and in part due to
socialization are generally not very
emotionally expressive what's more a man
isn't always prepared to engage with a
woman more or less on demand sometimes
he's tired sometimes he's preoccupied
sometimes he just wants to be left alone
in fact there seem to be some important
gender differences in how men and women
tend to respond to emotional stressors
whereas women generally prefer to talk
things out in order to feel better men
often prefer to like withdraw into the
Batcave to solve the problem men like to
go inside to isolate to incubate and to
resolve the problem internally before
emerging with a solution or at least a
plan of action of course it would be
very helpful for women to understand
that when men are disinterested in
interacting with them it doesn't
necessarily mean that they have a
problem with them they just have a
problem it's occupying their attention
and they don't want to cope with the
problem in the same way that women do
