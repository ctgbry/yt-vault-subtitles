i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
bullies
never have enough lunch money
now these words conjure up images of
elementary school and big dopey boys who
pick on smaller kids using the threat of
violence
this is of course a very stereotyped
view of bullying
in adult life bullies are generally much
more subtle
cunning and psychological
that are the elementary school variety
usually the threatened harm of adult
bullies isn't physical violence though
unfortunately that still does happen
but rather some form of emotional or
relational violence
the threat is basically that i'm going
to make your situation so difficult or
so uncomfortable that you will
eventually be coerced into giving me
what i want
sound familiar

[01:01]
sound familiar
that's a bully a bully is anyone who
uses the threat of physical or
psychological violence to get his or her
needs met
so think about this elementary school
version for a moment do you think that
one day this bully is gonna wake up and
say to himself you know what
i've been a bully for a while and i've
made some good money out of this
but i think it's time to call it quits
because i have enough lunch money now
and i just don't have to do this anymore
that will never
ever happen
you cannot comply your way out of
bullying
when you comply with a bully all you do
is reinforce the effectiveness of the
threat for getting the bully's needs met
people don't stop using strategies that
work
though they might
give up strategies that don't

[02:01]
give up strategies that don't
so you have to be very
very careful about how you choose to
respond to bullies as an adult obviously
we don't want to provoke unnecessary
conflict however it's always easier to
stand up for yourself in a relationship
earlier as opposed to later
and frankly when you do stand up for
yourself most bullies will move on
because you just aren't worth the
trouble
remember that bullies will never have
enough lunch money which means that you
cannot comply your way out of bullying
you have to stand up for yourself
i hope this helps
