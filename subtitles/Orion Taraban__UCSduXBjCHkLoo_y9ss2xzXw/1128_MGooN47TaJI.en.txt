Is it possible in the uh in the
sentimentality of connecting with human
beings, is it possible that through
exchanging oxytocin, exchanging
vasopressin, the bonding hormones, those
neurotransmitters, the serotonin, the
dopamine and whatnot, could we be
putting each other on subscription
models? Could that be what lovers do and
why they stay together monogously for
lifelong? You're on a subscription model
with each other so you can't disconnect
because you won't find it adequately
anywhere else or at least it would be
difficult to find it somewhere else
without interruption. Yeah, and I do
talk about that using the Netflix model
is kind of one of the best ways to get
involved in a relationship in 2025,
which is, it's actually kind of ironic
cuz I don't think Netflix does this
anymore. Someone told me this recently,
but the idea is you give people a free
trial where they get access to your
entire product, no strings attached.
Here it is. We have highquality
entertainment and shows. And the idea,
of course, is that the viewer will take
that time to get emotionally invested in

that time to get emotionally invested in
one or more programs. They want to get
hooked on that unique content, and it
has to be content that you can't get on
Hulu or Peacock or all the other
platforms that are out there. And then
as you know, the months go by and that
hook get digs deeper, that's when they
hit you with, "So, are you ready to
upgrade to the premium um subscription?"
Of course, if the hook isn't set
emotionally before that time and or that
content is not unique to that platform,
most people are going to bulk at paying
for something that they used to receive
for free. But I don't think that in
today's day and age, you can demand that
people, let's say, even buy a
subscription in order to just see what
kind of content you have to offer. I
think that would be a tough
