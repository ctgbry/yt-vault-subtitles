I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is every
woman is two women this is very
important for all men to appreciate more
accurately each woman is at least two
women but today we're going to focus on
the two women that absolutely live
inside of every woman the first woman is
the public facing Persona this is the
woman that you know and interact with on
the job or in the Community or on a date
and the second woman is the bedroom
Persona this is the woman that you only
ever meet behind closed doors in the
context of a sexual encounter and these
two women are not the same
women sometimes not even close and I'm
going to be talking about some of the
repercussions of this dichotomy in
today's talk in the first place you need
to understand that I'm talking about the
bedroom metaphorically not the literal
physical location which is present in

[01:01]
physical location which is present in
one spot but a contextual location which
is present whenever and wherever sex
occurs now when it comes to sexuality
the bedroom is like the wild west and it
will kind of always be like that
connected as it is to reproduction and
therefore to life itself sex will never
ever be wholly civilized after all all's
fair and Love and War which is to say
that where survival is at stake either
through life or death we acknowledge
that all bets are off this is why the
bedroom is kind of an anything goes type
of territory with very few if any rules
that govern what actually go down in any
case there's the public facing Persona
and the bedroom Persona and they're not
the same person for all intents and
purposes just like it would be
inappropriate to engage the public
facing Persona sexually even if you were
in a sexual relationship with that woman
it's kind of appropriate to engage the

[02:01]
it's kind of appropriate to engage the
bedroom Persona
non-sexually either one is likely going
to lead to complaints and hurt feelings
it's like the public facing Persona has
to be treated in a certain way and the
bedroom Persona has to be treated in a
certain other way each after its own
fashion and this is important for men to
remember for a number of reasons first
and foremost it's actually very very
difficult to tell what a woman's bedroom
Persona will be until you get her in the
bed room even through careful
observation of her public facing Persona
it will be difficult to predict what
she's going to be like behind closed
doors from my own experience there are
girls who seem to be squeaky clean on
the outside like they seem conventional
innocent even pure nice girls who to
look at them you might think they had
never even had a naughty thought but who
are the nastiest freakiest girls
imaginable when the curtains have been
drawn by the the same token there are

[03:01]
drawn by the the same token there are
some women who look totally wild they're
all tatted up with provocative clothing
and edgy attitudes but who are fairly
timid and conservative when you get them
in the bedroom the upshot is that the
public facing Persona rarely affords
good consistent information with respect
to the bedroom Persona and women I think
often don't adequately appreciate how
difficult it is for most men to navigate
this dichotomy For Better or Worse we t
to think that how she is out in public
is more or less how she is going to be
in the bedroom and this misunderstanding
causes both men and women to miss out on
all kinds of potentially satisfying
relationships now before I go any

in the description okay let's get back
to
it probably one of the most common
instances of this fallacy this
conflation of the public facing and the
bedroom personas is the phenomenon of
the boss so there are a lot of
women in the west today who are doing
very well at least from the standpoint
of material success many are competent
and accomplished and they have attained
to positions of power and authority and
all kinds of organizations now the
public facing personas of these women
tend to be more masculine or assertive
because those traits functionally help
them to compete successfully in the
professional Arena however it would be a
mistake to assume that this is how these
same women necessarily behave behind
closed doors in fact many of women are

[05:00]
closed doors in fact many of women are
looking to relax into their feminine if
not be outright dominated in their
sexual
relationships the issue is that men kind
of assume that the public facing Persona
is isomorphic with the bedroom Persona
and this scares a lot of guys off not
because these women intimidate like men
are not afraid of these women but
because assertiveness and
competitiveness isn't what the vast
majority of men are seeking in their
intimate relationships most guys want to
be the in the dominant role Visa their
women and they think H it's going to be
a power struggle every time I try to
take the lead here and they pass these
women over and this is potentially
unfortunate because it's actually quite
possible that the woman might want the
same thing as the man but that's not the
vibe she's putting off with her public
facing Persona so she's got a marketing
problem on her hands now some women are
inappropriately competitive with their
men and some some women are going to

[06:00]
men and some some women are going to
feel more comfortable in the driver's
seat but I would say that most women
actually want the man to wear the pants
in the relationship so guys it's
important to remember that how she
behaves out in public is not necessarily
how she's going to behave behind closed
doors and ladies it's important to
remember you're potentially dealing with
a target audience who finds it difficult
to remember that the same thing goes for
women who seem too pure for this world
men might pass them by because they
might think well I'm full of all these
depraved sexual desires and there's no
way this woman would go in for that
however that isn't necessarily true
either and in general the more a woman
is attracted to you the more she's going
to be willing to at least try out
certain things in the bedroom trust me
it's often the case that women are even
freakier than the men they get involved
with so try not to make assumptions
about her desires before they're

[07:00]
about her desires before they're
warranted now a deep appreciation of
this fact will start to mess with your
conceptualization of women because I'm
telling you every woman is these two
women that means your sisters are these
two women your mothers are these two
women all of your female classmates and
colleagues and neighbors are these two
women every woman on this planet
possesses these two versions of
themselves and this means that every
woman on this planet has to learn learn
how to navigate this ambiguity within
themselves especially because women
receive all kinds of conflicting
messages about their sexuality from
society some women attempt to resolve
this ambiguity by just collapsing the
dichotomy they're hyper controlled and
generally hyper controlling and they try
to civilize the bedroom as much as
possible there is no Wild West anymore
just Law and Order all the time under a
Vigilant surveillance State yay

[08:00]
Vigilant surveillance State yay
on the other hand there are women
usually young women who collapse the
dichotomy in the opposite direction
they're under regulated with poor
boundaries and inappropriately
sexualized interactions that have no
business being sexual with these women
it's only the wild west and anything
goes which will eventually motivate you
to develop Vigilant surveillance as you
won't otherwise know when you're about
to be ambushed as might be expected
neither one of these situations is
particularly ideal and most women
resolve this ambiguity by kind of
compartmentalizing the two in different
dimensions of reality but that leads to
the misunderstanding that I discussed
earlier in this episode and this is also
a big part of why sexual relationships
are generally a role of the dice which I
will discuss more in future episodes
