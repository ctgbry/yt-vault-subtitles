I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
evil isn't dark
now I believe in the existence of evil
just like I believe in the existence of
good and I don't just mean that I
believe that people do bad things or are
capable of Good Deeds I'm talking about
what we might call spiritual forces that
can imbue a person with their Essence so
we might say that there are people in
this world who are touched with evil and
that there are people in this world who
are touched with good or Holiness this
is my personal belief and I'm not
proselytizing or advocating for any
particular religion or spiritual
tradition this is my belief and your
beliefs are your business
and within my belief one thing that I've
learned is that most people have a
pretty inaccurate view of what evil
looks like and I think this has a lot to
do with the movies and the fairy tales
and the media that we have consumed from
a very young age in most cases the

[01:02]
a very young age in most cases the
villain is portrayed as Twisted
ugly and dark
Voldemort is an archetypal example the
guy is hideous to behold and shrouded in
dark tattered robes you can't look at
him and not think that he's evil he is
clearly telegraphing I'm an evil guy
which actually puts him somewhat at a
disadvantage
in any case I'd like you to suggest that
the belief that evil is dark and twisted
visibly
does folks a disservice in a number of
different ways however before I really

so how did Evil come to be associated
with Darkness to begin with well I think
this kind of occurred indirectly and by
accident how so well the most obvious
symbol for goodness that has been
available to people on this planet
throughout history is the Sun
the Sun is bright it is constant and it
supports all life on this planet without
the sun existence as we know it would
cease so we see how the Sun is an easy
symbol for the divine
and if the Divine is symbolized by
something light and bright then by
analogy its antithesis must be dark and
obscure so we get the association
between evil and darkness not because
darkness is itself evil but because
darkness is the opposite of the most
obvious symbol of the good

[03:00]
obvious symbol of the good
and this symbolic analogy has since been
reified in the collective imagination
only a little critical thought is
necessary to understand that Darkness
isn't actually evil in the story of
Genesis for example on the first day of
creation God separated the light from
the darkness he named the light day and
the Darkness night
and we're told that God was pleased with
what he saw darkness is part of the
Divine creation and it is good
it's like in that Louis Armstrong song I
see skies of blue and clouds of white
the brightness of day the dark sacred
night and I think to myself What a
Wonderful World
the stars are in their tasteful arrays
in the heavens and the moon is castoring
it it's silvery glow over the planet the
dark is a peaceful joyful respite
wherein we can commune with some of the
more obscure aspects of the Divine
so what does evil generally look like

[04:02]
so what does evil generally look like
well we have to kind of assume that few
people would knowingly choose to follow
evil so it probably doesn't look
unattractive or hideous or terrifying
it would be very difficult for evil to
attract followers that way
in fact we would generally expect it to
come in the guise of what people want
and to the extent that people want good
things we have to conclude that evil
must typically look almost exactly like
the good
evil wears a cloak of light and that
means that evil isn't dark it's bright
with a false light designed to mimic the
light of the good
Lucifer after all means light bringer
literally he was not dark but rather the
brightest shining of all the Angels the

[05:00]
brightest shining of all the Angels the
pride of which led to his fall and we
see similar tropes and mythologies
throughout history
all of this is to say that evil isn't
necessarily lurking in the shadows if
evil is a false light then it must be
visible
and in fact if you have a mind to look
you can see it every day you can see it
when you turn on the TV you can see it
when you browse social media you can see
it in the Affairs of man throughout the
world it is not dark it is not hidden
if anything it hides in plain sight and
very often it is attractive it is
seductive and it is ensnaring
evil is a lure that temps people off the
path toward real goodness Often by
seeming as a shortcut to the good
typically the only thing that looks more
like the good than evil is the good
that's how closely they appear to

[06:02]
that's how closely they appear to
resemble each other and that's why we
need to have our wits about us as we
make our way through the world because
there is nothing good for us at the end
of those other paths if you consider
that the most evil actions that have
been committed in the history of the
world generally occurred in plain sight
with the awareness of all those involved
you might arrive at a different
understanding of this Force
and an accurate understanding will help
keep you and all of us safer
what do you think have you seen this to
be true in your own experience let me
know in the comments below and thank you
