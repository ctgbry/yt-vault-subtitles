hello everybody thank you for joining me
on this Thursday evening it is
605m in Napa
California we have been experiencing an
unseasonable Heat Wave it's been over
100 degrees
Fahrenheit the last several days but I
do think it will be cooling off
soon thank you for being on time I
expect that more folks will be joining
us soon soon as the hour goes on and if
not you know 50 is already pretty
good um let's do some housekeeping stuff
at the top before I get into responding
to your questions which I hope you have
for me these sessions would be really
boring without your questions so I'm
counting on you for your support in that
regard so personally I had a birthday
the other day on
Tuesday October 1st I celebrated my 42nd

[01:01]
Tuesday October 1st I celebrated my 42nd
birthday and I had a really nice day and
a lot of people reached out and wished
me well and I had a very nice dinner I
got to do some of my work in many
respects my birthday was kind of like a
normal day because I really like my my
normal days so I saw some clients I went
to the gym
I talked to the people that I cared
about and got this spend the night just
relaxing so uh just wanted to tell you
about that the purpose of this chat I
think it will be my final one dedicated
specifically to discussing my book the
value of
others uh it came out almost three
months ago it's incredible that it's
already been that long it's still
performing very well it's in the top 10
on Amazon internationally in a number of
important categories like dating in

[02:00]
important categories like dating in
relationships and marriage and long-term
relationships that's
incredible the fact that I do not have a
manager I do not have an agent I do not
have a publishing house I do not spend
any money on
advertising and a man in his house can
write a book that
reaches this
scope is amazing like this
the internet and what it can now
accomplish will continue to disrupt a
great number of
Industries uh it's still selling very
well thanks to your support and Word of
Mouth referrals because that's really
how this works um in the absence of a
publicists and a marketing
campaign and I'm really pleased with the
feedback that I have received thus far
that said I can appreciate that it's not
always the easiest book to

[03:01]
always the easiest book to
understand uh I wrote this book in a
different tone than I use on the YouTube
channel YouTube channel was kind of
informal it's casual it's eight minutes
you know and then you move on to the
next thing this book I hope will still
be relevant 100 years from now that's
sort of this is like my bid for uh
continued relevance long after I'm gone
and
um it might need to be wrestled with a
little bit were reread it's not
something that was hly dashed out to
capitalize on a little internet Fame
it's something that I hope will have a
longlasting influence in the field and
potentially change how people approach
their relationships moving
forward Maggie The Substitute Teacher hi
Maggie nice to see
you happy belated birthday I love the
audio book the audio book was so much
fun to record I got to record

[04:00]
fun to record I got to record
myself one of the things I wanted to be
when I was in my early 20s was a book
narrator I actually had a girlfriend who
did that for a living uh she recorded
children's books and I thought that was
just the coolest best job in the world I
tried so hard to get a gig there but for
whatever reason I wasn't able to do it
so with this audiobook I was able to
sort of fulfill a dream of mine um I
just had to write the book myself I
guess um it was also a lot of fun I
recorded it in about 4 days and I think
at that time it was also unseasonably
hot it was about 110 degrees and I had
to turn the fans off in the little dark
room that I was recording in so I was
actually recording in my underwear with
the shades drawn in the dark with kind
of sweat pouring down uh just to try to
stay cool um and get the job done but I
had a great time recording it thank you
I'm glad that you had a nice time

[05:01]
I'm glad that you had a nice time
listening to it so the uh super chats
are already starting to come in please
have patience with me this is only the
third time I'm doing this I think I'm
getting the hang of it if I miss you for
some reason please do not take it
personally I will do my best to get to
everybody uh thank you for your
support um so we're here to talk about
the book the value of others if you have
questions relative to any of the the
themes or subjects that uh exist in the
book I'd be happy to discuss them uh as
a
priority and then I'm going to save some
time near the end to share with you like
what's going to happen next because I
actually have a couple of big things
coming down the pipeline that I'm
excited to share with you okay so people
are joining us which is great and uh
let's get to your questions okay let's
make sure that I don't screw this
up like I have in the past okay we
always heard from Maggie thank you next
up is Tom Lee thank you for your
donation I'm a 5 foot5 32y old Asian

[06:01]
donation I'm a 5 foot5 32y old Asian
male hting 120k in
Melbourne I'm currently focusing on
building a business fitness and fashion
sounds like you're doing great man what
else should I be working on to become
husband material and experience
optionality at 35 despite my race and
height so uh first of all there's a bit
of a just maybe some internal work that
needs to be done there I I appreciate
that race
effects dating like there's been some
really interesting studies that were
done using
OK Cupid data OK Cupid is a big
conglomeration that owns like 90% of
dating apps including OK Cupid hinge
Tinder Etc so it's actually a pretty
robust evidence pool um and they did
show that there are intersections on
preference between the various races and
genders so let's not pretend that race
doesn't influence people's perceptions
when it comes to sexual selection and
make choice that said I guarantee that
there are women out there who are into

[07:00]
there are women out there who are into
shorter Asian men like I guarantee it
they may not be where you currently are
they may I mean Melbourne is a is a big
city so there's probably going to be
some women who are into shorter Asian
men in that City but if not then you got
to go where the fish are you know what
I'm saying so it's like if you're not
having
luck where you are and you suspect it
might be due to your race then
geoarbitrage man it's like welcome to
2024 the sectional Marketplace it's one
big pond so go to where you are more
highly valued and more highly
appreciated um I would also potentially
refer you to that article I'm sure you
can Google it to find out well which
races of women swipe right on Asian men
the most and those are going to be kind
of like your customers and hopefully
there is an overlap between what you
want and what's attractive

[08:00]
want and what's attractive
uh to you uh what's and who is attracted
to you
okay um so I address that what else
should I be working on to become husband
material um the best thing that you
could do in the next several years is to
practice
so most guys don't just want to get
married just like most women don't just
want to get married despite what some
guys might think they want to be married
to someone that they like and they
they're attracted to and someone that
they feel like lucky to be with and
those people don't come around every day
you know there's billions and billions
of people in the world but the the ones
that you really like and that really
light you
up they don't come around every day
right so you have to be ready for them
it's like if you don't get any batting
practice in how are you going to hit it
out of the Park when the pressure's on

[09:02]
out of the Park when the pressure's on
that is when you're actually confronted
with a really attractive option right if
you have if you're just sort of like
waiting out of the game until the bases
are loaded in the bottom of the ninth
because that's when it really matters I
don't think you're going to be as
effective as you might like so I talk
about this I made an episode a long time
ago called the two kinds of dates and I
learned this from my dad and he taught
me that Orion there are two kinds of
dates there are good dates and there are
practice for good dates that's it so in
the absence of a optionality that really
excites you and lights you up you need
to practice on the women that are
available and that are showing some
interest in dating you um I know that
can rub some folks the wrong way but how
else are Men supposed to be confident
and competent about directing a
relationship if they don't have any
experience dating um and seducing and
moving in that direction so I would say

[10:01]
moving in that direction so I would say
you got to get some reps in so that you
can be prepared to hit out of the park
when you get your pitch okay hope that
helps Tiffany Longboat thank you for
your donation Canada Canadian 149 I'll
I'll put that as down payment on a soda
thank you uh L casley
20 thank you for your support I agree
the audiobook was easy to listen to
while working out or cleaning the house
I'm glad to hear that I'm also a little
surprised I kind of thought that the
book might be something that would
require undivided attention maybe you're
just really intelligent and can split
your Consciousness and focus on multiple
things at once because uh I sometimes
get lost listening to my own own audio
book uh Hector P thank you for your
donation um thank you uh Kaka okay uh
where did you
go $10 Canadian thank you with your
little workout Emoji I appreciate you

[11:03]
little workout Emoji I appreciate you
appreciate you voodoo 2130 thank you for
your donation good day Orion or good day
since I assume that's
Australian Orion can the role of the
Ador and the adored be switched in a
romantic relationship at any point it
absolutely can if so what are the pros
and cons of that switch thanks okay so
it can switch but it generally requires
a major life or relationship
event so in the beginning when people
are getting to know each other in the
initial stages of the courtship process
they're kind of kind of feeling out who
they are and they're they're negotiating
unconsciously and behaviorally and there
can be bigger Swings with respect to the
balance of Attraction maybe one week the
woman is pursuing and the next week the
man is pursuing
and I'm not sure about that that one
date didn't go so well so do I give up
or do I stick it out so there's a lot of

[12:01]
or do I stick it out so there's a lot of
swings that happen in the
beginning as a relationship progresses
people pretty much settle into roles um
and they kind of stick it out mostly
because each person is in most cases
they settle into their preferred role
and they kind of negotiate a preferred
gap between the two of them and that's
kind of what allows the relationship to
end
now if for whatever reason like it would
be hard to provoke um a shift in the
balance of
Attraction it it would definitely
destabilize the relationship which would
probably jeopardize the uh you know the
maintenance of it it would put it at
risk because some people just do not
want to be in the other role and if you
manipulate the relationship in such a
way to more or less force them into that
role they might become dissatisfied with

[13:00]
role they might become dissatisfied with
the relationship that it's no longer
worth it so you should be cautious about
like fiddling with that but the roles do
switch um but it's usually when there's
a
great positive thing that happens or a
big negative thing that happens to one
of the person in the relationship and
not the other so for example a positive
thing that could happen is maybe
somebody in the adorer role who never
really thought much of himself suddenly
gets a huge promotion or becomes like
internet famous and is now making 10
times the money that he made before and
is now a wash and sexual optionality
like it might not happen overnight but
that person is probably eventually going
to shift into more the adored role um
because the the balance of power has
shifted in that
relationship um by the same token
a big negative thing that could happen

[14:01]
a big negative thing that could happen
could be like an affair where the the
trust and the attraction is
fundamentally broken and that can cause
sometimes a fall from grace the adored
can no longer be on his or her pedestal
because of the indiscretion um and then
the adorer can no longer like see the
adored with that kind of um positive
Mooney eyes for for instance so it can
switch but it generally requires a
pretty big uh change that affects only
one of the
partners okay mrid thank you for your
donation how would you apply your
principles in a society that is
continually moving towards gender
equality are the theories compatible
thank you great book yeah I don't think
that gender equality is incompatible
with the things that I talk about but we
have to be clear about what we're
talking about when we say gender
equality
because there's lots of different ways

[15:00]
because there's lots of different ways
that we can Define
that like logically or mathematically
equality means the same like when we say
1+ 2 equals 3 we're saying that three is
the same thing as one and two together
and that's why we can like swap out
those terms in a mathematical statement
and everything still is true we can swap
out the term three for 1 plus 2 in
parentheses and everything will work
because 1 plus 2 is the same as three
and sometimes people approach gender
Dynamics in that sense that men and
women are the same and that's not true
because you certainly can't just swap
out a man with a woman and expect
everything else to be the same gender
obviously influences a great number of
relationship Dynamics most notably
people get into sexual relationships
generally with one gender and not the
other right so if suddenly your wife was
replaced by a man I think that you would

[16:01]
replaced by a man I think that you would
notice right so that's a potentially a
very literal but also a very logical um
definition of equality I think the way
that most
um uh well-meaning
liberals approach equality is correct
which is that equality in the genders is
equality of opportunity and that there
shouldn't necessarily be things socially
that men are allowed to do and women are
not and vice versa and that men and
women should be treated equally under
the law um otherwise what we're really
talking about is some form of
discrimination and that would be a form
of political suicide even though there
are some political movements that are
masquerading as other things that might
actually be discriminating against one
gender or the
other so um one of the issues that I
don't think I talk about in the book
because it has more to do with
masculinity and femininity which are not

[17:01]
masculinity and femininity which are not
the same
as like biological
sex men have masculinity and femininity
inside of them women have masculinity
and femininity inside of them and what
seems to attract is that kind of
polarity like really masculine folks of
both genders tend to attract very
feminine folks of the gender of their
sexual preference right you see this
even in in same-sex relationships where
one partner seems to be much more
masculine and the other one seems to be
much more feminine whereas as
the as the Sexes kind of
converge um we
see that matching as well like when when
a guy isn't too masculine he generally
ends up with a woman who isn't too
feminine or a man who isn't is a little
bit feminine ends up with a a man who a
woman who's a little bit Mas masculine
like on some level the intensity is sort

[18:02]
like on some level the intensity is sort
of matched with respect to their gender
expression and that's something to keep
in mind so like if you're not catching
the fish you would like to eat you might
need to change your bait you know what
I'm saying so it's like where on the
gender expression Spectrum are the folks
that you want to attract if you're a man
for instance who who's interested in
attracting more traditionally feminine
women you might have more luck if you
express yourself in more traditionally
masculine ways
because they tend to attract based on
like intensity of that polarity
hopefully that Mak sense good
question Byron inel thank you for
your support Dr Orion what are some
practical ways for men captains to
maintain frame order within their
relationships on their ship's boats yeah
um this is the subject of an upcoming

[19:00]
um this is the subject of an upcoming
video where I talk about the three
phases of relationships the three phases
of relationships obviously are discussed
in the book they are attraction
negotiation and maintenance one thing
that I failed to mention in the book
that I correct in the video
is that a relationship phase once
initiated never
terminates like for example if you
succeed in attraction your reward is you
get to start
negotiation but that does not mean that
you get to stop attraction you never get
to stop attraction for the rest of that
relationship because stopping that will
jeopardize the basis of that
relationship sometimes fast sometimes
slow by the same token if you
successfully negotiate and secure a
relationship your reward is you get to
start maintaining but that doesn't mean
that you get to stop negotiating and
that's what's really uh this question is
about very few relationships are
explicitly negotiated like the closest
that usually comes in heterosexual
relationships
is the Define the relationship talk

[20:01]
is the Define the relationship talk
where both people kind of pretend to
understand what they mean by
monogamous um and after that or like you
know you you say your marriage vows once
and that's it like this is this is the
terms of our relationship and we don't
need to revisit that and on some level
that makes sense it's like a contract
once signed is like indefinitely
enforceable until
you know the termination date in the
contract or the death of the
participants or whatever come sooner I
suppose but that's not really how
relationships work because relationships
aren't really about that discharging of
responsibility it's a part of it but
people aren't G to approach their
romantic relationships exactly like they
approach their jobs for better for
worse
so the negoti the truth is that it's not
that Rel relationships are negotiated
once and then that's the structure of

[21:01]
once and then that's the structure of
the relationship hence forth
relationships are actually constantly
being renegotiated throughout the
duration of the relationship but they're
not usually renegotiated with words your
partner doesn't come to you in most
cases and say I want a change in this
type of
relationship generally what happens is
that people just start showing up in the
relationship in different ways some of
this is is just organic and inevitable
because people are always in the process
of becoming who they are people are
always changing they they can't not if
you're not changing you're dead so some
of this is natural and let's say
unconscious some of this might be
intentional and um conscious but your
partner is going to start showing up
differently now how you respond and some
of those ways that they show up
differently some of them you're going to
like and some of them you're not going
to like so much right
um and what we're talking about here

[22:01]
um and what we're talking about here
about maintaining frame is your partner
starts showing up in ways that you don't
like so
much now this change gets renegotiated
based on how you respond to how your
partner is now showing up differently so
here's a very concrete and common
example in the beginning of a
relationship a woman is very sexual for
example and they're having sex several
times a week she loves it seems to be
have a very high libido Etc now fast
forward 5 years into the relationship
and the guy is kind of lucky to get it
once a quarter like how did that happen
like over time I'm sure the man
continued to make bids that were more
frequently rejected that would be the
change in Behavior or there was just
longer periods of time before
intercourse between intercourses right
and if the guy doesn't really say
anything and just sort of like accepts
that this is the new status quo then the

[23:00]
that this is the new status quo then the
relationship has functionally been
renegotiated right and this is
unfortunate because it all happened kind
of tacitly and non-verbally and there's
also kind of plausible deniability there
like maybe she really isn't feeling well
or that she's been under a lot of stress
you know things like that so it's it's
this this is how relationships get
renegotiated and captains sort of call
that
out and they don't accept changes in the
relationship that they're not
comfortable
tolerating like it's hard for I I do
consultations every week with guys who
are in sexless marriages and the the
kind of like shame and the rage and the
frustration and the Despair and the pain
that come from that like it's it's very
difficult for them um but they are at
least somewhat complicit because like a
relationship doesn't become sexless
overnight and that guy just continued to
sort of go along with it right so that's

[24:02]
sort of go along with it right so that's
kind of how frame gets seated in
relationships is the partner shows up
different and we just sort of go along
with it um so one of the easiest ways to
do that like a first level response if
you can is to joke about it and it's
that's a way of kind of like bringing it
into the conscious dialogue but without
showing that you know or taking it too
serious ly or that I'm offended or hurt
by the change in behavior that would be
maybe like a level
one it might go down to like a level 10
and a level 10 is like explicitly
addressing the change and giving the
other person a choice between that
behavior or a continued relationship
with you
and and to try to do that without any
kind of uh you know petulance or anger
or hurt could hard to do and um respect

[25:01]
or hurt could hard to do and um respect
that person's Choice some people are
going to choose the behavior over a
relationship with you and some people
are GNA see oh you know what uh I'm
willing to give this up as I'm will to
sacrifice this Behavior to keep a valued
relationship so that's what I would say
to that good
question Gustavo par thank you for your
donation sir amazing work thank you
thank
you okay
sorry I lost my place here here we go XA
CAD Trader Canadian 10 thank you for
your support happy birthday Dr terban
thanks your book is one of my favorite
reads ever thank you s question for you
what psych literature courses would you
recommend for improving self-esteem and
social skills for
dating I don't know many like my I will
say that my favorite book on
dating until I wrote my book uh was Mark

[26:02]
dating until I wrote my book uh was Mark
Manson's models that is an excellent
book uh he wrote it before he became
famous with the subtle art of not giving
a [ __ ] apparently back in the day he was
something of a pickup artist and he kind
of made a living as a dating coach like
hitch in the Boston area in his 20s and
uh he learned a lot of Seduction
techniques and taught them to other men
and this book is basically him kind of
saying here's my the accumulation of my
knowledge in this field and I'm going to
move on to other things and uh it's a
great book and he touches on a lot of
different things its core premise
is the successful SE seduction is based
on vulnerability which is a complicated
word which I think that he admits um
being vulnerable basically means like
sharing being willing to share and
express your authentic emotion
uh and he goes into a lot of practical

[27:01]
uh and he goes into a lot of practical
things to consider from everything that
you
look you know your dress to some some
things you might say to increase sexual
tension it's it's a good read check it
out um I would also recommend the
channel the naturals
lifestyle I've had Alex Leon who's one
of their coaches on the channel in the
past they're their big kind of uh
Flagship dude is James Marshall and that
channel has I think four or five guys
they all have their own energies and
personalities and they're all they all
seem to be really
good and I like that because sometimes
we fall prey to thinking that there's
one right way to be a man or one right
way to seduce a woman and that's that's
not true there's lots of different ways
to do it and these guys do it without
being creepy and I I would highly check
out their highly recommend you check out
their Channel social skills for dating I
made a newsletter about this the best
thing to do for improving social skills

[28:01]
thing to do for improving social skills
for dating is dating the second best
thing like I was talking about a few
minutes ago practice the second best
thing is improv
classes um improv will help you to get
out of your head which is generally your
enemy when it comes to social
interactions on some level you have to
open your mouth without really knowing
what you're have you're going to say and
trust that you're going to be able to
complete the sentence in an intelligible
way like if you trying to think out in
full everything that you're going to say
before you say it you're going to be so
locked into your own mind you're going
to be so rigid and inflexible it's going
to be very hard to to play and that's
generally what banter is it's like a
form of verbal tennis and you have to be
able to hit the ball back and forth if
you're like playing chess 50 moves out
before you even make your opening
move it's unlikely to progress the way
that you imagine so improv is about like
making choices before you're ready and
trusting that you'll be able to work
with them a really useful skill set it

[29:01]
with them a really useful skill set it
can feel kind of funny but that might
mean that you're just like getting out
from behind your social reticence or
your social fear so that's what I would
recommend Charles D New Zealand 10 thank
you for donation kiwi you mentioned an
emerging gig economy yeah EG Tinder task
rabbit versus
husband prostitute cleaner versus wife
uh I think I understand what you're
talking about because I mentioned Tinder
and Tas rabbit in the book what are some
other less obvious gig rolls you foresee
and what are the trade-offs of using
them what's interesting is
um like the way I talk about the future
of relationships in the 12th chapter of
the book can seem super Progressive and
scary like because I'm basically talking
about not the complete elimination of
marriage and traditional relationships
but the

[30:00]
but the
continued diminution of those
institutions like we're seeing them fall
apart in in real time it's been a
decimation over the last 50 years and
with dating apps it seems like it's just
getting worse in many
respects um and so sometimes people hear
my progn prognostications for the future
and they think oh this guy he's so
cynical uh or he's so far out there we
need to return to like a tradition
modity this idea of the gig relationship
is actually more aligned with
traditional marriage and relationships
not traditional in the
1950s ideal steamless stainless steel
toaster you know tradcon fantasy I mean
like when we lived in villages in the
medieval period and for thousands of
years previous to that when we lived in
villages and we had extended kin

[31:01]
villages and we had extended kin
networks we had hundred people within a
mile of us who we knew like it wasn't
just oh that's I I think I saw that guy
at the post office like you you know
these people you know their name you you
know their story you've eaten with them
you see them in church or a temple or
whatever form of worship at the
community
rituals and you go to different people
for different things like you go to that
person for advice and you go to that
person to like have fun with and you go
to that person if you want to gossip and
you go to that person if you need help
with your crops um you need that person
to to trade for the things that you make
you know it's like that's a gig economy
and that's how human beings have lived
for hundreds of thousands of years
and what we did is we changed all that

[32:03]
and what we did is we changed all that
about 100 years ago the F the first real
change was the huge Advent of the love
marriage where we conflated two of those
gigs which
is spouse and mistress and those were
very separate roles for the vast
majority of human history you did not
expect your wife your your spouse the
person with whom you're basically
forming a small business with to raise
children to also be your passionate
romantic
lover that's nuts it was just sort of
like you know people had
different uh tolerances and
accommodations to those realities but
they were almost never the same person
but now they're the same person supposed
to have our like I talk about the love
marriage might be a very Paradox in
terms but then we get rid of the
communities and we get rid of the accan
networks and now we need advice so this

[33:02]
networks and now we need advice so this
person needs to be our therapist and
then we need funds this person needs to
be our buddy and uh we don't live with
our parents anymore so we need this
person to be our mommy or our daddy and
all this instrumental support and it
just becomes too much um and this has
gotten to a fever pitch in the last four
years where people aren't even like
leaving their houses anymore it's
like men and women were never really
designed to spend all that much time
with each other like that's not what you
see in
traditional living like the men
generally spend their days hanging out
with other men and the women generally
spend more time hanging out with other
women and
nowadays not only are men and women
spending a lot of time together but
they're spending time with like one
particular man and one particular woman
they don't even go into the office
anymore since then now they're working
at home they never [ __ ] leave right
so like to give you the way that a lot
of modern couples live it it almost
sounds like an experiment that NASA

[34:00]
sounds like an experiment that NASA
would do to determine if like their two
astronauts were mentally resilient
enough to go to Mars without killing
each other because we're just gonna like
put them in this little capsule for a
year and see what
happens okay it would be a psych
experiment and and that's how millions
of men and women are living in today's
day and age it's like science
fiction so what I'm suggesting is that
we actually go back to the traditional
like that's the cycles of histories like
what's Progressive is actually very
traditional in many respects and we we
make the institution of marriage if we
want to keep it more humble where we
just like lower our expectations for
what we
need and want from our spouse and and
get our needs met with other
relationships and bring back that
flourishment of um and diversity of
relationships in people's lives
hopefully that answers your question
Stephanie a thank you for your support
question question as a woman what is the
best way to outplay a trickster

[35:00]
best way to outplay a trickster
archetype man H dealing with a player
like him always takes me out of my frame
I get so defensive so I assume when
you're saying the trickster archetype
you mean that you're dealing with a
player and when you say a player I I'm
assuming you mean a guy who just sort of
wants to have sex with you and will say
what he needs to say and will do what he
needs to do to make that
happen and that's very attractive
because um
generally players don't have qualms
about telling women what they want to
hear and nothing works better on people
than telling them what they want to hear
okay it's the most attractive it's music
to everyone's ears to hear exactly what
you want to hear right and you might
think like a a normal person with maybe
more honest Integrity won't just cater
to that and will tell more the truth and
that's not as seductive that kind of
like breaks the spell of the romance and

[36:04]
like breaks the spell of the romance and
that's despite what women and men say
not really what they want a lot of men
and women want to be
seduced if you're finding yourself
having to deal with with players a lot
it there there might be a part of you
that likes to be tricked that likes to
be told what she wants to hear because
it feels really good the guys who tell
you the truth it's not as fun it's
honesty doesn't get you laid but it's
generally easier to be into a
relationship with in the long run right
um so the way to I wouldn't try to like
out Trick the trickster that just is
more troubled than it's worth um it's
it's a better idea to not give players
too much
ammo like you got to think how did this
person
know exactly what I wanted to hear H

[37:03]
know exactly what I wanted to hear H
well in the vast majority of cases you
[ __ ] told him exactly what you wanted
to hear and this guy just mirrored it
back to you okay so don't go a lot of
women they think that they're like
dating intentionally by coming right out
of the gate and saying this is what I
want this is what I'm looking for this
is what I respond
to on in some level that makes rational
sense they're just trying to kind of
like accelerate the process filter
people out Etc but all they're really
doing on some level is giving the
players better access to their
vulnerabilities um and it's much easy
and now and now you have a problem
because it's going to be harder for you
to tell whether the men is telling you
when you hear what you want to hear it's
going to be harder for you to know
whether the guy's a player and he's just
doing it because he's he knows it will
help him get laid which it will or that
that he's actually like compatible he's

[38:00]
that he's actually like compatible he's
honestly compatible with you so it's a
good idea not to spill your purse out
too soon with anybody
um and to kind of like give people a
chance to show you who they are as
opposed to kind of like training them to
know what you want to hear like some
women make it so
obvious um in from their dating profiles
where they won't even talk to men it's
like if you're this way then swipe left
that's get out of here it's very easy to
reverse engineer than what you want to
hear um and I can pretend to be that if
I'm a player for a couple hours in order
to get what I want so that's probably
what I would recommend is don't give too
much information too soon and to learn
to disclose on par with
trust okay Tino
danielzik thank you for your
donation how does your model presented

[39:02]
donation how does your model presented
in the book apply to people we consider
as toxic like narcissists or BPD people
H well I think it still
applies it's very difficult if not
impossible to have a relationship with a
personality disordered individual like a
let me to have a peaceful stable
harmonious relationship with a
personality disorder individual
especially a cluster
b um like I talk about in what is it
chapter
10 you can't have any relationship with
anyone you can only have certain
relationships with certain people and
when you're really dealing with a
narcissist because I know that word gets
used a lot these days or a borderline
you can't have any type of relationship
with them you you can
have um non-reciprocated relationships
you can have chaotic

[40:00]
you can have chaotic
relationships you can have um on again
off again relationships you can have
abusive
relationships you can have addicted
relationships I mean like those are the
types of relationships you can have the
personal sort of people it's very
frustrating and and everyone I think
gets a pass because most people don't
don't haven't dated somebody with a a
cluster be personality disorder
and when you haven't you don't
understand how absolutely crazy it can
be
like the [ __ ] that can happen in a
relationship with a narcist or a
borderline it's like you might think it
only happens on a soap opera but like
it's like soap opas are tame compared to
these
relationships and most people are
unprepared for this like really crazy
outlier you know because respects they
look they don't look crazy in many

[41:02]
look they don't look crazy in many
respects they're very attractive you
know what's really interesting because I
I've I've researched both of these a lot
because I worked with personality
disorder folks for several years
fascinating subject there are some um
evidence that suggests like all the
there's three clusters of personality
disorders a b and c and all of the
disorders in a single cluster they load
on each other so there there's like
overlap between
them they're unique Expressions but
they're they also seem to have a very
common base because they're often
comorbidly diagnosed um and there's four
in the cluster B right there's
borderline narcissistic antisocial and
histrionic yeah so some researchers have
come to the conclusion that borderline
and narcissism are actually the same
disorder
expressed through the lens of gender
which is interesting because if you look

[42:00]
which is interesting because if you look
at the DSM definition of narcissism
which is really a grandiose type which
is not the only type
but that's it's it's like five times
more likely that a man will have NPD
than a woman and if you look at the way
that borderline is constructed in the
DSM it's like five times more likely
that a woman will be diagnosed with BPD
than a man but there's some
some there's some evidence to research
to suggest that both of these are the
same
underlying disorder the same like really
fractured and immature sense of self
that then gets expressed in culturally
sanctioned
gendered
Expressions um we have to be careful
though because like narcissists and
borderline folks um sometimes they they
like why do so many people like have so
much energy about it it's because
they can be so attractive and Charming

[43:00]
they can be so attractive and Charming
not all of them but like a lot of them
and that's why
people just like burn with this
animosity around their disordered exes
right because they got their hopes up
like this was this beautiful woman who
seemed to be over the moon about you and
she made you feel like a million dollars
that no one no man has ever [ __ ] her
like that before that she's never loved
somebody so much in her entire life and
that works on people man it's like
especially if you've had kind of like
unsatisfying or lackluster relationships
in the past that's like wow finally
finally it's working or you know a
narcissist narcissistic man can come in
and he's super confident he's like
almost dangerous he often is high
achieving in corporate organizations you
have to be a little mocky aelan to play
The Game of Thrones in some
respects what I'm saying is that often
narcissistic men and borderline women
present as very attractive like fantasy

[44:00]
present as very attractive like fantasy
options it's like wow finally This Tall
attractive Rich confident
risky man who just like takes what he
wants is showing interest in
me wow I can see how that would be
seductive so uh that's why people get
into relationships with these folks is
because they see them as very high value
they they present as having a lot of
what they want and and of course it
doesn't
last and a lot of times people spend
months or years like chasing the dragon
they're trying to chase that high that
they felt in the first two or three
months before let's say the curtain
dropped and they found out who they were
really dealing with and it's very
confusing because it's like well I know
that they can be loving and warm and
kind and confident and and I I really
want to see that side of them again can
be very confusing and painful to to be

[45:00]
be very confusing and painful to to be
in relationships with those folks and to
separate from those folks but I think I
don't think they're a special case I
still feel like they fit into the model
and that's why people get into
relationships with those those folks
okay Tiffany longbo thank you for your
donation Jamar thank you for your
donation um hello doctor if you can give
your 25-year-old self any piece of
advice what is the most important
message you would want to get AC cross
oh
man that is a great question and I'm
struggling
because I don't know if my 25y old self
would would listen to
me you know even if I stepped out of a
time
portal because like I I would try to
impart my words of wisdom to him but
like how did I get the wisdom that I
have it's like I had to go through the
[ __ ] I had to make my own mistakes I had

[46:00]
[ __ ] I had to make my own mistakes I had
to choose to live how I
lived
and I don't know if I I'm the type of
person who can just listen to good
advice that goes against what I might
want to do in the present moment and
prioritize the
advice same thing I mean it was kind of
the issue when I was younger my dad gave
me a lot of good advice with especially
with respect to money because he's
worked in finance almost his entire
career but I wanted to be an actor and I
you know I I thought that money was kind
of this
crass um
materialistic at best necessity and at
worst corruption and that the real
important things in life didn't have
anything to do with money and I was very
idealistic and I wanted to live a
Bohemian lifestyle
and it just and that that caused me to
be very
poor for most of my 20s and uh you know
I only started making money a bit later
than some of my friends and colleagues

[47:00]
than some of my friends and colleagues
so like my lifetime earnings is probably
lower um and now I know it's like my dad
was giving me very good advice I was
just not ready to hear it and I wasn't
ready to hear it because I wasn't like
done with my own foolishness on some
level like Pearls Before Swine man like
people have to be done with their
foolishness otherwise just save your
breath this is really important as a
therapist like you'd be surprised people
pay me now a lot of money and they come
to me asking for help asking for advice
it's hard enough when people pay and ask
for advice for them to follow
it it's not like people just just do
everything that I I ask them or
recommend of
them that's just not how people work so
if people who are paying and asking for
advice still don't follow it we should
be very cautious about giving it where
it's not asked for because it's hard
enough to get people to follow it when
they

[48:00]
do wi December cool name thanks for your
donation is there a technique to become
the captain instead of being Pastor
absolutely that's what we talk about in
the book to become a Captain you need to
do three things you need to build a boat
you need to learn to sail and you need
to chart a course that's how you go from
being a passenger to a captain don't
feel bad everyone starts out as a
passenger because we all start out as
children and children can't really do
anything under their own power but
there's a small proportion of humanity
that eventually becomes sick of being a
passenger and goes through the expense
and risk and trial of becoming a captain
and they do this by building something
to live in and to share with others
something good something of
value by developing themselves by
becoming competent by becoming
masterful and by having a mission and a
purpose and an objective around which
other people can rally so that's how you
become a captain
Mike S hey Mike S thanks for your
donation we've talked in the past about

[49:01]
donation we've talked in the past about
meditation what type do you recommend
and why hm I don't a lot of meditation
in my life like T tens of thousands of
hours a lot I was really interested in
meditation starting from when I was a
teenager I even lived in a monastery for
a while um and it was a big part of my
life for a very long
time and there are different types of
meditation the most popular meditation
right now is is mindfulness meditation I
even wrote my dissertation on
mindfulness and ran a randomized control
trial about the effects of a brief
mindfulness intervention on reading
comprehension so I'm really interested
in mindfulness um that said uh it's not
like this Panacea you know it's not
rootes it's not good for
everything it's good for some things um
I think in today's day and age based on
the problems that I see we don't need as
much mindfulness
as we need concentration there's so many

[50:00]
as we need concentration there's so many
attentional problems and there's so many
distractions in our
lives it's very hard for people to watch
even an eight minute long YouTube video
these days you know what I'm saying how
long can people actually
Focus how long can people sit and in
peace and
Repose like their lives are becoming
anxious and agitated and restless and
exhausted and a lot of that is because
of the dissipation of their attention of
their focus David Goldman the guy who
wrote emotional intelligence wrote a
book called Focus the hidden driver of
Excellence not a great book in my
opinion um but the idea is a good one
which
is uh like behind most successful people
is the ability to focus intensely and
this is also how I work it's like I
structure my day so that I have chunks
that I can focus on doing one one thing
like I always batch my consultations
together one after the other so I just

[51:01]
together one after the other so I just
like bang them out when I work on my
writing I set aside at least three hours
to do that and if I if I don't have a
three-hour chunk I don't write because
what I've noticed is that writing it
takes some time to kind of get into the
Flow State and I kind of want to go deep
into my thoughts if I do 1550 minutes
here 50 minutes there then the writing
is kind of disjointed because I'm kind
of thinking about and feeling different
things on different days and that might
show so it's a good idea to kind of like
focus on to create that in your daily
routine so that you can focus deeply so
concentrational medit and this is
important mindfulness meditation you
can't really [ __ ] up which is probably
why it's very popular today it's like no
matter what you happens inside of you as
long as you like notice it you did it
it's like I'm noticing that I'm thinking
about becoming a bird and flying over
the Grand Canyon I'm thinking about the
last time I went to a Grand Canyon I
heard a story about it snowing that
would be interesting to see the Grand
Canyon when it was snowing what was the

[52:00]
Canyon when it was snowing what was the
last time I even saw snow it's like I'm
I'm not mind wondering I'm mindfully
meditating I'm mindfully attending to my
wandering thoughts right um
concentrational meditation you can [ __ ]
up it like it has a fail condition which
is you stop focusing on the thing you're
supposed to be focusing on the easiest
one to do is just to focus on your
breath is just to is just to know just
to put all of your focus and attention
on the breath and entering your lungs
and leaving your lungs sometimes it can
be a point in space or a Mandela or it
can be a mantra there's you want to kind
of keep it simple that you can maintain
a consistent Focus either visually or
you know
interceptive um and then when you notice
that your mind has wandered which it
absolutely will uh you just sort of
gently and without judgment bring it
back to where it's supposed to be and
the more you do that the more you can
actually have this piercing enduring
concentration one of my like mutant

[53:00]
concentration one of my like mutant
abilities like if I was I have
incredible concentration like I can sit
down and read a book without stopping
without looking up uh it's and that's
something that is not an accident it's
not something that I was just born with
it's something that I've trained over
decades but holy [ __ ] do I get a lot of
stuff done now because I can just focus
and drill it out so that's what I would
recommend
okay Nikki thank you for your donation
appreciate your content and that it
helps women as much as men thank you I'm
glad that you said that is there anyone
your content is not for I would say my
content is for everyone but not everyone
is for my
content I I don't talk about certain
groups as much as others right like
sometimes people want to know more about
my takes on gay relationships and I've
talked a little bit about that but
honestly I don't really feel like one
that's not my expertise and I mean do
the gay population really want a

[54:00]
the gay population really want a
straight guy telling them about how to
be in a gay relationship like that might
wrankle me the wrong way so sometimes
folks kind of get a little offended at
let's say my lack of uh diversity or my
heteronormativity or my androcentrism I
heard that word recently um but like
that's what I know and so I'm sort of
speaking out of my personal experience
and also my professional expertise which
tends to focus on interest sexual
heterosexual
Dynamics um and I respect in um samesex
relationships for example not everything
I say will apply but I do think that the
core reasons why human beings enter into
relationships with each other are
fundamentally the same regardless of the
are mostly the same regardless of the
genders of the folks involved so I I
don't want my content to alienate
um I don't I don't want my content to be
divisive or
um Sensational or controversial trust me

[55:01]
um Sensational or controversial trust me
it would be very easy to lean into all
those things and I would get 10 times as
many views if I did but I'm kind of here
for a long time not a good time I hope
and uh I don't see how I achieve my
ultimate Mission which is to reduce
unnecessary suffering in the world at
the expense
of some group of people like that's just
not how I want to live so hopefully that
answers your question
Kid Flash thank you for your donation
love the channel and the book I've heard
a lot of talk about how people with
personality disorders should be avoided
in dating does the same apply to mood
disorder specifically bipolar too I mean
kind of yeah man kind of it's like you
have to understand that you can only
relationships certain kinds of
relationships with certain people and if
you're dating somebody with a mood
disorder whether it's bipolar to let's
say major depression like at least
moderate I think you get
work around a mild depression but
moderate to severe I mean this is

[56:01]
moderate to severe I mean this is
extremely difficult
like for example a depressed person and
depression is one of the components of
bipolar 2 that's why I'm talking about
that they can feel just like a like an
emotional bucket with a hole in the
bottom like no matter how much love and
support and encouragement you you give
this person it just disappears out of
the bottom and it can be exhausting and
you definitely don't get the same level
of reciprocity because the person is
dealing with the depression or the
bipolar so it's like you just have to be
real
with who you're who you're dealing with
in the vast majority of cases it just
might be easier to find somebody else
who isn't depressed or has a significant
mental disorder and trust me there are a
lot of people out there and this is not
to put down people who are struggling
with mental disorders it's like I think
that they can do what they need to do to
to heal and get over it just like you

[57:01]
to heal and get over it just like you
know if I injure myself I maybe I
shouldn't be playing tennis for six
months while my injury heals that
doesn't mean like I'm a bad person I'll
never play tennis again but maybe don't
date take care of this issue and become
like more available and a better partner
um you know six months 12 months down
the road it's okay I mean it's not
that's not going to be the end of the
world and um you know I would just I'm
interested in like
easygoing relationships and when you're
dealing with somebody with a with a
mental disorder whatever the disorder is
they all share one thing in common which
is they have a distorted perception that
they're it's like a fun house mirror
that somehow reality isn't reflected
back accurately and that can range from
being annoying to being absolutely
infuriating or hopeless or craziness
so it's just like if you want to have an

[58:00]
so it's just like if you want to have an
easygoing relationship you should kind
of find somebody who's emotionally
stable who's emotionally available and
is more or less securely attached I mean
it's not rocket
surgery okay Jenny Jen DOI I hope I said
that right thank you for your
donation good day Oran I am a 26 female
if a man felt disrespected by an event
happened during dating phase what can I
do to get him committed for a marriage
wow that was a big jump um I mean I
don't want to pry but that can mean lots
of different things like he could have
felt disrespected because you didn't
text him back as quickly as he would
like or because you slept with somebody
else you know so uh obviously one is
going to be easier to overcome than the
other
uh it's it's hard to get over stuff and
the earlier it's difficult
uh I mean like First Impressions kind of
matter and certainly the first let's say

[59:01]
matter and certainly the first let's say
20 Impressions matter like by the time
you've spent 20 Hangouts with somebody
you you have a
fairly concrete stable mental construct
of that person that it would kind of
take a lot to change so um if he for
whatever reason Associates you with
being a disrespectful
woman or a disrespectful
partner especially if it didn't I don't
I don't even know if you're in a
relationship with this guy right now but
if it just happened early in the
courtship phase it it just it just might
be easier to go find somebody and get
off on the right foot with them you know
um rather than like having
to overcome this obstacle that for
whatever reason is present in your
relationship um how can I get him
committed for a
marriage um
I talk about that in the book so the the
best way for a woman to get married is

[1:00:02]
best way for a woman to get married is
the Netflix
model um so lots of people have Netflix
why uh do they force them to buy the
membership before they even see the
content no quite the opposite they make
it really easy to access the content
they say we will give you a
complete full free trial like nothing is
off the menu you have complete access to
every single one of our shows and movies
and
whatnot they want
to give you this like they want to
reduce the barriers to entry and they
want to create opportunities for their
potential customer to become emotionally
hooked
and that's the goal is like within three
months they now kind of get used to this
they like it they're using it they find
a show or two that they really like
they want to know what happens next and
then if you'd like to continue your

[1:01:01]
then if you'd like to continue your
Netflix subscription we suggest that you
go to 99.99 a month or whatever it is so
it's like that's kind of the best way to
do it so many women especially on the
apps man they come right out and they're
like I'm looking for a long-term
relationship it's like okay I mean that
that's that's nice but like I mean do
you really want to negotiate that
explicitly and I trust me when I've when
I tried to meet a woman with that kind
of explicit negotiation they don't like
it okay
so you know it costs nothing to want and
it cost something to give so it's like
it's nice that you might want that but
like so what's in it for him kind of a
thing you need to enchant him you need
to give him good value you need to be
the the three month free trial where he
you get he gets access to everything
it's super easygoing there are no
obstructions and it's emotionally
engaging and then you threaten to take
it
away that's what causes people to buy

[1:02:01]
away that's what causes people to buy
Netflix memberships you can't put the
stuff behind the pay wall because Hulu
offers the free trial and peacock offers
the free trial and Disney plus whatever
it's
like you can't put all the good stuff
behind the pay wall of commitment
anymore because none of your competitors
are doing that so For Better or For
Worse this is just the standard practice
in that industry and it's kind of the
same thing in the sexual Marketplace
these days so you want to Target the man
that you give the good free full menu to
very
prudently um you don't just want to do
that willy-nilly which
is sometimes people misinterpret what I
say that's not what I say it's like
women shouldn't just be throwing sex at
every man uh but if they find a really
qualified lead it's not the time to
withhold let's put it that way so um
Target Target the right guy become
emotionally compelling I actually have
an episode coming out called how to

[1:03:00]
an episode coming out called how to
marry a rich attractive man so uh
because that's what I get all the time
in my consultations women so hopefully
that'll answer your question more thank
you
Jenny okay here we go and then um looks
like this will be the last one for now
and then I'll maybe wrap up and tell you
some of my news for the future I have
some exciting uh
updates all right LJ thank you for your
donation I gifted the book to a few
friends and they all took issues with
the moral issues in the last chapter how
would you respond to those issues I had
I read the book as having no real moral
leaning but as a set of observations H I
wish I knew more about what the moral
issues
were um I like my best guess
is that I kind of predict a continued
destabilization of the institution of
marriage which is um very troubling for
certain parts of the population right

[1:04:01]
certain parts of the population right
but I it's is not
like the book is not
um morally
prescriptive it's not like I don't I
think I mentioned this in the preface
it's like I don't agree with everything
like I don't let's put it this way I
don't like everything that I that I've
come
to I don't like every one of my
conclusions
it's
like Charles Darwin didn't like his
theory of evolution he he actually wrote
On the Origin of Species and kept it in
a locked drawer in his desk for 20 years
because it troubled him so much and he
only published it when uh a colleague in
another country published a very similar
idea of natural
selection and the evolution of species
he says actually I have this maybe the
time has come for this idea and he
unlocked the drawer and Darwin got
credit very graciously by his um

[1:05:00]
credit very graciously by his um
colleague who actually literally
published the book before Darwin who had
been sleeping on it for 20 years so it's
like this is not morally I'm not saying
this is how it should
be I'm I'm making a
reasonable guess that this is how it
will be and that is value neutral when I
talk about
how men fundamentally attempt to
exchange resources for sexual
opportunity and and vice versa for women
this is not a moral prescription I'm not
saying this is what men and women should
do I'm saying I observe
behavior and this is what men and women
do they often pretend that they don't do
that which is often what wrinkles people
morally is
sometimes I mean there's a lot of
self-righteousness in in Morality and
sometimes the truth
is more complicated than the easy
prescriptions of an ethical code where
everything is kind of black and white in

[1:06:00]
everything is kind of black and white in
reality people are complex relationships
are a mixed bag and a tradeoff and
nothing is all good or nothing is all
bad Under the Sun
so that's the approach that I came to
writing this book with I'm not making
moral judgments here and I don't love
all the conclusions that I arrive at but
they do seem to be aligned with reality
as best as I can see it so that's what I
would
say um yo Ryan there's two super Heats
you missed above did I okay yeah thanks
thank you for
that thanks for that man glad I caught
that okay um let me respond to these and
uh I think that might
be oh there's more holy
crap oh dear um all right
more no more questions uh I'm going to
respond to the ones that I got and I'll

[1:07:00]
respond to the ones that I got and I'll
probably be a little briefer I didn't
know that I had so many more of them oh
my gosh geez Louise guys okay so
uh oh
boy okay I'm gonna I'm gonna try to be
brief sorry about this I had no idea I
had such a log here okay xat X cop don't
know what that is but
$4,000 wow I'm gonna I'm gonna assume
that's a lot of money thank you for your
donation uh is a deal breaker if I'm
losing a lot of sexual attraction to my
long-term girlfriend of two years to
move forward with marriage even though
everything else is good man that's a
tough one and I have been in that
situation
before
um this has to do with kind of the gig
economy like it's to my
mind it's
sad
when one dimension of a relationship
stops working that we throw the entire
relationship out if the relationship

[1:08:00]
relationship out if the relationship
provides so much more so much good and
value and benefit in our lives so we
should be cautious about doing
that if this is something that you've
tried to negotiate but doesn't seem like
you're going to get
anywhere I think it would be really hard
for me personally to choose between like
somebody that I I loved and cared about
and had a good relationship with and
like my
sexuality that would be that would be
tough because like the point of
monogamous sexual relationship is is to
have sex like that's what makes an
monogamous sexual relationship I can
care about somebody as a friend but we
don't have to be married like or we
don't have to be sexual partners do you
understand so if you guys are both
mature adults about this you might
approach some
non-conventional
arrangements um but of course that
requires some tact some willingness to
be flexible and
um some people aren't going to be able
to do that and you're going to have to

[1:09:03]
to do that and you're going to have to
choose and you have to also appreciate
that every relationship is a trade-off
and if you were to leave this
relationship I'm saying you should but
if you were you'll meet somebody else I
I guarantee that and this person might
really float your boat
sexually but might be more annoying or
difficult to get along with you know so
it's it's always going to be a trade-off
you C you can't um there is no perfect
person but there are some flaws or
quirks that you can live with in others
that you can't and you really have to be
honest with yourself about that because
some of those things that
you either can or can't live with may
not be what Society or your family or
your friends or your parents tell you
you should or should not live with you
kind of have to make up your own mind
about that as a person with a very high
levido it would be hard for me you know
somebody with a
for whom sex isn't as
important uh maybe that's a great deal

[1:10:01]
important uh maybe that's a great deal
so there's a few things to consider
there okay I gotta keep going marriage
cause divorce hey man thanks for your
donations oh you got several oh man I'm
gonna have to bang him out real fast
though what do you think of evolutionary
psychology I think it's great is it
often it is often criticized as being
speculation is all psychology ultimately
evolutionary psychology I don't think
it's all evolutionary psychology but
obviously all psychology is based on a
mind which must have some sort of brain
substrate which was produced through
billions of years of evolution so like
indirectly all psychology rests on a
biological basis though exactly how it
does is very mysterious and we shouldn't
pretend that we understand how that
works um so in that sense all psychology
has an
evolutionary basis because it's rooted
in the mind which is in some somehow
related to the brain um I is it

[1:11:00]
related to the brain um I is it
speculation I mean yeah we weren't there
two billion years ago
um but we also can like ethnography is
really good and good correlate to
evolutionary psychology because that
examines how more indigenous people live
in the Amazon rainforest or Papa New
Guinea um because we can more or less
presume that these are modern analoges
to the way that humans lived in
pre-agricultural
societies um something to consider why
do women want men to be emotionally
vulnerable so they know when they should
jump ship and mate switch or use
vulnerable well that's some women will
do that I call that weaponized intimacy
some women want to know where your thumb
screws are like where your wounds are so
that they know kind of where
to put their thumb in to get you to jump
um women might also want to know because
like the player in my previous response

[1:12:00]
like the player in my previous response
they might want to know what you want to
see and what you want to hear because a
lot of women want to be liked they don't
talk about that a lot these days but a
lot of women want men to like them and
they want to know how they can be liked
more by the men they want to be liked
more by and obviously the more they know
about his emotions and his personality
interests the more that they can reflect
back to him what he wants to see which
generally does make him like her more
though can lead to consequences further
down the road men as per the coolage
effect seem to be genetically wired for
sexual variety I would agree are women
genetically wired to require resources
and good genes definitely good genes
resources can uh vary significantly from
culture to culture and across time like
in pre-agricultural
societies resources like private
property didn't really exist so the
resources would probably be more aligned
with maybe there was like flocks of
sheep potentially uh for nomadic hurting
cultures but the research is probably

[1:13:00]
cultures but the research is probably
more aligned with the good genes it's
like he was strong so he can protect and
hunt and get more meat um things like
that who is worst oh boy The Narcissist
who has a mental illness well the
narcissism is mental illness or the
person who keeps falling in love with
narcissist and the fantasies they sell
uh well they both kind of have an issue
so it's like this is something to keep
in mind is that
normal normal emotionally
healed securely attached
people generally don't get into
catastrophic relationships with
narcissists because something early on
doesn't smell
right it like it doesn't pass the sniff
test or there's a there's a little bit
of disrespect or there's something
that's off and they just say you know
what I'm going to have to go with my gut
here and I'm out of
here they are less susceptible to toxic

[1:14:03]
here they are less susceptible to toxic
personalities the folks who seem to keep
getting involved with toxic people have
some form of complimentary wound that
leaves them vulnerable and susceptible
to
exploitation and I'm not saying that
they deserved their abuse or their
exploitation or
victimization uh but if they just think
that they're the
unlikely victims of bad people I'm not
sure how they're going to keeps safe and
make better decisions moving forward so
there's something in them that like I
talked about the love bombing that's um
often associated with early stage
courtship with borderline folks is um I
mean who's going to be susceptible
somebody who didn't didn't have enough
love in his life you know some a woman
who who didn't feel has it's never been
made to feel beautiful you know that's
that's a that's a a wound that's a

[1:15:00]
that's a that's a a wound that's a
that's a need that a toxic exploited to
person can actually very easily exploit
okay James Francis 20 bucks thank you
thoughts on Parenthood how do you tell
if a long-term partner might be a good
co-parent as well uh vetting for a
co-parent is very different from vetting
for a playmate or just like a travel
partner or just casual dating
when it comes to
Parenthood I mean everyone's going to be
different right but I think that it
makes sense to prioritize the attributes
that have most to do with with child
care so if you're a James I assume
you're a man so like you are probably
vetting for a woman uh like does she
want kids does she like
kids is she kind is she patient is she
loving is she like emotionally stable
herself
is she emotionally available kids are
very very demanding and if a if a woman
is already kind of like not really

[1:16:01]
is already kind of like not really
available to you be for whatever reason
it's going to be hard to be available to
the children right and that's so those
are some of the things that I would do
um and of course you need to feel like
you need to trust them this
person you're going to be dealing with
some very precious delicate goods and
you're not going to be everywhere at
once and so you really need to be able
to trust this other
person their competence and their
um just like their logistical commitment
on some level do they show up when they
say they're going to show up do they do
the things they're gonna they say
they're going to do do they not do the
things they they don't say they're going
to they say they're not going to do Etc
hope that helps Chicago chano thank you
for your donation is your book just a
basis for dating in the US or can it
expound internationally I'm moving
abroad next year yeah I think it's
International certainly in more
westernized cultures than in more
traditional cultures but in every part
of the world as far as I can tell

[1:17:01]
of the world as far as I can tell
traditional cultures are moving the
direction of modern Western
relationships so uh I don't think it's
just based in the US in fact I've done a
number of consultations with folks in uh
Saudi Arabia and they say that it's it's
just feminism everywhere there and the
women want to be modern and liberated
and it's just like America according to
the men that
I've conversed
Caesar price 20 bucks thank you sir
Hello rzl Lord a making me blush I find
the Ador to be the best for me when I
implemented your advice okay I sto
focusing on women that look good and
just focusing on ones that want
me it pretty much take it or leave it
mindset yeah take it or leave it is a
really compelling sales attitude
like it's the the the sense that like
you're interested but not too interested
actually creates the conditions to be
one and that's part of the game of

[1:18:04]
one and that's part of the game of
dating and seduction there's a conquest
we think that it's men that always
conquer women but women conquer men all
the time probably more often to be
honest um and we can't conquer somebody
that just surrenders And We Just
Surrender when we say oh man I really
like you and anybody like you I I want
to date you I want to be in Rel
like that's just there's no Siege
there's no there's no Conquest there's
no glory there's no there's no nothing
to be gained so like the take it or
leave it creates the conditions to be
there's like win conditions now um and
potentially lose conditions which also
heighten this the sense of risk or
danger and motivate
action Diego Tapia Dr terban chapter
nine is fascinating oh yeah I love that
one that's my favorite chapter that's
one about love what key sources did you
use for love and romance historic
analysis did you explore other cultural
perspectives beyond the Western medieval
context great work um in the book in the

[1:19:02]
context great work um in the book in the
footnote I talk about the two
primary um sources that I used for my
analysis of romantic love so if you
listened on a on the audio book maybe
you didn't know that so those two
sources are Denny de rimon's love in the
Western World which is a very in my
opinion well researched
academic dissertation on the literary
and historical origins of
romance and the book we by the
psychoanalyst Robert Johnson which
examines the myth of Tristan and
isoldi through the lens of like a
jungian
analysis uh which make lays be the kind
of psychological truths that exists at
the heart of that myth so uh granted
those are um
both Western sources but I think my
argument is the the idea of romance as

[1:20:00]
argument is the the idea of romance as
we understand it it it is kind of
Western and it it did get more or less
exported around the world and cultures
that have less contact
with uh especially Christian
Traditions including and Islamic
Traditions which you know it's kind of a
evolution in in their teachings of um
Christianity uh they don't have that
same idea you go to you go to India you
go to Southeast Asia
um it's not saturated with romance it's
more saturated especially in East Asia
with Confucianism which has more to do
with like maint pract practicality and
maintaining Harmony in relationships as
opposed to like um this sort of like
spiritual um
righteous Destiny kind of a thing I
don't know that was right say um
okay promo MV MV thank you for your
donation I've been with my girlfriend
for 10 years she has gained 20 pounds

[1:21:00]
for 10 years she has gained 20 pounds
since I met her okay I can't enjoy sex
with her and I've tried everything but
nothing works I really love her but I'm
tired and I don't know what to
do well uh there's a few ways you can
approach that first uh I would encourage
you to if uh hopefully you're you're
keeping care of yourself and you're
working out and you're not overweight
yourself and invite her along with you
invite her to go for a run uh get her a
gym membership say it's something that
you can do together frame it as
something that's good for your
health um have it be something that you
can do as a couple and invite her into
that part of your life hopefully it will
take uh at a certain point though if it
is a deal breaker I would suggest that
you are honest and the way to have
difficult conversations with anyone is
to State the obvious emotional
consequence of the behavior like for
example if somebody's late all the time
or they're flaky the natural emtional
consequence is that you don't trust that
they're going to show up when they say

[1:22:00]
they're going to show up
like d obviously that is what is going
to come up in the people when you break
plans at the last minute and you're 30
minutes late Etc so you just sit down
and like hey you know I just want you
you're my friend I just want you to know
that like I'm I'm I'm noticing I'm
having I'm I'm hesitate I'm hesitating
making more plans with you because in
the past like half the time you canel
the plans last minute and so I kind of
feel like I can't really trust whether
you're going to keep the plans it's like
no [ __ ] um so like is this something
that we can we can potentially discuss
because like I don't want to feel like a
schmuck which is what I do when you
cancel plans the last minute um and it
makes me not want to make more plans
with you so it's like I don't know do
you not want to make plans with me is
this am I did I not get the message and
you kind of make it explicit and you you
don't like say you shouldn't you should
keep your word or it's I can't believe
that you would be so Shelf to do that
you don't you it's all about you like
there's nothing to argue about because
I'm talking about how I feel and it's

[1:23:00]
I'm talking about how I feel and it's
what anyone would feel so that's what I
would be in that situation it's like hey
sweetie you know you know I love you and
I care about you and I gotta be real
with you I'm having I'm not as sexually
attracted to you as I used to and I
think it's because you put on all this
weight and I'm struggling here I don't
know what to do because I care about you
but like I I I I miss this dimension of
our relationship and it's it's kind of
important to me and I've I've I've
noticed that I'm like paying more
attention to other
women
like my my my eyes are straying like duh
that's the natural human consequence if
you start to lose sexual attraction for
your partner you start to become more
sexually interested in other people and
it's like that might be the thing it's
like oh yeah okay this is actually
there's a consequence to this kind of a
thing and do I want to maintain my
partner's attraction I might have to
choose between you know the life of
comfort that facilitates the weight gain
and and uh the relationship and then
allow her to
choose chendo 1994 what is the best

[1:24:01]
choose chendo 1994 what is the best
place to find sexually conservative
socios sexually restricted women when
you aren't religious for something
long-term marriage
um if you aren't well religion would be
the best one uh other than that I would
say more like small town the cities it's
very hard to be have a conservative
upbringing in a major city in in small
towns and
in different parts of the country and
different parts of the
world they're they're going to have more
conservative values they're to be honest
they're probably going to be wrapped up
in in religiosity in most cases as well
but um that's where those folks tend to
live now of course it's hard to go there
because there's fewer people so they
have a smaller pool which is why they
those folks The Young Ones anyway tend
to migrate to the cities where they
often get um corrupted by the the city
influence over time but fortunately with

[1:25:02]
influence over time but fortunately with
the
international so you social media apps
and everyone's just in one big pond
these days you can you can target folks
geographically via social media so that
would be my suggestion Tiffany long be
question for humble pittance how do you
keep Grandpa Mouse satiated and valued
I don't I don't know what that's
supposed to mean is Grandpa
Mouse are are you like an older woman
and Grandpa Mouse is your uh your
husband I assume that's what you're
saying satiated and
valued well um let me tell you the best
the best hack I gave this to a woman
just uh today to especially to make an
older man feel valued is to ask his
advice like ask him for help
give him an opportunity to solve one of
your problems or to demonstrate that he
knows something about this and can teach

[1:26:00]
knows something about this and can teach
you
something like make him feel like his
competence and his experience are
worthwhile by creating an opportunity
for him to demonstrated
it okay nutrino Surfers thank you for
your donation hello sir could you
elaborate on how you fix your attention
to toxic
people despite my efforts I've been with
three relationship in a row with women
struggling addiction personality
disorders
yeah so if it's three in a row you like
I was saying earlier you might have to
look inside and be like well what
unhealed complimentary wounding inside
of me is leading me to get into
relationships with these types of women
I had that I talk about that on the
channel when I was younger I seemed to
have like a radar that could sense the
roller coasters the really
dramatic High passion But ultimately
chaotic and destructive women and
um I had to I had to come to the
conclusion it wasn't just that women
were crazy there was a craziness inside
of me that um I had to like address and

[1:27:00]
of me that um I had to like address and
heal so that my attraction organically G
began to shift and as I started to heal
that wound it didn't happen right away
it took about two years um and I slowly
went from being attracted to a certain
type of woman to being attracted to
stable emotionally available securely
attached women but two years ago I'd
have to pretend to be attracted to those
types of women you know what I'm saying
like I I could choose to be with them
but my I was like always leaning over
here so if you find yourself over and
over again in toxic relationships you
you have to look you're the common
denominator dude and that's good um
because that you might be able to look
inside and find something to learn about
yourself and about what you're doing to
attract these women or stay in those
relationships once the red flags become
apparent so keep yourself safe in the
future I know you can do it man
okay just a couple more thank you for
your patience Ace 7x thank you for

[1:28:01]
your patience Ace 7x thank you for
donation Orion you should travel to
Dubai and go on Mike thst's podcast
don't know who that is but I am
interested about Dubai because it just
seems like such a wild a wild place to
test some of my theories also some sorry
if someone asked this already but will
you write another book if so and what
funny you should ask that I am going to
be making an announcement very soon let
me just get through these other
questions and I'll table this to the end
Byron in thank you for your donation one
of my key takeaways from the book was
that you can either have more power in a
relationship or be more in love is this
a fair conclusion Kinda Yeah it's
like everything has a cost and one of
the
costs of being in love is
control like love is a roller coaster
man it's full of loopd loops and
disneying H and terrifying lows It's A
Thrill
Ride you
can't be on a roller coaster and drive

[1:29:01]
can't be on a roller coaster and drive
the roller coaster at the same time like
you get taken for a ride on a roller
coaster you strap yourself in you
surrender control and somebody else
drives it that's what makes it a Thrill
Ride if you were controlling it it
wouldn't be nearly as thrilling so one
of the costs of the in love that
limerance is control and generally the
one with more power has more control in
the relationship
so I would agree
LJ uh oh I talked about that one oh is
that everything excellent thank you so
no more questions because I don't want
to drag this on too long it's already
been an hour and a half so thank you so
much those are excellent questions today
it also came out pretty good um I hope
that was interesting to you so as I said
I have a couple of updates for you about
the future of the channel and also the
things that I'm going to be working on I
have two big projects that I'm going to
turn my attention to starting next week
actually the first is that I hope to

[1:30:00]
actually the first is that I hope to
launch a membersonly community very soon
in fact I hope to get it up and running
starting in
November and I'm very excited at the
prospect of what this community might be
able to offer I'm calling it the
Captain's Quarters to use the metaphor
of the Captain from my book and that we
discussed in today's Live cast so um the
Captain's Quarters will be my members
only
Community uh and there's going to be a
number of benefits associated with that
so besides access to an interactive
community of like-minded growth oriented
individuals you'll get a lot more access
to me so there will be bimonthly twice a
month group consultation calls not quite
like this in this kind of call you just
see and hear me right and we see the
chat on the side in these calls it's
going to be two-way I'm going to see you
you're going to be able to talk and

[1:31:01]
you're going to be able to talk and
we're going to be able to have more of a
dialogue
together um and they're going to be I
think an hour and a half long twice a
month which is going to be super cool
I'm excited about that because these
chats have been so much
fun uh I'm also going to bring back
guests like I did on my
Channel having the long form content was
bad for the algorithm so I stopped stop
doing it but I would love to continue to
have discussions with interesting people
and to give the members an opportunity
to ask them questions and pick their
brains for their experience and
expertise so they'll have access to that
kind of exclusive
content and some other things like
discounts on uh one-on-one consultations
and things like that so uh there's
obviously a lot that I have to do to
kind of get that up and running I have
to build the platform but that's what we
are looking at for the for able
future um so that's exciting thing
number

[1:32:00]
number
one uh exciting thing number two is I am
starting my next book I couldn't stay
away apparently that hasn't even been
three months since the publication of
the value of others and I'm already
itching at to get started on the next
one I have a I have an idea it's G to
it's going to be a very different book
so like I said this was sort of like my
Flagship book I hope it's relevant 100
years from now it's my best possible
argument for kind of some highle
Concepts the book I'm imagining is going
to be half as long and is going to
be more accessible and more U
aspirational it's going to be less about
the nitty-gritty economics of
relationships and more about how to
become a Captain so it's going to be
again using that metaphor and expanding
on that in a way that hopefully all
people can resonate with so I'm really
excited about that I can't wait to get

[1:33:01]
excited about that I can't wait to get
started and I hope to have more updates
for you on both of those on this channel
in the coming
weeks so that's what I got for you looks
like there was another one here Antonio
nutrition just to thank you because
you're awesome and genuine please do sit
down with Dr Jordan Peterson one day I'd
love to would be amazing thank you for
your thoughtful intellect oh yeah I'd
love to talk to to Jordan Peterson uh
I've noticed it doesn't really work when
I invite myself on people's channels and
uh I'm sure this is no exception so if
you do want to see a conversation
between me and Dr Peterson or anybody
else the best thing to do to support
that happening is to reach out to those
platforms and say hey I'd really like
you to interview this guy if you haven't
heard about him and so that their team
can extend an invitation to me that's
that's generally how this happens
inviting yourself in the podcast World
goes about as well as inviting yourself

[1:34:00]
goes about as well as inviting yourself
to somebody else's birthday party it's
like don't go if you're not
invited um and uh I am confident that
more invitations are going to be coming
in I have several more um appearances
lined up uh for Q4 so thank you so much
for tuning in I hope this was
interesting for you guys and please stay
tuned for updates about the community
and the book all right I'm going to sign
off thanks for joining me byebye
