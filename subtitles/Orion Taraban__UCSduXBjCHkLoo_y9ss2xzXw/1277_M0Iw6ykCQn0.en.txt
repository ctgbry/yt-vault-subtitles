Marriage has become a very problematic
construct. I believe it certainly
doesn't have a very high success rate.
Not one that would make any thinking
person enthusiastic about the idea. And
one of the reasons why I think that is
is because we want it to be too many
things. The fact that we want love as
well. We want passionate sex. We want a
legal commitment that includes resource
sharing that we want uh a big princess
festival and a that costs 50 or
$100,000. Um we want to be best friends.
It's like all the that you hear in
modern wedding. It's like oh boy. It's
so hard to find one person who can do
even two of those things very well, let
alone eight. But so far it's like that's
what marriage is. take it or leave it.
And a lot of people are saying, well, it
I'm I'm leaving it. But I do think that
we can be more intentional and conscious
about, well, maybe we marriage doesn't
have to be all those things for us.
Maybe we can get some of those needs met
outside of our relationships, which is

[01:01]
outside of our relationships, which is
basically how humans have lived. They've
lived in small communities or tribes for
hundreds of thousands of years in
extended kin networks.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so people had all kinds of
soft relationships.
