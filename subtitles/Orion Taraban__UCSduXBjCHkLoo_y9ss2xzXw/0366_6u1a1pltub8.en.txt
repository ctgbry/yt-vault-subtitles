it is not easy to make friends as an
adult but it is possible the easiest way
to do this is to enroll yourself in some
kind of certification program could be a
100 hour yoga teacher training course or
some sort of leadership development
program it doesn't really matter you
should pick something that you're at
least somewhat interested in though
because you will have to spend some time
within that milieu now this is important
for a couple of reasons one is the fact
that there's some sort of certification
at the end of the process will
incentivize people to make a consistent
presence in this context and you need to
see people repeatedly in order to have
and develop relationships with them
secondly the fastest way to accelerate
intimacy is to undergo shared difficulty
and that's precisely what you'll be
doing when you're undergoing a course of
study under an abbreviated duration of
time it will be stressful you'll be
completing assigns together and that
tends to bring folks together
