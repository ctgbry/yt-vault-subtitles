I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why some
people get so upset with my content so
this episode was actually requested by
many of my followers following some of
my recent media appearances now I've
been doing this now for about 3 years
and I would say that the response to my
content on the whole has been
extremely positive like 99 9% positive
which is a joy and an honor that said
about 1% of the feedback I received from
folks is extremely negative and this
feedback always pertains to my views on
intersexual Dynamics and the game of
mating and dating and today I'm going to
discuss why this is the case in the
first place it's important to appreciate
that virtually none of this negative
feedback is substantive like it almost

[01:00]
feedback is substantive like it almost
never pertains to any of my arguments
rather it almost entirely consists of
insults defamation and AD homonym
attacks which frankly is why it's
difficult to take this feedback
seriously and why it doesn't really
bother me to me there is no more obvious
confession that someone has lost an
argument than resorting to ad homonyms
this is because if my attackers could
Pro prove me wrong I have to assume that
they would at least try to do so as that
would be a much greater victory for them
so I just hear those attacks as
Declarations of surrender responding to
them at face value would be tant amount
to kicking someone when they're down
that said they do constitute a
fascinating phenomenon so what's really
going on here what you have to
understand is that most people aren't
very

[02:00]
very
self-aware and a lot of what I talk
about actually takes place beneath the
threshold of awareness for instance it's
absolutely true that relationships are
the medium through which value is
transacted and that people tend to enter
into relationships where they most stand
to gain or stand least to lose the issue
is that the perception of value and gain
and loss is actually dependent on a very
complex covert calculus of which most
people are almost entirely unaware and
this calculus consists of an uncountable
number of micro evaluations that
accumulate into a judgment of
attractiveness these evaluations occur
in the context of your memory and past
relationships and in the context of your
goals and future plans and in the
context of your own self-evaluation and
self-image they predict whether another
person can give you what you want and if
if they can whether they will be willing

[03:01]
if they can whether they will be willing
to give it to you they evaluate Global
personality traits like character and
more circumscribed attributes like
loyalty or sexiness or sense of humor
that are weighted given their relative
importance and relevance to the
evaluator and they also estimate the
costs the evaluator expects to incur in
the procurement and maintenance of the
relationship both in terms of the actual
expenditure of resources and in terms of
foregone reproductive opportunities and
all of this occurs beneath the threshold
of awareness in large part very few
people very few people are going to
consciously think to themselves I've
decided to enter into a relationship
with this person because I believe it
will be a net gain for me in that the
benefits I expect to receive will
significantly exceed the costs
associated with acquiring them like that
sounds cold calculating and
inhuman but if we were to pop the hood
and examine the components of a person's

[04:00]
and examine the components of a person's
decision this is what we would find it
sounds psychotic to verbalize but it
accurately reflects what's going on
beneath the surface so what happens in
the vast majority of cases is that the
final calculation gets transmuted into a
feeling for instance when this covert
calculus predicts that the value of a
certain relationship is going to
significantly exceed its costs people
don't think to themselves this is a
beneficial transaction for me
they think I'm pretty excited about this
person she's great I think she might be
a keeper on the other hand when the
calculus predicts that the value of a
relationship is not going to
significantly exceed its costs people
don't think to themselves this is a wash
and there a loss to me as it it is
preventing me from entering into more
personally beneficial
transactions they think you know she's a
she's a really nice girl but I feel like
something is missing or

[05:00]
something is missing or
I'm just not sure I guess I could make
it work and of course when the calculus
predicts that the costs of a
relationship will significantly exceed
its value people don't think the
benefits I receive in this transaction
do not justify its expense they think
oh not if you were the last man on Earth
or I think of us more as friends what
happens is that this value calculation
gets transmuted into an emotion
which motivates people to either
approach and invest or withdraw and
avoid people are aware of this emotion
but not what aroused the emotion most of
the time that isn't an issue however if
you want to understand how people
actually make decisions you have to hack
into this deeper process now before I go
any further if you're liking what you're

Stellar
g.com okay let's get back to it now I
guarantee I guarantee that people enter
into relationships with their perceived
best options like it wouldn't make sense
to argue that people would forgo a
better opportunity for a worse one our
genetic line would likely have stopped
ages ago if that were the case so if
people enter into relationships with
their perceived best options then the
perception of value is at the heart of
why people enter into
relationships it's also sufficient to
explain a great deal of behavior
especially a great deal of the bad

[07:00]
especially a great deal of the bad
behavior in the sexual Marketplace
everything from divorce and monkey
branching to ghosting and
infidelity now the folks who are
critical of the economic model of
relationships they still make decisions
every day about who they spend their
time with and with whom they enter into
relationships and these decisions are
predicated on the perception of value
but here's the thing many of the things
that people value are not socially
acceptable
or politically correct for instance
there are plenty of men who married the
hottest woman they could get that's it
that was the primary
Criterion and there are many women who
married because they were afraid that
they'd end up alone if they didn't like
they didn't really like the guy or
certainly not love him they just were
afraid and that's what motivated them to
enter into that relationship so people
hide these reasons almost always from
other people but very often from

[08:01]
other people but very often from
themselves a lot of people haven't done
the work to integrate the socially
unacceptable parts of themselves
especially given our current topic of
discussion their
superficiality and their selfishness
they would like to believe that these
parts don't exist inside of them which
just isn't true however in the absence
of integration they can really only deny
and disavow these aspects of their
personality this makes it
likely uh that they won't come into
emotional contact with these distressing
parts of themselves but it doesn't
actually neutralize the negativity which
is really only possible through
integration Instead This disavowed
negativity gets projected onto other
people who are abstracted and
dehumanized to facilitate the projection
hence the adamms and the insults the
tragic misunderstanding occurs when
people attempt to eradicate their own

[09:00]
people attempt to eradicate their own
projected negativity or Evil by
destroying the person on whom the
negativity or evil was projected such
people attempt to purge their own
darkness by cleansing the world of
anything that reminds them of the
disavowed portions of
themselves of course this never ever
Works which is why this ignorance is
directly responsible for a great deal of
the unnecessary pain and suffering that
exists in this world and here's one
final thought we can use the economic
model to predict what demographic of
people is most likely to take issue with
the economic model think about it if
relationships ultimately are
transactional who do you think would be
most opposed to this knowledge becoming
more widely known qu Bono those who
typically benefit less from a mystified
transaction or those who typically

[10:00]
transaction or those who typically
benefit
more without a doubt it would be those
who benefit more who would take issue
and who typically benefits more from a
relationship according to the economic
model women whereas women mate and date
for gain men must resign themselves to
mate and date for acceptable loss
however not all women benefit from
relationships equally what subsection of
women typically benefits the most
according to the economic
model older women older women are very
very expensive for instance a
50-year-old woman no longer has any
direct reproductive value and she likely
has finished raising any children she
did have she will also have become
significantly less attractive as a
sexual partner as she ages many of the
goods for which men transacted their
commitment will have ended by this time
however men are still expected to
provide Prov en visioning and resources

[11:00]
provide Prov en visioning and resources
and exclusive commitment to these women
for the rest of their lives you might
argue that this is due recompense for
what these women did in the past but
those men probably did a lot in the past
too the upshot is that men are expected
to pay the same price for a depreciating
reproductive opportunity which
functionally renders that opportunity
increasingly expensive as a function of
time so we can predict that the most
aggressive opposition to the economic
model of relationships will come from
older women precisely because older
women stand to lose the most if this
idea were more widely known and if You
observe who responds most obstreperously
to my ideas online you will find that
this is exactly what happens what do you
