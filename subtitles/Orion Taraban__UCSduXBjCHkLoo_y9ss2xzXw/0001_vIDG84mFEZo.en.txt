i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is be the person that you can love
so i talk to a lot of folks in my
clinical practice and
they often feel in the core of their
their being
that they're not enough that they're
insufficient or that they're
unlovable for some reason and that's
obviously inherently painful and it
causes them to go out in the world and
try to prove
to themselves through other people that
they are enough
and they try to substitute let's say the
approval or the respect
or the recognition of other people
to fill in that hole inside of their own
heart
that says that they're actually not
enough and this is
this is a losing game i've discovered
that you can't
solve internal problems with external
solutions and
vice versa it's like square peg round
hole so
we want to heal that wound directly that

[01:01]
we want to heal that wound directly that
says that i'm not enough
that i'm unlovable nobody likes me or
respects me
and the solution to that is to be the
person
that you can love so do some
visualization it's like
what do you look like what kinds of
things are you doing what's your job
where are you living who are you
associating with
that's the person that you could be
maybe not
in six weeks or six months but maybe in
six years you could be that person or at
least you can make significant progress
towards approximating that person and
that's kind of the art of life
where we take on this role of creator
and
you know our own our own bodies and
minds are the
the medium for that artistry is that we
can transform and create ourselves
in line with our vision of who we want
to be
and the idea here is to choose a vision
of ourselves it's not based on what we
think that we should be or what our

[02:01]
think that we should be or what our
parents think we should be or what our
society thinks that we should be
but who we would
actually authentically legitimately love
and respect
it's very hard to love and respect
yourself if you're not doing anything
lovable or respectable
so that's kind of that's kind of it
first stop doing the things
that make you feel ashamed or
pathetic and start doing the things that
yourself can love and admire and respect
so this generally means some kind of
goal attainment or achievement
so get busy doing things generally
challenging things that you can
appropriately overcome so you can say
wow um i did that and i can actually
feel proud of myself for having done
that
i've never run a marathon for example
but i know that it would take
six months of training it would be very
painful i'd have to overcome the obvious
discomfort and difficulty with this
the day of the marathon my shoes might

[03:01]
the day of the marathon my shoes might
fill with blood i want to give up
there's a stitch in the side and if i
don't quit and i actually quit i
finished
across that finish line i'm going to
feel legitimately proud of what i was
able to accomplish
and you chain enough of those things
into your life
and you become somebody that you can
respect
and the whole problem of getting other
people to acknowledge that it sort of
disappears
because the internal problem has
resolved itself with an internal
solution
so the seeking after the external
solution it becomes redundant and
irrelevant
okay that's my thoughts on the matter

more in future episodes
