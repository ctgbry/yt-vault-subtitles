just like women are disincentivized from
opening the gate of sex to everybody and
anybody who wants it Men Are
disincentivized from opening the gate of
commitment to anybody and everybody who
wants that women what's going to open
that gate is not you standing outside
declaring that you're looking for a
serious relationship that is like a
Salesman knocking on your door and
saying Hey I want to make some money
here open up both are entering the
interaction exclusively focused on what
they want I want to make some money I
want a committed relationship let me in
so how does a Salesman actually get you
to engage by offering something that the
other person might want and with respect
to relationships between men and women
it's safe to assume that something the
other person might want is sex if a
woman stands in front of a man's gate
and instead offers a sexual opportunity
it will significantly increase the
likelihood that he will open it up and
invite her in that's why I say this is
the Trojan Horse of getting a committed
relationship
