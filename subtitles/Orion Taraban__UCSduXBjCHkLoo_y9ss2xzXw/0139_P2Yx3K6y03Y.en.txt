i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
have to
versus
choose to
so this phrase have to is one that i've
tried my best to
excise from my vocabulary
this is because i discovered that when i
believe that i have to do something
whatever that something is becomes
onerous aversive and unpleasant
it's like in high school when i was
assigned some of the classics of english
literature
if i had spontaneously chosen to read
those books on my own i probably would
have enjoyed them much more than i did
reading them under duress
my enjoyment had more to do with the
attitude with which i was approaching
that assignment than it did with the
actual books themselves
maybe you can relate
the fact of the matter is that there are
very few things in life that we have to
do
usually when we think we have to do
something what we really mean is that we

[01:01]
something what we really mean is that we
would prefer not to experience the
consequences of not doing it but that is
always an option for us
whenever i catch myself using this
phrase i have to
i try to replace it with the phrase i
choose to
and to do this i have to connect the
duty responsibility or assignment
to my own personally relevant goals
it's a small change but it's a powerful
one
for instance it's not so much that i
have to read this book because my
teacher told me to
it's that i choose to read this book
because it it's a means to get what i
want
a desired degree which will further my
career
it's not so much that i have to pay my
taxes
no i don't i can go to prison
so when i catch myself complaining that
i have to pay my taxes for instance i
reformulate that thought to be that i'm
choosing to avoid a prison sentence
and if it costs me x amount of dollars
to avoid that outcome i'm going to do so

[02:01]
to avoid that outcome i'm going to do so
with alacrity my freedom is worth much
more than that amount of money so i'm
actually getting the better deal here
performing this cognitive kung fu
requires a bit of mental discipline
but try replacing the phrase have to
with choose to and see how this impacts
how you show up to your own lived
experience
have you tried this out what's your
experience
