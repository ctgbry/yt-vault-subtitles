on some level it's never been easier in
the history of the world to have direct
access to more potential mates than it
is today you just switch on the magic
rectangle you carry around in your
pocket and boom you instantly have
access to thousands of single and not so
single people in your area ostensibly
looking for love in fact we've seen a
dramatic uptick in the proportion of
couples who met online in the past
decade 10 years ago about 20% of
American couples met online now it's
around 50% however across that same time
period we've seen an equally dramatic
downturn in the frequency of all kinds
of sexual relationships over the past
decade fewer people are getting married
fewer people are getting into
relationships and surprisingly fewer
people are even hooking up some of these
numbers are at historically
unprecedented lows so while it's only a
correlative finding it's highly
suggestive the more people rely on
dating apps for sexual relationships of
all kinds the fewer sexual relationships
are actually transacted
