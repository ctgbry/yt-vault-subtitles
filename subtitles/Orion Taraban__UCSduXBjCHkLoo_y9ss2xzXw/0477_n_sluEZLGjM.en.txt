pain is the universe giving you feedback
that you need to pay attention to a
particular aspect of your life because
pain is a signal that your model of
reality is incorrect and pain is your
opportunity to bring that model into
closer Conformity with the way things
really are if you can alter your
relationship with pain you will
accelerate your self-development 100
fold so what prevents people from using
the opportunity inherent in pain well
there are many potential obstructions
but three principal ones the first
principle obstruction is that some
people are so stubborn or arrogant or
ideologically possessed that they double
down on their incorrect version of
reality they continue to believe that
their right despite their pain they hold
on to the belief that the way they think
things should be is how reality should
in fact operate so arrogance and
ideological possession can prevent
people from entering into this
opportunity
