Imagine you and I are having a friendly
conversation. I'm currently unemployed
and looking for work. And when out of
your concern you ask me how things are
going, I respond, "Not great, man. I
mean, all I want is a high-paying, low
stress, personally rewarding job." Like,
is that really too much to ask? That's
just three things.
Why is it so hard to find? How much
sympathy would you have for me at that
point? Only one person in a million has
a highpaying, low stress, personally
rewarding job. Like, for all intents and
purposes, those jobs do not exist, and
they're certainly not advertised. If a
job is highaying and personally
rewarding, it's going to be stressful. A
lot of people are going to have high
expectations about your performance. If
it's high-paying and low stress, it's
not going to be personally rewarding. No
one dreams about flipping luxury goods
in geo arbitrageed markets when they
grow up. And if it's low stress and

grow up. And if it's low stress and
personally rewarding, it's not going to
be highpaying. You're not going to pull
in six figures working for Habitat for
Humanity. In a job, people are extremely
fortunate to get two things that they
want, but when it comes to their sexual
relationships, they somehow have no
problem demanding 20. This is insane. As
I discuss in my book, and is expensive.
It is a statistical inevitability. Every
time you say and, you're multiplying
probabilities, which according to the
immutable laws of mathematics makes the
product smaller. And when something is
rarer, it tends to be more expensive to
find and more expensive to
