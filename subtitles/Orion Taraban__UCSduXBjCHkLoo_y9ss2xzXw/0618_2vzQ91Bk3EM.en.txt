now you might think well Orion what's
the problem with that what's the problem
with more new medicines to treat new
problems as we discover them and I would
respond are we discovering them or are
we creating them remember according to
the psychiatrists themselves there is no
conclusive diagnostic assessment for any
one of their mental disorders so how can
you really prove that a drug is
effective in treating a disorder when
you can't even prove that the disorder
objectively exists in the first place
and if objective corroboration of any
new disorder is unnecessary then we're
basically now in the realm of metap
physics we're arguing functionally how
many angels can fit on the head of a pin
it used to be two now it's 300 and I
guarantee we'll find more ways to fit
even more angels on that pin with each
passing year because why not since their
relationship with objective reality is
tenuous already we can continue to split
the categories even finer that way the
new conceptualizations can be
medicalized and a new pharmaceutical
solution for that conceptualization can
be brought to market after all it
doesn't really work if you sell the
solution and then create the problem
does it
