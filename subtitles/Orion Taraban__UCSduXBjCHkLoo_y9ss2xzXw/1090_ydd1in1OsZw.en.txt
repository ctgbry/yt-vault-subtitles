I know it's kind of a controversial
concept. Some people think that it
exists. Some people think that it's been
disproven, but it's called the dual
mating strategy in women, which
basically suggests possibly it would be
great if women could get really good
genes and good security, resources,
protection, and provision from their
mate. But the likelihood that all of
those things are going to be in one male
is very low. So the dual mating strategy
basically says that it might be in
women's best interest or female's best
interest more generally to kind of like
enter into a committed relationship with
a male with status and and resources
who's willing to kind of commit to her
but maybe surreptitiously reproduce with
a different male that has better genes.
You know on the internet they call it
alpha and beta bucks as it were.
So it's like and this is corroborated in
some studies that suggest that when a
woman is in the ovulatory phase of her

woman is in the ovulatory phase of her
cycle, she is more likely to cheat or at
least consider cheating, I think is what
the research finding um showed
technically. There's also studies that
asked women to like smell shirts worn by
different types of men and they found
the scent on shirts worn by more
masculine men to be more yummy smelling
when they were ovulating. So there does
seem to be this like hormonally based or
driven tendency to seek out riskier more
masculine sexual opportunities. But then
that changes once they enter into the
you know they start to menstruate or
then the lutininal phase. So like
women's preferences do change as a as a
consequence of the chemicals that are
flooding through their body. would kind
of make sense.
