i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
be afraid of your fear
that is be more afraid of the fact that
you are afraid than of anything you
might be afraid of
by using fear in this way you can
harness a powerful motivator for
constructive behavioral change
so i'll tell you a little story
many years ago i wanted to overcome my
approach anxiety
i wanted to be able to go up to the
attractive women that i saw on the
streets or in the bars and strike up a
conversation with them to get their
phone numbers and ask them out
the problem was of course that when i
saw an attractive woman i would get
anxious hesitate in my approach and get
two in my head
usually what would end up happening was
that i would leave without saying
anything
and that would generally cause me to
feel very schmucky about myself
and even when i set the intention to
overcome this approach anxiety this
would continue to happen

[01:00]
would continue to happen
i'd put on my suit get all hyped up and
go out to bars with the express
objective of picking up women however
when i got there i couldn't screw up the
courage to talk to a single one
i'd spend two three hours in a bar
and then go home feeling like a schmuck
this happened five six seven times with
the exact same outcome and i ended up
feeling so
pathetic
i'd be back at home alone
lonely and beating myself up for being
such a coward
and every time this happened i would
feel a little worse than the time before
but i didn't give up
now at some point maybe it was the
eighth or ninth time we're going out
something changed
i was at a bar and i saw an attractive
woman and i felt an authentic desire to
approach her so far so good
and then suddenly instead of the usual
self-consciousness that would arise at
this point what came into my mind very
clearly
was everything that happens when i don't
approach
the self-pity the loneliness the

[02:02]
the self-pity the loneliness the
cowardice the frustration the despair
i knew for sure
that if i were to succumb to my fear in
that moment that that is what was in
store for me i knew that with 100
certainty because it had already
happened nine times in a row why would
the tenth time be any different
and i began to feel afraid of that
outcome
i began to fear feeling like a schmuck
this was interesting because fear
contains a behavioral impulse to avoid
but by becoming afraid of the outcome
associated with my avoidance i was
functionally avoiding avoidance
if i approached the woman
i didn't know what was going to happen i
didn't know if she was going to like me
maybe she'd laugh or throw her drink in
my face but i knew for sure what was
going to happen if i didn't approach her
at that moment i became more afraid of
that inevitability than of anything that

[03:00]
that inevitability than of anything that
woman could possibly have said or done
to me and that is how i began to get
over my approach anxiety i had to have a
very specific personal and powerful
aversion to doing
nothing
it's not that women became any less
scary at that point
but rather that i became aware of
something even scarier by comparison
and i think this is generalizable to do
something scary you kind of have to be
even more afraid of not doing it the
consequences and meanings associated
with not doing it and the way to figure
out what those are is to not do it and
pay attention to how your aversion makes
you feel
this will give you something to turn
away from when the time is right and it
turns out i've never had a woman so much
as roller eyes at me let alone throw a
drink in my face
of course i've been turned down a bunch
of times but that really isn't that bad
in fact i can say with confidence that

[04:01]
in fact i can say with confidence that
being rejected feels significantly less
bad than feeling like a schmuck
i just had to get on the right side of
fear
