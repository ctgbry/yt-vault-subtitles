I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is what
should I do with my life so this is a
question that explicitly or implicitly
underlies much of my work with young men
and today I'm going to share some
perspectives on both how to approach and
how not to approach an answer to this
question these are lessons I've learned
the hard way through my own personal
experience and subsequently refined in
working with thousands of men let's get
to it so here's the thing being a young
man is extremely difficult and Society
does not acknowledge that reality at all
you're unattractive to women because you
don't have the things that women want
you don't yet have status wealth
emotional maturity decent housing or an
emotionally compelling lifestyle unless
you're a musician or something and most
girls go through a musician phase before
realizing that they're definitely not

[01:00]
realizing that they're definitely not
looking for a musician by the same token
you're also useless to men because you
can't really help them achieve their
goals you don't yet have experience
skills knowledge resources or a social
network worth noting you're a liability
you're not really able to help you can
only be helped so it takes a while to
find your way as a young man and very
few people are really going to help you
with this process because doing so would
require they spend time energy and money
and you may not yet have anything other
people want in exchange for their
troubles there are many ways to go and
little to no assistance forthcoming and
since we're talking about your life the
stakes are indeed High what should you
in fact
do well I can tell you that the absolute
worst way to approach this question of
what you should do with your life is to
sit in your room and think about it that

[02:02]
sit in your room and think about it that
does not work I call this strategy
playing mental chess or chessing for
short when people chess they sit in
their rooms and consider hundreds or
thousands of hypothetical scenarios in
the privacy of their Consciousness at
first blush this may seem like a useful
adaptation after all isn't it better to
fail or worse in your imagination than
in reality doesn't this allow people to
live a multitude of simulated lives and
choose the best one not really thinking
about what you should do with your life
as a young man is kind of like playing a
game of chess in your mind 50 moves out
before you've even made your opener it
is absurd like the likelihood that the
game will actually transact along those
lines is a trillion to one the
probability is so infinitesimally small
it's literally not worth expending the
calories to think about you could spend

[03:00]
calories to think about you could spend
hours days weeks or even months
visualizing the game unfolding along
certain lines and the first move your
opponent makes invalidates the entire
effort so it's a silly thing to do it's
also silly because frankly you don't
really know who you are yet I mean
you're not even done physically maturing
until you're 25 and it can take much
longer to mature emotionally and
psychologically you might think you know
who you are and you probably do if
you're in your early 20s but that might
not actually Accord with who you truly
are so sitting in your room and chessing
out your future and the privacy of your
Consciousness means that you're actually
making hypothetical decisions based on
who you think you are or who you'd like
to be and the chances are good that
these decisions will not align perfectly
or even mostly with the reality of who
you really are so not only is it not
like good hypothetic iCal planning it

[04:00]
like good hypothetic iCal planning it
can't be good hypothetical planning

definition now before I go any further

you very much now chess is interesting
there have been many studies examining
Mastery in the context of Chess and it
turns out that contrary to popular
belief Chess Masters actually don't
think significantly more moves ahead
than the average player most are only
thinking two or three moves in advance
Master chess players differentiate
themselves from average players in two
main ways by identifying poor moves
quickly and reliably thereby reducing

[05:02]
quickly and reliably thereby reducing
the total move set under consideration
to just a few plausible contenders and
by recognizing patterns more quickly and
with less information thereby activating
previously Consolidated move sequences
and of course they're able to do both
because they've played thousands and
thousands and thousands of games the
same is basically true of life you can't
figure out who you you can't figure out
what you should do with your life just
sitting in your room because we only
really learn Who We Are by examining the
choices that we make as we move through
life and the longer you sit in your room
and ruminate the longer you're depriving
yourself of this precious data about who
you actually are fortunately there are
very few decisions in life that have
really long lasting consequences these
include things like the decision to have
children or get married so leaving these
aside most decisions can be easily

[06:01]
aside most decisions can be easily
course corrected as you receive feedback
as a consequence of your initial
decision like if you were to leave your
house and realize that you set off in
the wrong direction you wouldn't like
keep going around the world until you
arrive back at your starting point you
just turn around and in the vast
majority of cases it's actually much
easier to just turn around than most
people believe so to figure out who you
are you need to move out into the world
and start making decisions enter into a
period of exploration and
experimentation your 20s are like a
buffet when you go to a buffet you don't
just load up on the first things that
you see you kind of take a little bit of
everything you nibble on this you nibble
on that sometimes your expectations are
confirmed and a lot of times they're not
but in all cases you now have much
better insight into where to go back for
seconds the idea here is to put yourself
in situations and check in with how you

[07:00]
in situations and check in with how you
feel as a consequence of that decision
your feeling is the important data point
if you feel mostly good you may only
need to tweak your heading a little bit
as you continue in the same general
direction and if it feels bad and I mean
bad in the sense of it makes you feel
weak or ashamed or aggravated not in the
sense that it's hard or difficult you
may need to quit and move in a different
direction contrary to popular belief
quitting is not a problem as I've
previously discussed winners almost
always quit they quit everything except
the thing they choose to master and they
do this because it takes a significant
amount of focus effort and resources to
actually arrive at Mastery very very few
people can be Masters in multiple
domains so you'll want to choose that
one thing very carefully because a
mismatch between who you actually are
and the reality-based demands of Master
in a particular field will have

[08:01]
in a particular field will have
significant Downstream consequences hard
work will often Trump Talent without
effort but you really need both to
succeed at the highest levels so get out
there and start making choices the
feedback from your decisions will reveal
who you are to yourself and if you pay
attention to that feedback you'll begin
to accumulate accurate self- knowledge
and this is very useful because accurate
self- knowledge accelerates this whole
process considerably moving forward you
won't have to conduct more or less
random experiments with respect to your
choices and you'll be better able to
reliably determine which options are
most likely to provide goodness of fit
with your actual personality and this
process becomes like
exponential with more data and accurate
Insight now here's the payoff after
you've made a few thousand decisions and
after you've changed Direction and
you've course corrected and after you've

[09:00]
you've course corrected and after you've
improved your capacity for self-
knowledge and after some years have
passed then then you'll be in a position
to answer the question of what you
should do with your life by looking back
and seeing what you've chosen to do with
it your path in life is the one under
your
feet and so your path in life is only
revealed in the
walking you cannot determine this in
advance of the
journey you can only recognize it after
you've made some progress along the way
and hopefully at the end of those
decisions you'll be able to look back on
your life without regret because you've
used your limited time
