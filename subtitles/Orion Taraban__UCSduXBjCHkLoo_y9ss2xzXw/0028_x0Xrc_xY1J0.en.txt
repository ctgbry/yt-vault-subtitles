i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is should and anger
generally behind most angry emotions
is a thought that contains the concept
of should
something like i shouldn't have to deal
with this or
this person should have known better and
these thoughts
can be very dangerous it's not really
possible to think these thoughts give
them attention
validate them with belief and not feel
angry
so i'd like you to consider that
thoughts like these are really
anger pathogens they're what create
the i the issue is that when people use
the concept of
should in this way they're really using
it incorrectly
and that incorrect usage is what
contributes to the emotional suffering
the incorrect use of the word should is
anything
that suggests that reality has a moral
or ethical

[01:00]
or ethical
obligation to be anything other than
what it actually is
that it has a moral or ethical
obligation to be aligned with what
they believe reality should be thinking
in this manner is just
asking to be outraged there is also
really no basis for such beliefs
i mean where is it written that reality
must align with our own hopes and
desires
however virtuous and noble those hopes
and desires might be
that's not really how things work on
this planet
alternatively a better use of the word
should
is as a kind of shorthand for given the
confluence of factors that are exerting
themselves on a given situation
the most likely outcome is so that's a
bit of a mouthful so i'll say it again
a better use of the word should is as a
kind of
shorthand for given the confluence of
factors that are exerting themselves
on a given situation the most likely
outcome is
so for example if i were to go up to the
roof of my house

[02:00]
roof of my house
and i were to drop a glass bottle from
that height it should break when it hits
the ground
that is due to the force generated by
the rapid deceleration when the bottle
comes into contact with the ground and
the structural integrity of the bonds
between the molecules comprising the
glass and several other factors
the most likely outcome is that the
bottle breaks as a result of that
collision
if it breaks it should have broken
if for some reason it doesn't break it
shouldn't have broken
because apparently the forces exerted on
that bottle were not sufficient to cause
that to happen
everything is as it should be
so you'll notice instead of starting
with our ideals
and trying to impose them on reality and
getting angry when there's a lack of
alignment between how things are and how
we want them to be
we start with reality and allow reality
to dictate our models of
and beliefs about the way things should
be this attitude is actually very
scientific rather than attempting to
force reality into a pre-existing
framework

[03:00]
framework
we can functionally go to reality and
say teach me
help me understand why this happened the
way that it did
through an examination of the forces
that conspired to create this outcome
as surprising or personally distasteful
this outcome happens to be for me teach
me
and if i were to continue to stubbornly
insist
that this shouldn't have happened or
people should behave in a certain way
then i'm turning a willfully blind eye
to the reasons why reality is the way
that it is
which actually robs me of the
opportunity to grow into greater
alignment with those forces for my own
betterment
the more i listen to reality the more i
can build
accurate representations of reality with
my words and beliefs
which in turn will help me stay safe and
get what i want
moving forward hopefully that was
helpful
