Women only want to be able to leave the
workforce if and when it suits them
personally, which unfortunately makes it
next to impossible for this to occur as
a practical reality. Why? This option is
really only possible if her partner is
already a significantly above average
earner. And this is part of what is
driving the outofont control hypergamy
of modern mate selection. For instance,
about 1 in6 American women today earn
over $100,000 a year that supports a
$100,000 a year lifestyle for herself.
As a result, she's going to be very
reluctant to start a family and raise
children with a man who only earns
$100,000 a year himself. Why? Well,
assuming it costs at least $20,000 a
year to raise a child, then that would
mean such a man could only provide a
$40,000 a year lifestyle for the two

$40,000 a year lifestyle for the two
adults, which is a significant drop
relative to the lifestyle to which she
had become accustomed. To experience no
change in her lifestyle, she would need
to hook a man who earned at least
$220,000
a year in this scenario. And only about
1 in 30 American men today earn above
that threshold. One in 30 to one in six.
That's a 5:1 ratio.
