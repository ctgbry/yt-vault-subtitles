You know, in your experience with women,
can they maintain the level of sexual
intimacy that they began the
relationship with or do they tend to
drop? Is that universal? Because
sometimes I'll meet men that leave their
wives because there was no intimacy.
Meet a younger, hotter girl and after a
year or two there's no intimacy again.
So, I'm just almost like, is this just
something that they have to accept that
the intimacy decreases at any stage with
a woman? Well, I do think that we very
rarely see frequency of sex go up as a
function of time. So, I do think that
there's probably a natural decline. Mhm.
The question is like how steep of a drop
off over what timeline? And I do think
that it's happening way too fast. Like
it shouldn't fade away after 2 or 3 or 5
years. And I think there are reasons for
that. I don't think it's committing. I
don't think it's even marriage. I don't
think it's it's children. I think it's
cohabitation more than anything else.
Just living together. Yes. Um because I
think we've prioritize Esther Pel makes
this argument basically in mating in
captivity that in all of our western
relationship templates we've prioritized

relationship templates we've prioritized
safety and security over passion, sex,
and enthusiasm, right? So everything
that's good for safety and security is
kind of bad for passion and sex and vice
versa. So, we've just choked out the
passion and the desire in our
unrelenting prioritization of safety and
security. And I think that one thing
that makes sex more likely to happen is
space. Is space is like is to sex what
oxygen is to fire. Like you need it.
It's a combustible element. And when
people are living together, they have
constant lowgrade interactions. You can
walk into a room and not even
acknowledge the other person.
