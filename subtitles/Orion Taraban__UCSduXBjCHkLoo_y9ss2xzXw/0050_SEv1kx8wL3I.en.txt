i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the myth of closure
closure is something we all seek after
to varying degrees in the wake of a
significant relationship rupture
and we have all of these fantasies
typically propagated by popular culture
about what closure looks like
and it's often the case that heartbroken
folks looking for closure can attempt to
restage their own versions of these
hollywood scenes
usually with disastrous results as the
other person generally hasn't read the
same script
i'm sure you can picture it the former
lovers come back together the truth is
finally revealed the remaining questions
are finally answered the long sought
after apology is offered the loose ends
are tied up and both parties are open
and honest about their true feelings for
each other and as a result the two
former lovers are able to move forward

[01:00]
former lovers are able to move forward
on their respective paths of life
without looking back
the issue is that this doesn't happen in
real life
and this is because closure does not
come from another person
if you need closure from somebody then
whether you like it or not you're
putting this somebody in a position of
power relative to you
as you've decided that they now have the
ability to bestow or withhold a desired
good
the idea is to take that power back
by seeking closure in ourselves
the fact of the matter is that we do not
need the other person to experience a
feeling of closure with respect to a
relationship
this is because closure is not when all
the loose ends are tied up and all the
lingering questions are answered that
never happens that never
happens
closure occurs when we internally decide
we are ready to move on

[02:00]
we are ready to move on
it's easy to say it's not always easy to
do
but that's the truth closure occurs when
you make the decision that you're ready
to move on
it's so simple
and that's why people miss it
think about it
what would actually happen if the former
lover came back and told you all the
things that you had been waiting and
hoping for them to say
you might imagine that upon hearing
their apology or confession that all of
the confusion and pain and resentment
that you've been harboring for months or
years just disappears like some kind of
magic spell
however that's absolutely not what
actually happens
a much more likely response especially
from someone who hasn't yet healed and
sought closure and himself or herself is
you you think you can just waltz
back into my life say i'm sorry and
expect to live happily ever after take
away my pain and give me back my time
you see
that's the proof that closure doesn't

[03:01]
that's the proof that closure doesn't
depend on the other person's behavior if
it did
then the apology or the confession would
immediately resolve the inner turmoil
and we know that it doesn't
i suppose it's nice to hear
however if we don't heal ourselves first
their words probably won't change a
thing
hopefully that was helpful
