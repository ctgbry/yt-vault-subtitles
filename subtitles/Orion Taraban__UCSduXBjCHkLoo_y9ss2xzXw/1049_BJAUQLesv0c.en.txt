Will is sort of like a muscle. We're all
endowed with it, but it's stronger in
some individuals than in others. And why
is that? Because just like a muscle,
those with strong wills have chosen to
systematically strengthen it by
exercising it regularly with
progressively more difficult decisions.
Ultimately, when the will is cultivated
to embody its full potential, it can
break through any resistance that the Mi
is subject to presenting. And what's
more, the stronger the will becomes, the
less resistance the Mi generally
presents. It's almost like it kind of
learns, what's the point? Why even
bother with the resistance? It just gets
overridden anyway, me might as well save
me's breath. Of course, if the Mi is not
used to being overridden, as will be the
case for most people when they begin the
journey of selfdiscipline, it will throw

very little that you won't be able to
accomplish if you apply yourself
correctly.
