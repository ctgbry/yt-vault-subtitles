so the solution to any relationship
plagued by boredom is to start telling
the truth I assure you if you start
telling the truth you won't be bored for
very long if you are bored in your
marriage go up to your wife open your
mouth and say I'm bored with our
marriage lately I've been fantasizing
about having an affair or getting a
divorce or just going out for cigarettes
and never coming back and that's because
the only other emotion I can remember
feeling recently besides boredom is a
vague sense of dread that I'm going to
spend the rest of what could be the only
life I'm ever going to have suffocating
in a middling lukewarm existence of
comfort and complacency guess what your
marriage isn't going to be boring
anymore and that's because no matter the
outcome your experience of the
relationship will have shifted
significantly and you may no longer be
able to rely on your old scripts and
evasions the truth is out and must be
contended with
