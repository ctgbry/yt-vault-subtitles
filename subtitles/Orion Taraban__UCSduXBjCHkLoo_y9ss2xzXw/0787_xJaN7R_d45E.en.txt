I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the truth
about good
relationships we all kind of know this
truth but very few people say it out
loud but once we bring it out into the
open it does a great deal to explain why
so few people have good relationships
and why so many young people apparently
don't seem to be interested in
relationships at all these days here it
is the truth about good relationships is
that good relationships are
boring they're
boring they are not exciting a good
relationship does not have drama it does
not have conflict it does not have
passionate arguments or complex
arrangements or high emotion good
relationships are calm they're
consistent they're reliable they run
smoothly and the smoother they run the
less you even notice them like nothing

[01:02]
less you even notice them like nothing
attracts attention like a problem which
is a big part of why so many people
create them in their
relationships listen closely a person's
ability to have a good relationship is
directly proportionate to his or her
capacity to withstand
boredom the folks who are trying to sell
traditional relationships to young
people seem to have missed this point
yes there is something fulfilling and
satisfying about a good relationship but
you need emotional maturity to be able
to experience it emotional maturity is
what transforms boredom into peace but
emotional maturity is precisely what so
many people especially young people who
are literally not yet fully developed
still lack without that maturity the
boredom of a good relationship becomes
insufferable no novelty

[02:00]
insufferable no novelty
no excitement no surprises
indefinitely this is why so many people
men and women create unnecessary
problems in their
relationships they don't want to admit
it but they're bored these people will
kick The Hornet's Nest even if it means
getting stung because at least that way
they will feel
something they will also seek out
Partners who are exciting or passionate
or spontaneous Partners who are in some
way unstable or unreliable or uncertain
because let's face it all these things
make for good drama they evoke emotions
and many people would prefer even
negative emotions to the muted
experiences that often characterize a
good relationship insisting that such
people are like immature or damaged or
what have you isn't going to change
their minds and it certainly isn't going
to solve this problem

[03:01]
to solve this problem
problem there's this great movie by
yasujiro U one of my all-time favorite
directors it's not one of his better
known films it's called the flavor of
green tea over rice and it exemplifies
this understanding better than any movie
I've ever seen the film is basically a
portrait of a marriage the husband is
patient calm loving hardworking and
long-suffering and the wife
is just an enormous pain in the ass like
through through 80% of the movie she is
and critical and complaining and
unreliable she lies to her husband and
talks badly about him behind his back
until her own girlfriends can't take it
anymore and call her out for her shitty
Behavior now what U gets right but
doesn't really call attention to is the
fact that the husband's consistent
reliability like

[04:00]
reliability like
enables the wife to act like a petulant
brat this is because consistent
reliability is boring and many women
like the wife and U's film find boredom
to be intolerable trust me if women
found decency and Tranquility sexy the
world would look like a very different
place however these traits do not evoke
strong emotional responses and
consistent reliability is often taken
for granted
precisely because its performance is
invisible and thus harder to see it
takes emotional maturity to be able to
appreciate these things and that is
precisely what the young wife lacks
through most of the
film if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and

[05:01]
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description back to the film eventually
the criticism of her friends as well as
the threat of loss represented by her
husband's departure on an unexpected
business trip bring the wife to her
senses she does some soul searching
realizes that she's been a miserable
crank and begs her husband's forgiveness
what follows is the best scene in the
movie The two have lived together as
husband and wife for years but most of
the domestic duties have been discharged
by their livein ma not wanting to wake

[06:02]
by their livein ma not wanting to wake
her up the two enter into the kitchen
the heart of Domesticity for the first
time to prepare a midnight snack they
have to work together to figure out
where the pans are and where they keep
the rice and we watch them stumble
through the preparation of a very simple
meal green tea over
rice green tea over rice is U's metaphor
for marriage it's not flashy or creative
it doesn't have exotic spices or complex
flavors or gastronomic inventions it's
good and wholesome and simple Rice and
tea and how would you describe the
flavor of rice and
tea
subtle
Bland
unremarkable like no one goes to a
restaurant to order tea over rice do you
understand but it's filling and
comforting in a way that few things are

[07:03]
comforting in a way that few things are
U understood the modest Simplicity that
characterizes good relationships in fact
this is consistently embodied in his
style no panning no tracking no zooming
every shot looks the same and it should
be noted that U the venerated chronicler
of Japanese Domesticity never married
and lived with his mother for the
remainder of her
life as I've said before the main reason
why most marriages don't last is because
we collectively want that relationship
to be too many things marriage is
fundamentally a very humble institution
and we burden that structure with
expectations and desires that it was
never designed to support it is simple
and
unpretentious like tea over rice it is
for lack of a better word
boring and this is especially true if
people are used to experiencing like big

[08:01]
people are used to experiencing like big
bright intense emotions and Sensations a
good relationship is going to seem very
dreary and dull by comparison but that's
just because these individuals weren't
really looking with their eyes and
hearing with their ears they just kind
of looked and heard enough to give them
the confidence that what they see and
hear is known and understood and
therefore that there's nothing new or
interesting about it which in turn
causes them to dismissively turn away
from
it but when they start to really look
and really listen they begin to see all
this subtle variation and delightful
nuance and tasteful diversity in the
experience they once rejected this life
isn't boring far from it it's sublimely
peaceful but it can take time and
maturity to arrive at this understanding
a good relationship is like listening to
the rain or watching a well- banked fire

[09:01]
the rain or watching a well- banked fire
it's simple and calming and
restorative and as you become
increasingly attuned to these
experiences then your relationship
becomes like this really safe playground
and the world kind of opens up to you
without even needing to leave your house
intense emotions and Sensations actually
dull your sensitivity to this kind of
stuff and make it harder to tolerate the
boredom that initially attends these
experiences but what's the alternative
you'll be chasing the dragon of
emotional stimulation until you can
tolerate boredom long enough to see it
transform into
peace what do you think does this fit
