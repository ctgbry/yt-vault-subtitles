i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
you never really know what you give to
others
so this is a lesson that i learned as a
teacher
before i became a psychologist i made my
living in new york city as a private
tutor as a means of subsidizing my
artistic ambitions
and while i was a private tutor i worked
with hundreds of young people in middle
school and high school on a variety of
subjects some of these students i saw
several times a week for years
and we talked about latin conjugation
and calculus integration
and classical literature and everything
in between
and because i did this for over a decade
it was often the case that young people
i worked with would graduate and move on
with their lives
and in many cases our paths would cross
years later
and in the course of our catching up i
would be consistently surprised to learn
what those students had remembered from

[01:00]
what those students had remembered from
our time together
in every case
they had forgotten the latin
they had forgotten the calculus and they
had forgotten the classical literature
everything that i thought i was there to
teach them
had since faded in time
but what they did remember
was often some throwaway comment that i
made when i was leaving the room one day
and never thought about twice
for whatever reason that comment really
spoke to them
and they've never been able to forget it
all these years later and that
was what i taught them
all the years i was working with them
neither one of us really knew what i was
teaching
we only learned that years later and it
was the student who taught me
what he had learned
and ironically
it never had anything to do with what i
was ostensibly paid to teach
it's interesting isn't it

[02:00]
it's interesting isn't it
and i think this is generalizable to
relationships
we don't actually know what we give to
other people
it's for other people to decide what we
give them because it's for other people
to decide what's of lasting value to
them
and it's often the case that neither
participant in a relationship knows the
value of what was given or received
until some time is passed
and that's just the way it is
what do you think
