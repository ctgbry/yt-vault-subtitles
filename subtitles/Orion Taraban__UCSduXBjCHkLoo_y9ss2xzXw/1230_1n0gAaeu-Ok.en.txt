Why is there such a wellestablished
double [music] standard with the you
said body count earlier se number of
sexual partners between men and women?
Love to hear about this because this is
hotly contested. We congratulate guys
for having sex with a lot of women, but
we those same guys will go, "Oh, she's
runth through if she's got even a third
of this guy's number."
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's very deep. You know, the
pathy phrase is, you know, a key that
can open any lock is a good key, but a
lock that any key can open is a bad
lock. Oh man, that's warm up those
emails, folks. I'm here for you.
&gt;&gt; But you have to understand that this is
rooted in often very deep cultural
scripts. And ultimately, it's not even
about men and women. It's about economic
inequality, which I'll get to near the
end. But [music] one of the reasons is
that as far as I know, there are no
cultures in which male virginity is
celebrated. You know, every once in a
while you see clips of like the
Christian youth camps where they're
trying to say being a virgin is cool.
And it's like, oh, bro. You know, so it

[01:00]
And it's like, oh, bro. You know, so it
it's
nowhere is that a value. You never hear
a woman say, "I want a virgin man."
&gt;&gt; You know, maybe if women did start to
talk like that and more importantly
decided to act like that, we would see
male virginity increasing its value. But
it doesn't really give women anything
that they don't already have.
Traditionally, what female virginity
does give men is some sort of paternity
assurance in the context of marriage. So
there is like the women always know it's
their baby. Men never 100% know.
&gt;&gt; That's the one of the foundational
Jewish law things is did it come out of
mom? Well, okay, that's the lineage
we're going with because we don't know
which dad it is. Like for being 100%
honest.
&gt;&gt; I see. So there is a value add to men
for female virginity that doesn't exist
the other way around. And there is

[02:01]
the other way around. And there is
that's probably the reason why female
virginity is celebrated in a lot of
cultures instead of the other way
