I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the old
man at the
club this is a phrase I often hear in my
consultations with male clients and even
in the mouths of my own male friends
these guys are typically in their early
to mid-30s and they usually spent their
20s sewing their Wild Oats or playing
the field and they are now reaching the
age when they feel it would be
inappropriate for them to continue to do
so
after all they don't want to be the old
guy at the club an image that is both
creepy and pathetic that is the man is
clearly passed his prime but hasn't yet
read the writing on the wall and there
he is making all the young women feel
disgusted and uncomfortable who would
want to be that guy once more these men
also believe that if they persist much
longer in this Behavior then all the
good women who might be wife material
will be snatched up and that they're

[01:01]
will be snatched up and that they're
going to miss the boat for a long-term
relationship and this in turn Stokes the
fear that they will die alone more on
that later in this episode and while I
can understand where this concern is
coming from I also maintain that it is
fundamentally misguided when I hear
someone say that he doesn't want to be
the old guy at the club I typically
respond well what club are you talking
about the nightclub or the Country Club
the oldest most dated man in one context
might be the youngest most relevant man
in another the fact of the matter is
that if you want to maintain your
options as a man you need to have a club
broadly defined nightclubs aren't the
only clubs there are and frankly there
isn't much for high value men there
anyway a club broadly defined could be a
professional Network or a community of
like-minded men or a society of shared

[02:01]
like-minded men or a society of shared
vision and aging out of one typically
means that you're aging into another yes
it might be Unbecoming of a man of a
certain age to hover in the shadows of a
discotech but there are other
alternatives to that scene than settling
down into domestication which if it's
chosen should be chosen because you want
it not because you don't want something
else for instance one alternative to the
nightclub is the country club and let me
tell you it's possible to pick women up
20 years younger than you in both places
if you have a mind to do that the point
is that as a man you can continue to
play the field for as long as you want
to provided you find an appropriate
millu to do so and if you play your
cards right which includes not
foreclosing prematurely to avoid a
negative outcome this often becomes
easier for men to do as they age the
issue is that what tends to make older

[03:02]
issue is that what tends to make older
men attractive to women doesn't really
shine through at the nightclub like the
main way these men can stand out in the
nightclub is through their ability to
spend tens of thousands of dollars on
bottle service and VIP lounges which
younger men typically just can't afford
and let's be real well this will
absolutely attract female attention it
will generally attract immature and
materialistic female attention behaving
in this way is going to attract
opportunistic gold diggers who are going
to attempt to exploit that man for his
resources because let's be fair that's
precisely what that man is aggressively
marketing he's good for if a man baits
his hook with money he can't complain
when he catches gold diggers so the idea
is for men to continue to put themselves
in contexts in which what they have to
offer is both highly visible and high

[04:00]
offer is both highly visible and high
Salient this is akin to seizing or
creating opportunities to be a
contextual Alpha circulate in
environments where you are both valued
and appreciated it doesn't matter if
that environment is a boardroom or a
golf course or a magic the Gathering
tournament like if there are women in
those environments those women will be
looking for in focusing on the men at
the top of those status hierarchies make
sure you're one of them and if for
whatever reason you can't be then it
might be better for you to find a
different scene than to quit the game
completely find clubs that play to your
strengths and highlight the most
attractive features of your
lifestyle if you appreciate the insights
on this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and

[05:01]
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description now the other component of
this concern of being the old guy at the
club is the fear of dying alone the idea
is that if you don't find a partner by a
certain date then you've just missed the
boat on a long-term committed
partnership which means that you might
end up dying in a gutter somewhere alone
and forgotten so let's talk about this
first and foremost it's important to
appreciate that everyone dies
alone this is uncomfortable existential

[06:01]
alone this is uncomfortable existential
fact but that doesn't diminish its
fundamental truth regardless of whether
you die nameless in some miserable
trench in a misguided war or comfortably
in your bed surrounded by your children
and your grandchildren and your
great-grandchildren you're the only one
who dies only you will be passing
through the eye of the needle and only
you will have to face whatever is on the
other side of that experience this is
true irrespective of whether you are
completely isolated or surrounded by
adoring loved ones and this is why it's
important for every person to come to
terms with their own existence and to
make peace with their god well in
advance of that happening because no one
else is going to be going through that
with you even if they wanted
to however leaving this aside it's also
true that wherever there are people
there are relationships which means that
Rel reltionship are possible at every

[07:01]
Rel reltionship are possible at every
stage of life for example it's a
somewhat uncomfortable fact that a
common hot bed for STDs are nursing
homes it turns out that 80-year-olds
still love to and they often do it
with abandon people often don't like the
idea of Grandma and Grandpa getting it
on until of course they become grandpas
and grandmas and then suddenly they
don't really see what the issue is in
any case the fact is that there are
possibilities for relationship at every
stage of life and this is particularly
true for men given the simple fact that
as a function of time there generally
are more of them than there are of us
like in the west women both outnumber
and Outlast men so on the population
level demand for men tends to outstrip
supply across the lifespan and Men
typically benefit from this economic
reality and while it might be difficult
for a man in his 70s to get with a woman

[08:00]
for a man in his 70s to get with a woman
in her 20s and he may not want to anyway
that doesn't necessarily mean that he
has to limit himself to a woman in her
70s either like when you're 70 40 is
going to seem really young and vital and
it's certainly possible for men to mate
and date women 20 even 30 years younger
than them if they so desire I've seen
men get divorced at 50 and enter into
satisfying committed relationship with a
new woman throughout their 50s and then
another woman throughout their 60s and
then another woman throughout their 70s
and so on and this kind of works for
them because they typically want
different things in their 50s than in
their 70s and they more or less learn to
let relationships run their course
rather than try to force one person to
be all things for all time which might
be how they ended up getting divorced in
the first place so that that's what I
got for you if you're aging out of the

[09:01]
got for you if you're aging out of the
nightclub then find a different Club
where you're valued and relevant and if
you're worried about the future just
remember that relationships are possible
in every phase of Life all the way up to
