I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is
overpaying is the cost of winning this
is an important life lesson in today's
day and age we are fairly squeamish
about the idea of winners and losers we
would prefer that the Universe did not
exist as a zero sum game and in some
cases it doesn't however in far more
cases than we would like to admit it
does the game is zero sum if you want
that job no one else can have it if you
want to marry that man no other woman
can marry him if you want to win that
Championship everyone else has to lose
the universe is abundant in general
there are lots of jobs and men and
championships but it is zero sum in the
particular there is only one of that job
and of that man and of that championship
and if you you want it no one else can

[01:02]
and if you you want it no one else can
have it if you want it you have to be
willing and able to win and the cost of
winning is overpaying and I don't just
mean money I'm using the word overpay in
its broadest possible sense not only
might you need to pay more you might
need to work harder and longer than you
ever thought you would you might need to
sacrifice more of your time and energy
and attention than you ever thought you
could
you might need to pay in the sense of
giving things up like Leisure and
comfort and free time and hobbies you
might even need to part with friends and
family who obstruct your goal and you
may need to pay with doubt and
loneliness and ridicule and pain at the
highest levels this is the cost of
winning why is this the case well life
is sort of like an auction house and how

[02:02]
is sort of like an auction house and how
does an auction house work an auction
house is full of things that many people
want however these things are for sale
remember wanting is free the whole world
wants a loving relationship and a
beautiful house and a rewarding job who
wouldn't want more beauty or power or
money wanting these things is free but
an auction house is not a charity
actually getting these things
will cost you and the fairest way we've
Hit Upon to distribute these particular
Zero Sum Goods is to give them to the
person who pays the most perhaps not a
perfect system but it's the best we've
managed to come up with to win the lot
the given buyer must pay more than
anyone else does and this means that the
winner
overpays why because apparently no one
else thought that that good was worth
that that much they weren't willing to

[03:02]
that that much they weren't willing to
sacrifice as much as the winner because
they didn't think what they were being
asked to give up was a fair exchange for
what they hoped to receive and they may
have been right but those people didn't
win the lot winners win not only because
they pay more than everyone else they
win because they pay more for the good
than it is likely worth they overpay in
an auction house a winner might overpay
by a dollar or by $10 million but they
always overpay because they almost
always could have won the same good for
Less because no one else was willing to
pay that much now with respect to a
literal auction winners overpay with
money like that's how I got this house
there were 14 other offers on this house
I wasn't awarded the chance to buy it
because I was a better person or because
I wanted it the most or because the
seller really liked me I got to buy it

[04:01]
seller really liked me I got to buy it
because I offered the most money I the
amount I paid was significantly more
than the second best offer which
functionally means that I overpaid for
this house but look who's living here
now property values and interest rates
have spiked since I bought the house and
I bought the house because I thought it
was
undervalued but I still overpaid
relative to my competition and this is
inevitable because overpaying is the
cost and the privilege of winning
however how does this apply to other
Goods in life well let's say you want to
start your own business like who
wouldn't want to be independently
successful however in order for your
business to succeed you will likely need
to overpay just like I was willing to
give more money than anyone else was in
order to buy this house you might have
to do what no one else is willing to do
in order for your business to succeed
this is the price of success more
generally the willingness to do what no

[05:01]
generally the willingness to do what no
one else is willing to do this might
mean that you're willing to provide a
service that no one else does or to sell
your product more cheaply than anyone
else or to provide a higher quality
customer experience than your
competition for your business to succeed
you need to find some way to do what
your competitors are not doing that is
still attractive and valuable to your
potential customers now before I go any

proportion to the value you feel you've

product placements or corporate
sponsorships so I really do rely on your
support to make all this happen I deeply
appreciate it thank
you now the same goes for relationships
you have your sites set on a particular
man ladies then you will have to overpay
to get him that means that you have to

[06:02]
to get him that means that you have to
be willing to do what no other woman in
the competition is willing to do this
could mean being more sexually generous
and available or more sweet and
supportive or more helpful in the
service of his mission but you will have
to do what other women w't now you might
argue that well he's not worth it and
you may be right however you won't win
with that attitude that's sour grapes
same goes for men you want a particular
woman you will have to overpay to get
her ultimately the right to buy goes to
the man who offers her the best overall
compensation package however she chooses
to Define that this could mean offering
children or commitment or excitement and
Adventure or an emotionally compelling
lifestyle and you might argue that she's
not worth it and you may be right but
you won't win with that attitude w w to

[07:01]
you won't win with that attitude w w to
win you must beat out your competition
and to beat out your competition you
must be willing to do things that they
aren't that are still valuable and
attractive to your potential customer
base this means that you must either
strengthen yourself or weaken your
competition two strategies that go hand
inand in the Game of Love and War or
business and until you figure out how to
do that you will be passed over again
and again and again and again you can
whine you can you can protest but
that's just how it is now here's the
thing if overpaying is the true cost of
winning then it will often be the case
that winning will be
disappointing this is the economic
explanation for why getting what you
want doesn't make you happy in general
the cost of winning tends to exceed the
value of what you've won in a lot of
cases is winning is a net loss this is

[08:02]
cases is winning is a net loss this is
one of the reasons why I help people get
what they want it facilitates their
disappointment which allows them to rule
out one more place they need to look in
order to find their happiness which is
never found outside of themselves but
people don't believe me when I tell them
that they only listen when they've been
sufficiently disappointed in their
gratification so does that mean winning
isn't worth it well not necessarily you
just have to understand that the real
value in getting what you want is not
the good itself because it probably
won't be worth more than what it costs
to achieve it but the process of
recreating yourself the good became the
pretext to move through a transformative
process to become more than you
currently are after all you likely can't
win as you are presently to win you must
be willing to do what your competition
is not which will motivate you to get

[09:00]
is not which will motivate you to get
off your ass and become a more competent
version of yourself broadly defined the
desire to win creates the process in
which you will be remade into something
greater than you currently are and
that's the real Alchemy here just
consider an Olympic Athlete the real
gold is not the medal and standing on a
Podium for three minutes the real gold
is becoming the strongest person in the
world or the fastest person in the world
or the most graceful person in the world
years of pain and discipline and
heartbreak and perseverance cannot be
worth the value of that medal but it
might be worth the value of being
afforded the opportunity to realize
one's potential as fully as possible
once in your life and that's why no one
wins the
gold actually does it for the medal
that's why no one who wins the gold
actually does it for the medal if that's
all they wanted they probably would have
given up a long time ago because the
medal is just too expensive too rich for

[10:01]
medal is just too expensive too rich for
my blood sociopaths aside winners win
because they understand that the real
value is the process which is what
allows them to stick with the process
long enough to win because it always
takes longer and costs more than you
think it will before you start so if you
want to win then be willing to overpay
and if you're not willing to overpay
then give up the desire to win because
that desire will only torture you if
you're not willing to do what you need
to do to realistically achieve it Just
Surrender the desire and be content with
what you have what do you think does
