i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
fundamental game of human relationships
if you've been following this channel
you know that i'm enamored with the
concept of the game
i love this concept because there's so
much you can do with it
and i define a game as anything with
rules and a goal
and today i'm going to talk about the
fundamental game of human relationships
it's called the game of please know
many of you might not know this but
before
psychology i was actually a theater
actor and i worked for over a decade as
a professional actor in new york city
i began that career at a prestigious
acting conservatory there and for the
entire first year of my training my
acting class was entirely devoted to a
single exercise which was called the
game of please no
and over the ensuing decades i've come
to understand that this is the

[01:01]
to understand that this is the
fundamental game of human relationships
so i'd like to briefly describe what
this game entails
the game of please know is very simple
it's always played between two people
and the rules are as follows one person
can only say the word please
and the other person can only say the
words yes or no
and this person has to start in the no
position
the please person always acts first and
the game goes on as long as it needs to
the goal of the game is for the please
person to change the yes no person's no
into a yes that's it
among other things this goal is an
excellent way to develop non-verbal
communication skills i mean you only
have one word to use
so you pay attention to things like
tonality proxemics posture gesture
rhythm pacing etc however the aspect of
the game that i want to focus on today
is its relation to the negotiation at
the heart of all human relationships

[02:02]
the heart of all human relationships
we go to other people because we want
something from them
this could be love attention
money
sex
resources kindness
advice friendship play doesn't matter
we go to other people when we want
something from them and that's why the
please person always acts first
the issue is as i've discussed in a
previous episode the universe lives
closed
which is to say the default starting
position of the universe is always
no can i have this job no can i have
this house no can i have a date no want
to hang out
no
and that's why the yes no person always
starts from a no position
the fundamental game of human
relationships is the game that we play
to get what we want from other people
the game of transforming knows into
yeses

[03:00]
yeses
at the end of the day
people are successful in life
in direct proportion to their ability to
transform no's into yeses
or to put it another way in direct
relation to their mastery of the game of
please know
master this game and the world is yours
for the taking
refuse to play and the world will be a
cold and miserable place
if you ever decide to play this game
yourself you'll very quickly learn that
success is not a one-size-fits-all
ordeal
the same game played between the same
individuals on one day will have a very
different progress and potential outcome
than the same game played between the
same two individuals on another
you'll also come to see that the various
methods or strategies utilized by the
please people to secure their yeses are
varied but they're not infinite
in fact these strategies tend to fall
into a few easily identifiable general
categories which include seduction

[04:02]
categories which include seduction
intimidation
humor
supplication
sincerity etc
and these strategies will work
differentially on different people on
different days the trick to mastering
the game of please know is being able to
suss out as quickly and reliably as
possible the strategy that is most
likely to be effective for that
particular person in that particular
moment
and you do this
by learning to listen more carefully to
the no response and becoming more
perceptive to the information contained
therein
because the fact of the matter is that
the way a person says no
always contains a clue
about how to get them to say yes
