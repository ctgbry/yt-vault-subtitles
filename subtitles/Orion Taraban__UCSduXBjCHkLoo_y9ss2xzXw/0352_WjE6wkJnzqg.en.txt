I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is cancer
cures neurosis
to something of a provocative title but
these actually aren't my words this is a
quote from the great psychotherapist
Irvin yalam who like myself actually got
started as a health psychologist working
with folks diagnosed with cancer
so let's unpack this quote a bit because
I do think there is some truth to it but
before I do please remember to like this
episode And subscribe to this channel it
takes less than a second costs you
nothing and it's a good way to cure what
ails you so do the same
my own personal definition of neurosis
is that Neurosis is confusing a fake
problem
with a real problem
and just to be clear confusing a fake
problem with a real problem is a real
problem it creates a lot of suffering
for a lot of folks so I'm not trying to
minimize the suffering of neurotic
illness however what I am saying is that

[01:02]
illness however what I am saying is that
there is a fake problem at the heart of
neurosis that is confused for a real
problem
not touching your doorknob three times
before you leave the house is a fake
problem
the social disapproval of others is a
fake problem
abstaining from pornography is a fake
problem
now again all these fake problems and
more can cause real suffering but let's
be honest they are not real problems a
real problem is something like penury
War sickness and death
these are real problems
and what y'all have noticed is that when
folks were confronted with a real
problem
many of their fake problems tended to
disappear
it's almost like folks need a real
problem in their lives to put their fake
problems in perspective hence cancer
cures neurosis
I saw this many many times when I was
working with cancer patients as a health

[02:00]
working with cancer patients as a health
psychologist
when folks are first given a diagnosis
of stage four disease especially if they
had presumed that they had that they
were otherwise healthy there was a kind
of predictable sequence of emotions that
they passed through from shock and
Terror to rage and hopelessness it's a
real emotional roller coaster for at
least several weeks
but what tended to happen after that was
amazing
in the majority of cases when folks
eventually arrived at an acceptance of
the possibility that they may actually
have only six months left to live
almost all of them decided that they did
not want to spend those six months
afraid despondent
and Furious
and so I often bore witness to a radical
transformation in the personalities of
folks as they approach the ends of their
lives
in fact I heard from many folks in this
situation that it wasn't until they

[03:00]
situation that it wasn't until they
started to die that they began to really
live
I want you to sit with that for a moment
this is not a hypothetical comment I
heard this many times from actual
people's mouths
that it wasn't until they started to die
that they actually started to really
live
and what they meant in part is that
there is a sort of freedom and
fearlessness that comes with the
acceptance of one's mortality and once
folks arrive at that point they live
life Full Throttle trying to squeeze
every moment out of the time they have
left
and that doesn't mean that they're just
like manically happy there was also
profound sadness and real forgiveness
and genuine courage
it's so impressive to see people truly
living
and it's such a shame that they didn't
start to live that way earlier
and I think that's true for all of us I

[04:01]
and I think that's true for all of us I
think we all tend to believe that we
have more time than we might
and so put off that living for another
day
but I think that if we attempted to live
as if we had cancer that is with the
acceptance that our days are numbered
then maybe we might
after accommodate to that terrifying
helpless infuriating reality
and eventually move through the rest of
our days with real courage honesty and
conviction
in that way though it's strange to say
the cancer experience has been a gift to
many people
obviously I don't wish cancer on anybody
I would not like to go through the
experience myself but I think it's also
important to understand that it's really
how you use what happens to you in your
life that matters not what does or does
not happen to you
that's the really important thing how to
use what happens to you and it turns out
that even something like dying

[05:02]
that even something like dying
can be used to bring you closer
to life
something to keep in mind
what do you think
have you moved towards authenticity in
your own life if so how'd you do it let
me know in the comments below thank you
