When it comes to attachment, it's
important to keep in mind that this is a
field of research that is fundamentally
based on observing infant behavior. Now,
things can definitely happen to people
when they're babies that will continue
to impact them for the rest of their
lives. I don't want to minimize or
discount that. But by the same token,
it's also true that most people change
in many significant ways as they mature.
Like most people are not the same at
1-year-old than they are at 40 years
old. So it's important to remember that
how an infant related to a caregiver
does not dictate how that same person
will relate to an intimate partner as an
adult. It's more likely to be similar
the less people make an effort to change
their style of relating. And of course,
they're less likely to make an effort if
they believe that style to be inflexible
and determined. But this style can and
does change with intentional effort over
time and over the course of normal
developmental maturity.
