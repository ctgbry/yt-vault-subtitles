i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the two kinds of dates let's get right
to it there are only two kinds of dates
ladies and gentlemen there are
good dates and there are
practice for good dates
good dates are self-explanatory so let's
take a look at the other category
it's not exactly fair or even accurate
to consider any date that doesn't lead
to connection sex or a relationship as a
failure
and if you approach dating with this
mindset you're very quickly going to get
burnt out
most first dates will not lead to second
dates so being able to reframe anything
that doesn't lead to a second date as a
learning experience will help prevent
you from becoming angry disappointed and
demoralized
here's another thing to consider
i've occasionally worked with folks who
have been very reluctant to even go out
on a first date with someone when for

[01:02]
on a first date with someone when for
whatever reason they don't believe
there's any possibility that it could
lead to a long-term relationship
now how these folks even know this to be
true before meeting the other person is
often a mystery to me but i suppose they
have their reasons
that said this attitude is problematic
for
the following reason
if you only go out with people who you
believe are strong fits for a long-term
relationship or with people you are
extremely attracted to
[Music]
you're just not going to go out on many
dates
and this is going to make you
rusty
the ability to have interesting
conversations the ability to flirt the
ability to seduce these are skills
i mean i don't care how hot or rich or
awesome you are
these things generally don't come
naturally to folks like any other skills
they require practice to hone an effort
to maintain

to maintain
and if you're not going out on a lot of
dates to keep these skills sharp well
what's going to happen when the perfect
guy or the perfect girl suddenly sits
down next to you at the bar
or you actually match with each other on
the app
you might blow that chance because you
haven't kept a hand in the game now i'm
not advocating that you go out with
people that you have zero attraction to
but dating regularly helps you get
better at dating
and reduces the likelihood that
you'll blow a good chance when you get
one those opportunities they don't come
around every day so it's important to be
ready for them when they do present
themselves so get out there and get some
practice
