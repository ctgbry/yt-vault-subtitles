i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
the three keys to effective boundary
setting
so setting boundaries with other people
is very important irrespective of the
relationship
this is because setting boundaries
teaches people how to love and respect
us without that feedback it's not really
possible to reasonably expect to be
loved and respected by other people in
the way that we would prefer without
boundaries this would only happen by
accident or coincidence
so it's important to learn how to set
effective boundaries with others
i'm here to tell you that there are
three key components to effective
boundary setting first be very specific
with respect to your target behavior
ask for what you want or what you don't
want
i know these conversations can be
difficult but the vaguer and more
indirect your language the easier it is
for misunderstanding to occur
if you want your partner to stop

[01:00]
if you want your partner to stop
drinking say i want you to stop drinking
if you want your friend to stop making
disrespectful jokes in public say i want
you to stop making disrespectful jokes
in public
don't say something like i want you to
take better care of yourself or i want
you to be nicer to me
there are so many different ways that
those requests can be interpreted and
the vast majority of them won't result
in changing the target behavior so it's
important to be as specific as possible
with respect to defining the target
behavior
the second key is to create an
actionable timeline
timelines are important because they
give a sense of urgency to the behavior
change
we want timelines to be reasonable but
we also don't want them to drag on for
too long otherwise the whole point of
priority is lost
this could mean something like if i
don't see some action in the direction
of this goal by the end of the month
then
or i need to stop by the end of the year
we'll get to what comes next in a minute
that's the third key but the point here

[02:00]
that's the third key but the point here
is that we want to have a very explicit
timeline in order to have an effective
conversation about boundary setting
and the third key is probably the most
important
you need to have a clear consequence
that's within your control
and that you're willing to execute
in most relationships the best leverage
you have with respect to boundary
setting is to apply the consequence of
taking yourself out of the relationship
it's like i can't control what you do
but i can control whether i continue to
participate in this relationship that's
always your trump card and it's
effective in direct proportion to how
much you bring to the table if you're a
loving partner or a competent employee
then refusing to participate in the
relationship will obviously be more
aversive than the converse
that said if you're not willing to walk
away from the relationship for whatever
reason
then don't nominate that as a
consequence only pick consequences that
you're actually willing to execute and

[03:01]
you're actually willing to execute and
for that matter that you can reliably
execute because the consequence is
within your domain of control
so
be very specific when defining the
target behavior create an actionable and
realistic timeline and identify a clear
consequence within your control that
you're willing to execute
if you do all three
you're well on your way
i hope this was helpful if you have a
topic that you'd like discussed in a
future episode or you'd like to schedule
