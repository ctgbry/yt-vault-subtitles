I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is it's
better for women to be adorers so if you
haven't done so already I would highly
encourage you to check out my series on
the balance of Attraction because some
of this talk won't fully make sense to
you unless you have that additional
context in brief it is not possible for
two people to like each other exactly
the same amount therefore in any
relationship
one person must always like the other
person more and one person must always
like the other person less the person
who likes the other person more is the
adorer and the person who likes the
other less is the adored now these two
roles are gender neutral both men and
women can be adorers and both men and
women can be the adored and both roles
come with their pros and cons it's not
actually better to be the adored and

[01:01]
actually better to be the adored and
vice versa
uh
however in my opinion it's generally
better for women to be adorers and I'm
going to back up that statement in this
episode now it may sound strange but
most people men and women most people
actually want to be adorers
most people don't think they do but they
actually do and this is because most
people are looking for that feeling they
want to find their person
to feel excited about a relationship to
be in love to feel lucky to be there
most people want to feel these things in
a relationship but these emotions are
not shared in the same degree between
the two roles
these emotions are mostly felt by the
adorer why because the adorer and only
the adorer gets to be with the one they
love the adored on the other hand gets

[02:02]
love the adored on the other hand gets
to be loved by the one they're with it's
not nearly as emotionally compelling of
an experience so if you want the
emotional dimension of love in a
relationship you're really looking to be
the adorer now before I go any further

trust me men want that emotional
experience almost as much as women do
but here's the thing in my experience
it's more important for a woman to have
an emotional experience in a
relationship than it is for a man
that's kind of like why the woman is
there perhaps you've heard it said that

[03:01]
there perhaps you've heard it said that
you can make a woman feel anything
except bored and there's some truth to
that statement a woman who hates you
might not leave but a woman who feels
indifferently is probably looking for
the door
so if it's more important for a woman to
have an emotional experience in a
relationship then it's probably better
that she be the adorer because if she's
the adored if she's up there on that
pedestal well that might feel good for a
while but it will actually get boring
pretty quickly being on a pedestal ain't
all it's cracked up to be and a bored
woman makes for an unsustainable
relationship
men this is what you have to understand
two people in a relationship cannot
occupy the same place and so when a man
insists on being the adorer he kind of
robs the woman of the opportunity of
being the adorer which isn't really
doing any one of them any favors and

[04:00]
doing any one of them any favors and
this is because you can't have two
adorers and you can't have two adores
because the balance of Attraction which
maintains that two people cannot like
each other exactly the same amount
insisting on being the adorer forces the
woman to be the adored which robs her of
the Lion's Share of emotionality in the
relationship makes sense
now there's another important reason why
it's better for women to be adorers and
this reason has to do with hypergamy
which we have now talked about a few
times on this channel hypergamy is the
tendency of women to select up and
across which is why they tend to mate
and date men who are older taller
stronger wealthier and higher status for
instance
this means literally and figuratively a
woman wants to look up to her man
if a man insists on being the adore then
he's looking up at her which means that
she is looking down at him and that is

[05:03]
she is looking down at him and that is
definitely not a sustainable
relationship men you don't allow a woman
to look up to you you don't even give
her the chance if you're looking up at
I can hear some wheels turning and some
of my male audiences heads right about
now and that's good it's good that
you're thinking about this
and this is what I'd like you to
consider gentlemen
I get that you want to be the adorer
she's gorgeous and it feels amazing to
be with the woman you love I get it
but here's the thing if you insist on
having that experience you are robbing
her of the opportunity of having that
experience because you can't both be
adorers my dude
so what I'd like you to consider
is making a voluntary sacrifice to be
the adored I know that sounds weird but
it's a sacrifice to be the adored
because almost everyone wants to be the
adorer it's a sacrifice to be the adored

[06:00]
adorer it's a sacrifice to be the adored
to give the opportunity
to give up the opportunity of being with
the one that you love
and you're willing to do that to give
the woman that opportunity which is no
small thing because you know how good it
can feel does that make sense
