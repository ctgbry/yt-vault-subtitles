I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the truth
about romance romance is for men
this title is probably a shock to most
of you especially to the men out there
I'm here to argue that all the things
that go into modern Romance the flowers
the chivalry the bent knee proposals are
actually not for women
they're for men this was a big
realization for me and it was even
bigger because it was actually staring
me in the face the entire time
it's so obvious that it's invisible to
people

romance is for men in the pinned comment
below there's a link to this really
catchy 90s song called Two Princes by
the band Spin Doctors I remember when I
heard this song in the sixth grade for
the first time I made my mom drive me to
the mall just so that I could buy the
single which I proceeded to listen to
over and over and over again the song
just spoke to me the song Hit number one
on the US charts and more important to
our present undertaking it perfectly
exemplifies what I'm here to talk about
if you haven't done so already listen to
it yourself it's really catchy now the
lyrics of the song tell the story of an
age-old romantic Trope two men are vying
for the same woman one guy is Rich he's
established he has status as the song
says he's got diamonds in his pockets
but he apparently doesn't really love
the woman on the other hand the guy the
singer he's well he's poor he's got no
future he's got nothing to offer but his

[02:02]
future he's got nothing to offer but his
heart but he apparently knows what a
prince and lover ought to be
there is nothing new here this is the
same dichotomy you see in almost every
romantic comedy or Hallmark movie so who
cares well let me ask you a really
obvious and stupid question
why is this always the case that is why
is it always the rich powerful man who
doesn't believe in love
against the poor down on his luck dude
who does or to put another way why is it
never the rich powerful man who believes
in love
against the poor down on those dude
who doesn't
and it's an easy question because the
answer is obvious the reason why it's
never the other way around is that it
wouldn't be a fair fight the woman would
have absolutely no reason to choose the
second guy
so there's really no reason to tell that

[03:02]
so there's really no reason to tell that
story there's no conflict because
there's no contest the woman of course
would choose the rich and powerful man
who believes in love do you understand
so what was the story before romance was
invented like how did it work in
medieval and ancient times leaving aside
the fact that women rarely got to choose
their Partners how many men how were men
selected for women back then
well before romance it was just the rich
powerful guy against the poor down as
luck dude
which like my hypothetical counter
example also isn't a fair fight
the first guy wins every single time and
in those times not only did the rich and
powerful men get their pick of the
choicest women it wasn't all that
uncommon for these men to have a whole
Harem of women I mean according to the
Bible King Solomon had 700 wives

[04:02]
Bible King Solomon had 700 wives
and 300 concubines that guy had a
thousand women
which means that at that time in that
place there was probably
999 other guys who were pissed at
Solomon for bogarting all the best
ladies for himself
but can you really blame the women why
wouldn't they choose Solomon he was the
king he had the money and the Palaces
which means he could offer resources and
protection and he was wise and generous
to boot the other guys couldn't compete
now because romance was actually a
historical phenomenon it originated in
the south of France in the 15th century
we know who invented it
men invented it more specifically the
chivalric Knights of that time and place
and these men invented it for them
four men not for women and they invented
romance in an attempt to compete with

[05:03]
romance in an attempt to compete with
the rich and powerful men of their time
for access to the best women
and this is because if a guy couldn't
convince a woman that he had something
special something intangible that the
king didn't have there's no way he's
getting laid
the truth about romance is that it's a
strategy that lower status men have
adopted in their attempt to compete
successfully with higher status men for
women
this is also why romance is a young
man's game because most young men don't
have anything to offer women
but they still want to get laid and if
it works it's a pretty slick game
because I a lower status man would have
convinced you an attractive woman
that this intangible feeling in my chest
is actually more valuable and important

[06:00]
is actually more valuable and important
to you than all the resources and
opportunity that a higher status man
could provide for you I would have to be
extremely smooth for that to work and to
be honest it usually doesn't
women might think the second guy the guy
who calls himself a prince is rather
sweet and may even play around with him
for a little bit
but they generally end up with the first
guy the guy who might actually be a
prince
and who can provide her with the kind of
lifestyle that she would prefer
and this is just
mind-blowing for me because guys
typically think that romance is for
women
I mean they don't want chocolates and
flowers and poetry and jewelry and they
give these things because they think
women do
but women still want Solomon guys women
still want the king the powerful wise
generous Rich alpha male

[07:01]
generous Rich alpha male
things haven't changed because women's
nature like men's nature hasn't really
changed in the last few hundred years
the upshot is that romance was actually
invented by men for men to help them
compete with more powerful men who would
otherwise completely destroy them in the
sexual Marketplace for desirable women
