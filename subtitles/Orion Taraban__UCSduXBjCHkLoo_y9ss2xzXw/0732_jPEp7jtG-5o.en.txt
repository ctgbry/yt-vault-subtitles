in my understanding daddy issues are
kind of the sense that I can't ever do
enough a lot of daddy issues seem to be
associated with achievement and talent
and ability and like revenge in the
sense that I am going to like my
old man I'm going to do this so well
that he can't not acknowledge me and to
finally earn the love that I never
received from him that I felt like I
deserved when I was young and so a lot
of people with daddy issues and that can
be expressed differently in men and
women but in both genders they tend to
be very high achieving they tend to be
very driven very ambitious and they can
sacrifice their real needs and
authenticity in the service of having
that recognition from other people now
mommy issues I think are a little bit
deeper in the sense that I think that if
you don't receive the kind of love and
recognition from your mother you're it's
not so much that you don't do enough
it's like you are bad like you are a bad
human being
