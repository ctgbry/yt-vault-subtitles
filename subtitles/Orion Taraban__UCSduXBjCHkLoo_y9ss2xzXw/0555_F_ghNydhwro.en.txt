the first way that women disrespect men
without realizing it is through
inappropriate questioning the ability to
ask questions is a privilege that is
awarded to those with more power have
you ever been arrested in the
interrogation room you don't get to ask
the officers questions they do just like
they say in all the cop dramas hey we're
the ones asking questions here women
when you interrogate Men by questioning
their intentions their whereabouts their
motivations their choices you are
basically communicating that you believe
that you occupy a more powerful position
relative to them you communicate that
you believe that you have a right to
know certain things and that you believe
he must answer to you and it's only the
less powerful who must answer to the
more powerful never the other way around
this is functionally placing yourself in
a higher position relative to that man
which will absolutely be perceived as
disrespect
