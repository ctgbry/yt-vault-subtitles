it's just not a good idea for men to
allow themselves to emotionally invest
in any given woman until they conduct
sufficient due diligence they may need
to actively resist the urge to do so a
lot of guys they have a great first date
and they're already thinking about what
their kids are going to look like or
they meet a woman who them real good and
they think wow she's perfect I finally
found the one this is inappropriate
gentlemen it's like I'm glad you had a
good time or a fun night or two but
don't get ahead of yourselves because
you are setting yourself up for a fall
men it is your job to resist the pull to
emotionally invest in any given woman
until it is appropriate to do so dealing
with women is a lot like playing poker
every once in a while you're going to be
dealt some good whole cards if you start
jumping out of your chair and changing
your bedding Behavior every time you get
pocket aces you're not going to win that
pot and you haven't even seen the Flop
yet that's an advantageous position to
be in but you have to put on your best
poker face you keep a rain on your
emotions and you don't deviate from your
system because that's your best bet of
actually raking in a big pot
