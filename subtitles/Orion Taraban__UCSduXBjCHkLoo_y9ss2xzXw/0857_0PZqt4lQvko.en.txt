Being an advocate for men is a kind of
social suicide in today's day and age.
Like, no one says you're not supposed to
do this, but on some level, we all know
that it's not a good idea not to involve
the ladies. So, the role attracts
personalities that are so grandiose or
aggressive or hardened that they can
deal with the backlash that they
inevitably receive. And this is the
important part. Some of these
personalities go too far and in their
advocacy of men, they end up saying,
"Fuck women. Not a good look." But most
of them don't. However, even those who
don't say this might as well have. Like
the social inference here is that anyone
who must be for men must be against
women. And every social advocate for men
is a would-be oppressor of women. And
that just isn't true. And we certainly
don't think it's true when it's the
other way around. like the thought

aren't primarily considered to be the
sworn oppressors or enemies of men. But
this incorrect belief creates the
problem that we are discussing. Like if
just advocating for men implies that
you're against women, which will attract
a whole host of negative social
consequences, then the vast majority of
men who might be more sensitive and
nuanced around the issues will be
bullied out of the discourse or just
think it's not worth it, leaving only
the most aggressive or powerful
personalities. And if cultural progress
is considered to be the infiltration and
dismantling of every single male space,
then the only ones that will survive
will be those that actively defend
themselves and fight for their
existence.
