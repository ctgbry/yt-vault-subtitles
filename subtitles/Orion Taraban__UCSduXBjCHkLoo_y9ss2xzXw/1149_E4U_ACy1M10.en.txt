Gentlemen, listen closely. Well, you
can't turn a into a housewife, you can
absolutely turn a housewife into a and
if you're a man who is attracted to
behavior, this, in my opinion, is a much
better way to go about getting what you
want. It's been said that women want a
bad boy who's only good for her, and men
want a good girl who's only bad for him,
a lady in the streets and a freak in the
sheets, as it were. And I think there's
some truth to that. However, if you
think about it, that means starting with
the good girl first, with the lady. Find
yourself a girl who acts right from the
get-go. She doesn't have a big public-f
facing social media presence. She
doesn't go to suspicious places late at
night with strange men involving
alcohol. She doesn't have a horde of
friendly men surrounding her at all
times. Like, that's potentially a good
woman to have a long-term relationship
with. So why don't more men seek these
women out? For the same reason that
women don't seek out nice guys. These

women don't seek out nice guys. These
women are boring. Hate to say it, but
people men and women go to relationships
to feel. And a lot of guys seek out the
excitement and titilation that comes
with women. Like say what you will about
them, there's generally not a dull
moment when it comes to these kinds of
women. And boredom is actually one of
the hardest emotions for most human
beings to tolerate.
