what you have to understand is that if a
woman leaves she takes with her
everything you've ever given her the
only thing she loses when she walks away
is that which she wants and hasn't yet
received what keeps a woman in a
relationship is what she hasn't gotten
yet this and only this do they lose when
they leave this is why as a man it's
always essential that you remain future
focused whatever woman you're dealing
with needs to be looking forward to
something that she wants and that she
hasn't yet received and that's also why
it's a good idea to draw out what you
give her as long as possible you do not
want to paint yourself into a corner by
giving her everything that she wants too
soon because once she has everything
that she wants what can you possibly
give her and a woman who does not expect
any future benefit from a man is not
going to stick around just like you are
probably not going to stick around to
spend the rest of your career in a dead-
end job
