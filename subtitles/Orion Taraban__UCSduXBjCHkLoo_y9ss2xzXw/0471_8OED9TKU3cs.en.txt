I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic for today's short talk is only
Founders get equity this one is for the
ladies gentlemen feel free to send this
on to your sisters and daughters I'm
here to help now in the business World
investing in an untried company is an
inherently risky Endeavor pouring time
energy and money into a project with an
uncertain or even a low chance of
success is not something to be done
lightly or with casual indifference many
of these companies have nothing to show
for themselves yet or even money with
which to pay their workers so the way
these companies attract investors and
talent is with Equity the promise of a
portion of the company's eventual
success if and when it goes public
Equity is how people after several years
become multi-millionaires overnight
bet on the right Pony and that initial
investment or that year or two of effort

[01:01]
investment or that year or two of effort
can come back ten thousand fold and on
some level that's fair
these people took a significant risk
they deferred their gratification and
would have been left with nothing if the
company hadn't panned out in my opinion
they deserve their jackpot they are
substantially compensated for their
substantial risk and any company that is
just starting out will attempt to lure
its potential investors and
collaborators its founders with a vision
of the future and a promised slice of
the pie high risk but High reward
now many folks are going to turn down
this offer as too risky instead they're
going to wait to see what happens maybe
the company goes to the moon but maybe
or probably it's going to fail if it
fails bullet dodged and if it succeeds
well they could always apply for a
position if and when the company gets
through with its Growing Pains but
here's the thing

[02:01]
here's the thing
if you the potential employee wait to
seek a position at a company only after
it's been successfully established
you're not going to get equity
you're going to get a salary at best
now this might be a good salary I mean a
lot of companies where I live offer
their employees six figure salaries but
it is a salary nonetheless you're likely
never going to become a
multi-millionaire and you will need to
work 40 hours or more for the rest of
your career you might do very well for
yourself but it's a very different
situation to be an employee and a
successful company than to be a Founder
at a successful startup
this same thing holds true with
long-term relationships I'll speak from
my own experience
let me tell you when I was in my early
20s boy oh boy
was I interested in getting married and
why was I so keen on getting hitched

[03:02]
why was I so keen on getting hitched
back then
because I sure could have used the help
I was broke I was living in subsidized
housing in Brooklyn the place was
furnished with stuff that I found on the
streets I didn't know how to cook my
place was filthy and I had no real
prospects I had nothing to offer but
myself which I learned doesn't get you
very much in the sexual Marketplace
now here's the thing even back then I
knew who I was and I had a vision for
the future
I knew what I was capable of and I
believed in myself even when no one else
did I believed in myself and I had
absolute confidence in my ability to
achieve my vision
and I would pitch that to the women that
I dated this is what we could build
together I could really use your help
unfortunately my vision was just not a
sufficiently attractive offer to the
women in question and this was painful
at the time but I totally get it now

[04:02]
at the time but I totally get it now
after all most startups fail
there are a lot of guys with ambition
and potential who never end up realizing
their dream
I get it it's always riskier to bet on a
horse before the race is run
now before I go any further if you're

button it's the three little dots in the
lower right hand corner and tip me in
proportion to the value you feel you've
received from this message
it's support like this that makes all of
this happen and I really appreciate it
thank you very much
so in my case what happened well since I
couldn't find a Helper and since I
wasn't ready to give up on my dream I
had to roll up my sleeves and do it
myself
and back then I didn't really know
anything about anything and it turns out

[05:00]
anything about anything and it turns out
to use my analogy it's actually
extremely complicated to launch a
successful business for instance you
need to know about marketing and I
didn't know anything about marketing so
I would have loved to bring on a woman
who could do that but I couldn't find
one even though I offered equity
so I learned marketing myself
you also need to know about accounting
and I didn't know anything about
accounting so I would have loved to
bring a woman on for that but I couldn't
find one to do that either even though I
offered Equity so I learned about
accounting myself and so forth and so on
because I wasn't successful in
attracting a woman for a long-term
partnership with the prospect of equity
in a future successful relationship I
functionally hired myself for all of
those roles
nowadays I'm the CEO
and the CTO
and the CEO and the head of HR and the
chef who caters the meetings hell at

[06:01]
chef who caters the meetings hell at
this point I'm the chief diversity
officer
do you understand I'm everything because
I've had to be and now that my company
is fairly successful now that I bring in
a significant amount of Revenue now that
I have some clout and status and market
share now that I don't need to hire
anyone because I've learned to do
everything myself
guess what the resumes are just pouring
in
and this is just tragic because really I
would have been so grateful if I could
have gotten a woman's help when I first
started out it would have made things so
much easier I could have gotten here
sooner and it would have made a huge
difference in my life but that's not how
things played out
women who are generally more risk averse
than men saw investing in me back then
as too risky of a proposition and it's
like fair enough
but here's the thing I don't really need
to hire now and if I did they wouldn't

[07:00]
to hire now and if I did they wouldn't
get equity
they would get a salary
after all of my trials and all of my
efforts over the last two decades there
is absolutely no way I would ever enter
into an arrangement in which someone I
took on might be entitled to half of
what I've built it's like completely out
of the question like where were you 20
years ago you weren't involved in the
substantial risk so why would you be
entitled to a substantial reward ladies
if you wait until the company goes
public you don't get Equity you get a
salary
now the salary I offer is very
competitive you would be hard-pressed to
find a better compensation package
elsewhere but it's a position that will
require effort it's not a ticket to an
early retirement
ladies this is the takeaway
nearly all the successful high-value
guys that women are gunning for today
weren't always successful and high value
if women were really smart they would

[08:00]
if women were really smart they would
get better at exercising their
discernment with respect to which
ambitious talented men are likely to go
the distance
this is why I say that the best dating
strategy for women is to find a dark
horse I would encourage women to think
of themselves as Savvy investors they
may not always get it right but the good
ones generally do very well for
themselves just like in the marketplace
you ideally want to buy low and sell
High
the same works for relationships which
is why nearly every female billionaire
is either an heiress or a divorcee
if you want Equity especially Equity at
parity you've got to take the risk roll
up your sleeves and work just as hard as
the man when he has nothing
and if you're not willing to do that if
you want to wait until the work is done
and the race is run you'll need to
content yourself with a salary at best

[09:00]
content yourself with a salary at best
