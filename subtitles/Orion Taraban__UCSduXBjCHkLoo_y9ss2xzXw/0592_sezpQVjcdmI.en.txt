I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is men do
the right things with the wrong women
this principle applies to both men and
women but it's just too much content to
cover in one episode so I'll be talking
about how men do the right things with
the wrong women first and then I'll
discuss how women do the right things
with the wrong men in a future episode
first a caveat in these episodes I'm
going to be assigning numbers to people
now I'm not doing this simply as a means
of measuring the person's physical
attractiveness more than anything else
I'm using these numbers to represent
subjective interest so a six here is
someone you could kind of take or leave
whereas a nine is someone that you're
actually really interested in this has a
lot to do with perceived physical
attractiveness especially with men but
it's definitely not the whole story okay
let's get to it we'll start with
approach guys imagine you're at a bar

[01:00]
approach guys imagine you're at a bar
and you see a six on a bar stool and a
nine in the corner surrounded by a bunch
of her friends after a couple of drinks
most men are actually going to end up
approaching the six why because they're
going to incorrectly perceive her to be
the safer option the fact of the matter
is that most men are intimidated by
attractive women they think that women
also use the metric that men apply to
them which is a failure of intersex
understanding this leads them to think
that the nine is out of their league so
she functionally represents punching
outside their weight class on the other
hand they tend to think that the six
should be like shooting fish in a barrel
especially if they consider themselves
to be like a seven or an eight they're
more likely to think it's This Woman's
lucky day or this is a sure thing the
issue is that it certainly isn't a sure
thing this is because while men tend to
titrate their standards to kind of match

[02:00]
titrate their standards to kind of match
the attractiveness of the particular
woman they're dealing with women kind of
don't I know it might sound Bonkers but
that six is very likely to have the same
standards with respect to the men she's
willing to mate and date then that nine
is and this actually makes the six less
safe than the nine this is because it's
actually going to hurt worse if and when
a six rejects you than if and when a
nine does give it your perceptions if
and when a nine rejects you you're
probably going to think yeah I kind of
get it it was a long shot anyway on the
other hand given your perceptions if and
when a six rejects you you might
actually get your ego bruised who does
this women think she is I was doing her
a favor do you understand it's actually
all in your head but isn't everything
anyways in any case this is a part of
the reason why sixes actually tend to
get approached in bars more often than
nines

[03:00]
nines
and it's attention it's this attention
from men that can inappropriately
mislead these sixes into believing that
they are perceived to be more attractive
than they actually are so let's assume
that you go up to the six because you
perceive her to be the safer option
because you kind of believe that you're
the more attractive option you're going
to act like you're the more attractive
option you're going to be more confident
you're going to take bigger risks and
most importantly you're not really going
to care about her own interest in you
after all you're not that into her
anyway so you think it won't be any skin
off your back if it falls through that
confident indifference is like crack to
women they'll swear up and down that
they hate it when men behave that way
but I guarantee that they're not going
home with the empathic nice guy at the
end of the night next in your
interaction with the six you're likely

[04:01]
interaction with the six you're likely
going to be a bit more sexually
aggressive than you would with the nine
like you're going to be a bit more
motivated to move the encounter in the
direction of a sexual opportunity to
quote Alec Baldwin and Glen Gary Glenn
Ross it's [ __ ] or walk and why is that
because if you perceive her to be a six
there might not be much else besides the
sexual opportunity to justify your
continued investment of time energy and
attention so you're unlikely to spend
the whole evening talking to this girl
you'll communicate your sexual intent
more quickly and see how she responds if
she's not receptive you'll probably cut
your losses sooner and move on and if
she is receptive you can choose to act
on it or not all other things being
equal men who are more sexually
aggressive but important caveat not men
who are too sexually aggressive are more
likely to transition a sexual
opportunity into a sexual encounter and

[05:02]
opportunity into a sexual encounter and
this is simply due to the fact that it
is very rare for women to take the lead
on these things like they can pump the
brakes but they're generally not going
to step on the gas and just like driving
men who step on the gas tend to get to
where they're going more

back to
it let's say that you succeed in

[06:00]
it let's say that you succeed in
bringing this six back to your place and
you both enjoy a lovely consensual
sexual encounter once you're finished
how are you going to behave are you
going to be telling this girl that she's
the best you've ever had are you going
to start planning this second date while
she still lying there in bed once she
leaves are you going to text her the
next day hey I I want you to know that I
had a great time last night smiley face
winky face no once you're finished you
might be
thinking when is this woman going to
leave and you're probably not going to
be texting her anytime soon after a
certain amount of time this will
probably motivate her to reach out to
you because most women don't like the
idea of Simply being a one night stand
and you might be cool and indifferent
about the prospect of a second meeting
do this a few more times and this woman
might be blowing up your phone trying to
invite you over for a home-cooked meal
and guys end up thinking why is it
always the ones that I'm not interested

[07:00]
always the ones that I'm not interested
in who always seem to want a
relationship with me the answer is
simple my dudes you did the right things
with the wrong woman I guarantee that
all of the things that you did to pull
the six are just as effective in pulling
nine why because these two don't belong
to different species they are the same
animal they are woman and if it works on
one it will work on the the other the
problem is that your attraction
literally [ __ ] with your perception and
you end up thinking that the two are
somehow categorically different they're
not that's all in your head but what do
guys do when they Finly meet a woman
that they're really excited about they
throw all of that effective Behavior
right out the window they disclose their
attraction and positive emotions quickly
and clearly they hesitate in expressing
sexual in interest and communicating

[08:00]
sexual in interest and communicating
sexual intent they start planning the
second date while they're still on the
first they text the next day they smile
and compliment and buy gifts and pursue
and none of that [ __ ] Works none of it
and it wouldn't work for the six either
but you wouldn't even think of doing
those things with her because you
wouldn't believe the effort would be
justified by your
attraction my dudes treat the nine like
the six when you invest any given woman
with more interest and emotion than she
invests in you then you make her the
adored that turns you into the adorer
the
pursuer and this is a problem because
women are kind of like prey animals when
you start to chase them a lot of them
have this Instinct deep inside of them
to just run away even if it's from a
really great relationship opportunity
like they don't know that yet they just
feel you chasing and so they just feel

[09:01]
feel you chasing and so they just feel
this impulse to run away and even if
it's wrong this instinct is kind of in
the service of their survival like it's
more adaptive for them to run from a
false positive than for them to not run
from a false negative understand this is
why it's really important not to pursue
women if you do in the vast majority of
cases you'll only succeed in chasing
them right out of your
life I understand that this can be ult
but as a man it is essential that you
keep a tight rain on your emotions
finally meeting a woman that you're
authentically excited about after months
or years of unsatisfying Engagement in
the sexual Marketplace is kind of like
getting pocket aces in poker after a
string of bad hands if you start jumping
up and down in your chair and pumping
your fists in the air you are going to
blow that opportunity man so what do you
do when you get pocket aces in poker the

[10:03]
do when you get pocket aces in poker the
same [ __ ] thing you do on any other
hand you get dealt in poker you need to
stick to your system and keep control of
your emotions otherwise that hand is
going to be wasted on you my friend run
the experiment for yourself whatever
you're doing to make that six pursue you
for a
relationship works that is your system
