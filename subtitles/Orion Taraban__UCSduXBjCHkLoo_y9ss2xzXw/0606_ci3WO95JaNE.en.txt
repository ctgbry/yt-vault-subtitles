I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the Trap
of understanding so this is something
that often comes up in the context of
intimate relationships the foundational
cultural assumption here is that when
people in a relationship have problems
with each other what is called for is
greater understanding like this is
basically the Assumption upon which
couple's therapy is based that if only
the other person were to understand why
we want what we want or why we do what
we do then the conflict and the
disagreements will stop however this
almost never works the way we think it
will and in this episode I am going to
explain why here's a common example of
this phenomenon a man might want more
sex from his wife however the wife
doesn't want more sex from her husband
instead she wants him to understand that

[01:00]
instead she wants him to understand that
because of some difficult sexual
experiences in her past or because of
her shame-based family of origin or
because of her work rated stress she
can't read won't comply with his request
she believes the problem is not the lack
of sex but her husband's failure to
adequately understand why she doesn't
want to have sex and if he did
adequately understand her situation then
the problem would go away presumably
because he would stop wanting to have
sex with her and that's generally not
what happens now understanding has its
uses like understanding the reasons
behind another person's Behavior can
certainly help you to be more kind more
patient and more compassionate with that
person when you can appreciate that any
individual's response to the present
moment is on some level rational and
comprehensible given an understanding of
this person's programming and experience
then you can treat people with more
tolerance and forbear par if not more

[02:01]
tolerance and forbear par if not more
love and care and that is no small thing
however understanding does nothing to
change the need surrounding the behavior
that requires understanding like in the
example I just gave understanding why
his wife isn't interested in having sex
isn't going to change the husband's
desire to have sex with his wife or to
take other examples understanding why
someone say flies and to a rage or
doesn't follow through on commitments or
belittles others with sarcasm might
allow us to feel some measure of
compassion for that person however that
understanding does nothing to impact our
desire to say not be yelled at or not be
left hanging or not be
disrespected and this is the Trap of
understanding those who beg for the
understanding of others on some level
are asking other people to change they

[03:02]
are asking other people to change they
are functionally asking other people to
accommodate them which typically
requires special consideration and the
relinquishment of certain often
legitimate desires these people
essentially communicate that I shouldn't
have to change I shouldn't have to heal
or examine my programming or process my
shame or experiment with new behaviors
or courageously face my fears everyone
else
should have to change because I
can't the Trap of understanding is not
only a way of saying I'm not going to
change because I can't but it's a way of
indirectly requesting that everyone else
accept this self-diagnosed assessment as
well and the issue is that while some
things that people are subject to
dealing with really can't be changed a
lot of the things that people beg for
understanding about can absolutely be
changed and asking others to change

[04:00]
changed and asking others to change
before taking every reasonable measure
to First change
oneself is actually pretty
selfish now before I go any further if
you're liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this episode to someone
who might benefit from its message
because it's Word of Mouth referrals
like this that really help to make the
channel grow I'm also proud to announce
that I'll soon be publishing my book the
value of others so if you'd like to
learn more about that then you can go to
my website and sign up for my Weekly
Newsletter finally please fill out an
inquiry form on my website if you're
interested in booking a paid
consultation the link is in the
description okay let's get back to
it asking others to change is also
fairly costly for example the husband in
the previous example might understand
where his wife is coming from but he
still wants to have sex this makes the
relationship more expensive for him why
because he now has to give more that is
more patience more tolerance more
compassion for Less

[05:00]
compassion for Less
in this case a sexless relationship not
a very attractive offer is it think of
it this way imagine you're an employee
in a company and you're looking to get a
raise one day you go in to see your boss
you make your request and the boss
responds like this hey I totally get you
but here's what you need to understand
we've actually had a really tough year
sales were down and we're already over
budget as much as I'd like to help you
out there just isn't any money for a
raise right now I I can't do it please
understand and you will understand
you'll likely accept the explanation on
face value and you probably won't push
for a raise anymore you may even offer
some words of sympathy or some helpful
suggestions and you may look for another
[ __ ] job that pays you what you feel
like you deserve like understanding the
company's problems does nothing to
remove your goal do desire or need for

[06:00]
remove your goal do desire or need for
more money and this makes it
significantly more likely that you're
going to seek out another opportunity
elsewhere this is because what your boss
is functionally asking you to do is to
work at a discount like I understand
that you could potentially make more
money elsewhere I get it but I'm asking
you to work for Less here because I'm
hoping that you'll understand that we
can't give you more and that you'll
therefore make an allowance for me I'm
hoping that you'll surrender your desire
for more money without noticing that I'm
retaining my desire for you to continue
to work under our current Arrangement
like it's certainly not in the employees
long-term best interest to satisfy
himself with understanding instead of
compensation now is it on some level
asking to be understood is like asking
for a discount or an allowance or an
accommodation all of which make the
relationship more expensive for the

[07:01]
relationship more expensive for the
other person in many cases if you're
interested in keeping that relationship
it's a better idea to change your own
behavior the fact of the matter is that
when people are complicated or difficult
or demanding they're harder to love now
if you're not looking to be loved then
just keep on keeping on however if you
are looking to be loved then it makes
sense to strive
to be
lovable and how do you do that if you're
complicated then make yourself simple if
you're difficult then make yourself
easygoing and if you're demanding then
make yourself adaptable it's possible to
love anyone however it's harder to love
difficult complicated and demanding
people and it's easier to Love Simple
easygoing and adaptable people why
because it's more expensive to love the
challenging people you have to pay more

[08:01]
challenging people you have to pay more
for Less with these folks and is that
something that you're very keen on doing
probably not right so it's probably fair
to expect that no one else is very keen
on doing that for you either now I know
that make yourself simple is easy to say
and hard to do but let me tell you
striving in this direction will not only
improve the quality of your
relationships it will significantly
improve the quality of your own life
as well like it's hard to go through
life as a complicated person it's hard
to go through life as a difficult person
like in your own subjectivity it does
not feel good to be that person most
complicated difficult and demanding
people are not happy and contented
individuals so rather than working to
get everyone around you to accommodate
your complicated difficult and demanding
nature further entrenching it in your
behavioral repertoire TW it's a better

[09:00]
behavioral repertoire TW it's a better
idea to do what you can to work to
simplify your own complication to
resolve your own difficulty and to
assade your own demands this will not
only improve your own subjective
experience it will make it much easier
for people to love you and be close to
you do you understand what do you think
does this fit with your own experience
