in how to love without emotional
attachment quantized comments
relationships are more than just putting
the milk for someone i think you've
oversimplified the dynamics the point
where this makes no sense well which
makes less sense the argument that
relationships are predicated on the
provision of value and when no value
exists the relationship ceases or the
argument that people will
enter into and abide in relationships
where no value is present
at the opportunity cost of foregoing
relationships where value might be
present
that second argument seems to make much
less sense to me than the one that i'm
advocating people simply don't
enter into and persist in relationships
out of a moral or ethical duty they do
so because they feel like there's some
benefit that can be accrued as a
consequence of that relationship which
is the provision of milk the milk is
withdrawn the only thing that remains is
duty
