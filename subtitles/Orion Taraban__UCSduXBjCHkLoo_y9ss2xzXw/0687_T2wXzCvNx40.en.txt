I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is you
always break your own heart regardless
of how it feels this is the reality of
the situation technically speaking no
one can break your heart and I'm saying
this irrespective of what the other
party did even if they lied to you even
if they cheated on you even if they
betrayed you they didn't break your
heart because they couldn't only you can
break your own heart and this is what we
see in all cases of heartbreak if we
look carefully enough let's discuss why
this might be true it's important to
appreciate that one way or another all
relationships end and if you think about
it not much is actually lost when a
relationship ends that's because nothing
that happened in a relationship nothing
that you felt nothing that you built

[01:01]
that you felt nothing that you built
nothing that you experienced can
actually be taken from you when a
relationship ends that's because all of
that is in the past and everything in
the past is completely and indefinitely
secure because everything in the past is
completely and indefinitely inaccessible
For Better or Worse no one can change
the past and this fact does not depend
on current or future conditions like
everything that has happened in a
relationship ship is just as safe and
secure in the past when a relationship
continues through time as when it is
terminated in the present moment in
point of fact when a relationship ends
only one thing is really lost and it's
the loss of this one thing that is
actually responsible for your heartbreak
and that one thing that is lost is the
reasonable hope of a desired
future and this desired future isn't
something that you either have or ever

[02:00]
something that you either have or ever
had precisely because it's a future hope
and this of course means that from a
certain perspective you didn't even lose
that because you never had it to begin
with after all you have to have
something before you can lose it so this
one thing that you lose is actually an
elusory loss it's not an actual loss in
reality that said it definitely doesn't
feel like an elcer loss does it and
that's because this desired future has
been invested with a good deal of
emotionality and usually very positive
emotionality which is absolutely present
and real the most painful thing in the
world is the death of a dream the death
of a dream really really really hurts
especially when that dream has been
invested with the most sincere the most
precious and the most noble parts of
ourselves indeed that that dream might

[03:00]
ourselves indeed that that dream might
be quite beautiful a lively house with
happy children playing in the yard
Wedding Bells and champagne toasts
holding hands in the Rain the glory of
having made it work Despite All Odds
people can dream beautiful dreams and
the more beautiful the dream the harder
it is to kill it is difficult to
relinquish our highest most cherished
visions of the future irrespective of
the objective necessity for doing so
and this is why most serious
relationships require some measure of
grieving once they end one way or
another that said this grieving period
often lasts much longer than it needs to
this is because people often invest
these dreams of the future with the best
parts of themselves so when it comes
time to kill a hope that has become
unrealizable it can feel like killing
the best parts of themselves it's not
really but it can feel that way and

[04:00]
really but it can feel that way and
that's an unbearable position for many
people to be in like it takes an unusual
amount of ruthlessness and
self-discipline to be able to do that so
many people mistake the dream for the
best parts of themselves tremble at the
thought of cutting those parts out of
themselves and abide and heartbreak much
longer than may be
necessary and this is why you always
break your own heart you're the one who
invested that dream with the best parts
of yourself no one did that for you or
could have done that for you even if
they wanted to and of course if you
didn't invest that dream with the best
parts of yourself you wouldn't now be
squirming in pain but this is actually a
good
thing why well since you did it you can
undo it on the other hand if it were
done to you or for you then it would be
much harder to undo without the
participation of the other party which
at this point you might not be able to
count

[05:01]
count
on if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace
once you read the value of others you'll
never look at relationships the same way
again now available in ebook audiobook
and paperback formats the links are in
the
description let's get back to it the
technical term for investing something
with emotion and importance is
cathexis which is why the process of
divesting something of that same emotion
and importance is known as decathexis

[06:00]
and importance is known as decathexis
and though it may not always feel that
way this is something that you have some
measure of control over you have some
measure of control over what you imbue
with emotion and importance which means
that you have some measure of control
over what you strip of emotion and
importance decathexis is the process of
taking back the best parts of yourself
that you may have invested into other
things and it's essential that you take
these parts back before you kill the
dream of the desired future for two
reasons in the first place as previously
discussed it's very difficult to kill a
dream while it is still invested with
these parts of yourself and this means
that people who don't decathect will
feel more pain following the end of a
relationship much longer than they need
to however there's a second very
important reason why it's important to
decathect a dream before killing it if
people actually succeed in killing the
dream without de cathecting which though

[07:01]
dream without de cathecting which though
difficult actually is possible
especially if the individuals in
question are motivated by sufficient
pain and Desperation then they might
succeed in killing the best parts of
themselves the sweet and hopeful and
loving and Noble and beautiful
dimensions of their psyche and that is a
very big and ultimately
self-inflicted
loss like I'd like you to consider that
no matter how badly another person Burns
you in a breakup or a divorce you
actually succeed in burning yourself
even worse if you end up killing your
heart as a
result this is the loss of something
actual whereas the loss of a desired
future as previously discussed is
technically only the loss of something
potential I understand why people do
this the amount of pain that people can
experience in the wake of losing hope in
a desired future can feel absolutely

[08:02]
a desired future can feel absolutely
unbearable like it hurts to breathe it
hurts to Blink everything is painful and
people can't abide in that degree of
pain indefinitely so I can understand
why people do what they do in order to
escape that pain however if the only way
to escape feeling pain is destroy one's
capacity to feel
anything then really that should only be
done as an absolutely Last
Resort the ability to take those parts
back after the end of a relationship
depends on your ability to recognize
that the person or the relationship that
you lost was not so special in and of
itself but by virtue of what you put
into it and once you succeed in doing
that it's easier to see the dream for
what it is namely a dream it was a
possible vision of the future that that
had no basis in reality irrespective of

[09:02]
had no basis in reality irrespective of
where the the relationship ended and
then it's easier to let go as I
explained in how to let go of someone
the more you experience pain and
resentment and anger and jealousy the
more you emotionally cling to an object
just like letting go of something
physically letting go of something
emotionally requires a kind of
unclenching it's doing less not more
that causes something to fall out of our
grip and that's incomparably easier to
do if you're able to replace the
negative emotions you may be
experiencing if not with positive
emotions then at least with neutral ones
in any case your heartbreak is the death
of a dream that you extrapolated in your
mind is a consequence of your love and
or attraction and there's nothing wrong
with that dream it might be a beautiful
vision of a potential reality however if
we're honest there might have been
something wrong with its ution and it's

[10:00]
something wrong with its ution and it's
important not to confuse the two take
back the good parts of yourself that you
invested in that relationship they're
yours anyway learn any lessons you may
need to learn about the implementation
of Dreams in reality and when you're
ready keep moving forward you don't need
to stop loving just because you've been
burned in the past though you may need
to learn not to gamble with more than
you can afford to
lose what do you think does this fit
