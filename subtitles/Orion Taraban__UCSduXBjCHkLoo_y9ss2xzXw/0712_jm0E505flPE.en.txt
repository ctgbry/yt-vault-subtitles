men run into trouble when they want the
woman to do more than a woman can do or
will do there are many things that a
woman can do in a relationship but there
are at least as many things that a woman
can't do and unfortunately these are the
things that men tend to go to women for
like a woman isn't going to make you
happy she can't she's not going to bring
you peace she can't she isn't going to
complete your life she can't only you
can make yourself happy only you can
bring yourself peace and only you can
complete your life don't look to a woman
for those things that's expecting the
Cherry to be the Sunday and that's not
fair to her because you're setting her
up for failure which will only lead to
anger resentment and disappointment it's
a much better idea men to get those
things from the rest of your Sunday like
if you have the ice cream and the syrup
and the whipped cream you're going to be
pretty happy and satisfied with or
without the Cherry
