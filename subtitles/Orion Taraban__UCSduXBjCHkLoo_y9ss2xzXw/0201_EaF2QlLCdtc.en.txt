i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is to be
free
you cannot do whatever you want
now there's a little asterisk next to
this one which i'll explain at the end
of the episode but in the vast majority
of cases it's true that to be free you
cannot do whatever you want the best way
to understand this is by looking at the
natural universe there are many many
examples of this principle but here's
one
consider the earth as it travels around
the sun in its annual revolution
it has been freely moving around the sun
in an unobstructed fashion
for billions of years
that is some pretty legitimate free
motion
however
it's only able to persist in this
freedom because it is restricted
in its orbit
if the earth were to move further from
the sun then its orbit would become so
elongated that it would be slingshot

[01:01]
elongated that it would be slingshot
into space
and would likely be consumed by a gas
giant and if the earth were to move
closer to the sun then the gravitational
pull would be too great and it would
spiral into a solar collision if the
earth were to exercise freedom of
movement arbitrarily
it would soon no longer be free to move
as it would be destroyed
it can only persist in freedom
if it restricts itself to move in
alignment with the greater system in
which it is a part
a freedom today
that isn't a freedom tomorrow
isn't really freedom do you understand
freedom is only true freedom if in
choosing it you can persist in being
freedom that cannot persist in itself is
by definition subject to a more powerful
force
in choosing that course of action you
are choosing subjection to the more
powerful force this is not freedom this

[02:01]
powerful force this is not freedom this
is destruction in slow motion
so what does this mean
this means that if we want to continue
to enjoy freedom in our lives for
emotion free will free choice
we have to make choices that align
ourselves with that which allows that
freedom to continue to exist
to return to my previous metaphor we
have to find the right orbit
and most choices will not do that
most choices will tend to limit our
freedom
and move us toward destruction over time
because they're just not sustainable
you want to eat whatever you want
you can
but that's not really sustainable you'll
run into health problems and sooner or
later you won't be free to eat anything
you want to do whatever you want in
society
you can but that's not really
sustainable you'll run into legal
problems and sooner or later you won't
be free to do anything in society
you want to spend money however you want

[03:00]
you want to spend money however you want
you can
but it's not really sustainable you'll
run into financial problems and sooner
or later you won't be free to spend any
money
okay however there's one exception to
all this the asterisk that i mentioned
at the beginning of the episode
the only way you can remain free by
doing whatever you want is if you
succeed in disciplining your wanting to
such a degree
that you only want that which will allow
you to continue to be free i'll say that
again the only way you can remain free
by doing whatever you want is if you
succeed in disciplining your wanting to
such a degree that you only want
that which will allow you to continue to
be free
if you can do that
then you're free to want whatever you
want in perfect safety
and if you can please reach out because
i'd like to study under you the vast
majority of us myself included are just

[04:00]
majority of us myself included are just
not there yet so it's important to
discipline our wanting and to be prudent
about how we exercise our freedoms today
so that we can continue to exercise our
freedoms tomorrow
