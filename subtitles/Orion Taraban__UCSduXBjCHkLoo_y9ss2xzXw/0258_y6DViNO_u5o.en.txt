topic of today's short talk is the core
emotional wound this is a very important
psychological concept so we're going to
take a deeper dive today but before we

so what is the core emotional wound this
is something that is generally inflicted
on folks in the context of their primary
attachment relationships which means
that it generally occurs in the context
of their relationships with their
parents in childhood
and these attachment problems could have
been caused by neglect like the parent
was withdrawn emotionally unavailable or
absent
or by over involvement which means the
parent was invasive violating and
devouring
paradoxically these wounds can both

[01:01]
paradoxically these wounds can both
create the tendency to replicate the
wound through identification with the
parent
and create the tendency to avoid
replicating the wound through counter
identification with the parent
these wounds distort the lens of
subjectivity through which individuals
perceive reality
this means that people who suffer from
core emotional wounds will Harbor ideas
about themselves other people and the
world that warp the direct experience of
reality to a greater or lesser extent
the greater the wound the greater the
Distortion now every core emotional
wound is fundamentally unique however
there are two main wounds that people
are subject to suffer from
they are I'm not good enough
and I'm not lovable
behind the scenes there are some
commonalities between these two core
emotional wounds perhaps I'm a bad
person is the fundamental wound behind

[02:02]
person is the fundamental wound behind
them both but I think they're distinct
enough to let's say conceptually
disambiguate them
in general the wound
I'm not good enough is created in
attachment problems with the father I.E
daddy issues and in general the wound
I'm not lovable is created in attachment
problems with the mother I.E mommy
issues
and keep in mind that these are not
mutually exclusive some lucky folks have
both mommy and daddy issues
now what does this really have to do
with anything well people deal with
their core emotional wounds through
compensatory behaviors for instance a
person who believes I'm not good enough
will strive to be super competent
successful and perfectionistic because
that's how a person essentially Bargains
with the world for the respect and
validation they did not receive from the
father in appropriate quantities

[03:00]
father in appropriate quantities
on the other hand a person who believes
I'm not lovable will strive to be
Charming seductive and people pleasing
because that's how a person Bargains
with the world for the love and
affection they did not receive from the
mother inappropriate quantities
so folks these folks kind of believe
that they have to trick people into
liking them because they think they're
not sufficiently lovable without
manifesting these behaviors
finally when his or her compensatory
behaviors are checked threatened or
thwarted the person suffering from that
core emotional wound is thrown into a
profound state of emotional
dysregulation
depending on the size and intensity of
the wound a person in such a situation
could even be suicidal because the
failure of the compensatory behaviors
now constitutes an existential threat to
their very being serious stuff
okay there's definitely a lot more to

[04:00]
okay there's definitely a lot more to
say about core emotional wounds but
that's enough for a general overview

is something that a good psychotherapist
