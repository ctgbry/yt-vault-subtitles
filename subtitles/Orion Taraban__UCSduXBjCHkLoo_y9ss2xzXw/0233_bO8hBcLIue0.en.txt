in the comments section of my recent
episode what men and women look for in
sexual partners numerous people
suggested that i was wrong in my
assessment
indicating that women actually want
everything they want the sexy body and
they want the lifestyle as well and i'm
here to tell you that yeah okay
if they can get it i mean if this is
true of men and women
uh they if they can get everything that
they want they're gonna take it the fact
of the matter is that we can't always
get what we want and when we realize
that we can't always get what we want we
also realize that the things that we
want aren't equally important to us and
that there's a sort of rank ordered
priority to the factors that we're
looking for in a partner
and in general
if a woman can't get what she wants she
is more willing and likely to sacrifice
physical attraction
for
lifestyle opportunity
