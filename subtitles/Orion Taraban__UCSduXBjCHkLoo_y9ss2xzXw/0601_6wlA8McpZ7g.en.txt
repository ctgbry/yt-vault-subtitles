I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
marriage ultimatum so I've done a number
of consultations with guys who are
struggling with this very issue the
story is always the same the man has
been dating a woman for a certain amount
of time and the woman feels that that
time has been sufficient for that man to
have made the decision as to whether or
not he's going to marry her and because
she feels the time has lapsed she begins
to put more more emotional pressure on
him to enter into a legal arrangement
with her and she typically does this
either through a combination of
emotional manipulation tactics designed
to induce shame guilt or fear in the man
Andor creating difficulties by acting
more withdrawn or disagreeable and note
to all you ladies out there neither of
these strategies is a particularly good
idea with respect to your goals I'll do
an episode on how men actually decide to
get married very soon so stay tuned for

[01:02]
get married very soon so stay tuned for
that in any case these men are generally
legitimately conflicted they clearly
care about the women in question and are
nervous about the prospect of losing
them and they also have valid concerns
about radically changing the structure
of their relationships concerns that all
too often fall deaf on their women's
ears which does little to reassure them
these men are struggling and they don't
know what to do so I've created created
an analogy to help them understand what
they're going through the analogy is
this at some point in his life
practically every man has been in a
situation where he's dealing with a
woman he's not particularly attracted to
and may not even like but he's dealing
with her because he's horny and he wants
to have sex it is what it is now when
guys are dealing with a woman like that
they tend to get more aggressive with

[02:00]
they tend to get more aggressive with
respect to securing the sexual encounter
and the reason they do this is because
there isn't anything else they want from
her to this man the woman in question
isn't funny or charming so he doesn't
find her enjoyable to just have around
and she isn't wise or intelligent so she
isn't teaching him something that he's
interested in learning and she isn't
useful or helpful so she isn't
furthering his goals she's not any of
these things if she did provide other
ways in which he could meaningfully
benefit from the relationship then he
might be able to content himself without
the sexual element but in the absence of
these ways there's no reason for him to
stick around and deal with that woman
without sex he wants one thing because
he's not getting anything else that he
wants and without that one thing there
is no basis for further interaction and
that's what motivates men in these
circumstances to be more aggressive it's
it's like hey I'm cool either way but if

[03:02]
it's like hey I'm cool either way but if
you're not going to move things forward
I can't really deal with you and I'm
going to move on and that's a rational
decision given that man's perception of
the situation I get you fellas but
here's the thing what you do to a woman
under those circumstances is analogous
to what a woman does to you when she's
pressuring you to marry
her let that sink in if there were other
ways in which she felt she was
benefiting from that Arrangement if she
was content with your extrapolated
lifestyle and the things you did
together and the opportunities you
create for her and the status she enjoys
in relating to you and the good sex that
you consistently have and she could see
no better
options that could give her more of what
she wants then she wouldn't be as pushy
for marriage this is because being pushy
is a
risk sometimes when you rock the boat
you end up falling out this isn't always

[04:02]
you end up falling out this isn't always
a bad thing of course as it functionally
forces the pushy person to move on to a
different relationship where she might
stand a better chance of getting what
she wants but a woman is generally pushy
for marriage to the extent that she's
not getting anything else that she wants
from that relationship and the real
kicker here is that she might not be
getting anything else from the
relationship because you already gave it
to her remember to want is to lack so if
she already has it she's not going to
want it so if marriage is the only thing
you haven't given her yet then what else
is she G to want and if she's not
getting anything else to compensate her
for not getting the thing that she wants
then she's going to get more pushy it
makes sense now before I go any further

consultation the link is in the
description okay let's get back to it
now don't get me wrong a woman can want
whatever she wants and if she's not
getting what she wants then barring some
other commitment to the contrary she has
every right to leave that Rel
relationship and move on but a woman who
acts that way
men doesn't love you more than she loves
what she
wants Love's highest good is simply to
continue to exist in the presence of the
loved one that's it everything else
pales in comparison a woman who
threatens to leave you if you don't
marry her is functionally telling you
that she wants things more than she
wants want to continue to be with

[06:01]
wants want to continue to be with
you she doesn't love you in this moment
she is looking to do business so don't
confuse the two the upshot is from the
perspective of both men and women the
more someone is pushy the less you
should give them what they want like
women don't have sex with guys who are
pushy about having sex with you they're
pushy to the extent that they don't want
anything else from you because if they
did want something else and they were
getting it they wouldn't be so
aggressive by the same token men don't
marry women who are pushy about getting
married they're pushy to the extent that
they don't want anything else from you
because if they did want something else
and they were getting it they wouldn't
be so
aggressive as I've discussed at length
in another episode women treat men the
way men treat jobs when a woman is pushy
from Marriage she's functionally saying
look I've been in this role for two
years five years 10 years whatever and I

[07:02]
years five years 10 years whatever and I
want a promotion and I want a promotion
to permanent job
security if you do not give me said
promotion I am going to go to a
different company and it's like fair
enough ladies but men what you have to
understand is that a woman who engages
you like this isn't coming from a place
of Love she's coming from a place of
motivated self-interest she's looking to
do business which is after all precisely
what a relationship is for so that's not
necessarily the problem what is
potentially the problem is a woman who
is assertively negotiating for something
of great benefit to her without offering
anything of great benefit in return
doing this is bad business and will
likely cause the woman to be rejected
especially if the man has any
optionality to speak of men if she's

[08:02]
optionality to speak of men if she's
going to do business then you got to do
business ask yourself what would I hope
to get out of this what are the costs
what are the risks are they sufficiently
offset by the potential benefits I hope
to acre from this situation and both
sides need to remember that at this
point it's not personal it's just
business it's not personal if a woman
decides to lateral to a different
company with a more attractive
compensation package after all it's much
easier to remain loyal to one's
perceived best interest and it's not
personal if a man decides that a certain
employee is better suited for a role as
an independent contributor than as a
corporate officer after all people don't
become the CEO simply due to
seniority it also means that the people
men and women who are most likely to get
what they want are the ones who seem not

[09:01]
what they want are the ones who seem not
to want these things like the guy who
doesn't seem to care one way or the
other if he has sex is way more likely
to get laid than the guy who is pushing
aggressive for intercourse why because
his apparent indifference kind of makes
the sexual encounter feels safer for a
woman to
proceed by the same token the woman who
doesn't seem to care one way or the
other if she gets married is more likely
to get married than the woman who is
pushy and aggressive for a ring why
because her apparent indifference kind
of makes matrimony feel safer for a man
to proceed it's the same thing
the person who has more to lose needs to
be reassured needs to be made to feel
safe in order to proceed with sex the
party who has more to lose is the woman
with marriage the party who has more to

[10:00]
with marriage the party who has more to
lose is the man to the extent that men
want to marry women who love them men
will paradoxically be most motivated in
marrying women who do not seem to care
about whether or not they get married
