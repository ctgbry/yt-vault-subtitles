I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
biological clock doesn't exist
so this one's going to blow some mines
and melt some faces but the biological
clock at least in the sense that most
people understand it does not actually
exist
so what do most people understand by the
term biological clock what most people
understand is that women feel a
pressured urge to reproduce that arises
from their biological processes as they
get closer and closer to the Terminus of
their reproductive window
and I'm here to tell you that that does
not exist
and there are two obvious reasons why
that does not exist
first of all while it makes sense that
nature would endow women with a powerful
biological incentive to reproduce
this would only make sense if this

[01:00]
this would only make sense if this
incentive were felt most strongly when
women were the most fertile and most
likely to carry healthy viable Offspring
to term namely when they were young
if nature endowed women with a strong
biological urge to reproduce it doesn't
make sense that it would arise near the
end of their reproductive window when
women have a lower overall chance of
getting pregnant and a higher overall
chance of experiencing complications
with their pregnancies
that would be stupid and nature while
many things is not stupid so that's
obvious reason number one
obvious reason number two is that if the
biological clock as we commonly
understand it actually existed we would
see throughout history a pretty common
pattern to childbirths throughout most
of human history women became mothers

[02:00]
of human history women became mothers
fairly young in their early 20s if the
biological clock existed in the way that
we understand it we would see women
having children at 22 24 26
and then again at 36 38 and 40.
we would commonly see this large gap
between like Offspring cohorts from the
same mother
and we don't see this very often it's a
fairly uncommon situation for a woman
who had multiple children in her 20s to
have more children in her late 30s
so either these women did not feel a
powerful biological urge to reproduce
near the end of their reproductive
windows or they were sufficiently
disciplined with respect to not acting
upon it
that's obvious reason number two
so we can now appreciate the biological
clock as we understand it doesn't exist
now that said women do have a biological

[03:01]
now that said women do have a biological
clock associated with reproduction but
it's not on the scale of a lifetime it's
on the scale of a month
what we know is that women are much more
interested in sex
that they are more likely not just to
initiate but initiate riskier sexual
interactions like the ones more likely
to result in pregnancy when they're
ovulating
and this makes sense from a biological
perspective this biological clock
motivates women to seek out sex during
the monthly window when they're most
likely to get pregnant and riskier
doesn't just mean sex without protection
Research indicates for example that
married women are much more likely to
cheat when they're ovulating especially
when their committed partners are less
attractive
and this also makes sense from a
biological perspective the field calls

[04:00]
biological perspective the field calls
this women's mixed mating strategy in
which they attempt to secure genes from
an attractive man and resources from a
committed provider again nature is many
things but it's not stupid
that's a biological clock that's a
woman's biology saying you need to go
out right now and have sex and make
babies
and why this would happen every month at
Peak fertility but not across the
lifespan makes absolutely no sense

[05:00]
now
just to be clear I'm not suggesting that
women don't experience a pressured
urgency to have children as they near
the end of their reproductive Windows
especially if they haven't yet had
children
I believe that that exists what I'm
suggesting is that it's a misnomer to
call this a biological clock it's
probably truer to call it a
psychological clock
in my opinion this pressured sense of
urgency is really related to the fear of
missing out
it's a psychological recognition that an
experience that they haven't yet had
might be lost to them forever
in the game theory strategy most
prevalent today most young women are
kind of prioritizing the variety of life
they want to have every experience they
want to do everything and I can
sympathize they also reasonably believe
that taking on the responsibilities of

[06:00]
that taking on the responsibilities of
motherhood in their 20s might prevent
some of these experiences like traveling
the world or prioritizing their
friendships or dating casually or
investing in their careers or literally
any of the hundreds of things they could
be doing that are exceedingly more
difficult to do if you have a young
child
but over the course of a lifetime many
women come around to the fact that being
a mother and raising children is
something that they would like to do or
at least that it's something that they
wouldn't want to miss out on
and that is why this pressure and this
sense of urgency comes up in childless
women not in women who have had children
in their 20s but childless women in
their late 30s as they approach the
Terminus of their reproductive window
and this may not be do so much to a
strong desire to have children as to an
anxiety about missing out on the
opportunity of ever having them

[07:01]
opportunity of ever having them
that door would be closed to them
forever
and all other things being equal most
people want what they can't have more
than they otherwise would
so a lot of women prioritize other
things in life and they assume that
they'll just be able to have a family
when they're ready
and then they get to their mid or late
30s and they realize that it's actually
much more difficult to attract a man for
marriage and kids
now than it would have been in their
early or mid-20s the game changes
significantly at 30 and men are expected
to make the same offer which typically
becomes more expensive as a function of
time
and that's why 80 percent of women who
ultimately end up childless arrive there
unintentionally
in my opinion if women want to do it all
it's a better strategy to secure
partners and children in their 20s when

[08:01]
partners and children in their 20s when
their smv is high and it's biologically
advantageous to do so and devote the 30s
to career and development once the kids
are in school then the other way around
one of the reasons for this is that
there is not really a point at which
women can stop making money or traveling
or spending time with their friends but
there is absolutely a point at which
women can stop having children
