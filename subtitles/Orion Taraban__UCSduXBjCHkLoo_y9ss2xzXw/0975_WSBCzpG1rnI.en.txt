I think what people had a problem with
is the idea that they are in a loving
relationship with their husband or wife
and that that relationship started as
transactional when it's offensive to
them. Like the the concept of all
relationships being transactional uh
they might find is offensive. Well, put
it this way. It's like everybody is
trying to secure relationships with
their perceived best option. Yeah. So,
they ended up with their partner because
that was the best person who would have
them on some level. We can't necessarily
argue that that person had a better
option that they actually could have
secured and forwent that for this
worseer option. So that person did some
sort of value calculation. Maybe not
with numbers but on the level of
quantity. It's like this person might be
better for me than that person. And once
that kind of gets established in a
person's mind, that's where that's where
they go and that's where they stay.
Yeah. You're saying but you're saying
the quiet part loud. Meaning like women
don't want to believe I made a value
calculation to choose Brock over Chad.

calculation to choose Brock over Chad.
They want to believe it was vibe or
energy or fate or but when their
girlfriends say that they think that you
can do better, that's what they're
saying. They're making a value
calculation just on the level of
quantity, not on the level of, you know,
numeric value. In order for there to be
a value calculation, there's value
exchange. It has to be transactional.
And again, that's I think a lot of
people have a hard time with
