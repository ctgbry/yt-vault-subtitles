How do you sort of test your own
theories and wisdom like by by what how
do you measure them um for validity and
truth? Yeah, for me what really started
to turn my life around especially in the
domain of dating and relationships was
not was to surrender my models like my
models are what had led to my lack of
success in that space. I thought that I
knew what women wanted, I thought I knew
what caused relationships to succeed and
my models and assumptions of reality
preceded reality. And after just one
more instance of not getting the desired
outcome, I said, "Well, screw it." It's
like, if I knew how to do this, I I
wouldn't be in this situation. So maybe
my fundamental assumptions about women
and relationships and dating are are
wrong. So, I'm going to approach this
the true spirit of science, which is I
don't know. And I'm going to let the

don't know. And I'm going to let the
outcome of the experiment guide my
process and to build my models of
reality based on what worked. And that
led to some very sometimes uncomfortable
and counterintuitive places. But that's
sort of my model of truth is does the
plane fly? Like I'm I don't want to hear
anybody's theory of aerodynamics if they
haven't gotten into the plane that was
based on that principle and they could
fly across the Atlantic.
