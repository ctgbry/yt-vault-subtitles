i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
love is an adverb
so what is love
i have this funny way of answering this
question
i call it my parts of speech model of
love and it kind of goes like this
the most basic rudimentary understanding
of love is that love is a noun
it's a feeling which is a noun
it's a word that you say which is a noun
it's a marriage license which is a noun
that's the lowest comprehension
a higher comprehension of love is that
it's a verb
it's an action
you can say that you love someone but do
your actions actually align with that
confession
better to have the actions without the
confession than the other way around
so verb love can be acts of service
playfulness affection devotion you have
to do things or else it will be very
difficult to communicate love

[01:00]
difficult to communicate love
now this is pretty good but one of the
liabilities associated with verb love is
that people have different ideas about
what another person has to do
for them to be able to receive love
and sometimes they can believe that if
another person doesn't do those things
then that other person doesn't love them
and so people miss out on opportunities
to both give and receive love when they
abide at this level of comprehension
in my opinion the highest understanding
of love is that it's an adverb that is
love is a quality of action it's a way
of doing something
true love to coin a phrase
is
loving fulliness
you can do anything with love you can
say yes with love you can sing there
with love
you can agree with love you can disagree
with love you can approach with love you
can avoid with love

[02:00]
can avoid with love
it's a quality of action
and this kind of loving fullness can
permeate your being and radiate through
everything that you do
and i think this is an important
thing to keep in mind because it opens
the door for us to receive love in more
ways across a broader spectrum of
behaviors
we could have a finer relationship with
love
if we become increasingly sensitive to
the quality of another's action
over and above what they do
and how they feel
it's a more authentic and vibrant
experience
i hope that made sense
