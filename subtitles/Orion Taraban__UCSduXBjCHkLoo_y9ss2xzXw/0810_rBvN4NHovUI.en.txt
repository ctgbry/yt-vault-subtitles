now this isn't just supported by the
literature it's backed up by my own
personal experience as well like someone
might consider himself a diabetic I
consider myself a depressive I struggled
with severe depression for many years
mostly in my teens and 20s and I'm very
happy to report that I haven't been
depressed for a very long time knock on
wood that said I don't think I'm out of
the woods in fact I've come to accept
that there is a tendency a vulnerability
to depression that lives inside of me
and might not ever go away for as long
as I live hence I consider myself a
depressive and on some level it's this
acceptance that helps me stay n-
depressed as believing I was somehow
invulnerable to depression might
motivate me to do certain things that
would make it more likely for the
depression to return however because I
have accepted the reality of my
condition and because I have made a
number of changes to my life over the
years I haven't had to deal with
depression for quite some time I managed
the depression so well that it has
functionally become invisible
