And I remember one older lady, she was
really awesome cuz she was super
self-aware and very outspoken. She would
debate me a lot on this and she would
go, "No, we [music] need as a group, we
need to withhold sex from men because
that's how we get what we want." And I
was like, "Damn, you said the quiet part
out loud."
&gt;&gt; That's interesting. So there is an
ancient Greek play called
um Lissrada. Do you know this play?
&gt;&gt; It's by the comedian Aristophanes. Okay.
And I made an episode about it because
the the whole plot of this comedy is all
of the husbands in
Athens, I think, were out at war. They
were constantly campaigning here and
there, and the wives were getting sick
of all this. So, the wives get together
in act one, and they basically make this
blood oath that no woman will have sex
with her husband until the husbands end
the war. And the rest of the play is how
that plays out. And at first, the men
kind of laugh it off as, "Oh, women are
going to be crawling back to this

going to be crawling back to this
monster pretty soon." And [laughter]
that doesn't happen. And then the men
start to sneak out and be like, "Come
on, baby. I I just need a little bit
something." And sometimes the women
almost fold because they want it to. And
but they hold strong and eventually the
men stop the war and everyone kind of
lives happily ever after.
&gt;&gt; It's Greece. I figured you were going to
say they were banging each other by the
end of the
&gt;&gt; They might have, but maybe that gets
old. I'm not sure.
&gt;&gt; So, the uh the idea here is that women
can and do control their sexuality for
political or ideological reasons. The
issue is that it worked in this
fictitious play because it was a unified
community. It would never work in
