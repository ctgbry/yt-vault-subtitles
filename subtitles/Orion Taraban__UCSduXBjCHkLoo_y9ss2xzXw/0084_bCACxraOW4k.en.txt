i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
create the structure that you can
surrender to
humans need structure
those without it sort of drift through
life which while superficially romantic
is actually much more difficult than it
seems especially the older that you
become
we thrive in structure because structure
is what provides the opportunity for
goal-directed activity
it creates meaning because it provides a
context in which our striving makes
sense
nature does not provide that organically
we have to impose structure onto nature
in order to create the possibility of
purposeful action for ourselves
now that structure can come from one of
two places either externally or
internally
it's much easier for folks to accept
externally imposed structure
to surrender to that
i mean think about it

[01:00]
i mean think about it
which is more compelling to motivate
compliance you telling yourself that you
want to work out at the end of the day
or that your personal trainer is
expecting you at the at the gym
it's just easier to surrender the
expectation of others
that said the danger of externally
imposed structure is that we can't ever
expect that structure to perfectly align
with our own interests and desires
and the externally imposed structure
while providing us some benefit
generally serves the ends of the one who
created it
so if we want a better match between our
values and our goal directed activity we
have to create it for ourselves
the issue is that an internally imposed
structure is much harder to surrender to
however this is a skill that can be
developed through repetition
for instance we don't train children and
students to create internally imposed
structure
rather we train them to be obedient and
compliant to authority parents teachers

[02:00]
compliant to authority parents teachers
priests
and the externally imposed structure
associated with authority's interests
so it might take some time to develop
this capacity for creating internally
imposed structure in yourself
begin in small ways
a great way to do this is to treat your
word as if it had the same authority as
an externally imposed expectation
treat your word like a legally binding
contract with a business partner and
then surrender to your word
fulfill your obligation whether you like
it or not
without surrendering to a structure you
drift
however if you only surrender to
externally imposed structure then on
some level you'll likely remain
unfulfilled
the key to fulfillment in life is to
create the structure that you can
surrender to
and to practice in a disciplined and
consistent way surrendering to that
structure as if it had the force of an
externally imposed contract
