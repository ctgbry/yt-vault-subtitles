now the reason why people tend to lose
this 10-second battle is that they open
this little door in their minds
sometimes just to crack and entertain
the possibility of not doing the thing
that they had previously committed to
most often this takes the form of
checking in with themselves on what they
feel like doing as I've discussed
previously once you make a commitment to
do or not do something your feelings no
longer matter you just do it you Channel
your inner Postman and you deliver the
fing mail irrespective of whether it's
raining or snowing or hailing you make
your appointed rounds that's it this
means that it's unnecessary at best to
confirm whether you still feel like
doing the thing you committed to and
dangerous at worst so this question do I
still feel like doing that is a terrible
terrible question to ask yourself like
in order to make progress you might have
to remove that question from your
internal dialogue altogether
