so many guys have been in that situation
and self from approach anxiety I would
everybody myself and and I'll even take
it a step further I would argue that
approach anxiety is probably the number
one culprit for why so many guys suffer
with women because they simply don't
work the volume required to get the
dating life that they want and it stems
from Pro apprach anxiety where does that
fear come from you do need some reps to
get over it and when I used to go out I
had this rule so this might be of
practical use to your viewers guys
listen up that when I was going out to
get numbers I had a rule for myself that
I had to approach within 5 Seconds of
seeing a woman that I felt authentically
attracted to because I knew that if I
hesitated more than 5 seconds I was
screwed even if I eventually did work up
the courage to approach her later on I
was too in my head I was too
self-involved I was already thinking
about what to say the the fact of the
matter is doesn't really matter what you
say the point is you have to put
yourself in front of the woman and serve
the ball
