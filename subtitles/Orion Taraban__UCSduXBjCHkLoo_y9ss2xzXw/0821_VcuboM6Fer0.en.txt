why did I go through the trouble of like
becoming a psychologist or why did I
before that get really good at test prep
and teach people about the gr and learn
how to do that and before that why did I
become an actor and it's like because
people weren't just giving me money
people weren't just giving me sex people
weren't just giving me entertainment and
flights and dinners like and those
things sound nice don't they right
they're not necessary but they sure make
life a little bit more pleasant so I had
to earn them which is what most guys
have to do and we have to earn them
generally indirectly by becoming very
good at something which takes a long
time and to compete successfully with
other men often in the arena of life now
ever since I was 16 people were offering
to buy me food or to pay for my tuition
or to take me out every night of the
week or to give me relationships and
love would I have worked as hard as I
have in my life no I know that
enough about myself it's like that's
just too seductive it's like the one
ring of power man it's like very few
people could actually resist that
