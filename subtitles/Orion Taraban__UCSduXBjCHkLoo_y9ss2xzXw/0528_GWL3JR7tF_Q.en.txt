here's another reason why talking is
overrated how often has it happened in
your life that your partner has said to
you we need to talk and when you sat
down with his other person he or she
said I need you to know that last week
when we were having a discussion about
my mother I never felt so heard and
respected and validated in my life you
need to know that I'm very satisfied
with this relationship and I'm extremely
content with the way things are going
and I'm only concerned that I just might
not be able to love you any more than I
currently do like that never happens
does it and why is that because when
people say we need to talk it's because
somebody has a problem and they believe
that talking is going to resolve that
problem this is going to sound really
weird coming from a therapist but that
is often not the case only a small
subset of problems can really be solved
by talking about them and in many cases
talking about problems becomes a problem
in and of itself
