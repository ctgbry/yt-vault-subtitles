So, another reason why women get ghosted
is they don't understand that after sex
happens, the onus of the effort shifts
to them,
&gt;&gt; to the to the women,
&gt;&gt; to the women. Um, interesting. Perhaps
you've heard this said that men are the
gatekeepers of commitment and women are
the gatekeepers of sex. I heard that
book.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But in modern dating where sex precedes
commitment,
&gt;&gt; then we just come up against the women's
gatekeeping first. And this isn't even
really about men and women. It's about
who's like on the outside and who has
the power to let them in. So women have
the power to let men in sexually and sex
happens before commitment these days. So
the man's going to be making the effort.
He's running offense. She's running
defense
&gt;&gt; at first.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And sometimes women think cuz they get
kind of anchored there that after sex
happens that he's just going to keep
trying or keep escalating. And it's like
no sweetie, you have to make the effort.
You don't just hand over sex to the
every man that desires it from you.
Why is that man going to hand over

[01:00]
Why is that man going to hand over
commitment just because you want it? You
have to go get it. Now you are on
offense. He's on defense and he can let
you in or not. And so a lot of women
don't try. They don't make the effort.
And they also often don't know what to
do. They don't know how to secure a
man's commitment.
