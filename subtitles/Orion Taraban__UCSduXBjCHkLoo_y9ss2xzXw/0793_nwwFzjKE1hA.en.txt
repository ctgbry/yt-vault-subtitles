I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is put her
to work put her to work gentlemen this
is going to be an important episode for
you putting a woman to work is a very
important precept and it will help men
have the kinds of relationships they
tell me they're looking for with the
women of today so let's get to it a lot
of men complain to me that they can't
find women who are looking to provide
value in their relationships they're
finding takers not givers these men are
looking to get their needs met in a
relationship and they often lament that
the women they are meeting just seem
interested in kind of being taken care
of as if they were adult dependents and
while there absolutely are women who
just seem to want to be treated like
princesses or spoiled like bratty
children I would say the majority of
women aren't actually looking for this

[01:00]
women aren't actually looking for this
kind of
dynamic in my experience most women are
interested in helping and supporting the
men they really want to be in
relationships with the catch is they
need to really want to be in a
relationship with you in order for them
to enthusiastically show up in this way
so men can't conflate the fact that
apparently women aren't interested in
providing value to them with the fact
that women aren't interested in
providing value to men in general
as I've said before all men pay but the
more she likes you the greater the
discount if a woman doesn't really like
you if she doesn't feel that just being
with you is intrinsically valuable the
more she is going to demand either
directly or indirectly the provision of
value to compensate her for the
opportunity cost associated with
prioritizing a less attractive option
you it is what it is

[02:00]
you it is what it is
and when men invest in their own
attractiveness and level up their
Fitness and fashion and status and
wealth and game and humor and lifestyle
the more they will encounter women who
are not only interested but enthusiastic
about giving them what they
want this isn't something that is
discussed like at all in today's day and
age but most women actually want someone
to care for why do you think so many
single women have dogs or fur babies as
they call them most women kind of need
someone to worry about and fuss over and
nurture otherwise they feel something is
missing or they go a little off the
rails in fact this is the best
explanation I've ever heard for why
women disproportionately suffer from
anxiety disorders relative to men women
are twice twice as likely to be

[03:00]
are twice twice as likely to be
diagnosed with an anxiety disorder than
men are is it because their uterus or in
Greek their history is wandering around
their body causing trouble which is the
origin of the word
hysterical or is it possibly due to the
fact that women are alone in the 21st
century in a way that women have never
ever been alone in the history of
humanity like in terms of human
evolutionary history the single
independent woman is a newborn less than
one day old for hundreds of thousands of
years women lived with their families
and then lived with their husbands with
whom they started their own families if
a woman were to lose her husband she
would move in with one of her children
or the community would take care of her
a woman was like never alone so the
evolutionary explanation for high
anxiety in women is basically that women
have evolved to be anxious for two or

[04:01]
have evolved to be anxious for two or
three or five because the social role of
women has been to bear and raise
children who are often too stupid to
know what to be afraid of like a kid
will try to eat poisonous berries or
walk into a river or do all kinds of
stupid so women have evolved like
this heightened anxiety response because
they have had to care for things too
dumb to know what to fear they needed
excess
anxiety in any case a lot of women have
this Instinct this impulse to nurture
and help and care and when they don't
have someone to do these things for they
can go a little nutty the issue is that
they don't want to do these things for
just anyone which of course is perfectly
understandable they want to do them for
the right
men if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course

[05:03]
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available an ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description now modern courtship has
completely lost sight of this reality in
general women are considered the prize
and value is assumed to proceed from the
men to the women attractive women act
more and more like little celebrities
and Men despite they're complaining buy
into it and compete with each other for
the opportunity to buy them and
while this may be gratifying to some

[06:01]
while this may be gratifying to some
extent for the women to experience it
leaves this deeply ingrained impulse to
care and nurture unfulfilled which
generally destabilizes the
relationship and it's frankly
unsustainable from the men's perspective
this is because this is not the type of
relationship that most men want they
just kind of think it's what they have
to do to get the relationship they
really want this means that whether
they're aware of it or not most men are
playing a game of bait and switch with
women they think that if they care for
and nurture and invest in the
women okay then at some point the women
will be motivated to
reciprocate which is much closer to the
type of relationship they were looking
for to begin with the issue with this
strategy which I call the fairy booat
Captain is that once you start faing a
woman around you can never stop fing a

[07:03]
woman around you can never stop fing a
woman around like a fery booat captain
can't ever turn around and say to his
passenger hey um why don't you take me
where I want to go for a change huh that
passenger would get off the boat as
quickly as possible because that's not
what she signed up for even though that
Captain may have Faithfully performed
his duties for decades do you
understand as I discuss at length in my
book a man should put a woman in the
role he would like her to play in his
life as early in the courtship as
possible like if you want a first mate
don't invite her onto your ship as a
Pampered passenger this helps ensure not
only that everyone more or less
understands what they're signing up for
that the woman in question is actually a
good fit for the role you would like her
to
play consider hiring for a position in
the professional Arena self-service and

[08:00]
the professional Arena self-service and
structured interviews are notoriously
bad at giving employers good information
on their prospective
employees but do you know what does
provide good
information work samples like ask the
employee to do the job you would hire
them to do it is very difficult to fake
your way out of that one and it
completely bypasses a number of issues
like demand characteristics and social
desirability biases that plague these
other
approaches this means men that if you
want a woman who provides value in your
life you have to put her to work ask her
to do the things you want a woman to do
for you as early as possible this will
also allow you to quickly and reliably
gauge her interest and her character how
because a woman of either poor character
or low interest is going to bulk at your
request good this will help help prevent
you from misin esting your necessarily

[09:02]
you from misin esting your necessarily
limited resources in the wrong women
consider it once again from a
professional
standpoint if a manager were to approach
an employee and tell her hey you know
I've been thinking of you as a potential
lead for this new project and the
employee were to respond that's outside
my pay grade if you want more from me
then you need to pay me more You can
conclude a number of things either she
is not very committed to her job or she
is very
stupid like good luck getting a
promotion with that attitude and this is
because clever workers who are invested
in a particular career trajectory do not
see this new responsibility as a chore
they see it as an opportunity an
opportunity to show their quality to
demonstrate that they have executive
potential or whatever it is like how

[10:00]
potential or whatever it is like how
else do you expect to get the job if you
never get the chance to show that you've
got the chops for it it's only the
worker who isn't interested in the
promotion who complains about doing more
for less and why the would you
promote such a
worker a woman of good character who is
actually interested in you will see your
requests as
opportunities why as I've mentioned
previously women's best long-term
strategy and their best defense against
being used purely for sexual
gratification is to insinuate themselves
into the economy of the ship and they do
that by assuming
responsibility women I want you to
listen to me very carefully a man who
just wants to use you for sex won't ever
ask you to do anything
else this is because he wants to be able
to walk away from you at any time and

[11:01]
to walk away from you at any time and
keep his hands clean a man who asks
nothing from you is trying to keep his
Escape Route
clear this is because the more
responsibility a woman takes on that is
the more she insinuates herself into his
lifestyle the harder and harder it
becomes to extricate himself from that
relationship without some measure of
suffering or difficulty women a man
asking to do things for him is one of
the sure as signs of his authentic
interest in a long-term relationship see
these requests as opportunities to
demonstrate your value and as a hedge
against relational abandonment and men
don't be afraid to ask women to do
things for you you will either get what
you
want or force her to show her true
colors which is a win either way what do
you think does this fit with your own
