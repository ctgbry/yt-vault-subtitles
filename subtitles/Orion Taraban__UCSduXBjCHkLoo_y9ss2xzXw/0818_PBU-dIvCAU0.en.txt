I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is tests are
opportunities this is a really important
reframe if you want to make any kind of
meaningful progress in literally any
domain in life in this world men nothing
is handed to you everything of value
must be obtained through effort and
struggle however this process beset as
it is with tests and trials is often
disparaged by the individuals involved
many would prefer that the good in
question the money the woman The Virtue
were just handed over to them on a
silver platter and they kind of resent
the necessity of having to prove their
Worth to others in order to get what
they want unfortunately as far as I can
tell this necessity is necessary it's
unavoidable and since it is unavoidable
it is useful to reframe this reality to
accommodate a growth mindset

[01:00]
accommodate a growth mindset
and the best reframe that I've
personally been able to come up with is
that a test is not necessarily an
ordeal rather a test is an opportunity
to demonstrate Your Excellence or show
your Merit or exhibit your talent or
show off your Mastery in point of fact
many of these things are only ever
revealed through tests and they might
otherwise remain buried within the
within the individuals in question had
the pretext for the Revelation not
presented itself
of course tests are not universally
hated we like tests that we know we can
pass so when people Grumble about the
necessity of demonstrating their
knowledge Mastery or virtue it's
generally because they don't yet have
the Excellence in question otherwise
they probably wouldn't pass up the
opportunity to show it off in a socially
acceptable way and you know what that's
okay we all have to start somewhere and
few of us if we ever Ain Mastery do so

[02:01]
few of us if we ever Ain Mastery do so
in more than one regard so this is an
experience that is common to
humanity in any case the test is
welcomed when you possess the requisite
Talent Mastery or virtue to excel as the
test is the pretext to demonstrate a
quality that might otherwise remain
invisible to others and this is
ultimately what makes tests necessary
what could be abundantly clear to you
about yourself might not be obvious to
those around you this is why I say you
shouldn't expect recognition you
shouldn't expect recognition because
recognition is a very high thing you
have to be very close to Mastery to
understand how masterful Mastery really
is and most people by definition are not
going to be there so expecting
recognition of your Mastery from the
unmasterable is unreasonable and will
only lead to
disappointment however tests are
opportunities to demonstrate Your
Excellence to others consider the

[03:00]
Excellence to others consider the
mythical hero Hercules would Hercules be
Hercules if it weren't for the 12 labors
forget about it it's because of the 12
labors that we know the name of Hercules
today if there were no labors you and I
would not know the name of Hercules or
if we did that name would mean something
very different to us than it currently
does these labors these ordeals are
properly understood as Hercules's
opportunity to rise
as an opportunity to demonstrate his
Incredible strength and crafty
intelligence in no uncertain terms
indeed the labors were so difficult and
so extensive that having completed them
no one could possibly not recognize
those qualities in Hercules so the
labors were useful in this respect but
even more so the labors enabled Hercules
to recognize himself and this is

[04:00]
to recognize himself and this is
actually where tests are most valuable
Hercules did not know he was Hercules
until he completed the 12 labors like
even Hercules didn't know exactly what
he was capable of he might have sensed
his potential epic tatus talks about how
those who possess any Talent are sort of
dimly aware of it even if they've never
actualized it in practice he gives the
example of a bull who must be cognizant
of its own great great strength even
before it's been utilized as such which
is why it won't hesitate to rush into
the fry so there might have been
something inside of Hercules that he was
dimly aware of and we could call this
something his potential for strength and
heroism but it was only in the
overcoming of those various ordeals that
even he was convinced that he possessed
it if you're interested in taking your
understanding to the next level I would

exclusive content that you won't find

description for more information hope to
see you
aboard let me tell you Brothers it is
very easy to convince yourself that you
possess a virtue when you haven't yet
been tested video games and movies and
television have convinced millions of
people that they have main character
energy that they would certainly be the
one to stand up to the masses or help
the person in need or Purge the world of
corruption and that's just not true it
can't be true because if it were there
would be nothing heroic or extraordinary
about any of these things they would be
commonplace every every day behaviors

[06:00]
commonplace every every day behaviors
and we wouldn't be talking about them
now the fact of the matter is that most
people kind of think that they're
smarter stronger Kinder braver hotter
Etc than they really are and the reason
they think this is because they still
haven't truly been tested in The
Crucible of the
world tests are opportunities not only
to demonstrate your Merit to other
people which is reasonable but also to
demonstrate your Merit to
yourself this is because whatever Merit
exists within you remains pure potential
until it is actualized by necessity and
until this occurs you kind of exist in
unreality in fantasy because you can't
even trust yourself with respect to how
smart strong kind Brave hot Etc you
really are the tests of Life are rights
of Passage from fantasy into reality

[07:00]
of Passage from fantasy into reality
they show you who you really are this is
why at the highest level we should be
grateful for our trials we should be
grateful for our tests and we should be
ordeals they are opportunities to
fulfill our individual potential in new
and as yet unachieved ways because let
me tell you these trials are actually
pretty few and far between like how many
of us are really turning down The Call
to Adventure that Hercules received on a
regular basis how many of us are like oh
God I don't feel like slaying the nimian
lion today life tests everyone but it
tests everyone to varying degrees and
these opportunities don't actually come
along every day like most days are kind
of like most other days so when life
actually gives you the opportunity to
demonstrate who you are and what you can
do seize it take it and prove prove to

[08:00]
do seize it take it and prove prove to
everyone including yourself that you
have not duded yourself when you have
sensed your own potential for
excellence now responding to a test can
be
scary so let me offer you a word of
advice it's important to keep in mind
that testing especially when it occurs
interpersonally is a sign of great
interest raise your hand if you test
drive cars for
fun like very few people do that right
and they're kind of weird to be honest
most people will only test drive a car
when they're fairly sure they might buy
it personally I test drive cars just to
make sure that there's no reason why I
shouldn't move forward with my decision
so when a woman tests you don't get
frustrated that's a sign of interest
when an employer tests you don't be
annoyed that's a sign of Interest this
is because tests typically don't occur
at the first level of gatekeeping like
in an employment context you generally

[09:01]
in an employment context you generally
have to pass through at least a couple
of interviews before you get a real
solid test because tests take time and
energy to administer and review so you
only want to test fairly qualified
applicants understand that when people
or circumstances test you it's typically
a sign of heightened interest and it's
an opportunity to demonstrate to
yourself and others that you possess a
particular Merit Talent OR mastery
