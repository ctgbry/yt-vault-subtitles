I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the truth
about mental
illness so there are many things about
mental illness that I think a lot of
people don't understand dispelling all
of those misconceptions is a tall order
but today I hope to knock off two of
them so if you're dealing with mental
illness or you know someone who is this
is an episode for you let's get to it
the first is one of psychiatry's dirty
little secrets if you're dealing with
mild mental illness if you're feeling
down or unmotivated if you're feeling
stressed or on edge if you're feeling
less Satisfied by your work or your
relationships chances are that your
issue will resolve itself without any
further intervention in the literature
they call this spontaneous remission
according to the research the majority
of my mental illness will spontaneously

[01:02]
of my mental illness will spontaneously
remit in 6 to 12 months regardless of
whether you talk to a therapist or start
psychiatric medication or really do
anything at all and it's actually
unclear how much faster if at all these
problems resolve themselves when you add
those interventions into the mix as to
my knowledge those Studies have not been
conducted for a number of reasons so
that's misconception number one most
minor issues tend to go away on their
own on the other hand that's not
necessarily true for moderate to severe
mental illness not only May these
problems not resolve themselves but they
may in fact worsen over time if no
change is enacted this may not sound
like a very positive message it gets
positive near the end but at the
beginning not so much so you'll have to
bear with me but many moderate to severe
mental illnesses

[02:00]
mental illnesses
might not be
curable there might not be some
intervention or some combination of
interventions that solve the problem
once and for
all For Better or Worse mental illness
isn't like a physical infection where
you can take a course of antibiotics and
be done with the problem forever rather
mental illness might be more like a
chronic disease that must be managed
appropriately for the rest of your life
consider a chronic disease like
diabetes there actually isn't a
consensus on this but many people
believe that diabetes never goes away
like once people become diabetic they
remain diabetic for the rest of their
lives this can be a lot to process which
is often why folks are assigned
counselors when they're first diagnosed
in any case there is a wide spectrum of
response when it comes to dealing with
diabetes some do
nothing all things being equal their

[03:01]
nothing all things being equal their
conditions deteriorate over time and
they suffer the consequences others do a
complete 180 they change their
Lifestyles and alter their diets and
regularly track their blood sugar levels
and educate themselves on the factors
that influence their insulin production
etc etc now people in this group can
sometimes manage their diabetes so well
that their relevant panels are
indistinguishable from those who don't
have diabetes they might remain diabetic
their entire lives but they don't ever
really come into contact with the
diabetes per se this is because the
disease is managed so well that it
becomes functionally
invisible that said if these folks were
to lapse into Old Behavior patterns if
they were to start binging on sugary
Foods or stop managing their stress or
start bungling their insulin maintenance
then the syndrome of diabetes would
resurface Maybe not immediately but

[04:01]
resurface Maybe not immediately but
within a few weeks or a few months they
would be dealing with an acute disease
process the bad news is that these folks
might not ever be able to take their
feet off the gas they kind of have to
keep doing the good things and not doing
the bad things forever or suffer the
consequences however the good news is
that if they find a way to do this they
can functionally live their lives like
anyone one who doesn't suffer from the
same
disease if you're interested in taking
your understanding to the next level I

aboard now this isn't just supported by
the literature it's backed up by my own
personal experience as well like someone
might consider himself a diabetic I
consider myself a depressive I struggled
with severe depression for many years
mostly in my teens and 20s and I'm very
happy to report that I haven't been
depressed for a very long time knock on
would that said I don't think I'm out of
the woods in fact I've come to accept
that there is a tendency a vulnerability
to depression that lives inside of me
and might not ever go away for as long
as I live hence I consider myself a
depressive and on some level it's this
acceptance that helps me stay
non-depressed as believing I was somehow
invulnerable to depression might
motivate me to do do certain things that

[06:00]
motivate me to do do certain things that
would make it more likely for the
depression to
return however because I have accepted
the reality of my condition and because
I have made a number of changes to my
life over the years I haven't had to
deal with depression for quite some time
I managed the depression so well that it
has functionally become invisible but
invisible is different from eradicated
if I were to stop doing these things I
am absolutely certain that depression
would return Maybe not immediately but
within a few weeks or a few months I
would be dealing with an acute episode
that's just the way it
is and just what did I do to pull this
off I know some of you might be curious
the things I did were on the one hand
behavioral and on the other hand
cognitive behavioral change meant that I
had to start doing certain things and I
had to stop doing certain other things
first and foremost I had to stop doing

[07:03]
first and foremost I had to stop doing
drugs it's actually very difficult to
resolve an acute depression when you're
still using mind altering substances
including
weed these drugs numb you sapping your
motivation and accommodating you to the
status quo if you're used to taking them
things will get worse when you stop but
it's precisely the acuteness of that
misery that can help you break free of a
situation that no longer serves
you on the other hand things I had to do
included forming healthy relationships
with non-using friends finding a place
to belong identifying an overarching
purpose to my life getting daily
exercise eating nutritious food and
cultivating some material success like
as a broke lonely addicted struggling
actor I'd be more surprised if I wasn't
depressed I was a drift invisible

[08:00]
depressed I was a drift invisible
and near the bottom of nearly every
social status hierarchy now changing
that didn't happen overnight but what
was the alternative my life as it was
was intolerable so on some level I had
nothing to lose and everything to gain
over time I was able to transform the
various vulnerability factors that kept
me mired in depression into resilience
factors that reduced the likelihood of
the depression ever coming back it
wasn't easy and it wasn't a linear path
but it was worth
it at the same time to support these
behavioral changes I had to make a
number of cognitive changes as well
including silencing my critical inner
voice facing certain fears and
self-limiting beliefs increasing my
capacity to withstand certain
uncomfortable emotions developing the
courage to be honest with myself and
others adopting a growth mindset and
learning absolutely everything I could
about my mind and my

[09:01]
about my mind and my
heart by effortfully changing how I
thought and consistently changing what I
did I began to feel better and of course
the better I felt the easier it was for
me to keep doing the things that made me
feel better and that really shouldn't be
surprising as that's like CBT in a
nutshell in any case that's the second
misconception about mental illness most
moderate to severe cases will need to be
indefinitely managed like chronic
diseases however once you get the hang
of this management the illness becomes
functionally invisible and you can go
through life like any other
person what do you think does this fit
