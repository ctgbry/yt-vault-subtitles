I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why
people can't find
love this is an easy one to answer the
reason why people can't find love is
that they look for it in the wrong place
and where do they look for it in other
people that's the answer people can't
find love because they look for it in
other people I know this potentially
sounds cynical but I'm going to ask you
to go with me on this at least for the
next eight minutes and then you can make
up your own mind first of all it's
important to appreciate that you can't
feel someone else's emotions like you
can't feel someone else's fear you can't
feel someone else's Despair and you
can't feel someone else's love it's not
possible what is possible and what you
can experience is your own own love

[01:00]
can experience is your own own love
coming out of you if you want to find
love then you have to look for it inside
of yourself or more accurately you have
to look for it coming out of yourself
you will feel love as you express love
to others at the highest level you can
think of love as having a divine origin
it comes from a source higher than you
however as you increasingly become a
vessel for that love you can participate
in and experience that love as it passes
through you on its way from that higher
source to other people this of course
requires you to create space in yourself
to be filled with love and to cultivate
a willingness to give it away once you
have received it because it's only in
the giving away in the expression that
you experience it
phenomenologically now there's another
reason why people often struggle to find
love this is point number two

[02:00]
love this is point number two
people can't find love because they're
not actually looking for love they're
looking for something else that they
call love but isn't love is not
attractive love is not fun love is not
romantic love is a hard transformative
Crucible associated with Spiritual
Development as I've mentioned before
it's the humiliated self exaltan
love is changing the bed pan love is
staying with someone when they're down
and out love is sacrifice without the
hope of reward do you understand like
how many people today when they say
they're looking for love mean they're
looking for someone whose needs they can
indefinitely put ahead of their own how
many mean by this that they want to find
someone whom they can sacrifice their
own desires so that this other persons
can be fulfilled like very very few

[03:00]
can be fulfilled like very very few
right and that's why so many people find
it they're not actually looking for it
and what are these people looking for
instead most people are not looking for
love they are looking for the
gratification of being loved they want
to be treated well they want to get a
lot of what they want and not a lot of
what they don't and when this occurs
they experience a positive form of
emotion that is often called love like
wow I love this
but is really just the experience of
gratification and that is why when they
get less of what they want and more of
what they don't they don't feel the same
way and have fallen out of love with the
other the truth is they never love to
begin with because love has nothing to
do with getting what you want like who
wants to forgive the person who has hurt
them who wants to stay by the person who
has lost your memory who wants want to

[04:00]
has lost your memory who wants want to
forgo respect and appreciation and
reciprocity but these things and more
are often required of us by love and
love is capable of Performing all of
these and more because its Essence is
fundamentally Divine which is capable of
things we are
not if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description

[05:02]
all right the difference between loving
and being loved is vaster than the
difference of being a server and a diner
at a Michelin star restaurant they're
completely different the diner
experiences gratification they're
treated warmly respectfully they're
provided a host of interesting Pleasant
experiences their wishes and preferences
are fulfilled and accommodated and
immediate efforts are made to address
their slightest dissatisfactions
on the other hand the server enacts
service they express warmth and respect
they provide interest and pleasure they
fulfill wishes and accommodate
preferences and assuage
dissatisfactions and they do all of
these things at some cost to themselves
and within a context in which more
pleasurable or rewarding pastimes are
likely available finally true lovers
unlike restaurant servers can't
reasonably expect to be compensated for

[06:01]
reasonably expect to be compensated for
their service maybe they're recognized
maybe they're not maybe they're
appreciated maybe they're not maybe
they're reciprocated maybe they're not
and this is because love is serving
without the expectation of reward it has
to be otherwise it's giving to get which
wouldn't be Love Now people might hear
this and think Orion why would I want a
relationship in which I can never expect
to be gratified a relationship in which
all I do is give and serve without any
expectation of reciprocity and I would
respond yeah I completely understand
that but that means that you're not
looking for love you're looking to be
loved or rather you're looking to
exchange the Fulfillment of needs and
wants with another person which is
completely fine but that means that
you're not looking for love as much as
you're looking to do business and you
may need to get off your high horse
about that I explain this at much
greater length in my book in any case

[07:03]
greater length in my book in any case
it's generally more honest and effective
to approach relationships through that
lens when you approach relationships
through the lens of doing business then
you understand that if you want a lot
then you need to be prepared to give a
lot to have an attractive value
proposition to offer in return for the
gratification of being loved it could
very well be that the most satisfying
possible relationship ship is the one
characterized by Mutual
gratification two people getting a lot
of what they want and not a lot of what
they don't will really like each other
it's this gratification that as before
will cause people to feel I love this
person and you're probably not going to
feel that way when you're called upon by
love to sacrifice for the good of the
other what are you going to do when the
other is incapacitated

[08:00]
other is incapacitated
and incapable of reciprocity like being
a caregiver is an enormous burden it
will teach you a lot about life and love
and yourself but you will not like it
trust me however if you leave when you
cease being gratified than you never
loved to begin with which is kind of too
bad like everyone should love deeply and
at Great sacrifice at least once in
their lives it really helps people grow
up and to get over themselves but love
is a tough cell because it is
hard it's harder than diamonds and it
has to be as it might be one of the only
things hard enough to break our selfish
Egos and recalcitrant Wills so that's
why people can't find love they look for
it in other people namely in the
experience of being loved by others on
the other hand love can only be
experienced as it comes out of you in

[09:00]
experienced as it comes out of you in
the enactment of a conscious sacrifice
for the good of the loved one which is
why you don't even need to be in a
relationship in order to
love what do you think does this fit
