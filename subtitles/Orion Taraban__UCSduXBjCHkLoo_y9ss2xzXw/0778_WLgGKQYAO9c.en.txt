I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to be
a better person so this is something
that many people would like to be able
to do as usual my advice today will be
rather
counterintuitive but if you give me a
few minutes of your time I hope to be
able to convince you don't worry you can
spare it to begin with I'd like to tell
you about one of my favorite studies on
altruistic kindness I'll put the link in
the description below like all good
psych studies it used deception and this
time the ones being deceived were
Seminary students at Princeton
University these were young people who
were studying to be priests and after
completing a number of self-report
surveys always always such a trove of
insightful and reliable information
these students were asked to prepare a
short sermon on the Good Samaritan the
Good Samaritan was an irreligious person

[01:00]
Good Samaritan was an irreligious person
in a Bible story who stopped to help
someone in need after a bunch of
righteous folks passed him by so far so
good the real point of the study was to
observe what happened next in order to
give the sermon the students were
instructed to walk to a nearby building
through a narrow passageway and in this
passageway the participants would
encounter a sick man groaning on the
floor who was really a Confederate of
the study the passage way was so narrow
that the students couldn't really avoid
him in fact they kind of had to step
over him in order to get to where they
were going and the researchers wanted to
see how many of the students would stop
to help him out the catch was that the
students were randomly assigned to one
of three time constraints a third of the
participants were told that they were
early and had plenty of time before
their sermon a third were told they were
right on schedule and the final third
were told that they were already running

[02:01]
were told that they were already running
late what do you think the researchers
discovered well first of all they found
that all that self-report survey data
predicted [ __ ] all like whether the
students declared that they were
intrinsically motivated to help others
had nothing to do with whether they
actually did so in the real experiment
this is why we take what people say
especially about themselves with a huge
grain of salt and why we always defer to
what people actually do in order to form
our
conclusions as you may have guessed the
time constraint condition was the single
greatest predictor of whether the
participants stopped to help the sick
Confederate 63% of those with time on
their hands chose to help the person in
distress while only 10% of those who
were running late did the same that's an
enormous difference it's over six times
as many

[03:00]
as many
and it speaks to the influence of
extrinsic factors on our Behavior like
it kind of makes sense that those who
are running late wouldn't stop to help
they might think it's technically not my
responsibility to help this person but
it is my responsibility to get to my
appointment on time what's more there
might be someone else who could help
this guy whereas I'm the only person who
can help me not be late etc etc do you
understand the ones who stopped to help
were not necessarily Kinder than those
who didn't at least not in their own
minds they were the ones with time on
their
hands on some level they had nothing
better to do than to lend a helping hand
the unsatisfying conclusion here is that
the kind people like in terms of their
trait personality didn't always stop and
the ones who stopped were not
necessarily the kindest ones un L we get
too judgmental here we need to remember
that honoring one's commitment and

[04:01]
that honoring one's commitment and
showing up on time and discharging one's
responsibility is also a form of
kindness it's just not as visible and
stereotyped as helping out a sick
stranger if you're interested in taking
your understanding to the next level I
would encourage you to check out the

see you
aboard it's important to consider that a
lot of the kindness that people perform
in their everyday lives is the
unrecognized kindness of those who don't
stop this is because so many people are
really just trying to keep their heads
above water they are so wrapped up in

[05:00]
above water they are so wrapped up in
the busyness of their lives they are so
taxed with respect to their time and
their money and their attention that
frankly the only kindness they're
capable of doing which is not
necessarily a small thing is discharging
their own
responsibilities just like the study
revealed it's generally those who have
enough time or enough money or enough
emotional bandwidth who are in a
position to lend a
hand of course there are people who have
tons of time and money and do jack [ __ ]
so that's true too but what I've
discovered is that it's so much easier
to help other people when you have
arrived at a place of abundance a
surplus of time attention emotional
bandwidth and very often money because
let's be real you can't pay the bills
with thoughts and prayers man very few
actual problems are solved with a kind
word

[06:00]
word
money can often do a lot more good than
emotional support can now I'm not going
I'm not saying you should go around just
handing out cash but you should know
that a check would make for a much
happier Christmas for a lot of people
than some caroling you know what I'm
saying my point is that one way to
become a better person is to become more
prosperous this is not something I've
heard anyone else talk about the
connection between abundance and
altruistic behavior that is it's very
likely the case that you will be able to
help others more if you can orchestrate
your life so that you have more spare
time and some discretionary income and
most importantly some peace of mind this
is true for everyone but it's especially
true for anyone who wants to join a
helping profession you can't really help
anyone else as long as your head is full
of your own

[07:00]
of your own
problems you need to sort through your
own emotional baggage
first the reason why most people are bad
friends or Partners is not because
they're evil but because they are still
so preoccupied with their own [ __ ]
that they literally do not have space
for anyone else's problems in their life
they'll likely become irritable and push
back on anyone who comes to them for
help in a maladaptive attempt to protect
what little bandwidth they they still
have left like they might not even be
able to hear you if the voices in their
own head are too loud and in my
experience the voices get louder the
more your life isn't working in a lot of
cases those voices are an attempt at
problem solving and they tend to get
louder as the problems get more numerous
or severe this means that one of the
best things that you can do for other
people is to solve your own [ __ ]
problems when you do that

[08:00]
problems when you do that
you might just have enough bandwidth to
actually see another person to listen to
them non- reactively and not
judgmentally and potentially to be of
service to
them as the study revealed people
generally can't be of service to others
when doing so would simultaneously mean
failing in one of their own duties or
obligations either decision involves
some degree of loss in my opinion the
best way to mitigate that loss is to
cultivate enough abundance with respect
to your material and Psychological
Resources that you're no longer forced
to functionally choose like it's hard to
be patient when you're late right you're
already late you don't have time to be
patient so from a practical standpoint
how can you expect people to be patient
if they don't have an abundance of
time and the fact of the matter is that
we can all have an abundance of time as
senica wrote Life is long
if you know how to use it people think

[09:02]
if you know how to use it people think
that life is short or that they don't
have enough time because their lives are
so cluttered with [ __ ] and busyness
that decades pass them by without them
realizing it restructuring your life so
that you can once again experience this
abundance of time is no small thing it
can take a while to accomplish but doing
so might actually give you the
opportunity to pursue certain higher
Pursuits including being of service to
others what do you think does this fit
