if you're really in love with somebody
you're you're going to just accept
everything about them good and bad at
least tolerate I think that that's
something that we should stress more in
today's day and age is you don't have to
like everything about your partner but
you might have to tolerate certain
things and that's okay because they
might have to tolerate certain things
about you it's like everyone thinks
their farts smell better than they do to
other people I think our expectations
are too high expectations are too high
in so many different ways and one of the
most damaging expectations is that our
partner should be everything to us like
our lover and our business partner and
our best friend and our therapist and
our mommy or daddy and it's very
difficult to get even one of those
things discharged well from one person
and so that really puts a lot of
pressure and expectation on
relationships and it's sort of like a
chain is only a strong as its weakest
link and sometimes a wonderful mother
isn't a great lover and vice versa so
it's important I think for people to
understand that you can't get everything
from everyone and everyone has something
about them that is going to be less than
ideal
