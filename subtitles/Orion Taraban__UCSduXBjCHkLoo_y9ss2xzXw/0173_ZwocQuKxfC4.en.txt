i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
you can only get better
this is good news my friends the
pressure is off
whenever you do over and over again
you will get better at
it's literally not possible to do
something over and over again and get
worse at it
this proposition requires neither hope
nor faith it's simply an attribute of
the way that we are constructed for
instance you don't have to hope that
lifting a heavy thing over your head
over and over again will make you
stronger it absolutely will even if you
have no positive expectation that it
will it's just the way things work
the flip side of this however
is that you can get better
at the wrong thing
this is because the principle of
reinforcement through repetition
is value neutral
whatever you do over and over again you
will get better at so we have to be very

[01:01]
will get better at so we have to be very
very careful about what we do over and
over again if you're not careful you can
get better at avoiding
procrastinating
lying
binging
breaking your word letting yourself off
the hook
etc
i know some master procrastinators i
know some expert avoiders
and they've arrived at these specialties
like anyone else through consistent
practice
the key is to be mindful of the small
things
this is because any time we do something
we make that behavior just slightly
easier to do the next time around
which makes it just slightly more likely
that the person will choose that
behavior again when conditions are met
and over time in repetition that's how
very firm pathways are created in our
minds for good or bad
for instance
one cigarette does not give people lung

[02:01]
one cigarette does not give people lung
cancer
so people think what's the harm in one
cigarette it's not the end of the world
and people relent to the small vice well
that's true one cigarette won't kill you
but it's not exactly harmless either and
the harm is precisely that it makes the
second
cigarette a stronger possibility and the
second makes the third an even stronger
possibility and that's how bad habits
are constructed
on the other hand
one push-up does not make you strong so
people think what's the point of doing
one push-up it's not going to make any
difference at all so people neglect the
small virtue
well
that's true too one push-up won't make
you strong but it's not exactly
worthless either and its worth is
precisely that it makes the second
push-up easier and the second makes the
third even easier than that and so on
and that's how good habits are built

[03:00]
and that's how good habits are built
what's the upshot it's the small things
that create the big lasting habits of
our life
so don't neglect the harmless or the
worthless behaviors that you repeat
because whatever you do over and over
again
you will get better at what do you think
