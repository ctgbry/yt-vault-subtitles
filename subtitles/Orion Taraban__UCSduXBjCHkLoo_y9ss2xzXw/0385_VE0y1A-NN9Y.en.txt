I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why
people don't like it when you're nice to
them
chances are you have experienced this
phenomenon yourself there's somebody
that you like there's somebody that you
admire you want to show your affection
you want to give them a token of your
appreciation and it feels like you're
repaid only with contempt ingratitude
and disinterest
some people will accept your gift in the
spirit in which it is given but many
will not and this can be a puzzling
phenomenon for folks that's where I come
in I'm here to explain to you why it is
that people don't like you when you're
nice to them
the key to this puzzle has to do with
the balance of Attraction now different
people have different preferences with
respect to the role they prefer to be in
that is some people prefer to be the
adored and some rather most people
prefer to be the Adora
and they also have preferences with

[01:00]
and they also have preferences with
respect to the size of the Gap they
would like to experience in their
relationships there are some people out
there who want that Gap to be as close
to equal as possible these folks can get
really uncomfortable with even the idea
of power imbalances which spoiler alert
is actually one of the best ways to
maintain a power imbalance and they want
a perfect democracy between equal
partners and there are some folks out
there who like that Gap to be fairly
sizable while some toxic relationships
have large power imbalances not all
relationships with large power
imbalances are toxic relationships some
people want to lead and some or rather
most people want to follow
think benevolent dictatorship
in any case there those are the two ends
of the spectrum with respect to the Gap
in the balance of attraction
it's also true that these are not static
preferences that said the same person
might prefer to be the adorer relative

[02:01]
might prefer to be the adorer relative
to one person and the adored relative to
another some people always want to be
the adored some people always want to be
the adorer however most people want to
be adored by the people they want to be
adored by and they want to adore the
people they want to adore make sense
right and both positions and gaps can
shift and change over time so these
Dynamics and preferences can really only
be understood in context all right so
what does that have to do with anything
well when you demonstrate affection or
appreciation when you give time energy
gifts what you are functionally doing is
placing the other in the role of the
adored in increasing the gap between the
two of you this is especially true if
the time energy and gifts are not
reciprocated which is the case that
we're discussing here if you're nice to
somebody and they don't like it we're
talking about a non-reciprocal situation
this increases the Gap in the balance of
Attraction and that can make people

[03:00]
Attraction and that can make people
uncomfortable for a number of reasons
now before I go any further if you're

now this increasing Gap in the balance
of Attraction can make people
uncomfortable because they don't prefer
to be the adored or they don't want to
be the adored in relation to you or they
do want to be the adored in relation to
you but the Gap is becoming too large
for their tastes for whatever reason
your efforts are creating an awkward
interpersonal Dynamic and continuing to
expend effort will continue to make this
Dynamic more Awkward it's not going to
win you any favors

[04:01]
win you any favors
now when people are mean to you after
you show them respect and appreciation
whether they're conscious fit or not
what they're functionally doing is
either trying to punish or at least not
reinforce the behavior that is
increasing the Gap in attraction and
they do this by being unlikable
ungrateful disrespectful ignoring
minimizing and contemptuous their
response is an attempt to communicate a
message please like me less please the
Gap in our attraction is making me
uncomfortable and I will help you like
me less by behaving unlikably
interestingly if this attempt succeeds
and you actually back off and don't
pursue and expend less effort the other
person might begin to respond positively
to you why because the balance of
Attraction has been recalibrated to

[05:01]
Attraction has been recalibrated to
their preferred gap size does that make
sense
now sometimes I get pushback from people
on this idea they take offense and tell
me oh so I just can't do nice things for
people I'm just supposed to be an
all the time is that it I'm just
a nice person and I like to do nice
things for people is that so bad Orion
and I would respond well yeah
sometimes it is so bad
more is not always better in a
relationship remember it's the cat who
decides what milk is good the negative
reaction of the person you are being
nice to is their way of communicating
that that milk is not good for them
insisting that they should take your
affection and appreciation and respond
with positive regard is selfish
it's communicating my preference for The
Gap and the imbalance of Attraction
takes precedence over your preferences
for the same that's not nice people

[06:01]
for the same that's not nice people
that's selfish
complaining that women are cruel or men
are ungrateful is missing the point
those people are giving you constructive
feedback which if you can get your ego
out of the way you could use to
recalibrate your behavior to potentially
have a more successful and satisfying
relationship with that person not always
but it's possible
the idea that you just want to be nice
to somebody is kind of let's
keep it a buck and there's a very simple
way to demonstrate this if you really
just want the other person to smile or
to have a nice day or to have an easier
life or whatever
then would you offer the same gifts and
support anonymously
that's the real test would you be okay
with the other person not knowing the
good came from you or even thinking the
good things came from somebody else
if you just want to make their lives
better why would it matter

[07:01]
better why would it matter
be real honest with yourself
the vast majority of people are seeking
after some form of positive regard and
consideration that comes as a result of
being the acknowledged Giver of those
resources and benefits and there's
nothing necessarily wrong with that it
doesn't make you a bad person if you
want to be recognized for the good that
you do
but it does make you a little
self-deceptive if you won't admit that
even to yourself
on the other hand if you're all right
with giving without any expectation of
appreciation or reward if you are not
bothered when your good is repaid with
bad then congratulations you might be a
virtuous person capable of love
that doesn't mean though that you're not
seeking reward will be rewarded but hey
virtue is its own reward right
so in short when people don't like it
when you're nice to them it's their way
of communicating like me less and if you

[08:00]
of communicating like me less and if you
get the message they might end up
actually liking you more
