Guys, I'm going to help you communicate
sexual intent more effectively. As a
man, it is your job in the initial
interaction and certainly on the first
date to communicate sexual intent. The
idea here is to prevent any possible
misunderstandings with women. You are
not here to be friends. You are not here
to be pickle ball partners or study
buddies or a therapeutic peer or any of
the various subtrafuges that men rely on
to get closer to women. No, you are here
because you are attracted to her
physically and you are interested in
initiating a sexual relationship. Got
it? A lot of men hide their sexual
intent because they are afraid that it
will somehow be off-putting or offensive
to women. However, this is not the real
reason. Men hide because they still have
an ambivalent relationship with their
own sexuality. That is, they still
believe at some level that their sexual
interest is bad or wrong or disgusting

interest is bad or wrong or disgusting
or sinful or shameful or whatever
negative word his family in particular
and his culture in general has judged
his sexuality to be like. Good boys
don't think about women like that.
