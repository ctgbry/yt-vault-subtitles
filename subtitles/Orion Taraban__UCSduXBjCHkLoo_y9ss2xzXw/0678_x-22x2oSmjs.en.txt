the physical gym is an actual location
that we consciously and intentionally go
to the emotional gym is a psychological
location that comes to us whether we're
ready for it or not and the emotional
gem comes to us when we start to become
engaged with negative emotional states
when we start to give over onto
loneliness or irritation or anxiety or
Despair and it's a gym precisely because
it's the opportunity to strengthen the
commensurate virtue that will help you
defend against that particular weakness
in the future which in this case would
be self-possession or patience or
courage or hope respectively after all
how can you grow these virtues if you
don't ever have the opportunity to
practice them so these difficult
situations are the opportunity to grow
stronger in the virtues that will defend
you against future difficulties it's
sort of like building a tolerance to
poison you can do it by exposing
yourself to increasingly stronger doses
to build up your ability to withstand
its influence over time
