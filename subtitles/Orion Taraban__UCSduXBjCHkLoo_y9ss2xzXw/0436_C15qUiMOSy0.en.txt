[00:00]
want to talk about we want to be sure we
get to this because
I'm one of the biggest James Bond fans
on planet I get a sense that you're up
there too so I'm really excited to be
talking to you about the series so um
I I probably got into Bond when I was a
teenager and I just became obsessed with
him and I've probably seen all the pre
-craig movies at least
20 or 30 times so it's like a pretty oh
that's a serious Bond serious yeah
um so I want to there's a number of
things we can discuss first I just got
to get off my chest because I think that
you've made your uh public let's say
disdain is that too strong of a word for
the for the Craig movies
so what's up why do you why do you hate
the Daniel Craig Bond movies so much
um
I don't know about hate I just find them
boring incredibly boring
um you were talking about uh people

[01:01]
um you were talking about uh people
acting up on masculinity
um and instead of actually being
masculine and I see that with the Craig
Bond movies and there's too much of an
effort to try and make him look
really tough and hard and you know it's
like I prefer the old bonds where bonds
was having a laugh and
um I I love the uh the Sean Connery
Roger Moore Timothy Dalton era
um
yeah there's so much to go into about
that yeah but it's I found the new ones
are too fake uh ironically they try to
be more realistic but they're not more
realistic they're just as stupid as the
old ones
um but they try to put this uh veneer of
realism on it
um that isn't there the plots are just
as stupid the the characters are just as
stupid the fights are just as
unrealistic but in the old movies they
embraced it and they they didn't lie
about it and they they acknowledged to
the audience and said look you know we
know this is absolute garbage we know
this is juvenile teenage

[02:03]
this is juvenile teenage
um masculine sexual fantasy and it's it
could never happen in the real world but
we are going to fulfill those deep
fantasies that you've got on the most
brilliant level
um you know you know we're going to take
the fantasy beyond what even you would
would do with it you know
um and I love how they did that because
for me that felt very honest they made
them movies unrealistic
but I think that was honest because the
fantasies that we men have
that were being fulfilled by other
movies those fantasies are unrealistic
to begin with so I think the more mature
approach is to present it
unrealistically on the screen and the
new movies try to
pretend that it's not pretend
yeah they do have this like grittiness
and this realism we don't have exploding
pens and uh you know helicopters in
suitcases and women with ridiculous

[03:02]
suitcases and women with ridiculous
names and and things like that but
um I don't think they are more realistic
by the way I don't I think they're just
as stupid yeah I think you can
definitely make that case that they're
not more realistic I I do think that for
most of the series they are catering to
the male fantasy it's like who would
want to be this dashing secret agent who
lives a Life Adventure embeds all these
beautiful women and saves the world I
mean it's like sign me up for that that
sounds fantastic
and there seemed to be some sort of like
crisis of conscience about this that
happened in my I think the first signs
we see it in our GoldenEye which I we
watched a couple of years ago a lot of
people that are my age have this
romanticized view of GoldenEye I think
because of the video game that came up
uh at that time around the time when we
were classic game and so we love golden
eye but when you go back and watch it
it's actually kind of depressing and a
lot of that movie they spend just like
flagellating bond for his misogynism for
his you know being out of dates you know

[04:00]
his you know being out of dates you know
the money Penny the new Young Money
Penny isn't going to flirt with them so
she's she's too good for his advances
and it's like we can't have fun anymore
in in Goldeneye and it was like we have
to stop uh we have to stop the The
Superficial male fantasy that we've been
indulging in for too long and not only
that we have to enact some sort of
penance on men and I actually think
that's where we're getting with in the
Craigs because I do I do think that um
you know ever every actor who played
Bond certainly brought something unique
to the role and I think that's also not
just
a representation of who he was as a
person or an actor but also of the times
and
um I think what Craig brought to bond
was that we hadn't really seen in bond
before is that I can take it I can take
whatever you throw at me and still stand
up like I'm tougher than anything else
it's like you couldn't think Roger Moore
I don't think could really get the crap

[05:00]
I don't think could really get the crap
beaten out of them maybe you know he
he'd probably keep a stiff British upper
lip but like Craig is just
no matter what you throw at me no matter
if you it's the same with Connery by the
way I mean a lot of people think if
Connery as being a tough Bond but
actually when you see him with a share
top in the movies he was just as skinny
as Roger Moore he just had a hairy chest
her hairy chest doesn't stop but lots of
punches does it you know so yeah I mean
we had Bond like running through
drywalls in Casino Royale and just like
being this this
almost this unhinged weapon of like pure
ID and destruction that needs to kind of
be reigned in in Casino Royale to become
a more targeted effective assassin
basically
um but I do think that the the Craigs
are kind of a
um I mean we're talking about how to be
a man in a modern society that kind of
doesn't believe in men that thinks that
men have done all kinds of bad things in

[06:01]
men have done all kinds of bad things in
the past and not only maybe shouldn't be
in power anymore but maybe need to be
brought to bear for those transgressions
those historical Transmissions
and um that Bond as the man who's like
who gets things done and it's tough is
becoming increasingly irrelevant like
you see that in the exchange with q in
Casino Royale and they made Q into this
um this young nerdy character we also
find out in no time to die that he's gay
and he basically says that you know
you're I can do more damage
on my laptop than you could in your
entire life you're you're just someone
needs to pull the trigger every once in
a while so we're using you you're just
like this brute animal you don't really
have a place and you also see that in
the storyline in like um uh what is it
Specter where uh who is it C is trying
to take over MI6 it's like the the whole
MI6 Empire is we don't need this anymore

[07:02]
MI6 Empire is we don't need this anymore
we're globalists uh we need to move
Beyond this parochial view of
nationality it's just like the whole
thing about that bond is coming up
against in the Craig films is you are
irrelevant like that just gets told to
him over and over and over again and
over and over and over again he shows
that he's not
like I think that's the the male fantasy
today which is men live in the society
where they're kind of being told in so
many ways that they are increasingly
irrelevant yeah you know we're not
that's a good take on it I like that
yeah and and Craig's and he kind of
takes it on the chin every time it's
like the exchange with Vesper on the
train when he just like Smiles as she
skewers him and no one really
believes in him but he is he gets the
job done and almost everybody comes
around and respects him in the end and I
think that's the new male fantasy not
that I'm gonna go in bed you know 30
different women and have a bunch of cool
cars it's that like I can still be a man

[08:01]
cars it's that like I can still be a man
and be respected and celebrated for
doing so yeah what do you think
uh I can I can see that reading of it
um I don't
for me it doesn't make the movies work
um because
right in order to be respected as a man
you have to save the world and
go through all kinds of pain and beat
people up and fighting and stuff but
that's the male fantasy version does
that mean a woman doesn't have to go
through that does that mean some other
person from some other group doesn't
have to do that why is it only a a male
has to do that you know it's a good
point
um so yeah it's not a message that I
agree with
um but I also never got the the feeling
and I didn't cease back to but I saw the
other ones I never got the feeling in
any of those movies that he ended up
respected at the end at all for me the
endings were always just flat and dull
um well he died in the last one didn't
he well he does and then they toast him
and you know everybody's very sad uh

[09:00]
and you know everybody's very sad uh
Vesper comes around after he surely acts
very sad uh maybe you're right it's the
difference isn't it I saw some
interesting takes one thing that I do
think was great about the Craig series
is that really for the first time you
see continuity between the films which I
think was some something that the series
as a whole really
missed out on like I think you see
Sylvia trench for two seconds in From
Russia with Love and she's thinking that
you meet at the baccarat table in Dr No
but other than that other than like q
and Moneypenny and there's like no every
every movie is it takes place in like
this almost
in its own time capture a lot of
medically sealed universe exactly and I
think that I do kind of like that though
because I love the fact that with all
the old movies you can just say which
Bond movie do I feel like watching today
and you can dive into any one of them
and it's a complete whole experience on
its own
um
where's the new ones yeah it's more like

[10:01]
where's the new ones yeah it's more like
a series I I prefer the old style but I
can understand that there there are
appeals to having a continuous story
between them all but there's some
interesting things that come out of the
uh the disconnected nature between the
old
um Bond films it's almost like they're
all remakes of the same story you know
and the formula for sure yeah definitely
the same formula they're all remade lots
and lots of different ways
um and you kind of always knew what the
outcome was was going to be but there's
things about that that I found really
fascinating and one of them is uh if you
looked at them as being continuous a
continuous Bond story
what happens to each
um woman he gets with at the end of each
movie before the next movie is the I was
actually thinking I might do a video on
this at some point I think you talked
about this in one of your episodes you
have a little pep probably dead yeah I
mean does he does he does he kill them
off does he uh you know is he serial

[11:01]
off does he uh you know is he serial
killer uh does he just go and sneakily
dump them is this some woman
broken-hearted crying her eyes out
somewhere well he's off adventures in
the world meeting the next girl
you don't often see that you see that I
think in uh Tomorrow Never Dies where he
goes up to uh Terry Hatcher's character
and she just slaps him and I think this
is the first time in a film where bond
gets reintroduced
to a woman that he has seduced in the
past you don't you see that yeah yeah
and then he succeeds in seducing her
again so I guess yeah yeah of course he
does yeah yeah there's always an excuse
to let Bond off with them with being a
naughty boy isn't it you know so it was
usually like he sleeps with one girl or
two girls alien the movie and they get
killed by the bad guys sometimes Bond
even slip slips up and accidentally puts
them in danger and they get killed
anyway but then he gets to be with the
woman he really wants in the movie at

[12:01]
woman he really wants in the movie at
the end and he doesn't have to have the
guilt of dumping the other ones because
they got killed
