Here's a question for you. Maybe a
little difficult for you to answer. What
is it you think? What are you tapping
into with this relationship speak with
whether it's your demeanor, whether it's
the topics that you talk about, whether
it's are you doing a good balance of the
cerebral with the hard-hitting? What is
it about Dr. Teraban that touches so
many people that I can put up my, you
know, hundreds and hundreds of videos
and yours is the most popular? I mean,
you there's something to you. What is
it?
I'm not entirely sure. Maybe my episode
just has the most views because it's
been on your channel the longest and
it's just um kind of a longevity effect.
I'm not quite sure. I I think that if I
were to examine it, it has to do with
some of my previous experiences. I've
had three careers before I launched my
YouTube channel. I was an actor, I was a
teacher, and I was an ams.
And I think that I learned skills from
each one of those careers that

each one of those careers that
unbeknownst to me were preparing me
potentially for a career in social
media. As an actor, I learned a lot
about how to effectively communicate,
how to use my tone, a voice, how to use
my expression, how to confidently
present myself in front of an audience.
That's important to do as a social media
personality. As a teacher, I had 20
years of experience explaining often
challenging, complicated, or difficult
topics to people in a way that they
might be able to understand without
making them feel dumb, which is really
important to do as a teacher. You can't
ever make your students feel dumb. And
you don't want to talk down to people.
And you might need to mediate the
subject in a way to make it
comprehensible to your audience. You
have to meet them where they're at. So I
have a lot of experience taking complex
ideas and making them palatable to let's
say a lay audience.
