so this is an important concept to keep
in mind when it comes to relationships
and it's a concept that is relevant to
both men and women here it is I wish I
had better news for you but it's often
the case that you can have the person
you want or you can have the
relationship terms you prefer but you
might not be able to have both this
means that you might not be able to have
the terms you prefer with the person you
want or you might not be able to have
the person you want with the terms you
prefer the only people who get both are
either very very attractive or very very
lucky now this doesn't mean that you
can't have a relationship with the
person you want but that this very often
comes at the price of the relationship
terms you would prefer when this occurs
I call it winning to lose because on the
surface you won hooray you got the baddy
or the alpha but the costs associated
with winning are so high that the
victory is of an airic one What You've
Won is a Perpetual defeat you lose when
you win
