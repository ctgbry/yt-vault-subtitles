many people want to know what causes
relationships to fail and the general
consensus is that relationships often
fail because one partner kind of starts
to deteriorate maybe this person stopped
putting effort into the courtship or
into his or her appearance maybe this
person hasn't really Advanced his career
or here her lifestyle or has fallen into
hard financial Straits or maybe this
person has become depressed or addicted
there are lots of ways this can occur
but the idea here is that the
relationship fails when one partner
fails or refuses to recover from some
kind of setback and that can certainly
be the case however in my clinical
experience that's not what I usually see
there's this old joke it's not really a
joke because it's not really funny but
the joke basically says that the fastest
way to end a relationship is for one
partner to start therapy and what's the
grain of Truth in this unfunny joke that
relationships are more effectively
destabilized not when one person starts
doing worse but when one person starts
doing better
