i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the stress diathesis model of mental
illness
now this is an ungainly technical phrase
the stress diathesis model but it's
actually a fairly simple concept
it's a way to explain the pathogenesis
of mental illness or where mental
illness comes from
the dominant social view of mental
illness is that it is caused by an
imbalance in brain chemistry a narrative
that obviously supports the goals the
pharmaceutical industry
however the fact of the matter is that
there is very little evidence to support
this theory
take for example the popular belief that
depression is caused by a deficit of
serotonin
if this were the case we should expect
to see low serum serotonin levels in
depressed individuals and non-low serum
serotonin levels in non-depressed
individuals
but that's not what we see
rather we see that serum serotonin level

[01:02]
rather we see that serum serotonin level
is pretty much normally distributed
across the population
some depressed people have high serum
serotonin levels and some non-depressed
people have low serum serotonin levels
in fact the inventor of this theory
known as the monoamine hypothesis
recanted his position over 30 years ago
due to a lack of supporting evidence
however it continues to enjoy popular
support to this day
an alternative to this theory which
enjoys significantly more support in the
empirical literature
is the stress diathesis model which
basically says that an individual under
sufficient stress will eventually come
to respond to that stress in
increasingly dysfunctional ways
you can think of it kind of like your
immune system
generally when your immune system is
functioning well the bacteria and the
viruses and the cancer cells that are
actually always present within your body
are pretty much kept in check they don't
evolve into disease processes because
you are healthy and resilient enough to

[02:01]
you are healthy and resilient enough to
attend to them
however if your immune system is
corroded over time through poor
nutrition or lack of exercise or chronic
stress
then it won't be able to respond as
effectively to these continuous assaults
and the disease process begins in
earnest
well the same thing happens with your
mental health if you're having a
difficult time at work and you're going
through a breakup and you're not getting
enough sleep because you're ruminating
on negative thought patterns and you're
drinking too much
then all of these things are going to
conspire to make it increasingly
difficult for you to exercise natural
resiliency to overcome the difficulties
you happen to be facing in your life
and that's when the disease process the
mental illness fluoresces
when there's a confluence of factors
that make it increasingly harder for
dysfunctional responses to be kept in
check
the important thing to keep in mind here
is that the research suggests that it's
the number of stressors a person is
facing not the intensity of the
stressors the number of stressors
that really plays the pivotal role in

[03:01]
that really plays the pivotal role in
determining whether natural resiliency
is compromised to the extent that a
mental illness emerges
we can handle one maybe even two or
three significant setbacks concurrently
but when we get to six seven eight
it becomes very difficult to keep our
heads above water something to keep in
mind
