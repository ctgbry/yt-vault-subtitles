I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
problem with
self-respect like anything under the sun
there is nothing that is completely
positive everything is a trade off
everything is a mixture of positive and
negative of benefit and liability
furthermore everything comes with a cost
including values in fact that's one way
to think about values they Valu well bow
which is to say they're costly they're
expensive and self-respect is no
different and I think this is really
important because in today's day and age
we collectively seem to act as if there
is no downside to self-respect that is
not only is self-respect unilaterally a
positive but that it is a value all
people should prioritize Above All
Things in fact when people prioritize
another goal above their self-respect we
tend to think that they must be weak or

[01:02]
tend to think that they must be weak or
scared damaged or otherwise pitiable and
while they're absolutely is a time to
prioritize
self-respect it's probably less often
than most people
believe let me
explain since I've already spoken on
dialectical behavior therapy a few times
on this channel you know that I hold
this treatment in very high regard in
the interpersonal Effectiveness module
of DBT Marshall linahan talks about the
three possible goals of any human
interaction ideally we achieve all three
of these goals however like any ideal
this is actually extremely rare in any
case even if we do achieve all three we
typically can't achieve all three
equally which suggests that we have to
prioritize these goals in our dealings
with others and linahan argues that to
the extent that we do this skillfully
and intentionally which depends among
other things on our ability to flexibly

[02:00]
other things on our ability to flexibly
adapt to changing conditions we are more
likely to have satisfying relationships
as with many things pertaining to mental
health flexibility is key if people just
prioritize one of the goals all of the
time irrespective of the goal this tends
to lead to suboptimal outcomes so what
are the three goals they
are objective Effectiveness which is
getting what you want relationship
Effectiveness which is making sure that
the other person feels good about you at
the end of the interaction and
self-respect Effectiveness which is
making sure that you feel good about
yourself at the end of the interaction
again ideally people get all three
people feel good about giving us what we
want and we feel good about getting it
however in reality this is not always
the case depending on the situation we
sometimes need to prioritize one of the
goals over over the other two and this

[03:02]
goals over over the other two and this
obviously comes at a cost namely the
cost of the other two
goals to understand what that might look
like let's consider some extreme
examples prioritizing objective
Effectiveness over relationship and
self-respect Effectiveness could look
something like I don't care if you hate
me I don't care if you never speak to me
again and I don't care what I have to do
to get it but I will get it I will beg
borrow and steal to get it I will
perform any number of shameful Unholy
acts to get it I am prioritizing my goal
above all other
things okay and there is a time and a
place for that strategy on the other
hand prioritizing relationship
Effectiveness over objective and
self-respect Effectiveness could look
something like I don't care if I don't
get what I want I don't care if my
preferences or interests or desires are
taken into account I just want you to be

[04:01]
taken into account I just want you to be
happy I just want you to get what you
want even if that means that I have to
perform any number of shameful and
Unholy things to ensure that
goal all right and there's a time and a
place for that strategy as
well and what happens when people
prioritize self-respect Effectiveness
over objective and relationship
Effectiveness this could look something
like you crossed a line that shouldn't
have been crossed at this point
I don't even care if I get what I want
and I certainly don't care if you hate
me or never speak to me again I'm
prepared to hold this line and to pay
any price and incur any expense in doing
so to stand up for myself or to stand up
for this value on
principle make sense and there's a time
and a place for this strategy as
well at this point however the
liabilities associated with unduly
prioritizing self self respect

[05:00]
prioritizing self self respect
Effectiveness should be obvious people
who tend to prioritize self-respect
above all other things tend not to get
what they want and tend not to be in
relationships and this is expected
because they sacrifice the other two
goals objective Effectiveness getting
what they want and relationship
Effectiveness maintaining their
relationships in order to prioritize
their self-respect
it should go without saying but it can
be very difficult to deal with people
who tend to unduly prioritize
self-respect over the other two as a
habit and this is due to the fact that
these people
unfortunately operate under the
assumption that they can be difficult
and contentious and
self-focused and other people will still
happily give them what they want and
this my
friends is insane for For Better or

[06:00]
friends is insane for For Better or
Worse the cost of self-respect is the
other two goals the more a person
insists on the one the more he or she
foros the
others now before I go any further if

Mission I really appreciate it okay
let's get back to
it I found that people who tend to
prioritize self-respect Effectiveness
above the others also tend to have a
rather expansive sense of self and
because of this their egos tend to
bruise easily and their pride is easily
hurt they seem to have a lower threshold
with respect to what they perceive to be
a slight or an insult or a disparagement
as a consequence these folks end up
fighting a lot of battles and dying on a
lot of Hills which doesn't win them many
friends and doesn't help them become
successful these people often end up
alone and frustrated which ironically
causes them to prioritize self-respect
even more because what else do they have
so it can be a vicious

[08:01]
so it can be a vicious
cycle the fact of the matter is that in
order to get what you want in life or to
have satisfying harmonious relationships
with people you can't always insist that
how you are being treated is the most
important thing in life for example
objective Effectiveness is often
associated with learning how to play the
game if you want to climb the corporate
ladder or further your career you can't
be standing up for yourself all the time
can you sometimes you have to go along
with things that you disagree with
sometimes you have to strategically
cultivate relationships you're not going
to get there by just insisting that you
deserve better by the same token if you
want peaceful loving relationships you
can't always be putting your own
subjective experience front and center
can you sometimes you have to learn to
shut the [ __ ] up to bite your tongue to
let things slide and to give other
people what they need and want if you
have no filter fter if you are difficult

[09:01]
have no filter fter if you are difficult
and
contentious if you won't give other
people what they need and want then
don't be surprised if people don't like
you as much pride is cold company don't
expect other people to love and respect
you if you behave this way now as I've
already said there is a time and a place
to prioritize self-respect however this
is typically when dealing with flagrant
disrespect or some form of abuse
exploitation though the definition of
all of these words has expanded
significantly in the past few years
which is actually very problematic for a
number of reasons people shouldn't be
dealing with these things on a regular
basis and this means that prioritizing
self-respect shouldn't be a frequent
occurrence and if you do find yourself
dealing with these things on a regular
basis you might better Serve Yourself by
examining why you seem to end up in
disrespectful abusive or exploitative

[10:00]
disrespectful abusive or exploitative
relationships on a regular basis than by
fighting yet another battle in an
interminable succession of conflicts get
out of the situation and do some
self-reflection remember prioritizing
objective Effectiveness or relational
Harmony over your self-respect doesn't
necessarily make you weak or damaged or
beta or whatever negative judgment you
want to use it might make you
effective however like so many things in
life the trick is to cultivate the
wisdom to know when to prioritize one
goal over the others what do you think
does this fit with your own experience
