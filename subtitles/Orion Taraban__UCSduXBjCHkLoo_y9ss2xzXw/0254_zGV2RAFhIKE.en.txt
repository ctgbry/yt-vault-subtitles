i'm dr orion taraban and this is cycax
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the best
slave
is still a slave
this is a realization that i had back
when i was an actor many years ago i was
playing the role of moses in a play
about the exodus as you probably know
moses and the jewish people were being
held in bondage by the egyptians and the
exodus story is the story of their
liberation
but before i get to my realization
please remember to like this video and
subscribe to the channel
it takes less than a second costs you
nothing and it's how you can support me
in my mission to deliver free high
quality content to the world thanks for
your help
what i realized over the course of the
show was that my competitiveness was a
trap
when i was in this role even though i
was portraying somebody who was enslaved
to an exploitative master
the competitive instinct in me wanted to
be better than all the other slaves to

[01:00]
be better than all the other slaves to
be the best slave possible
and this is something of a paradox it's
like i understand the desire to be the
best possible version of yourself
whoever you are but to be the best
possible slave
well who is really benefiting from that
and in that moment i realized that my
competitiveness and my ambition could be
a trap
until i became my own master
my creativity and productivity would
primarily go toward the enrichment of
somebody else
and this is something that those with
competitive streaks need to come to
terms with
competitiveness and drive if not applied
correctly
if not applied in the service of your
goals and values is a trap
winning this game typically means losing
the metagame
as it will deplete your resources
needlessly as you expend your life
energy in the service of someone else's
goals
that said your ambition will privately

[02:00]
that said your ambition will privately
reward you with a badge of honor for
working so tirelessly and for achieving
so highly in your craft as a slave
and this satisfaction can blind you to
the fact that you are spending your life
in the service of someone else's goals
and this is because at the end of the
day the best slave is still a slave
