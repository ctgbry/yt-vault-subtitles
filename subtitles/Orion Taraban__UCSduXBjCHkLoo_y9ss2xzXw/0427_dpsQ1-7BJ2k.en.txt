hi everybody it's me Dr Orion taraban
and I thought that I would do something
a little different today we passed a
significant Milestone on the channel
very recently where we finally arrived
at 100
000 subscribers it's almost
baffling to me that this has actually
occurred
um
this happened
to the day
102 weeks after I began
first posting on this channel
and um I wanted to take some time to
thank everybody for their enormous
Support over the last two years
and for those who are interested to to
talk a little bit about my story and why
I started this channel
and how I ended up here and if that
doesn't interest you just wait for the
next psychics episode so first it's
really important for me to express my
gratitude for all of you it's so

[01:01]
gratitude for all of you it's so
humbling
to think that there are
that there are a hundred thousand people
out there who care what I
have to say it's an amazing privilege
it's one that I don't take lightly
as I've mentioned in my posts the more
of you there are the more I'm inspired
to put more work and Care into what I do
and I hope that that will only continue
in a virtuous cycle moving forward
um I obviously couldn't be doing this
without you and I kind of feed on that
energy
it's motivated me to remain consistent
through the times when it's been
rather difficult to keep going sometimes
I don't know how many of you out there
have ever tried to start a YouTube
channel it's it's easy to start I mean
anybody can record something and put it
on the internet but it's very very
difficult to achieve any kind of

[02:00]
difficult to achieve any kind of
traction so I'm extremely grateful
I can't wait to walk with you even
further because I have big things in
store for the channel
and I
I'm just flabbergasted that we're here
so thank you very much
for those of you are interested I'd like
to tell you a little bit about
the story of this channel because I get
asked that from time to time in the
questions so basically I'm a
psychologist in private practice and I
specialize in men's Mental Health
and I've been in private practice for a
while and I've been feeling fairly
confident about the work that I do with
my clients and it's extremely rewarding
like being a psychotherapist is
it's really the best job in the world
and it's extremely fulfilling that said
I was getting to the point where I was
struggling with the fact that if I was
successful in my private practice that
means that I was really only helping
maybe 30 people a month
and while that's important I mean to

[03:03]
and while that's important I mean to
actually make a difference in the lives
of 30 people is no small thing
I felt that what I could offer might be
of benefit to an even greater proportion
of the population
so I tried to think about how I could do
that I could try writing a book which
I'm starting to work on
um but it's very hard for anyone to read
your book if no one really knows who you
are or cares about what you have to say
so of all the different options that I
considered it seemed like starting a
YouTube channel might be worth trying
so I did a little research in an
afternoon and
looked into what made a YouTube channel
successful
and based on my research I gave myself
three years
I committed in that moment to working on
this podcast and Publishing regularly
like clockwork with no exceptions for at
least three years

[04:00]
least three years
and if I still didn't reach my primary
threshold of success I would reevaluate
at that time but I committed myself to
three years and that primary threshold
of success was a hundred thousand
subscribers so we've reached that in a
little less than two so I uh overshot
the time estimate but that's you know
better than the other way around because
I might have given up
so I started to work on episodes and the
First episodes I published are still
available on the channel I think I'm
going to leave them up there at least
the first few
forever because I think it's really
important for people to see
that when
that everything that they see on the
internet it didn't just sort of like
materialize effortlessly like if you
watch the First episodes you'll see how
far the channel has come in the last two
years
um I've made a lot of changes and I
think therefore the better and I kind of
learned by doing I didn't really buy a

[05:00]
learned by doing I didn't really buy a
whole bunch of fancy equipment I didn't
spend thousands of dollars in promotions
in fact I haven't promoted this at all I
haven't paid for viewers I haven't paid
to promote this in any social media the
growth has been entirely organic
um and that's because you don't make any
money on YouTube for a very long time
and even once you start making money
it's very little for quite some time
afterwards
so uh I had to kind of just make the
decision to start where I was at and
have faith that I would kind of learn as
I went and I think that's actually a
really good way of doing this and pretty
much anything it's like it's better just
to start where you're at and
put in massive effort and Learn by doing
because
it's you're gonna suck in the beginning
and those first few episodes I mean it's
hard to hear I'm kind of rambling
um I was in a different location I mean
I learned a lot

[06:00]
I learned a lot
by doing and also by listening to
feedback that I received and it wasn't I
think until around the 80th episode or
so that I received any kind of traction
at all and this is something to really
keep in mind is that that meant for like
um maybe like 10 months I was putting in
effort every single day sometimes for
hours every single day
and getting like absolutely zero
reinforcement
you do this for a while and you put a
lot of effort into what you're doing and
it's just like throwing it into the void
of the internet nobody sees it you're
invisible to the algorithm you get no
money you get no praise you get no
attention
and it's actually extremely hard to keep
going through that and the reason I did
was because I made that firm commitment
to myself from the outset that no matter
what happened I would do this for at

[07:01]
what happened I would do this for at
least three years
and um
that's something to consider a lot of
people I think quit during that time
period before their efforts start to
bear fruit For Better or For Worse It
generally takes a while for people to
care
enough to even pay attention to anything
that you're saying or doing
and
I remember the days where I would get
like one subscriber and it was
it was really cool I think for those
first 10 months I had like 40
subscribers
um
in fact in January
2022 YouTube told me I had I think I had
that many I think 39 subscribers when I
started
last year now here we are at a hundred
thousand so you nothing happens for a
very long time
and then suddenly everything kind of
starts to happen all at once and I think
that's true in a lot of different
domains of life

[08:01]
domains of life
um
success and progress is rarely a
positive slope up and to the right
so if you can understand that
you might be able to get through the
periods where it's very difficult until
that point where things start to click
um basically the way that I have moved
my intention here is to as I say in my
description to reduce the unnecessary
suffering in the world and the way I do
that is basically by working with my
clients and of course everything is
anonymous and
um I don't
mention anybody in my work but a lot of
what I talk about on this channel comes
up in my clinical practice and I think
whoa if this is a problem that one
person is dealing with I'm sure it's a
problem that many people are dealing
with and if this intervention or this
solution might be of use to this one
person it very well might be of use to

[09:02]
person it very well might be of use to
many other people so that's kind of the
principle that I operate from this isn't
a channel where I talk about a lot of
academic research this isn't a channel
where I talk a lot about Theory this is
really practical this is about getting
people out of pain this is about helping
people make money having better
relationships getting through the
because life is very very hard and we
need practical actionable solutions to
get out of the difficulties that we are
subject to finding ourselves in
and uh
I'd like to think that the channel helps
move
folks in that direction at least that's
certainly my intention I do not want to
be inflammatory I do not want to be
divisive
um I'm not doing this so that I could
make
a significant amount of money it's nice
that the money is coming in because I
can reinvest that in the channel in

[10:00]
can reinvest that in the channel in
different ways like getting help I'm not
very good at tech for instance
and um
yeah it's because I I have various
sources of income already so it's this
isn't about getting famous this isn't
about making a bunch of money it's about
trying to help people live Better Lives
um whether I succeed is up to you of
course but that certainly is my
intention
uh now about moving forward I hope to
continue to put out good content for you
on the regular
I am in my slow
and consistent way moving in the
direction of writing a book which many
of you have asked about
um I'm excited about the prospect but
it's going to take some time because I
have my clinical practice I work on the
channel I have another business
so
it kind of It kind of has to happen
when nothing else is happening
so I'm doing it here and there but it

[11:00]
so I'm doing it here and there but it
will come out I'm moving in that
direction
um and I'm starting with more I'm
beginning to do more long-form
interviews on the channel inviting
people that I am really impressed by and
I'm interested in to have longer
discussions with and hopefully you'll
see more of those on this channel moving
forward as well now a lot of you have
asked me to appear on other people's
podcasts that's great not really up to
me entirely whether I appear it's
generally requires an invitation
so what I would ask of you is that if
there's somebody that you would like me
to speak to
one of the best things that you can do
to make that happen to help make that
happen is to reach out to the person you
want me to speak to
especially if you follow them and are
familiar with their content
and if that other person gets enough
feedback from his or her subscriber base
that they're interested in the
conversation between the two of us it's
going to make it much more likely that

[12:00]
going to make it much more likely that
person will extend an invitation to me
me asking for an invitation it generally
doesn't work but if that invitation
arrives organically
from the audience of these various other
folks it's much more likely to happen so
that is one easy way that some of you
could help to further the mission of the
channel and it helps you get what you
want if you want me to talk to certain
individuals cost you nothing just I
don't know a minute of your time so
something to consider
um and again I'm super stoked about the
future who knows how far this is going
to go I'm going to keep writing it out
for a while and
making a better and better experience
for everybody so again thank you very
much for accompanying me this far and
let's keep going all right
bye-bye
