I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the gift
of nothingness so I'd like to begin this
episode by relating an experience from
my own past that radically transformed
my relationship to life and reality
itself six or seven years ago I decided
to spend several weeks backpacking by
myself in the mountains now I'm not
exactly sure how I arrived there but one
day while I was meditating
I came to a place that was so peaceful
and so still that I lost all sense of
myself my Consciousness was completely
empty of content so there was no longer
even the sense of the Consciousness
being mine it was more like the field of
Consciousness was wholly empty and I
passed out of all sense of space and
time there was no sensation no memory no
subjectivity only nothingness

[01:00]
subjectivity only nothingness
the no thingness of the infinite void
now I have no idea how long I persisted
in that state however the transition out
of that experience from the
undifferentiated experience of the
Timeless spaceless void to the normal
everyday perception of reality felt like
the big bang it felt no less staggering
and baffling and intense than the
eruption of the entire created Universe
which could be why the Buddha spoke on
how everything in the universe is
created by our own minds or to put it
another way on how mind precedes all
phenomena on some level that is
certainly correct like you've never
experienced anything outside of your own
Consciousness like you're not even
listening to me right now you're
listening to an emergent perception
within your own mind inside your own
Consciousness the observable universe
requires an observer and without that
Observer the observable universe on some
level doesn't exist in any case this

[02:01]
level doesn't exist in any case this
experience turned out to be a kind of
turning point in my life as it radically
and permanently altered my relationship
to reality among other things it helped
me approach the miraculousness of
everyday life when people use the word
miracle they typically reserve it for
certain behaviors or events that just
shouldn't be possible within our
understanding the laws of physics like
it was a miracle when Jesus walked on
water because given our understanding of
that just shouldn't have been
possible these events are considered
miraculous primarily because the basis
of comparison is our understanding of
the laws of physics which are themselves
derived from careful observation of the
observable universe however if the basis
of comparison is say the nothingness of
the infinite void then everything
becomes
miraculous there is nothing in
nothingness that suggests that anything

[03:02]
nothingness that suggests that anything
should be possible even our modern
cosmological explanations of creation
have to posit the existence of like
Phantom particles that is they have to
assume the existence of something to
make sense of everything else to go from
nothing to something anything is an
incomprehensible leap because under what
framework can we reasonably assume that
something can come from
nothing Rel to the nothingness of no
time no space and no matter everything
in the observable universe is miraculous
water flowing downhill is just as
miraculous as water flowing uphill
because on what basis can we reasonably
assume the existence of water hills and
flow frankly the direction of that flow
is probably the least miraculous aspect
of the whole shebang from this
perspective it doesn't really matter

[04:00]
perspective it doesn't really matter
what we're talking about a tree a cloud
a broken shoe everything is miraculous
and everything is beautiful it's an
amazing way to go through life it's also
an overwhelming way to go through life
but it gets easier to navigate with
practice in any case this event
significantly deepened my relationship
with reality and it did so because it
wasn't an intellectual concept from the
wisdom literature that I could kind of
trick myself into thinking I understood
but an embodied and irrefutable felt
experience now before I go any further

the link is in the
description okay let's get back to it
and I think the felt
experience is important because too
often we collectively mistake the
aesthetic sensibility for Spiritual
truth like God does not just live in the
beautiful cathedrals no matter how
profound your experience there might be
if that's the only place that you can
experience Transcendence then your
spirituality is still relatively Barren
because how much of your life are you
really going to spend in a
cathedral but relative to the
possibility of total
non-existence then all of the created
universe is a cathedral and the beauty
of that creation shines through when we
get out of the way of our own cognitive
projections more on this in a future
episode through this lens a strip mall a
trailer park or a fast food restaurant
is just as Divine and

[06:02]
is just as Divine and
beautiful as a forest or a cathedral I
know that sounds crazy but it's kind of
true which to my mind is actually one of
the lessons of the Christmas story as a
Manger was kind of the 2,000-year old
equivalent of some of these places a
humble place of no particular beauty or
Merit now there does seem to be a
relationship between Beauty and Truth at
least at the very highest levels however
if you expect all truth to be beautiful
or all Beauty to be true then you're in
for quite a ride down here my friend
those two things are fairly different
from each other and I think we too often
make the mistake of imbuing Beauty with
a de facto truth that I don't believe is
Justified in any case when you arrive at
a place where you are able to contrast
the objects of your perception not with
your understanding of causality and the
laws of physics but with the infinite
void of nothingness

[07:00]
void of nothingness
then all of creation becomes bright and
shining and miraculous you will also
never feel alone again but that could
also be the topic of another
episode now I wish I could tell you how
I arrived at that place exactly but I
can't tell you the path this is because
roads only go where they go and where I
went there were no roads perhaps that's
the gateless gate alluded to in Zen
parables I can tell you that I have at
least 10,000 hours of meditation
experience over the course of my life so
that probably has something to do with
it however it's mysterious I know people
who are more experienced than I am who
haven't yet had a comparable experience
and I've heard stories of people who are
much less experienced than I am undergo
even more dramatic Transformations like
Saul Blinded By the Light on the road to
Damascus the upshot is that if you think
Miracles are just about non standard

[08:00]
Miracles are just about non standard
empirical phenomena then you're anchored
at the wrong point the standard
phenomena are just as miraculous as the
non-standard phenomenon and it speaks to
the pervasive and stultifying effects of
convention that so many of us seem to
have forgotten that this is so what do
you think does this fit with your own
experience let me know in the comments
