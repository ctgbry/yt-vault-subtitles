I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
resist becoming emotionally attached now
you might be thinking Orion what are you
talking about isn't that bad isn't that
toxic are you really going to teach men
how to be cooler less emotional and less
invested in their relationships and my
response to that would be yeah I am
that's exactly what I'm going to do
because there is a time for a man to be
emotionally invested in a relationship
ship and there is a time for a man not
to be emotionally invested in a
relationship and what is that time at
least the first six months of a
relationship I have talked with too many
men too many men over the years whose
problems stemmed from the fact that they
could not resist becoming emotionally
attached to a particular woman before
she had been properly vetted for a
relationship so many difficult and

[01:00]
relationship so many difficult and
problematic situations could be avoided
entirely if men could learn to exercise
a little restraint in this department my
dudes there is a reason why buyers
expect a diligence period before any big
purchase like a business or a house they
don't yet know what they're dealing with
they don't yet know whether the
particular opportunity in front of them
is actually what they want and hope it
to be and if they don't figure that out
for the sale it's going to be their
problem after they hand over the money
similarly men should consider the first
six months minimum to be the diligence
dating period why six months because it
typically takes at least that long to
reach the crisis of disillusionment in
which the projected fantasy to which you
have been attracted is Shattered by the
reality of who the other person actually
is and if you decide to give your heart
to to a woman before you can see who she

[02:01]
to to a woman before you can see who she
really is then you're not just gambling
you're gambling without even bothering
to learn the [ __ ] rules of the game
don't do that that is stupid and it's
stupid for two reasons in the first
place if you decide to emotionally
invest in a woman who turns out to be of
poor moral character you're going to
suffer and you're going to suffer
because ultimately you will need to
choose between your head and your heart
that is you'll have to choose between
what is good and right for you and what
you've already chosen to love and that's
a terrible position to be in like no
matter what you do it's going to hurt
and it might hurt real bad and frankly
you did that to yourself because you did
not exercise sufficient restraint and
discernment before choosing to
emotionally invest in that particular
woman resisting this investment is an
emotional survival strategy and in the
second place if you decide to
emotionally invest in a woman before it

[03:00]
emotionally invest in a woman before it
is warranted you will place yourself in
the adorer role this will force her in
the place of the adored which is
generally not where women want to be
because it robs them of the emotional
experience that women typically seek
from romantic relationships a man in the
Ador role is also less attractive
because if you're looking up at her then
she's looking down at you and it's very
hard for a woman to love let alone
respect
a man that she is forced to look down on
so emotionally investing too soon can
significantly compromise attraction and
drive a woman right out of your life
remember you can't want someone into
wanting you more so just cool your jets
either way it's just not a good idea for
men to allow themselves to emotionally
invest in any given woman until they
conduct sufficient due diligence they
may need to actively resist the urge to
do so a lot of guys they have a great

[04:00]
do so a lot of guys they have a great
first date and they're already thinking
about what their kids are going to look
like or they meet a woman who [ __ ] them
real good and they think wow she's
perfect I finally found the one this is
inappropriate gentlemen it's like I'm
glad you had a good time or a fun night
or two but don't get ahead of yourselves

a fall now before I go any further if

this is how I keep all of this running I
really appreciate your support thank you
very
much men it is your job to resist the
pull to emotionally invest in any given
woman until it is appropriate to do so
dealing with women is a lot like playing
poker every once in a while you're going
to be dealt some good whole cards if you

[05:02]
to be dealt some good whole cards if you
start jumping out of your chair and
changing your bedding Behavior every
time you get pocket aces you're not
going to win that pot and you haven't
even seen the Flop yet like that's an
advantageous position to be in but you
have to put on your best poker face in
that situation you keep a rain on your
emotions and you don't deviate from your
system because that's your best bet of
actually raking in a big pot in that
circumstance you can not allow your
emotions to change your behavior now
there are several things that you can do
to resist the pull to invest emotionally
first and foremost you need to guard
your thoughts if she's not around don't
think about her in general it's not a
good idea to let your mind wander to
things that aren't present in your life
if you do this you will be where your
life is not and that's not generally
where you want to be

[06:00]
where you want to be
you want to be where your life is
because at the end of the day that's all
you really have be mindful of where your
thoughts are are you remembering how she
moaned are you fantasizing about the
next encounter if you spend more and
more time with the mental construct of a
woman in the privacy of your own
Consciousness you are basically training
yourself to fall in love with the idea
of who she is that is unwise gentlemen
be mindful of this and redirect your
attention to other things your work your
friends your Fitness or just what's
right in front of you next up if you've
only known yourself if you only known
each other for a few weeks you should
not be texting every day let alone all
day every day constant communication
dramatically accelerates the emotional
intimacy process I understand that it
might be reassuring and exciting maybe
even flattering for an attractive woman
to blow up your phone however if you

[07:02]
to blow up your phone however if you
respond to everything she sends you then
she is functionally dictating the
Cadence of
interaction this is the most common way
that men slip into a woman's frame
without realizing it get back to her
when you want to get back to her she's
going to have whatever emotional
response she's going to have that's not
up to you and if she throws a tantrum
because you kept her waiting as opposed
to feeling grateful that you got a
response then you just learned a
valuable piece of information didn't
you here's another one inappropriate
disclosure some of you guys are going
out on like 12-hour dates where by the
end of them you end up sharing your
deepest darkest secrets with each other
all of your previous relationship trauma
and a bridged history of your entire
childhood and your most sincere wishes
for the future why are you doing this
you do not yet know who this person is
you do not yet know what they are going
going to do with this information this

[08:01]
going to do with this information this
is like Achilles telling some girl he
just met you know I don't really like to
admit it but I'm a little soft around
the ankles like why would he do that the
rule of thumb is that if you're not yet
ready to trust this person with your
bank account information then you're not
get ready for this level of
vulnerability after all that's just your
money you can make more money trust me
being robbed is easier to recover from
than a toxic relationship though
obviously I'm not recommending either
people make decisions with their heart
that they would never make with their
money they believe that they can just
get over things as a therapist let me
tell you that it is actually fairly
difficult for most people to just get
over things and getting emotionally
involved with the wrong with the wrong
person is right near the top of the list
of things that are hard to just get over
so until you trust someone with your
money don't trust them with your heart

[09:01]
money don't trust them with your heart
just be two consenting adults who enjoy
each other's company these three things
mentally obsessing about someone
communicating constantly being too
emotionally vulnerable these three
things are how people fall in love with
each other that's how men become
emotionally invested now I'm not saying
to never become emotionally invested in
a woman just that you damn well better
be sure that that woman is safe and
trustworthy and competent and loyal
before you do so and if you're unwilling
to take the time to figure that out
beforehand you are just asking for pain
and don't you have enough of that in
your life as it is so get a handle on
your emotions gentlemen and don't be
stupid what do you think does this fit
