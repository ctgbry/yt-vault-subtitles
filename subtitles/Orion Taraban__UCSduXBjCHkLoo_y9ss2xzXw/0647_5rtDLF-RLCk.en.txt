as the man you will be expected to plan
the date and you will be expected to
move the relationship in the direction
of a sexual encounter women rarely do
either in fact if you leave it up to
them what is the date that most women
propose let's meet for a coffee
somewhere in the middle the
impracticality of a sexual opportunity
in this idea is no accident it's by
Design as I've discussed in the
negotiation phase women are attempting
to secure as many resources for as
little sexual opportunity as possible
while men are attempting to secure as
much sexual opportunity for as few
resources as possible and anchoring at
this point in an initial interaction all
but ensures a less satisfying
relationship for the man meeting for
coffee halfway is the female equivalent
to just coming over for sex which women
typically don't do so take a page from
the ladies Playbook gentleman and don't
agree to courtship interactions in which
sexual opportunity doesn't exist
