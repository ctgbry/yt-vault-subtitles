If we are truly able to arrive at a
place where either through extreme
control of our attention or a kind of
complete absorption in the present
moment, past and future no longer exist
and we abide without judgment or
expectation or even conscious thought,
then all we're truly doing in that
moment is sensing, is perceiving. Living
in the present moment is a very sensuous
or sensual experience. You see what you
see. You hear what you hear. You feel

women are not very sensual and that we
collectively look down on sensuality as
base and pile. Whereas the abstract

Like, I don't think I would have any
problem living in the moment if I were
lying on a feather bed covered in rose
petals and beautiful women. That sounds
quite nice. I don't think I'll be
thinking about my tax returns. Indeed,
in order to be absorbed in the present
moment, most people require a stimulus
that produces strong physical pleasure
and/or a very evocative emotional
experience. This is why, according to
one of my favorite experience sampling
studies, the one and only commonplace
activity during which people are focused
on the present and do not experience
mind wandering episodes is X.
