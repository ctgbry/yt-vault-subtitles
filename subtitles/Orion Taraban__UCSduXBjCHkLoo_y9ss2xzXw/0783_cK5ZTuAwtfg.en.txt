who are you and why should people listen
to you for relationships and dating H
well who am I that's a complicated
question isn't it nature of identity but
in terms of my professional experience I
have a Sidia Doctorate of psychology
I've been in private practice since I
graduated in 2015 so I have 9 years of
Private Practice experience during that
time I focused on men's mental health
and I started psyx which is a YouTube
channel about 3 and a half years ago my
motivation behind that was that I was
working with a number of guys in my
private practice and I could see that
they were getting better they were
improving their lives and I thought oh
that's cool that made me feel good and
it was nice to see but I figured that
those 30 guys I was working with every
year weren't necessarily special or
unique and if what we were doing
together helped them it might help
potentially 30 million men so I decided
to take some of the insights and
interventions I was using to address the
problems that were coming up in my
clinical practice and I wanted to launch
them in front of a wider audience to see
if it might help folks on a grander
scale
