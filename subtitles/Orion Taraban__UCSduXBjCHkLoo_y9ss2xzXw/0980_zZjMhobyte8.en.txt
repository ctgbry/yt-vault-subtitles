What are some of the liabilities that
women face when they try to step into
that captaincy role? First of all, it
takes a long time. It takes at least a
decade to ascend to one's captaincy. So,
it's a lot of work. It's a lot of
expense. It's a lot of effort. And it's
certainly not guaranteed. Lots of people
start down that path and don't arrive.
And there are risks associated to not
arriving after you invested a
considerable amount of generally time
and effort into something. So, that's
one. But let's assume that a woman
actually does the hard work and succeeds
in a sense to her captaincy. The main
problem that she'll have at that stage
is one, regardless of what her culture
or third or fourth feminism tells her,
many of the things that she's attracted
to, she's not going to find in a male
passenger. We know from the context of
hypergamy that women tend to mate and
date up. that even as women become more
successful, they don't think of that and
say, "Oh, now it's an opportunity for me
to share some of my success with a less
successful man in order to secure the
relationship that I would prefer."
Women, for better, or for worse, they

Women, for better, or for worse, they
don't share. They don't grow up with
that kind of attitude where a man is
sort of expected to succeed and then
distribute some of those resources and
success to his family, his children.
Like, that's part of what we're
acculturated to do. And I don't think
that women are accultated to do the same
thing. There's like the old joke about
marriage where you know my money is my
money and our money is my money too from
a woman's perspective.
