hi i'm dr orion taraban
and this is psych hacks better living
through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
everyone is completely unique and
totally replaceable so this is sort of
the paradox
with respect to human relationships
every relationship that you form whether
it's a romantic
or a professional relationship
it will have inside of it a very unique
flavor
there will be emotions affections
experiences
memories and associations that you won't
ever be able to
replace um with any other human being on
the planet
you know that this is true because
oftentimes i
i hear from clients that have been in
relationships for extended periods of
time that
their partner has changed and the
feeling or the flavor that they had when
they first started
dating and when they got together you

[01:00]
dating and when they got together you
know the magic is
is gone or it's just become something
else
so on some level not only is every
relationship
unique but every chapter of every
relationship
is unique as well so i'd like to
remember this
because we don't really
need to worry with respect to
[Music]
being replaced on some level because
it's not possible it's
always apples to oranges um
there's no way that your current partner
could find somebody else to have the
same kind of relationship with
that relationship will always be sort of
protected and in violent within
each individual's heart and mind
because of its own uniqueness that said
everyone is also totally replaceable
which is that nobody the

[02:01]
which is that nobody the
nobody's function is so unique
that there can't be somebody else
sometimes hundreds thousands or millions
of someone else's
who couldn't perform an analogous
function think about it in terms of
work you know there's somebody in that
role
who you know this particular person was
was maybe very funny
was friends with with jack and diane
um would come to meetings a little bit
late but got the job done
that was their unique flavor that they
brought to that position
um but if that person leaves or is fired
they're going to bring somebody else in
to do the hr and this person might bring
donuts
may not get along with jack may hit it
off really well with diane
is always on time different flavor but
the function
is going to be fulfilled and
that's kind of how relationships are
whether they're friends relationships
romantic relationships professional

[03:01]
romantic relationships professional
relationships we all bring our unique
flavor to them
and we're all totally replaceable as
well
so again i think about that then i don't
have to worry also about
losing anyone in particular because that
special relationship is inviolate in my
heart and
the world is full of other people who
can fulfill a similar function
so that's all i want to say today please
