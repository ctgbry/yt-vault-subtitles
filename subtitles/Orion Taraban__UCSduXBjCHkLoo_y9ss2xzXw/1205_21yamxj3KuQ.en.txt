Hey everyone. [snorts] So, I just
recently got this cool swag from the
Diary of a CEO podcast, and I thought it
would be fun if we open it up together
and see what's inside. Let's take a
look.
All right, so this is what I got in the
mail the other day. Let's take a look
inside.
Okay, looks like it is a note from
Steven Orion. Can't believe our
conversation was over a year ago. I've
been thinking a lot about all the people
I've sat down with over the years and
yours always stands out. I've just
created a new addition of the
conversation cards and your question
made it into the pack. Oh, how cool.
When did you last realize that you had
it all wrong? It stopped me when you
asked it and I know it'll do the same
for everyone else. Sending a pack to say
thank you. That must be this.
Our conversation reminds me exactly why
we do this. Have a plan. Let me know
what you think. Stephen Partlet, how
awesome is that? Oh, look at this. I got
like a gold version of my card. When did

[01:01]
like a gold version of my card. When did
you last realize that you had it all
wrong? That is um pretty exciting.
And I must be in this new conversation
card pack. Very nice.
Um is there something on the back? Ready
to open up. Light the candles. I don't
know what that's about. Let's take a
bigger look. Well, there's even more
stuff. Oh my gosh. I have an embroidered
um tablecloth.
Okay.
Ah. Ah, I see. There are the candles.
That wasn't a metaphorical candle. This
is a uh an actual candle. Well, there's
two of them. That makes sense. You can't
really have a conversation
all by yourself without looking real
funny.
Uh huh. Got the candles. Candlesticks.
There's the base. The other one
that is very

[02:04]
nice.
So, we got the Orion, the candles.
Fantastic. That was very sweet. I'm
honored to be included in this new
edition of the conversation pack. The
conversation pack is based on one of the
recurring themes of the podcast in which
each guest opens up a book and responds
to a question that was left by the
previous guest. Um that closes out every
episode and sometimes these are the
moments of greatest insight or
vulnerability in the interviews and um
it's really cool that my question got
included in this new version. So, thank
you very much to Stephen and the entire
Diaria CEO team.
