eye contact is extremely intimate one of
the things I say in that episode that I
don't think many women know is that if
you and I didn't know each other and we
were out at a bar and I just like looked
right into your eyes for 3 seconds I
think you wanted to fight exactly even
there's this nervous laughter which can
potentially cover okay this is getting a
little tense and maybe I'm trying to
deescalate it by smiling and showing
that I'm not a threat but absolutely
sustained eye contact between two
strange men is an aggressive t IC for
more than a couple seconds it's going be
like can I help you is there a problem
here he just looked at you and why
because it's too intimate I don't know
who you are dude why do you think that
you can get that close to me you could
be on the other side of the bar but eye
contact feels like you're inside me it's
amazing so women can use eye contact to
their benefit where they can basically
call the men that they want to interact
with to them but they have to be willing
to do that if they're not willing to
drop the handkerchief or look them in
the eye I mean that's sort of like the
minimum necessary Behavior
