i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
we learn about ourselves in
relationships
so there's this notion of identity that
assumes that deep down
who we are is this sort of unchanging
crystalline entity
that who we are remains constant
regardless of where we are who we're
with or what we're doing
and i think that's a fairly
philosophical notion of identity that is
betrayed in the practice of our everyday
lives
the fact of the matter is that who we
are our experience of self
changes significantly based on where we
are who we're with and what we're doing
now the fact that our experience of self
is constantly shifting doesn't
necessarily mean that we're lying or
acting
it just means that in certain situations
certain parts of yourself are more
salient or relevant than others
think about your own experience

[01:01]
think about your own experience
don't certain people seem to
call forth certain aspects of yourself
like maybe you feel more playful and
seductive with this person or more
serious and reserved with this other
and aren't both different from how you
tend to feel when you're alone
the fact of the matter is that your
experience of self in solitude isn't
necessarily truer or more real than your
experience of self in relationship
in fact we primarily learn about
ourselves in relationship
i don't pretend to know exactly how this
works i just know that it does
relationships pull
latent aspects of self out of your
personality structure
that may otherwise have remained long
dormant
relationships give you a reason to
actualize those latent aspects of self
and as a result
we get to experience ourselves in a new
way
in a relationship to that specific
individual
that's a big part of why relationships

[02:00]
that's a big part of why relationships
are so fun
and why they're non-repeatable
you can't have the same relationship
with two different people because
you're kind of two different people with
two different people
and to get a fuller more complete
understanding of who we are it makes
sense for us to have many different
relationships with many different kinds
of people
and that's because it's in relationships
that our otherwise latent potential
becomes manifest and actual
in a very real way
we become ourselves more fully
in relation to others
what do you think have you experienced
something similar
