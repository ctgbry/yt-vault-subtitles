I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is
exclusivity is expensive
let's get to it in the first place it's
important to understand some of the
differences between commitment and
exclusivity it's like squares and
rectals all exclusivity is a commitment
but not all commitment is exclusivity
you can think of commitment as a
partnership this means that you're
invested it means that you care it means
that you are available it means that
you're willing to spend time and energy
and resources if you do these things
you're in a committed relationship
exclusivity means that in addition to
doing all of these things you're not
doing any of those with anyone else make
sense now before I explain why
exclusivity is so expensive please

now the difference between commitment
and exclusivity cannot be overstated and
to help folks understand why this might
be the case
I'm going to lateral from the Romantic
sphere to the professional sphere
because as I often say what works in one
often works in the other
let's say that your company wanted to
advertise at the upcoming World Cup that
is your company wanted to become a
partner of the event to do this your
company would enter into an agreement a
commitment with the folks who put on the
event in exchange for showing your
company's advertising at the stadium or
providing a 30-second spot during
halftime your company is going to pay a
substantial amount of money and that's
the deal you worked out it's a committed
partnership in which ideally both
Partners get what they want in the
exchange
but let's say that your company wanted
to be the exclusive partner of the World

[02:01]
to be the exclusive partner of the World
Cup
do you have
any idea how much more they would have
to pay
the folks who put on the event would
counter that they could get ad revenue
from like 50 other companies for this
one Stadium alone
so if you wanted the spectators to see
your branding and your branding alone
you would probably have to buy out all
the other Billboards and AD spots that
you would otherwise that we would
otherwise sell to your competitors
it'll be less work for us to just sell
to you because we'd only have to manage
one contract versus 51 contracts so
we'll give you a discount but it's still
going to cost you a lot exclusivity
would probably cost around 45x what
commitment would in the scenario
and it would be Financial suicide for
the promoters to agree to anything less
since they could make so much more
selling individual Partnerships do you
understand
now let's lateral back to the Romantic
sphere the basis of any relationship

[03:01]
sphere the basis of any relationship
whether it's personal or professional is
the mutual exchange of value
and the amount of value being exchanged
dictates the level of the relationship a
certain amount of value needs to be
exchanged in order to have a committed
relationship but another level entirely
must be exchanged to have an exclusive
relationship at least if one of the
participants isn't going to be
completely hosed
this is something to keep in mind
exclusivity is really expensive it's
really expensive and so if you're
gunning for that level in your
relationship you have to be willing to
provide an exorbitant amount of value
and value is always defined by the other
party remember the cat decides which
milk is good just keeping it real what
