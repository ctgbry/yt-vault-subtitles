i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to receive a compliment
it might sound strange but for some
folks it's easier to accept criticism
than a compliment so today i'd like to
talk about how to get better at
receiving positive feedback
first of all i'd like to consider that a
compliment is a gift
and as such it's important to understand
that not all gifts are free and sincere
some gifts have strings attached so it's
important to discern between complements
that have strings attached which we
would typically call flattery which is
actually a form of mockery
and those that are given freely and
sincerely in this video i'm only going
to be talking about the latter the free
and sincere compliments so if you
receive positive feedback from someone
that you perceive as sincere
what i'd like you to consider is that
this is a free and spontaneous gift
that was given at the pleasure of the
complimenter
so what do you do when you receive a

[01:00]
so what do you do when you receive a
gift like a present for your birthday
you don't just look at
it and say oh thanks and here's one for
you don't just unthinkingly repay a gift
with a gift in kind you also don't you
know dismiss the gift or the gift-giver
out of your own discomfort over having
received a gift
if you have any grace whatsoever
you open up the package and you express
some enjoyment and the easiest way to
express enjoyment is to make accurate
observations over what it is that you've
received
you pull it out of the box and you say
oh
it's a sweater
and look at the color ooh and it's so
soft i bet it'll be so warm and cozy
this winter thank you
that's how you communicate gratitude for
a gift that was freely given
you can do something similar when you
receive a compliment
and to do this you will need to exercise
a certain flexibility in your
perspective
in the moment of receiving the
compliment
you can shift your perspective to join

[02:02]
you can shift your perspective to join
with the complimenter in appreciation of
whatever is being complemented
this will allow your subjectivity to
join
with the complimenter in appreciation of
your objectivity
so for instance if someone were to
compliment you on your physique
you could flexibly change your
perspective to join with the
complimenter and appreciate your
physique from an objective perspective
something like yeah i'm liking how
things are turning out too
i've been working pretty hard and i've
started to see some definition in my
arms yeah thanks for noticing
i think that's sufficient
i think anything more than that might
come off as bane
but anything less than that might come
off as awkward or ungrateful
it's a fine line but you can learn how
to walk it
so the best way to accept a compliment
is to flexibly join with the perspective
of the complimenter and to express
accurate observations about the object
of the complement which just so happens
to be you
it's no longer you as subject it's you

[03:01]
it's no longer you as subject it's you
as object and in this way you don't have
to feel awkward or uncomfortable about
receiving compliments because you can
join with the objective perspective of
the complimenter in that moment
i hope that makes sense
