i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the power of half
so this is going to be a story time
story times are episodes that i will
periodically release in which i talk
about my life
i've had a lot of interesting
experiences and some of those
experiences i think have important and
powerful lessons for myself and others
and many viewers have expressed
curiosity about my life as well so i
thought i'd tell some stories so this
story is called the power of half
so when i was a teenager i was very
interested in meditation and when i was
19 years old i went to live at the
shaolin monastery in china to study kung
fu and qigong under a master teacher
it was a very
very difficult experience the regimen
pushed me out of my comfort zone in many
significant ways we were doing week-long
fasts we were meditating 20 hours a day

[01:00]
fasts we were meditating 20 hours a day
it was almost superhuman it was also my
first time in a radically different
culture where i was identifiably other
and didn't speak the language i had a
couple of breakdowns i had a few
breakthroughs and it was overall a very
powerful experience for me
i remember one day i was sitting in my
classroom with my teacher
we when we weren't actively meditating
he would usually talk about the next
exercise or some sort of spiritual
doctrine however this time
apropos of nothing
he started talking about money
he said that if anyone asks you for
money
give them half
it was a real non-sequitur i and i think
that's why it kind of stuck i was like
why is he talking about this
but that's what he said if anybody asks
you for money give them half
okay
a few days later i decided to go for a
walk in the countryside outside of town
back then shaolin was a small village
with one dirt road through the center of

[02:00]
with one dirt road through the center of
town sounded by pasture and mountains
and i thought it would be pleasant to
walk in nature
however i was followed out of town by a
group of maybe 10 teenage boys students
of the martial arts academies there in
xiaolin
now they didn't speak any english and i
didn't speak any mandarin so it was
tough going at the beginning but they
eventually formed a circle around me
a few of them started picking up rocks
making threatening gestures and grimaces
at that point i understood i was in a
sticky situation
now for a brief instant the thought
crossed my mind like hmm time to see how
good my kung fu really is let's see if i
can take all 10 guys by myself but
unfortunately that thought was very
short-lived as i realized that that
would have been a bad decision if i took
on 10 guys i wouldn't come out of that
situation looking pretty
so
then what

[03:00]
then what
they're looking at me
i'm looking at them i'm thinking how am
i gonna get out of this situation
when i remember what my teacher said a
few days ago and i thought well i don't
have a better idea so let's try this out
so i took out my wallet and i showed
them all my money
which wasn't all that much mind you and
i separated it into two piles and i said
with my gestures okay this half is for
you guys
and this half is for me
i'm giving you all half
and the guys looked at each other
and they looked at me
and they all seemed to agree that yes
this was the most equitable possible
arrangement
and they took half the money divided it
among themselves and then slapped me on
the back and went on their merry way
they certainly could have snatched both
piles of money
they certainly could have forced more
out of me they had numbers on their side
but in that moment

[04:00]
but in that moment
i learned that there was something
psychologically powerful about the idea
of equal halves
those guys weren't entitled to any of
that money
and they could have taken it all
and yet they were content with half
amazing i was amazed
in the first place that the half-trick
worked
and in the second place that my teacher
had instructed me to do this two days
prior to the actual event it was pretty
uncanny
so if you ever find yourself in a tough
situation you can always try the half
trick turns out that halfness has some
power to it a psychological validity
that is not to be underestimated anyway
