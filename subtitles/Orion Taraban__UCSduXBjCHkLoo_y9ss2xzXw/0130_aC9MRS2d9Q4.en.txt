i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the origin
of romance
so everything has an origin and that
includes romantic love
now to be sure people have been falling
in love since the beginning of recorded
history the ancient greeks for instance
talk about the phenomenon as a kind of
pitiable madness
those struck by the arrows of eros were
out of touch with reality and robbed of
their faculties of reason sound familiar
so while the experience of falling in
love or limerence is nothing new what is
relatively new is considering this state
to be desirable
limerence is the affliction that
everyone wants to suffer from
a lot of what i'm going to discuss today
will be the condensation of this
excellent book
love in the western world by denis de
rujiman
this is a painstaking academic analysis

[01:01]
this is a painstaking academic analysis
into the origins of romantic love highly
recommended for those with the interest
in the patients
basically
de rojaman argues that romantic love
arose in the 11th or 12th century in the
south of france
in this time and place was a popular
pagan cult
known as the cathars which means
something like the pure
that was promulgating religious doctrine
that was heretical to the catholic
church
cities largely composed of cathars face
significant persecution extended sieges
holy wars and inquisitions at the hands
of the church
so the catholics rather than divest
themselves of their beliefs entirely
kind of secularized their cult so that
it could more or less continue to exist
within the realm of christendom without
persecution
and those secularized principles served
as the foundation of what we might now

[02:00]
as the foundation of what we might now
call
the cult of romantic love
so the origin of romantic love is
religious
kind of a mind blower huh however this
actually accounts for a lot of aspects
of romantic love that would otherwise be
kind of inexplicable
look at
a lot of the language that we use when
we talk about romance idol
devotion
worship
adoration
union
these are all religious terms
there are also many pop songs about love
that could easily serve as prayers to
the divine
my favorite are the lyrics to the
scorpions no one like you i'll put a
link in the description
that could have been written by a
franciscan monk waiting for the
inspiration of grace during the dark
night of the soul
you just need to replace girl with lord
and it's basically a medieval prayer
it can also help to explain the power
and intensity of the emotions that

[03:01]
and intensity of the emotions that
people feel when they're in the throes
of romantic love
it can even feel like the adored has a
godlike power over us to make us
blissfully happy or hopelessly bereft to
be sure this is an idol a god of our own
making but a potent one
okay so tldr the principles of romantic
love are the secularization of the dogma
of a persecuted pagan cult in 12th
century france
we'll be discussing more about the
truths of romantic love in future
