I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is women win
this dating game
apologies for the clickbaity title but
here you are so what game am I referring
to in the title of this episode very
simply the dating game that women win is
serial monogamy in fact they win in a
big way relative to men which is why I'm
consistently baffled when men choose to
play this game in the dating Market the
real kicker here has to do with this
little visual aid which I'll come back
to near the end of the episode
the reason why women win the game of
Serial monogamy is that it is far easier
for the average woman to enter into a
new relationship at the end of an
existing one than it is for a man to do
the same
there are three main reasons why this is
the case first and foremost women

[01:00]
the case first and foremost women
initiate
but far more breakups than men do
according to the research women initiate
between 60 and 70 percent of all
breakups and divorces and because
statistics can be a little baffling this
basically means that women break up with
men twice as often as men break up with
women that's a significant difference
twice as often
and this is important because whereas
some guys might see the writing on the
wall
the person doing the breaking up
always sees it coming
think about it in the context of work
the employer who is doing the firing
always knows exactly when it's going to
go down whereas the employee even if
he's on a performance Improvement plan
might not know exactly when the ax is
going to drop and keep in mind that no
matter how frustrating or low performing
that employee is

[02:00]
that employee is
that employer is unlikely to cut that
employee loose while he is still
necessary like in the middle of a
project
whose success would otherwise be
compromised so firing is always on the
employer's terms and it will occur when
it is convenient for the employer doing
the firing not the employee being fired
therefore since women break up with men
far more often they have time to prepare
against its coming this generally means
that they begin to get themselves ready
for re-entry into the sexual Marketplace
before leaving their pre-existing
relationship this could mean going to
the gym to lose a few pounds
this could mean starting new activities
which expose her to new social groups
with new potential mating opportunities
she might not be doing anything that
constitutes an overt betrayal however a
woman who has decided that a termination

[03:00]
woman who has decided that a termination
is impending will put herself in a
position to act on the preparations that
she has made against this happening
on the other hand the guy is often just
left there holding his dick
this is the first reason why women get
into a new relationship faster than men
do now before I go any further if you're

now the second reason is that women
often have potential mates on the
periphery of their lives these could be
co-workers or yoga buddies or friends of
friends they are men in her Ambit where

[04:01]
friends they are men in her Ambit where
there is some acknowledged attraction
that hasn't yet been acted upon it's
actually fairly common for women to have
plan B's if not plan C's D's E's F's and
G's while she's still in her primary
relationship and women are generally
allowed to do this socially because the
standards for infidelity really revolve
around overt sexuality so as long as
it's look but don't touch as long as she
acknowledges that she's in a
relationship currently a woman can keep
options warm that can potentially be
acted upon in the future
this allows her to strike up a new
relationship quickly as there are men
waiting in her proverbial Wings on the
other hand most men do not enjoy
optionality with women this means that
they often don't have a backup plan even
if they wanted one that's the second
reason and the third reason why it's
easier for women to get into a new

[05:01]
easier for women to get into a new
relationship than it is for men is that
men's standards for entering into a
relationship are across the board
significantly lower than women's
standards for the same most men I hate
to say it but it's true most men will
have whoever will have them
and if she's cute and willing to have
sex with him and doesn't cause too many
problems men are generally willing to
entertain the possibility of a
relationship on the other hand women
have and are encouraged to have much
higher standards for their potential
mates and dates so even if a man wanted
to get into a new relationship right
away he would run up against the
unforgiving gatekeeping of women's
standards so that's reason number three
so women win the game of Serial monogamy
who cares why is this important
well that brings me to my
aforementioned visual aid which is

[06:02]
aforementioned visual aid which is
really the nail in the coffin
the 20s are a special time for both men
and women well everyone is on his or her
own path the average age at first
marriage in the U.S is 28 for women and
30 for men
so the decade of your 20s is your Prime
dating period
let's say that it takes about six months
to determine whether a relationship has
long-term potential in my opinion that's
the bare minimum amount of time
necessary to do some due diligence let's
also say that it takes a woman one month
after a relationship ends to get into a
new relationship whereas it takes a man
six months after a relationship ends to
get into a new relationship
here's what that would look like over
the course of 10 years
the red lines being periods of time
spent within a committed relationship
as you can see there are far more red

[07:01]
as you can see there are far more red
lines in the women's graph than in the
men's graph in fact the women have 17
to the man's ten this means that given
the relative speed with which a woman
can enter into a new relationship women
get 70 percent more chances of finding a
partner for themselves across this
particularly sensitive period of their
lives than men do
let's be honest there's a huge amount of
luck in the dating game it's often a
question of being in the right place at
the right time in some respects dating
is like one of those claw games at an
arcade the more attempts you make the
more likely you'll eventually pull out a
prize and if a woman gets 17 attempts
for every 10 that a man gets it's much
more likely that a woman is going to end
up with a relationship over the course
of a decade that serves her needs and
interests than a man is
do you understand
this is why men lose the game of Serial

[08:01]
this is why men lose the game of Serial
monogamy it's not in their best
interests with respect to securing a
long-term relationship that actually
matches with their values goals and
their purpose in life
