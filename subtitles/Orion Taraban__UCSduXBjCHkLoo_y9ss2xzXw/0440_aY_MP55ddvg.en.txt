hello this is Orion taraban and this is
cycax Better Living Through psychology
and today I am very happy to be speaking
with Alexander Grace thank you for
joining us all the way from Australia
thank you for having me excited I've
been a fan of Alexander's content
personally for years and I really
respect his even-handed evidence-based
approach to intersexual Dynamics
and to relationships in particular and I
think he has a a special commitment to
helping out men I think that's in like
your hey HERO program it's specifically
geared towards men and helping them
become better versions of themselves not
necessarily just about getting laid but
becoming the best
best possible men that they can be
yes I am passionate about that I think
I'm
uh of the opinion that men and women's
interests uh competing with each other
in some regards particularly if people
are not working optimally I think when
men's best interests are being served is
actually benefits women so I don't see

[01:01]
actually benefits women so I don't see
it at one is the expense of each other
as a zero-sum game so even though I do
help men because I'm a man I think I can
do that better I'm very pleased to know
that the work that I do definitely
benefits their girlfriends benefits
their daughters so I'm all about just
alleviating suffering and helping All
Humans right on and as you know I am a
psychologist who specializes in men's
mental health so I think that's a real
point of commonality between us and so
I'd like to begin by asking so based on
the people that you tend to work with
the men who purchase consultations from
you or by your programs what are some of
the biggest challenges that you see
facing men today
typically they they come in two forms is
one is a variation of I can't seem to
get a girlfriend the other is I'm in a
relationship but it's not working very
well what can I do to fix myself fix her
fix the relationship so that I'm happier
inside my relationship I know that's
quite broad but um it's like am I

[02:01]
quite broad but um it's like am I
answering questions about dating or am I
answering questions about relationships
and sometimes the cause of the problems
in both Arenas can be the same sometimes
different
sure there are different strategies and
skills that are necessary in different
stages of the courtship and the
relationship process but what's
interesting there is I assume you're
casting a very wide net you're talking
to all of these guys they could bring
you issues or concerns about anything
but mostly they bring you concerns about
women either women they're trying to
date or women they're actually in
relationships with as opposed to their
self-esteem or their careers or other
things so do you think that's reflective
of where men's minds are at is that
they're generally focused on women
no I think that's reflective of my role
on the internet actually I'm like the
women Whisperer right like so I think
that they're probably all that other
stuff is very important to men and
they're seeking those problems out
elsewhere but the Alexander Grace
YouTube channel like what I do is
essentially take what is mysterious and

[03:01]
essentially take what is mysterious and
unknowable and unexplainable to a lot of
men and then I try and put it in terms
that men are able to understand you know
like if a woman was an algorithm this
would be what it looks like and so I
sort of break that down so people just
generally know in the back of their mind
like oh that's that Alexander Grace guy
he seems to understand women why they do
what they do so when they come up with
problems in their lives where I don't
understand why women aren't attracted to
me I don't understand why my
girlfriend's always mad at me I don't
understand why this is so hard they just
vomit out that information to me and
then I respond I decoded all here's what
she's thinking here's what she's feeling
here's what's going to make it better
for her here's what to do so whether or
not they're seeking out other like
things about their and stuff like that
they probably are I have no idea if
women is actually at the Forefront I
just know that that's that's my job
that's that's what people come to me for
that makes sense so
um would it be interesting to know how
you figured this stuff out like how did
you how did you understand that you were
the woman Whisperer
[Music]

[04:01]
[Music]
I am absolutely fascinated by the
differences between men and women like I
just for whatever reason I find that
really really interesting because it is
very distinct and I'm of the belief that
the male experience and the female
experience is vastly different the
shared commonality of the humanity is is
interesting but it's those points of
Divergence that I found so interesting
and I also find it so poorly understood
and so when I realized that they were so
poorly understood it was kind of like oh
my God like why is there such a huge gap
between reality and people's knowledge
of that reality and look at how much
good I can do here which is probably why
it became my career with regards to why
I was interested in it personally I
think it's because I recognized very
early on that it was my inability to
distinguish the differences between men
and women that was actually causing the
frustrations I was having in the dating
market and this is back when I was like
a teenage kid you know what I mean like
I had my share of girlfriends or
whatever but mostly I was just kind of

[05:01]
whatever but mostly I was just kind of
blustering about and kind of having
accidental successes of just being
persistent I wasn't being smooth I
didn't really understand what I was
doing and when I think back on some of
the mistakes I made it can link back to
the fact that I didn't know what women
were attracted to I didn't know how to
behave in order to specifically appeal
to their femininity and then when I was
19 my buddy showed me the stuff online
about like the pickup artist Community I
don't know if you ever got into that
kind of stuff like game and flirtation
and seduction techniques or whatever and
I had a good like nine months of just
like studying it and going out with my
buddies and like trying all of this
stuff and I just learned so much
practically I was like oh my God like
women this is what works and it just
kind of captured my brain and that's I
think it was in that dichotomy that I
really became consciously aware of
myself as a man I was like because this
stuff that's working women that would
never work on me like it's not hitting
any part of my resonance but it's like

[06:01]
any part of my resonance but it's like
candy to these girls like they are
absolutely loving it and that fascinated
me I don't understand why more people
aren't absolutely fascinated by that and
then I got more interested in the other
stuff because in the course of my
relationship the more I lent into the
fact that I was the man and that she was
the woman you know when I did get out of
game and did decide it was time to sort
of settle down I got more and more
successful and the relationship was
really good like like really good
there's no false modesty for me my
relationship was and is really fantastic
and I remember it got to a point maybe
three years into the relationship where
another set of my friends broke up and
they were kind of the last couple that I
had looked up to and could ask advice
about any time I got to a problem and
today I was like maybe 25 or something
you know and I came from a my parents
got divorced and I was like I don't
think anybody understands how to do this
properly like nobody seems to be happy
in their relationships everyone seems to
hate their partner and I mean getting

[07:00]
hate their partner and I mean getting
divorced or break looking up or they
can't make it work they're trying to
have you know Affairs or whatever and I
had worked so diligently on
Understanding Psychology understanding
myself understanding the differences
between men and women and my
relationship was going well and people
started to ask me for advice over a long
period of time and I think that
it's kind of an accident but at some
point I started a YouTube channel
because I was actually doing research on
on something completely different but I
came across the red pill on Reddit and I
was like wow this is really interesting
it was the first time I had seen
evolutionary psychology framed as
evolutionary psychology I was a big fan
of Nathaniel Brandon I don't know if you
know his work but the biocentric
psychology from like the 60s movement I
was huge on so I was already kind of
familiar with that idea that we have
these innate psychological
characteristics but I was like reading
all this red pill stuff and some of it I
was like that makes sense but that
sounds sexist or that sounds true but I
don't think people are going to accept
that that's true and I was like what
would happen if we took these ideas

[08:01]
would happen if we took these ideas
out of the internet and then took them
to real women on the street and the idea
just kind of amused me so this was my
origin story is I just wrote a bunch of
questions like the red pill says this
about women and I went to the beach and
I filmed women I was like this is what
they say about women what do you think
and so the first like 30 40 videos of my
channel was just me interviewing women
on the street about these ideas and
generally we found there's a lot of
agreements some really upset
disagreement but it was an interesting
discussion and then that brought me onto
the YouTube space and then I started
looking at the other channels that
people said were similar to mine and the
advice they were giving and I was just
appalled I was like oh my God none of
these guys have any idea what they're
talking about like this is who people
are going to for advice I was really
really kind of depressed and that kind
of gave me the confidence boost of like
oh I think I actually know more than the
so-called like experts here so I started
putting my own opinions out online
obviously I'm very Alexander Grace
Centric so I think my content is good
and it's been six years or so since I've
checked in on what other people are
saying so I have no idea if their stuff
is better or if I was just unfair in my

[09:01]
is better or if I was just unfair in my
initial judgment but regardless that was
the confidence I needed and I started my
YouTube channel and um I think the
success of my channel and the fact that
people still seek me out validates that
I do kind of know what I'm talking about
uh and the people do listen so yeah
that's my story right on thanks for
sharing that's really interesting
there's so much in what you just said I
I agree there's a lot of bad advice on
the internet generally
um both for men and women with respect
to what works in relationships and
attraction and while there might be some
truth to a lot of red pill stuff it's
often verbalized in a way that
is like preaching to the choir I believe
it's like the the folks who already buy
into it hook line and sinker are going
to be nodding vigorously but it's
largely going to be alienating to
anybody who hasn't already been let's
say initiated into that field and so one
of the particular goals of my channel
was to take some of those ideas and
present them in a way that if I were

[10:02]
present them in a way that if I were
speaking directly to a woman she might
be able to understand and agree with
because I don't see the point a lot of
red pill commentators are complaining
about the This Modern state of
femininity and women but they're doing
it in a way that is is not at all going
to cause anyone to change their behavior
so I'm not really sure what their end
goal here is except potentially making
men angrier at women for their own
business uh objectives
oh man so that's what a pleasure to
encounter a mind that's reached the same
conclusion that I have I could say the
exact same thing it frustrates me that
there's not an effort made by these guys
to try and make this information
accessible and mainstream and to bring
women on as allies I'm like what's the
point in staying in that Echo chamber do
we just want to Pat ourselves on the
back and say we're victims or do we
actually want to improve things and so
every single one of my videos I make
with the full awareness that a woman is
going to watch it and I want a woman to
agree with everything that I'm saying
that's a standardized step for myself
right on yeah I feel the same way

[11:01]
right on yeah I feel the same way
because we need each other women aren't
going anywhere men aren't going anywhere
and it's great that we're different and
I think that we can learn to work
together to Greater Harmony
what's when you were started talking
about when you first became aware of
the fact that men and women were vastly
different from each other
I have a story about the first time I
realized that it's a very silly anecdote
but I must have been like maybe 11 or 12
and I was watching the musical grease
have you seen that with John Travolta
sorry and Olivia Newton John okay so
it's a it's a silly
um High School Musical from like the 70s
and there's this number in it called
Summer nights where the John Travolta
and his guy friends and Olivia yeah yeah
girlfriends I know that scene are
talking about the date but they're
talking about it in totally different
ways and my 12 year old mind was blown I
was like they're this they see it
totally differently but the same thing

[12:00]
totally differently but the same thing
happened
you know you get that sometimes musicals
like in West Side Story America the kind
of contest between the men and women
over whether you know they're Pro or con
New York City and it's just that was
actually my entree into the possibility
that men and women Psychology was vastly
different from each other yep no it's a
cool story yeah 100 they're very
different I believe
and you're uh foray into the Pua stuff I
think is not uncommon to guys who get
into the red pill I think that pickup
Artistry is not really an end in and of
itself certainly not one that men in my
opinion should necessarily aspire to but
it can be really useful because what
pickup artists are fundamentally
interested in is Effectiveness they're
like
scientists with respect to applied
behavioral psychology and like good
scientists on some level they're kind of
value neutral is they think you know I

[13:03]
value neutral is they think you know I
can't
presume to know what should work with
this I'm going to go in and just throw a
bunch out there and see kind of what
sticks and then sort of extrapolate my
models based on outcomes as opposed to
starting with a value proposition and
extract language should work based on
what you believe yeah and I think that's
kind of what's great about
pick up community in general is that
it is really based on what works like
what makes the plane fly and
the proof is in the pudding as it were
and I also think that the very thing
that you just elucidated about pickup
artist is why you don't see it as a
strong force anymore I don't know about
like your audience but because it was my
origin I I started off assuming that
most guys had gone through pickup or
learned the basics and it's not not the
case the younger generation the guys who
discover this stuff

[14:00]
discover this stuff
they're more interested in the value
discussions I think the sort of
emptiness I suppose in terms of actual
values in the pickup Artistry doesn't it
means that it can't ever become like a
collective movement in the way that you
see online communities congregate these
days and it also is difficult it takes
work and I also think that it's less
socially appropriate to approach women
randomly you know back that now than it
was you know 15 years ago when I was
doing it so I think that there's a lot
that's been lost unfortunately in the
fact that more young men aren't
practicing game and developing those
skills
um they're more likely to just get
really down like the red pill or the
black pill or whatever like this and and
just by way as a disclaimer I certainly
don't consider myself red pill I know
people have applied that label to me but
that's not something I have for myself
so just to sort of clarify
um
but that that bums me out I would like
to see more guys practice their game uh
yeah yeah I have a video that's going to
be coming out soon about why men are
afraid of approaching women and partly

[15:00]
afraid of approaching women and partly
it's very hard to do that in the shadow
of let's say the metoo movement where
there's not only the threat of rejection
but there's the threat of being canceled
or being shamed for expressing sexual
interest and that's the world in which
we find ourselves but actually I in in
listening to some of the comments from
my own audience
when I talk about seduction techniques
on my channel the pushback is generally
more black pilled it's it's more the
juice isn't worth the squeeze why go
through all of the why learn these
skills just to get a woman when a woman
isn't you know
really all that great of a reward anyway
I see a lot of hopelessness among the
younger generation have you encountered
this as well in your own work yeah yeah
and what do you think that's about
like why why is it showing up now
things are worse than they've ever been
in terms of people getting together
there's more single dim I think women's

[16:02]
there's more single dim I think women's
hypergamy are stronger than ever before
the expectations on men are very
difficult
so it's it's a lot of that and I think
that the the hopelessness I suppose the
giving up is just the final response of
somebody who can't handle rejection or
pain
any longer I mean I think most of these
guys would understand that there are
some men who are happy in relationships
who found good women and they're
fulfilling all of their needs that they
ever wanted from a relationship again
you don't want to brag but without false
modesty like I'm one of those guys so it
can happen I know for a fact that it can
happen that you can be very happy and
find a good woman but if you feel like
that's beyond you I suppose you're gonna
cling to any kind of like uh explanation
that sort of gives you permission to
give up that way you don't constantly
have to feel like a failure you know
what I mean like if you think of the
envy you might feel over a rich person
you know and all the success and all the

[17:01]
you know and all the success and all the
like the lavish luxury goods that they
have and no matter what you just don't
seem to be able to break into that that
strata Stratosphere of wealth you might
be very attracted to ideologies
political ideologies that tell you that
rich people are all corrupt and that you
know money isn't the source of all
happiness or whatever like it is I mean
and it's not I'm not not making that
point but I suppose you you look for
some kind of um justification for your
own failure I suppose there's a kind of
numbing effect say ah it's it's not me
it's not so bad and that's a tough one
because you can't apply it universally
because it's kind of not their fault in
a lot of ways you know what I mean like
the idea that if you don't manage to
find success and happiness in a
relationship with a high quality woman
there therefore it's all on you is
simply not true like there's existential
factors at play it's really hard the
dating market sucks for men there's also
a certain amount of luck now it's true
that with enough dedicated effort and
information and and work over the time
you probably can improve those odds

[18:02]
you probably can improve those odds
significantly but with the black pill
guys and the Doom and Gloom they'll
point to a lot of stuff that's that's
absolutely real absolutely reasonable
it's not an absolute in my mind but you
can't dismiss what they're saying either
as though it's all just their own
problem and they're just making all this
stuff up no that's absolutely not the
case so it's it's a tough line to
balance and I find that um
I find that it's also an emotionally
sensitive topic a lot of guys will get
very upset I suppose in any suggestion
that they can improve their life and
that's a bummer that they've gotten to
that stage almost like
the the feeling of shame or failure or
the loss of happiness or the grief of
not having the life they imagined is so
painful that any small suggestion that
that might still be possible for them if
they take some personal agency is too
much and they block it angrily and the
psychology of a man who's got to that
stage is something that really really
concerns me and actually motivates me to
continue to make my content because I

[19:00]
continue to make my content because I
certainly wouldn't want them to kind of
give up
um but I found it's best not to actually
talk to them directly in that regard
because it just angers them you know too
much you know it's just too sensitive a
subject so yeah I think grief is a
really important word that you just use
there because I I do think on some level
that men might have to pass through the
death of a dream in order to arrive at
acceptance of reality and it's and with
the acceptance of reality the way women
really are the way the world really
works the way the relationships actually
function that you stand the best
possible chances of having successful
happy satisfying relationships
um that a lot of relationships that are
founded on dreams tend to fail but
there's nothing more painful than the
death of a dream and that's actually
what heartbreak is it's not so much
um that you've you're losing what you
had because that's like sacrosanct in
your memory no one can ever take that

[20:00]
your memory no one can ever take that
from you what you're losing is all the
possibilities of what you wanted that
you didn't yet attain the future that
you wanted but will never have and
that's really really hard and
heartbreaking to give up but there could
be enough
in reality if you can get through that
that is still worth striving for does
that make sense a hundred percent and I
hope to anybody listening to what um Dr
Ryan's just said really takes that on
board and let me say from the other side
that my relationship now is not what I
fantasized it was going to be but it's
better
I promise you it's better the reality
has a certain
like we all know that when you when you
take reality and then you distort it
through your own interpretation your
lens and you use it to play out some
fantasy like if you find an average girl
with an average personality but you
project on her all this amazingness and
you live out this pretend fantasy for a
couple of weeks that she's this
incredible girl she's going to solve all

[21:01]
incredible girl she's going to solve all
your problems there's a kind of like
like an amphetamine style like high that
comes from that is like oh I'm getting
away from reality I'm doing this but you
got to keep kind of going
and it's it's it's not very satisfying
in fact it's anxiety provoking it's not
really that good so in case you're like
inclined to not process your grief
because you don't want to give up these
delusions about how special and amazing
women are they're going to solve all
your problems you'll be happily ever
after in case you don't want to do that
work let me tell you that you're not
really giving up anything that's that's
special you know what I mean playing out
that fantasy is not that good the
reality of a good relationship it's it's
more like calm it's like gentle it's
peaceful you know what I mean there's a
sort of quiet satisfaction and pride
that never expresses itself with really
intense emotions or a huge rush of
thoughts or or aspirations about the
future no it's quite grounded and based
on on the present moment and it's
infinitely more satisfying so
like grave because you're not giving up

[22:02]
like grave because you're not giving up
anything good like what you get
what you get at the end of The Grieving
the the dream as Dr Ryan just said is
you get reality and reality is so much
better than anything that you could
imagine if you do it right I suppose
yeah yeah this reminds me of the origin
myth of romantic love which is the um
the myth of Tristan and he soldi are you
familiar with that myth I'm not and just
as a small technical thing is your
camera like bobbing up and down ever so
slightly is it I maybe I'm oh I'm
knocking the table so it kind of okay
I'll try not to do that thanks for
calling that out so um
this is like the foundational myth of
Western romantic love it originated in
the south of France in like the 13th
century and it's a very interesting
story
um Tristan is a knight in the service of
his King and he basically drinks a magic
potion that causes him to fall in love

[23:00]
potion that causes him to fall in love
with
the king's wife and she drinks the same
poster so she falls in love with him and
so they have this horrid passionate love
affair that
exists even though they don't even know
each other even though they don't even
really like each other they kind of are
miserable when they're apart but also
like especially miserable when they're
together and in the course of this story
Tristan actually like swears this woman
off ah this is crazy I have to stop
seeing this woman and she's like no I I
have to we can never do this again and
he gets involved with a woman who's
in this in the myth is also named to
solely but it's a different facility and
she's the assaulty of the white hand and
in this relationship they can have they
live together like she is a textile
person and they have dinner together and
they they like create a household
it's a peaceful ordinary relationship

[24:01]
it's a peaceful ordinary relationship
that's functional
and Tristan is completely bored like he
can't stop thinking about the first
facility
and he eventually leaves that
relationship because it felt
unfulfilling like something was missing
and I think this is really important
because what you talked about is you
maybe you can't get everything that you
want from a relationship maybe part of
the problem here is that people are
going to relationships expecting the
wrong things but
it could be that if you leave those
expectations to the side there's enough
that you can get out of an actual
relationship to justify let's say the
sacrifices involved in creating and
maintaining it
oh my God yeah really well put so to add
on to that just to flesh it out and put
some flesh on the bones here
a lot of people did not grow up with
having all of their emotional needs and
their attachment needs adequately met by

[25:01]
their attachment needs adequately met by
their parents parenting in the west is a
bit of a disaster
um I think we're getting better in some
regards but for the most part for the
generation of me I'm 35 Dr Ryan's 40 I
think a lot of people kind of become
adults but they're stunted emotionally
they have a bunch of unmet needs and
then you couple that with the fairy tale
happily ever after Hollywood soul mate
kind of fantasy myth I've got to find my
missing half a lot of people are
bringing a huge amount of expectations
to their partner they're going to solve
this they're going to solve that like
they're going to fix all of these things
and it's unrealistic but if you can
understand what the limitations of a
woman what a wife or even a boyfriend if
this doesn't have to be gender but what
a partner can do for you then in the
course of that relationship you will try
and get those unmet needs met realize
that it's not appropriate and then if
you're diligent you can work through it
and that the relation relationship
itself can become an Arbiter of reality
of what's appropriate to ask of another
person and what's not and you never

[26:01]
person and what's not and you never
delve too deeply into codependence you
actually work on becoming too
interdependent people that's quite
functional and so it becomes a vehicle
for self-growth in a sense and once
you've used that process to its
completion you realize holy [ __ ] it's
through this relationship that I've
actually discovered where I start and
where I begin like where my boundaries
are who I am and I've also helped this
other person come that way at that point
when you're not bonded through
obligation or codependence that's I
think where True Love Actually exists
it's a pair bonded trust respect Mutual
enjoyment of each other's company and
it's incredible it's amazing
but it's specifically all those good
things because it never tries to be
something that it's not it's a lot of
guys are coming to me and the fights are
having in their girlfriend are just
variations of this exact theme and so
what I I tell them is that
you'll probably love this as a
practicing clinician but there's nothing
wrong with the emotions that you have
the needs that you that you have the the

[27:01]
the needs that you that you have the the
unmet needs it's just that she's not the
right person to fix that girlfriends are
not your mothers and he's like well I
have a [ __ ] relationship with my mother
like what am I going to do I'm like a 30
year old man now I was like yeah I get
that go see a therapist you know go see
Dr Ryan go see somebody else because
there are actual qualified professionals
who exist to help you work through all
of that stuff and you can be codependent
you can have transference with that
person you can play out all of your
insecurities in that therapist's office
and get those needs met and it's so much
healthier to do that with that person
than to try and do it with your
relationship because there are so many
good relationships that are ending
simply because of unrealistic
expectations and that's a tragedy
well yeah a lot there so Robert Johnson
am I making really long monologues I
apologize this is great man I'm really
enjoying talking with you so Robert
Johnson is a jungian psychologist he
wrote a book called we which is a really
wonderful book it's about 100 pages long
people can read it in an afternoon and

[28:01]
people can read it in an afternoon and
it's a jungian interpretation of the
Tristan and soldiment and basically his
fundamental
thesis is that romantic love is a
conflation of the human and the Divine
and that's symbolized by the magic
potion that Tristan is sold a drink it's
made out of herbs so it's like natural
and earthy but it also is magic so it's
supernatural and the danger comes when
we expect the other person to be more
than human or divine
that they can solve all of our problems
that they can make us complete that they
can make us happy and another person
doesn't and shouldn't and can't have
that kind of power over you unless you
give it to them inappropriately and
that's a disaster because we have to
remember that in every classic romance
in literature and history every classic
romance ends in tragedy ends in death
like and that's because on some level
the Romantic idea is that the lovers can
be United at once only in the next life

[29:02]
be United at once only in the next life
so
it's not possible for romantic lovers to
actually live happily ever after here
the Romantic narrative The Narrative Arc
of romance is tragedy
and that's why the Romantic cause is
always the one that's the underdog the
one that doesn't really have any chance
of winning it's hard to root for the
Yankees unless you're from the Bronx
there you have no soul because they have
you know all those championships it it's
hard to root for the
the thing that works the thing that's
successful people don't like to do that
for whatever reason now you mentioned
something else though which is besides
the expectation
um you didn't use this word but what I
think you were getting at is like
wounding
so
what was the word wounding like they
have emotion people have emotional
wounds like maybe they had a [ __ ]
relationship with their mother and so
now they have [ __ ] relationships with
their girlfriends like that's not an
accident
so what I've discovered and I have a

[30:01]
so what I've discovered and I have a
video on this that's forthcoming is in
my own experience when I was in my 20s I
had this like Sixth Sense
I could walk into a room full of woman
women and just like be able to pick out
the one that I could ride the roller
coaster with because like my emotional
wound would resonate in the presence of
a complementary emotional wound and we
would get together and we'd find
ourselves and be very passionate and
intense because we were recreating the
circumstances that led to the wounding
in a misguided attempt to heal the world
yep and we were attracted to that not
because it was good but because it was
familiar yep and this is tough because
this goes back to Childhood stuff and
children will accept any reality which
they're given they don't even really
like if a child is born and raised in
chaos he will think that chaos is normal
he won't even think that it's chaos he
will just think that it's normal
and so when he leaves the family where

[31:02]
and so when he leaves the family where
chaos makes sense he goes and tries to
I'm a good boy I'm doing what you're
supposed to do in relationships which is
to be chaotic and unpredictable and
this is all I've ever seen this is all
I've ever known I thought this is what
you you do
um the fish can't see the water and so
it's particularly difficult for people
who are raised in high conflict or
broken or dysfunctional families but it
is possible to overcome that wounding to
heal that wounding and overcome that
programming and at 30 I mean hopefully
you have at least another 50 good years
of life left so even if it takes a few
years to do it's like that's worth doing
how is he going to spend your time if
not working on this stuff yeah I guess
you'd have to take up knitting or
something how are you doing now are you
still attracted to women based on your
wounds no because what I found is that
as I worked to heal that emotional
wounding okay so this is the other part

[32:00]
wounding okay so this is the other part
of it which is so I I'd have that sixth
sense to the women that I could recreate
those dramas with and then they would
get too crazy and I'd think I just can't
handle this anymore I just want a nice
stable woman and just like in the
Romantic myth I'd find that nice stable
woman and I would be bored to tears and
I would think there's this isn't I don't
feel anything and so I felt for a long
time like I had this terrible choice
between what I
but I was really attracted to but was
terrible for me this is something that I
didn't really feel anything for but I
knew was like healthy and mature
neither one of them look on your face
like oh like a good woman who treats me
well what a what a drag Well yeah if you
eat junk food all your life you think
that you know vegetables are disgusting
but you know you see how it is so
I had to like try to squeeze up some
attraction for some of these stable
women and that didn't work or I tried to
make the unstable women more

[33:05]
so basically I had to change me because
I couldn't change the women and as I
process this stuff and healed it
surprise surprise my authentic
attraction began to change like I didn't
have to try to be attracted to different
women my authentic desire began to shift
and I started to become attracted to
emotionally stable secure women as I
became more emotionally stable and
secure and holy [ __ ] does that solve a
lot of problems
getting in you just never encounter them
when you get into relationships with
emotionally stable secure women oh man
it's great oh so beautiful uh it's it's
just that's the story of so many men you
what you just put this so well and it's
a good reminder to me that like
like I'll admit I'm human sometimes I

[34:00]
like I'll admit I'm human sometimes I
get frustrated at guys who are in that
stage that you're out of like she's
great but I'm bored I'm like what like
like
you know sort of do that but I love the
fact that you actually articulated that
the desire naturally shifted once you
made that shift that's what that's what
guys should be aspiring to and it's one
of the reasons why I say
like I'm not a big fan of these guys who
are just like living the player
lifestyle like that's not my version of
masculinity is just [ __ ] a bunch of
women because I've seen too clearly the
psychological underpinnings of a man who
needs that kind of level of distraction
and Novelty I'm not a big fan of
polyamory I'm not because to me
you can see how
based on what you just said monogamy
with a good woman is almost a test of
character only somebody who's genuinely
comfortable and at peace inside
themselves and who's done that work is
going to be able to unlock those innate
feelings of yes I actually like this I

[35:00]
feelings of yes I actually like this I
actually enjoy this and this is a fine
line for me to walk because I'm very
sensitive to accusations that I would
shame male sexuality and I'm not doing
that I get it male brain new women
different body parts
hugely stimulating I get the
evolutionary psychology of it I'm never
going to deny that even me 13 years into
a relationship a pretty girl comes up on
the TV screen I notice I get that but
what I'm saying is that that doesn't
necessarily Trump out the stuff that Dr
Ryan was talking about that natural
affection that natural love that Springs
up when you're coming from a more
emotionally healthy Place suddenly that
drama queen party girl that used to
excite you so much she just looks like a
hot mess you just like [ __ ] no I don't
want to touch that I don't want to get
that in my space my nice clean
psychologically pure space I don't want
it contaminated with that kind of toxic
low quality woman anymore she's no
longer interesting oh look this girl
treats me nicely she smiles she pays me
compliments she asked me how my day was
suddenly I'm like able to appreciate

[36:00]
suddenly I'm like able to appreciate
that in a whole new way and I hope that
everybody aspires for that
yeah I think I watched to John
mulbaney uh stand up routine he's a
comedian and I think he opened with I
didn't know that relationships were
supposed to feel good and everybody
laughed and he was like that's not a
joke that's just an observation uh and
this is the first time I was in a
relationship and it improved my quality
of life and that's enough that's a
life-changing experience for a lot of
guys for sure it kind of sorry to jump
in but it I I really want to make this
point it kind of
speaks to the Primacy of our
psychological need to heal those initial
wounds in that if you've got a girl in
front of you and you could have a
romantic connection with her but
subconsciously you're sabotaging it
you're picking fights you're provoking
behaviors what your brain is trying to
do is resolve those emotional wounds
that Dr Orion was talking about from

[37:01]
that Dr Orion was talking about from
earlier on and that just says everything
that how a big an impact this trauma
stuff has on us in that when choosing
between should we just enjoy the present
moment and have nice feelings of love or
should we make this a hell but it's a
hell that's potentially going to heal
this deeper hell that's inside me the
brain moves towards this and so men
don't underestimate it men are way too
cocky about their mental health you've
probably seen this like I'll just go to
the gym I'll just make a whole bunch of
money I'll just [ __ ] enough women and
then that'll solve it it won't it won't
you gotta take this stuff seriously
because if you don't when the time comes
and you're in front of a good woman if
you haven't sorted your [ __ ] out you
[ __ ] up the relationship you'll sabotage
it because your brain so desperately
needs to heal this stuff and I've Just
Seen sorry for getting a bit worked up
but I've seen so many requests in my hey
hero in my patreon DMs from guys who
have [ __ ] up good relationships
because they underestimated how messed
up they were inside that they didn't
take it seriously and so I really really

[38:02]
take it seriously and so I really really
want men to hear that message that if
you want to have a good relationship in
the future you can't half-ass this
you've got to sort yourself out
relationships with good women are a
luxury of the men who've done the work
on themselves it's not available to
anybody else the best that you're going
to be able to have is a dysfunctional
relationship and as far as I can see
that's an absolute truth I've not seen
it work otherwise
yeah there's a lot there so the way I
usually say it is that you can't solve
internal problems with external
Solutions so if you have an inner wound
or an internal void which is often how
it's experienced you're going to try to
fill it with money with drugs with TV or
video games with food with sex and it
doesn't work
um that hole inside you is insatiable
and it cannot be filled with something
that's external to itself but it can be
filled with something it can be healed
internally
and um what you described about how
messed up guys
go to relationships

[39:01]
go to relationships
and mess those up in similar ways in
Clinical Psychology we have a term for
that we call it
um a enactment or a reenactment and this
happens in the therapy office too and
there's this kind of a tragedy to this
because
the the unconscious rationalization for
this behavior is okay I was really
messed up by this experience in the past
and I can't go back and change the past
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
recreate the same emotional experience
in the present so that I can work
through it and have a different outcome
the tragedy is that most people haven't
learned the skills of being or relating
to achieve a different outcome so what
they they have a lot of skills in
recreating the same situation they don't
have the skills to do anything
and so they they're trying on this this
was an idea from Freud actually they're
trying unconsciously to solve these
emotional problems by recreating the
same emotional experiences but they lack
the skills and the Transcendence to

[40:01]
the skills and the Transcendence to
actually achieve a different outcome and
so that's why they end up hitting their
head against the wall over and over
again but that's why a therapist is so
valuable in case people don't
necessarily understand it's not just oh
I need someone to listen to my problems
is because while you might lack the
skills to resolve it you don't need
those skills yet you can turn up to a
therapist's office and just recreate all
that stuff in the relationship with a
therapist in a pure psychodynamic
Dynamic way and then the therapist will
talk you through how to resolve it they
they will because that's what they're
paid to do that's what they're trained
to do they're going to be the sensible
ones in the relationship and then
they'll help you fix that well a little
little asterisk there that's what a good
therapist will do and unfortunately like
any other profession there are some good
therapists there's some bad therapists
and a lot of them are going to be
mediocre so if you are going to go the
route of hiring a therapist it's on some
level you actually kind of want to
approach it like dating is that you
might have to talk to a number of people
before you find somebody that clicks and
that will really help you and for those

[41:00]
that will really help you and for those
who are interested in going down that
route
you don't have to try it for like three
months or six months to see if it works
I worked with a therap I worked with
many therapists and so I found the one
that really worked for me and I worked
with him for seven years in my 20s and
I was
uh I resonated with him from the very
first session like he told me something
and he clarified something to me in the
session in real time that I was never
able to put quite into words and that
something just sort of got unlocked and
I knew that this was a relationship that
held something of promise for me versus
other relationships I went in for six to
12 months and at best they didn't make
me worse you know so it is possible to
have a mediocre therapeutic experience
what you described was your therapist a
man
he was I've I've talked to one female
therapist for about 12 months and she

[42:02]
therapist for about 12 months and she
was one of the ones that didn't hurt me
but didn't particularly I didn't
particularly find very helpful
I think that with a good female
therapist they can be really really
useful but what I've heard from a lot of
guys is that they can't talk about the
relationship the dating the sex stuff
with a woman and actually get the kind
of recognition that they need it's it's
just too different and I do think that
at a certain point we just need to sort
of accept that it's like all right there
are some mental health issues unique to
men that you need to speak to another
man because without that feeling of oh
I'm being seen and I'm being understood
you're not really going to trust the
other person who's actually going to
have your back or or take any of his
advice or even work through it properly
and so generally I advise men to see
male therapists if you've got a good
female therapist don't give it up but
but typically that's been the advice
that I've given yeah I think that's true
I I there are three topics in particular
that I think it's easier for a man to

[43:01]
that I think it's easier for a man to
talk to another man
up in another one another woman and
those are sex power and aggression and
these are three things that are kind of
at the core of a lot of masculine
experience especially the aggression
like
some men the only emotion they can
consistently identify and experience is
anger and
anger perceived by another man is likely
experienced very differently than anger
perceived by a woman
and it's it's so I think it's so much
more threatening for a woman to
experience
um male aggression and male anger
um doesn't necessarily mean it's going
to spill over into violence but it can
be threatening and as a guy I think you
have to work through your anger it's
it's like the easiest emotion for us to
feel but it's just you don't want to
stay trapped there it's not like numb or
or angry that's no way to live that's

[44:01]
or angry that's no way to live that's
kind of like being a bull or some sort
of
violent Beast it's it's not um human
but there's a lot of
um men that get trapped there because
they don't have any let's say
um sympathetic outlets for that for the
basis of their anger which is generally
pain an angry man is a man in pain
and there's a lot of research that
suggests that depression in particular
is expressed differently in men and
women the depression that you read about
in the DSM to diagnose statistical
Manual of mental disorders is more
correlated with female presentation this
is kind of like sad and moping around
low self-esteem low self-worth men can
obviously get that too but there's
increasing evidence that men experience
and manifest depression through like
irritability and withdrawal and
isolation and even self-destructiveness

[45:00]
isolation and even self-destructiveness
yep
I agree with all that it makes me think
about the work that I do I run a couple
of online men's groups
um and some of the guys that we've come
across who are shut down emotionally
we've used anger as a means of unlocking
those emotions and it can be a flood
which is really really I remember one
exercise where we kind of took turns you
know uh
uh
no I would yeah just because I feel like
there might be um
violating some privacy stuff so I
apologize for leaving people down a
false Road there but I definitely agree
with everything you're saying anger is a
bit of a secondary emotion and it's used
to try and
to give a sense of control I suppose and
it can be quite a motivating emotion you
know like if you need to get [ __ ] done
being angry is actually quite a good
state to be in but it's so difficult in
this culture because women don't
tolerate male anger and there's so much
Shame about it and that's tough for a
lot of men who are like but I feel angry

[46:01]
lot of men who are like but I feel angry
and there's no Outlet it's like all
right well
in the first instance let's create an
environment where one you can express
some anger with some other guys and
we're not going to shame you that's an
important part but two we can also
provide the safety outlet that Dr Ryan
was talking about for you to talk about
the emotions that are underneath that
anger and that's a difficult process for
a lot of guys because the fear
I suppose the fear is that they're
they're not going to be able to shut it
off and men don't like feeling like
they're not in control and I think
that's probably
why as a whole the whole emotional side
of life is a bit frightening to men
because emotions are not as
within our like autonomy and our Direct
Control as like thoughts are you know
and beliefs that we can analyze and
reflect you know if it's like okay well
we're just going to feel all the pain
that exists inside you all of the
sadness a lot of men like I have no idea
how deep that goes I don't know which
way it's going to flow like that's
that's too frightening I can't sort of
you know let that happen and it's one of
the reasons why I'm passionate about the

[47:00]
the reasons why I'm passionate about the
men's group work we do because it's like
well we can provide some structure you
know what I mean we'll keep you grounded
you're not alone in this and I'm a
strong believer that very intense
emotions probably shouldn't be
experienced by yourself I think that can
lead to feelings of isolation and and
and and shame and it's kind of bad you
know I'm a big fan of actually creating
relationships whether that's with a
therapist a girlfriend or in like a
men's group setting or anything like
that where those deeper emotions are
expressed in the company of somebody
else I think that's incredibly healing
and I think that that's actually what
our brains psychologically are wired for
well provided they're safe and
trustworthy because I would say that if
they're not it might be better to
holster those emotions until you can
find somebody who is
about anger I usually say it's a um it's
a powerful servant but a terrible master
and it can be a force that
if you can yoke it appropriately can be
incredibly motivating and effective but
paradoxically even though men generally

[48:01]
paradoxically even though men generally
feel more empowered or in control when
they give into anger they're much less
so once they start to see red they're
the charging bull and it's really the
bull fighter who's in control of that
situation whoever's waving the cape
that's going to control where the bull
goes and what the bull does and
spoiler alert it doesn't usually end
well for the bull at the end of those
contests
yeah yeah now to be fair um
you used to use the term secondary
emotion yeah that's what we say in
Psychology which basically means that
anger very rarely arises spontaneously
and of itself it's usually a reaction to
a more Primary Emotion like fear or
grief or pain
um that said there is a place for
um anger especially in depressants
some people believe that depression is
um appropriate anger that's
inappropriately directed towards the
self and so sometimes when you're

[49:00]
self and so sometimes when you're
working with really clinically depressed
folks when they actually begin to
express their frustrations with other
people it's a step in the right
direction
okay yeah that don't make sense yeah
they probably shouldn't stay there but
like for the first time they're feeling
safe enough
to express that anger because that's the
other thing is that we can only express
anger when we feel safe
like all these protests that we see in
the western world like that's kind of
because these societies are fairly safe
you don't see that in North Korea
or in other cultures it makes me think
of parenting with like
[Laughter]
a lady I know her teacher would tell her
that her daughter was so sweet at school
and the mum's like God she gets home and
she's like angry about this and having
attention about this and and I think
that's the symptom of what you're just
talking about is that she actually does

[50:00]
talking about is that she actually does
have those emotions of anger but
school's not the safe place for her to
express that but at home where she's
comfortable familiar with the
surroundings and she knows her mum's
going to love her no matter what it
gives her that outlet to be able to
express that anger and that's
appropriate for children but one of the
um what I think I made a video about
this it's called the most toxic
relationship belief
and the belief is basically in my
relationship I get to say and do and be
whoever I want like out there at school
that's where I have to control myself at
work that's where I have to put on the
front but when I come home I should just
be able to let it all out
and I I think that's tough because what
ends up happening is that we tend to
treat the ones that are closest to us
the ones who treat us the best sometimes
the worst they see sides of themselves
that sides of us that maybe would be
best if they put on a little bit more of
uh

[51:00]
uh
um not necessarily A veneer but they had
a little bit more foresight into
revealing like I think of relationships
as roles and I think the only time you
really truly get to be yourself is when
you're by yourself and like it's
inappropriate for you when you're
engaging with your daughter you're in
the father role so are there certain
things that are appropriate for you to
do and probably inappropriate for you to
do when you're engaging with your
partner you're in the husband role and
that comes with certain privileges and
responsibilities but the idea that I
should just be able to be myself warts
and all no matter what and expect you to
to love and cherish me I think that's
tough because it can feel like they
treat the Stranger On The Bus better
than us and that's um not a good place
to be in it's the trade of a low quality
woman is really good love everything you
just said and just to add on to it is
that she mistakes the expression
sometimes the obnoxious expression of
her pain in the form of anger blame
insults as though she's just being

[52:01]
insults as though she's just being
authentic she's being real something
like that and it's a [ __ ]
rationalization used to abuse somebody
innocent I think it's totally [ __ ] up
and I have really no tolerance for it I
can understand if you've never come
across this information maybe once or
twice but when you see the impact it has
on your partner you really should cut it
out straight away so this goes for any
men who are listening if you do this to
your partnership as well you can't just
be angry and like yelling and blaming
them for stuff and being like well I'm
just being authentic I'm just being real
no you're being a dick you need to cut
that out what the obligation for you if
you want to be real in a relationship is
you need to find out well what is the
primary emotion and if it's sadness if
it's fear you need to communicate that
not in a way that blames the other
person in a way that brings them in and
and and and enlist them as an ally as a
teammate you know like if you did feel
really angry about something okay you
might you know say a few sentences and
then she'll be like whoa what the hell
you need to take a moment you need to
step away and then come back and be like
you know what I actually think I'm just

[53:00]
you know what I actually think I'm just
scared that you know we're not as close
as we used to be or that I'm scared I'm
not making enough money and I'm just I'm
I'm taking it out and then she's like oh
like I'm here for you I hear that let's
work through it and then suddenly you're
not in competition with each other
you're not trying to recreate it or or
push some [ __ ] drama or something
like that it's like no you're actually
working towards the solution so any guys
out there who think that it's their job
as the man to like listen while their
their partner is like raving and ranting
and insulting and and having tantrums
and things like that no she's not being
real you're not privileged or anything
like that she's being obnoxious and
entitled and you don't have to put up
with it you you can demand actual
authenticity and that requires her being
vulnerable because there's not really
any vulnerability in anger and if you're
not being vulnerable then she's not in
reality and what progress can you
actually make unless you're the two of
you are actually in reality
okay so this might be a Point of
Departure that we may have
um because the way that you're
describing it is
um
uh like The Importance of Being

[54:02]
uh like The Importance of Being
emotionally vulnerable with your partner
not necessarily just spewing every
thought or feeling out the moment that
you have it without a sensor or without
any kind of processing
but to bring your emotional
vulnerability to your partner and to
discuss that and resolve that in
collaboration potentially and I think
that possible
in relationship and it's probably only
possible though in very high functioning
effective communicators with emotional
stability do you would you agree with
that
yes but I feel like I might be being led
into a trap like I want to know where
you're going sure so one of one of the
concepts that I have is that
um the captain can't complain
and this
I I kind of approach relationships from
the perspective that the man is the
leader of the relationship yeah and so
that it's not a pure equality and that

[55:01]
that it's not a pure equality and that
there is a hierarchy in the relationship
and there are Privileges and
responsibilities that come with both of
those positions like ideally the woman
is like the first mate it's a very
elevated position
they offer feedback in counsel and a
good Captain will take that under
consideration but it's ultimately his
call
for the good of the ship which is the
nuclear family that he is leading and
one of the the resp the let's say the
responsibilities of a captain
is that he's like roll-bound not to
share his troubles with the subordinates
with with the crew as it were because
one thing that women are really good at
doing is they're sort of like good at
incubating and then reflecting back it's
like in every culture and every
mythology that I'm aware of the moon is
feminine and what is the moon though it
reflects the light of the sun which in
every culture that I'm aware of is the
masculine and so it's like the woman
will take what the man gives it

[56:01]
will take what the man gives it
and like incubate it and give it back to
him and shine it back to him you give a
woman a little sperm she'll give you
back a baby kind of a thing but if you
give her a little ounce of trouble or a
little ounce of fear or insecurity she
might bring that back to you in a in a
much more Amplified way
so my perspective is as a man you are
going to have fears you are going to
have concerns but it might be more
appropriate to bring that to your fellow
captains like other men that you have
trusted relationships with or your
father or your therapist
um then necessarily your first mate what
do you think about that
I think many things about that uh
I need to approach this quite delicately
I understand the the point that you make
and the general trend of it and I
disagree with the ultimate outcome and I
disagree for heaps of reasons and I'm a
little surprised that we're going to
depart on this one but I think this will
be very worthwhile to find out if we get

[57:01]
be very worthwhile to find out if we get
to the end of this if I change my mind
or if you change yours or if we just
offer two alternate perspectives and let
the audience decide that's also
completely fine
so the first thing that I would say is I
would not personally enjoy being in a
relationship if I could not be real with
my partner that's one of the biggest
Joys I get from my relationship is the
ability to
be vulnerable and to feel cared for by
her and if I felt like I was unable to
do that I would significantly like like
relation my relationship would be a lot
less enjoyable so I think that one of
the dangers of your advice is that
you're selling women short on what
they're capable of doing and then so
doing selling men's short and that if
they follow your advice they're not
going to reach the full Heights of
pleasure that's possible in a
relationship because they're
artificially handicapping themselves
it's one of the first thoughts that
comes up to me but I feel like that's
not really worth discussing at the
moment because first we need to discuss

[58:00]
moment because first we need to discuss
whether or not that's true what you've
said is that women are destined to do
that and I think that that's one of the
dangers of applying a whole bunch of
Truth which you just did and then making
a kind of what I would say is like a
leap into an outcome as though it's it's
absolutely predestined to be this way
but I have to tread a little bit
carefully
and actually figure out why I think this
well the first instance is that because
it just doesn't track with my experience
so maybe I'll just safely speak from
that is that
when I
correctly identify the true source of
um an emotion and I can bring it to my
partner in a vulnerable sense it does
not frighten her it reassures her it
demonstrates that I'm capable of
self-reflection that I take
responsibility for the actual source of
what's going on for me and I trust her
to know that information and to treat it
delicately and then we resolve it right
then and there so it doesn't linger as

[59:01]
then and there so it doesn't linger as
an issue so it serves as an incredibly
strong process of pair bonding for the
two of us and we're so much closer
because of it I can't relate to the
picture that you just spoke about of a
woman taking those things and then
leaving with relate God to my own
partner to me that just sounds like a
woman who's not emotionally mature
enough to be able to handle real
intimacy uh like a low quality woman
stuff and I'm sort of like well I
wouldn't be interested in dating a woman
who didn't have that basic human
capacity
okay I mean you have some points there
you might be right maybe this is a way
that we can approach a common ground on
this um
there's a difference potentially between
uh for a man going to his woman and
saying I'm afraid I'm feeling really
insecure about money and that's causing
me to like lose sleep and to worry about
our future yeah and a guy who comes to
his woman says I'm feeling I've been
feeling concerned about money in our

[1:00:01]
feeling concerned about money in our
financial future
and so I've taken
is my plan and I have this idea for
resolving this anxiety in a like
reality-based way but I'm not and the
difference I think is not just I'm I'm
bringing my
my feelings I'm also beginning to work
towards the solution and I think that
can make things more reassuring for the
woman
yeah so and I'll put it let me try and
rephrase what you said and you tell me
if you agree with my rephrasing is that
you can't ever bring your emotions to a
woman in a codependent way you can't
ever bring your vulnerability to
expecting her to solve it if that's
interesting by codependent yeah you
don't you can't expect your woman to
solve your problems yes and so a lot of
guys I maybe this is where we might have
some commonality they might bring the
fear to the woman hoping that like a
good mommy she will assuage his fear and
yeah everything is going to be okay and
rub his back and I believe in you

[1:01:01]
rub his back and I believe in you
and that might actually undermine the
trust and confidence in his leadership
if there's enough repetitions of that
exactly okay I think we might be on the
same page and I really do hope people
don't click add this video let us
resolve this discussion because actually
where we end up on this one is going to
be really really important
so I I definitely agree with that and it
was difficult for me to make the points
I was making earlier because I'm aware
that people could misinterpret what I've
said and do what I do with my
relationship and they could do it badly
they could do it in a codependent way
and for the most part people need to
follow your advice because my read on
the general male population is there's
too many you know
what not simply kind of looking for
their girlfriends to be their mother's
kind of energy around there and there
needs to be a lot more taking
responsibility I guess I don't want
people to
think of their relationships as going to
be limited to when I'm struggling I
can't talk to my partner about it that's

[1:02:01]
can't talk to my partner about it that's
that's not appropriate and here's the
I really hope people listen quite
carefully because here's the Nuance of
it sometimes the solution to an emotion
or vulnerability that you're
experiencing doesn't have a clear
practical piece of action that needs to
take to resolve it sometimes the
compassionate witnessing by your partner
is the solution there's an emotion
there's a vulnerability that you felt
your entire life and it's never been
seen understood or cared about by
anybody and when you bring that to your
partner in a sense you're coming to them
for a solution but it's not any deeper
other than I just discovered this about
myself and I want to share it with you
and then you discover that in them
listening and caring about that you're
like oh my God
I'm no longer carrying this burden of
this emotion I considered shameful by
myself anymore I was able to demonstrate
it in front of a person I love and Trust
they still love me in return I'm just
feeling one percent more acceptable

[1:03:01]
feeling one percent more acceptable
inside myself problem solved you know
that's the kind of fix and so we're kind
of talking about levels here in the
first stage of a relationship when
you're still working through this
codependency you need my girlfriend to
Mother you followed the advice Dr Ryan
you know Orion gave it's really really
good take responsibility for it keep it
in your frame don't be codependent but
also once you're in a relationship and
that's established she loves you she
trust you you're committed don't limit
yourself and hold yourself back from
potential pair bonding experiences that
could be really really amazing for your
growth really really Inspire more
loyalty and trust and love with each
other these parts of yourself that
previously like no I can't show with
that I can't show her that if you love
and trust this girl and she's your
partner and the issues you're dealing
with are just existential things to do
with the universe you could make the
both of you feel way less lonely if you
actually open up and trust and there's
an experience of pleasure that comes
from that that I would never trade for
anything it's probably I dare say it

[1:04:00]
anything it's probably I dare say it
might be my favorite thing about my
relationship and so that might be why I
unnecessarily jumped the gun in the
initial conversation I thought we were
coming from different places because I
assume what you're talking about was
like never had that and I was like [ __ ]
like that's not where I'm coming from at
all but I I don't think well I'll let
you respond now but I don't think we're
actually on different pages as much as I
thought that we were not as much I I do
think that was very well said and course
you need to need to bring
concerns and your issues to your partner
a captain
if there's water coming into a ship he
can't pretend that it's not sinking
said he can't just evolve into panic and
hope to be reassured by his crew he has
to keep his wits about him and spring
into action in a reality-based way to
solve a problem but what you're getting
at is um very
um emotionally
Advanced it's yeah and it's something
that you can definitely do with a a
mature woman who is effective an

[1:05:00]
mature woman who is effective an
effective Communicator who's emotionally
attuned and in a trusting loving
relationship and this sharing of
yourself with each other is actually an
important component of becoming yourself
I think this is why in like the in all
12-step programs part of the process is
to admit to another person and to God
that you have a problem it's like you
need to be able to overcome the shame
of the hiding and the isolation
and reveal yourself to another person in
a safe and appropriate context in order
to move in the direction of becoming
more yourself and overcoming the
addiction that you're struggling with so
I think that's was actually very well
said on your part
um
can I jump in and just say that was very
awkward that I had to do that because I
would never really talk about that in my
YouTube videos I would never make a
video about that because what I said was
so easily misunderstood and it's hard to

[1:06:02]
so easily misunderstood and it's hard to
protect against that I think a lot of
guys will take what I said and think oh
good I can now look for my girlfriend to
solve my problems for me you know what I
mean like it is quite an emotionally
Advanced thing and because I do think
that too many men are doing that it's
not the kind of thing that I'd usually
say publicly like because of its
potential to be misunderstood it's more
something that would come about in like
a one-on-one like like if I was helping
somebody out and they were at that kind
of stage but um
what I would also say so it was I was it
was interesting being put on the
receiving end of like God 99 of the time
I would be saying exactly what you're
saying but it's just in this one
instance I'm like no I think you can be
even greedier I think you can get even
more out of your relationships so it was
quite an interesting exchange for me
yeah okay I I think that was again very
well said
um what was I going to say about this
I'm just gonna jump in but I think I
lost it if it's important it'll come
back can I say it's

[1:07:00]
back can I say it's
it's exciting I suppose that the
conversation for me is being pushed in
this direction because I don't think
that there's
like in terms of like men's advice
online from the little I've seen it's
very very surface level and one of the
things that excites me about the fact
that like you reached out to chat to me
and I look at your channel there's been
such like tremendous growth and like
people are watching your stuff is
it makes me feel like this information
about the differences between men and
women is going more mainstream if we can
take a guy like you who had a successful
you know private therapy practice and
now you're like this is so important
that I'm going to start a YouTube
channel about it and I'm going to talk
to a man about these differences about
dating stuff and I was interviewed on
another podcast that Emily and Todd
podcast and Todd again it's a guy from
New York and he has a successful private
therapy practice and I'm like cool like
seven years ago you know it's guys like
me who don't have any formal education
in Psychology or just really passionate
amateurs we're making videos but you

[1:08:00]
amateurs we're making videos but you
know we're kind of more On The Fringe
and it's it's it's exciting to me that
guys with more mainstream credibility
are coming into this space and dare I
say potentially bringing more reality
less histrionic kind of emotionality in
victimhood and tribalism you know to it
um so look I just I like that last
exchange there is the I feel like is a
good example of the conversation in this
space hopefully elevating more and more
and more with the introduction of people
like you coming in oh thank you but I
think there's also ways in which the
mainstream media and the mainstream
professions really fail people as well
and that's what I've always loved about
YouTube is the Democratic potential of
the medium and I I do think that
ultimately it should be
um the the truth and the validity of
what is being said that should matter
more than the credentials or the
authority of whoever is saying it and
I guess it's nice that here I am a

[1:09:01]
I guess it's nice that here I am a
licensed psychologist who's saying some
of these things maybe that means that
some people will listen because I have
the degrees and the diplomas but
ultimately the truth of anything that I
say or anything that you say is
is does it bear with reality and does it
does it work like does the plane fly
when we follow these laws
and I think that it's really important
for me and for other folks to not
devolve to arguments of authority and to
believe that just because I have this
training where I have this degree that I
necessarily know more than somebody else
um that's not the case and I think that
we can all get better at evaluating
arguments on their own Merit independent
of the sources from which they arise and
that's
really the possibility of democratic
mediums like social media and a way of
moving towards integration of our
increasingly polarized Society it's like
we should be able to take the truth on
both sides or all sides because there's

[1:10:01]
both sides or all sides because there's
more than just two sides and
um use that to improve our lives and to
increase Harmony in our relationships
so two things is one is I very much
agree with you on the appeals to
Authority argument but my point was more
that reality does come first but now
look at people coming to reality that's
exciting
um so that's compromacy but I'm a little
bit more cynical about
um the sort of meritocracy argument that
you just made about social media I think
it's true in certain Pockets but what
I've seen becomes popular on social
media is not necessarily what's true
it's what
triggers emotions what validates
victimhood what inspires tribalism often
the things that kind of become really
popular bear no bearing to reality
reality is actually kind of shunned it's
actually what's convenient you know and
things like that I do think that certain
Pockets you know and I would with no
false humility consider myself and your
channel as well to be part of those
pockets of the reason they're popular is

[1:11:00]
pockets of the reason they're popular is
because they're hitting truths and it's
like oh no that's why we're taking off
and and having some success but but I
kind of see that more as the exceptions
so the sort of so-called like virtue of
democracy of social media I'm not so I'm
not so thrilled about I'm a little bit
more inclined I think maybe even than
you are and maybe if you spend seven
years on YouTube like I have you might
become more cynical like me but I quite
like the idea that some of this stuff is
a little bit more
there's a little bit more gatekeeping
involved you know what I mean because
there's so much fake information online
and so much stuff that seems true and
seems knowledgeable but actually isn't
and the misinformation causes a lot of
stuff I actually do prefer that people
have some kind of I know what I'm
talking about I'm talking like and it's
this and I don't mean that to become an
appeals to Authority I just think that
maybe there's a bit of a middle ground I
hear what you're saying and there's
certainly truth to that like
I know that if I made more extreme or
inflammatory content I would have far
more subscribers than I currently do but
that's just not how I want to operate I

[1:12:02]
that's just not how I want to operate I
think that if you have understanding of
these media and marketing and
positioning you can grow very quickly
and have like a more acute influence but
I think that these tend to be more flash
in the pan they they don't tend to last
as long I think the truth is slower to
catch on but it's harder to get rid of
so so good so that channels that are
really more concerned about that they
grow more slowly because they generally
grow through word of mouth as opposed to
like paid promotion or marketing efforts
and
um they're very different once like the
truth is the hardest virus to eliminate
and because once a person hears it they
never forget it and one
truth told to a person at the right time
can be life-changing
so I I really do think that on the whole
there's probably more
opportunity to social media than

[1:13:03]
opportunity to social media than
um liability
I do remember the thing I was going to
say so to just go to put a maybe a cap
on the conversation about let's say
um emotional intimacy with your partner
that it's also really really important
to emphasize that this is only
appropriate in a safe and trusting
relationship with a woman that you
vetted because what I've often seen is
that
even when I would go out on first dates
sometimes when women found out that I
was a therapist they would start just
like spilling their purse on the table
and talking about how they had DUIs and
their father abused them and it's like
wow I talked to guys and they have these
like 12 hours First Dates 12 hour second
dates where they stay up all night and
they just talk about their childhood
traumas and their dreams for the future
and it's like that is way too much too
soon you don't know who this person is
you don't know what they're going to do
with you or
um your vulnerability and it is a
shortcut to like let's say accelerate

[1:14:01]
shortcut to like let's say accelerate
the intimacy of the relationship but it
might not be appropriate and these sorts
of relationships they tend to be uh you
know the ones that burn twice as bright
burn for half as long kind of a thing
they get really intense very quickly and
then they tend to flare out in really
dramatic and high conflict ways so that
the vulnerability disclosure is is not
appropriate until you're much further
along in the relationship would you
agree with that so strongly so strongly
agree with that that so it's such a
damaging idea to open up too quickly too
soon because you're likely to get burned
and guess what happens then all your
trust issues all your trauma you're
going to bury them even deeper it's
going to be harder to dislodge so it
just makes me sad listening to the
description that you gave though because
it just speaks to how much pain that
people are living in because they must
know rationally that this is not a smart
idea you haven't vetted this person yet
what are you doing spilling your guts
but if they're that desperate to find

[1:15:01]
but if they're that desperate to find
somebody and to finally speak about this
stuff they're being driven to that even
though it's completely irrational to do
so and that's that's really depressing
that that's where people are at but it's
not going to work there's a level of
disclosure emotional disclosure that's
appropriate at the start of a
relationship and it's very very small
mostly you want to be having fun like
flirt tease you know have some laughs be
a bit sexual like that's what the start
of a relationship should look like and
then later on it's like okay we like
each other's energy we like each other's
Vibe you know what about values can we
actually talk like what kind of a life
do you imagine it's like oh there's
actually some similarities all right I'm
going to invest a little bit further and
it's really only once you're in an
established relationship like okay like
if we're gonna do this there's some
things I'd like to you know explore with
you it's like this thing happened to me
when I was a kid you know I'm taking
care of it but you should know and she's
like thank you so much for sharing with
me I don't think any less if you're not
all right cool I dipped my toe in the
water it went well next time I'll go a
little bit further it's got to be
sensible timed based on the feedback

[1:16:02]
sensible timed based on the feedback
that you're getting if you're just like
trauma dumping on people you're only
going to traumatize yourself further
it's a really bad strategy and also
women don't find it attractive you know
women like just straight up you're not
going to keep women if you do that
because women are not attracted to men
who don't have control of themselves in
this way who can't read basic social
cues and know that that's not
appropriate you've got to come across as
masculine on top of your stuff you know
within your frame
so yeah total disaster I agree with
everything you said yeah that's that's
interesting in therapy we have this term
called an emotionally disconfirming
experience and that's when a person is
able to do the thing that he's afraid of
and the outcome is non-terrible and
therefore he can let go of a lot of the
baggage around the thing and that's
actually what changes people not
insights not like learning that oh my
mom did this and my dad did that

[1:17:01]
mom did this and my dad did that
not necessarily paying a therapist
hundreds or thousands of dollars it's
about having emotionally disconfirming
experiences and you can have those with
a therapist but there's always a part of
you that knows that this is like a paid
professional that you're doing it with
so the real
the real way that people get better is
to have that emotionally disconfirming
experience in the real world is that
they can go out there and let's say they
have terrible approach anxiety they can
go up to a woman and
it's a non-terrible experience maybe
even a positive experience and that is
going to be worth more than 10 therapy
sessions
um that said you have to create the
context
that makes it more likely that they will
it will be a successful
situation you know so if you run off
half cocked and you just approach a
woman willy-nilly it might actually end
up badly and then that reinforces your
pre-existing beliefs about women
um same thing with the trust issues that
you were saying so uh yes there is a

[1:18:00]
you were saying so uh yes there is a
possibility to be healed in our
relationships but in general we should
try to do as much healing on our own as
possible before we seek out
relationships with others that's that's
my belief
but like like we've established those
emotionally disconfirming experiences
that are so much more transformative
than just insights they happen in
relationships they do so I mean it's one
of the reasons I'm so passionate about
the men's group I call them hero circles
that I run
um
because it's not just me who is somewhat
like the facilitator or whatever but
there's a bunch of other guys and so
when they're having these experiences of
I've never shared this with anybody it's
there's regular dudes who are all you
know disconfirming that that's a
shameful thing they're like no man we
hear you we love you it's all still good
it's very very transformative and that's
why the the focus for me as the
facilitator is away from intellectual
discussions and trying to find insights
and more is into experiential
relationship stuff because coming from
the kind of psychodynamic kind of like
place that I come from like to me that's
where the real transformation comes from

[1:19:01]
where the real transformation comes from
it's so much more interesting I
facilitated a lot of groups
um as a therapist and
there's a lot of evidence that suggests
that the outcomes from group therapy are
superior to the outcomes in individual
therapy I believe it group therapy is
real the idea of group therapy is really
scary to people who have never
experienced it but it's so the potential
for
accelerated transformation is
unparalleled and the reason there's a
fantastic book by um a group therapist
named Irvin yalam who was yeah I love
that book I've read it so much yeah yeah
that book is fantastic and he has a
whole chapter about the mechanisms that
are unique to group therapy that help
people improve in that modality and one
of them is just that another dude not a
therapist not a trained or paid
professional just another human being
just like you says dude I have the same
problem

[1:20:00]
problem
and it's like that normalizing
experience of opening up thinking that
you were the only one who was
suffering from this in the entire
universe and then being met with like
compassion understanding from somebody
who's not being paid to do that is
really incredible
so there's a great potential in group
therapy it's hard people are very scared
about group therapy usually before they
try it but it can be a great thing I'm
such a strong believer I read the book
group by Christy Tate and it really blew
my mind and then I read I read a bunch
of yolom's books but I bought the big
fat like textbook yeah it's it's a long
one it's it's a long one but as I as I
read it I was just like [ __ ] this is
as far as I could tell based on my 35
years of living on this planet the stuff
he was talking about offered the best
most sensible way to achieve Mass change
for a bunch of people those conditions

[1:21:01]
for a bunch of people those conditions
and so even though what I offer in these
hero circles is not therapy because I'm
not a licensed therapist I say the
effect is therapeutic because we borrow
heavily from that stuff as we support
each other
right on well I think that's probably a
good place
day Alex
and it's been a wonderful conversation
um if people want to know more about you
where should they go
can I Beady greedy and bring up one more
topic before we wrap it up if you like
sure how comfortable are you talking
about your personal relationship did you
talk about on your Channel not usually I
don't usually talk about my personal
relationship and that's just out of like
concern for the woman's privacy I've
already noticed that people are
searching out who this person might be
and I want to kind of like maybe protect
her from that on some on some level I
get it man I spent six years on YouTube
before I told anybody I was in a
relationship just like complete blank as
far as anybody knew I was single and

[1:22:00]
far as anybody knew I was single and
then at some point I was like
I don't mind anymore what I I just I
didn't feel as vulnerable about it like
but I'm a very intensely private person
so even though
I have a bunch of questions and I'm sure
people would appreciate the questions
I'm going to ask I was gonna ask I think
it's more important that you've got some
boundaries so I'm not going to push we
can we can wrap things up okay
um well I am in a relationship it's a
committed relationship and we've been
dating for several years now and um I'm
very happy with the way things are going
so I'll leave it at that can we ask one
question like how does she feel about
your YouTube channel
is that too personal no not at all um
she's she follows yeah me and I think
she watches every single thing I
probably wow she's a very supportive
um partner are you watching right now
Orion's girlfriend are you listening to
my words right now probably like she she
watches the long-form interviews as well
so um she has always been supportive of
what I've what I'm doing here uh I think

[1:23:01]
what I've what I'm doing here uh I think
when I've
so and a lot of this is my ideas about
women and relationships and so
um it's out there you know it's not like
I'm hiding this from her uh I think when
I've talked to her about this in the
past she says you know I
um disagree with some of the things that
you say Orion but you also bring up
things that I've never thought about and
so it's useful for me to consider it
from your perspective
so it's never caused any kind of
difficulty or conflict in my
relationship my YouTube channel
I'm particularly curious to know what
you would think of the exchange that we
just had about the nature of emotional
intimacy like if you were to go to her
and just like I've just had this
existential fear of death come over and
I just can't help but feel kind of
panicked and I don't know what to do
with it would she be like yo Captain
what the [ __ ] I'm the crewmate you
should not be talking to me about this
or would she be like oh my God I have
that sometimes as well I feel so much
closer to you like I I'm I'm very
curious to know how she would feel about

[1:24:01]
curious to know how she would feel about
what you talked about and your
relationship well on that particular
note I don't think it would come as a
surprise so anybody who knows me
personally knows that I keep momentum
worry very close to Heart I've had
several near-death experiences and I
suffered a lot of like loss and death of
loved ones when I was young so I don't
really go a day without thinking about
death and that is actually what acutely
motivates me to stay focused on what's
important and to move in the direction
of what I truly value
um so that would not come as any
surprise to her if I said that having
some existential dread and do you feel
like it's made her lose attraction for
you or do you think it's helped Bond you
sharing those things with her to be
honest on this particular point I don't
think that she it's almost like a
disconnect she does not she is not as
far as I can tell
what she's told me she hasn't yet
experienced that kind of
existential concern yes I think it's

[1:25:00]
existential concern yes I think it's
only a matter of time but she's also you
know she her family is very intact her
parents are still together she has
uncomplicated loving relationships with
her siblings
she has never really experienced any
kind of significant suffering or
hardship yet so she's on some level been
privileged by her life thus far but on
some level she's also been handicapped
because I think that it can
prevent her from understanding certain
dimensions of experience I found this to
be the fact among my friends as well so
I have I have friends who I call normies
who they just don't understand certain
things that I've gone through
um they think that this only happens in
movies or in soap operas
and let me tell you the truth sometimes
is Stranger Than Fiction but if people
have never experienced how chaotic or
how
terrible
relationships can be or how life how
difficult and painful life can be

[1:26:00]
difficult and painful life can be
um it's almost like does not compute it
doesn't really get in at best or they
get a little uncomfortable at worse
because they kind of have this dim
awareness that those things exist and
they're they don't want to really
experience them yet and they hope that
they can
prevent them for as long as possible
so we
we are very different with respect to
certain emotional and psychological
traits yeah but I think we're
complementary in that regard
you almost want to preserve that
innocence for as long as possible Right
like you don't really want to infect
somebody with
that reality of like if somebody is not
dealing with an existential fear of
death like every single day you're
almost like why would I ruin that right
but there is a real gift
to that momentum Warrior because it does
sharpen your focus and keeps you
motivated it's also easy to let stuff go

[1:27:02]
motivated it's also easy to let stuff go
um I think it's easier to have more
compassion for yourself and for other
people
um but I'm her first relationship I mean
so that's
how old is she she's 30. okay
I'm not robbing the cradle oh I know
you're a four-year-old dude like her
first relationship all right this could
take a 10. 30 is fine
so we have very different relationship
experiences we have very different life
experiences and that's okay
I think that's great
yeah no that's cool oh man I thank you
for sharing what you just did share with
me
um
I like I I obviously I'm I'm now excited
to have like a deeper relationship with
you in whatever form that might happen
in that like I'm now curious to find out
what commonalities the two of us have
had in our personal lives and share
about that this is probably not the
appropriate platform to do that but
um no it makes me happy Alexander I'd
love to get to know you socially and

[1:28:00]
love to get to know you socially and
maybe we can be friends as well oh cool
I gotta say it's
when I started if I can just be
self-indulgent but seven years ago on
YouTube I really did feel like alone
like like isolated in that I was like in
my mind I was like okay let's take the
best of this manisphere type stuff the
stuff that's true and then let's talk
about how it fits into all the
mainstream psychological stuff which is
not controversial it's been established
and then that's kind of how my channel
sort of fused together but I was very
alone in that like the people who would
like say these are your colleagues I see
their stuff and I'm like I don't feel
like I have anything in common with that
person at all like I don't get where
they're coming from they seem to be such
a hateful individual I don't like it
whatsoever more and more recently the
people who seem to be coming up and
becoming more popular on YouTube like
yourself I'm like man I [ __ ] love
this guy like I hope their Channel
becomes huge like I hope these are my
new like YouTube colleagues and in that
vein I don't know if you've come across
this stuff yet have you seen the YouTube

[1:29:00]
this stuff yet have you seen the YouTube
channel wheat waffles
uh no but I think I've the name has come
up in my uh comments
okay so uh like he's a guy I've got to
know a little bit off screen as well
some of his stuff I really disagree with
but he's a good guy like he's a really I
think he's got a lot of Integrity he's
very intelligent and he presents the
black pill look stuff
in his clean irrational way as you
possibly can I just wanted to mention
his name to you as a as a future
possible guest for your podcast
um I would definitely watch that he's a
fascinating guy to chat to oh I can do
it but yeah one of the great things
about the Channel Growing is that it
gives me the opportunity to connect with
people like yourself and that's been
really fulfilling for me personally is
to expand my social network Beyond just
my private recording studio and my
little you know Cotter of pre-existing
relationships to really I mean here you
are you're in Australia I'm in
California we're connecting from
opposite ends of the Earth because we

[1:30:00]
opposite ends of the Earth because we
have
some points of commonality and shared
vision and resonance and that's an
amazing thing that just wouldn't have
been possible even a generation ago and
I think that's for me personally the
real opportunity of this channel is that
it can uh
he can get me in contact with folks and
to potentially build relationships with
people that
um are just gonna light me up that I'm
going to be jazzed to know and to talk
to and spend time with
so that's a selfishly part of why I'm
doing this
oh I've made amazing relationships um
through the channel I think you know
Blair Daley the guy who does the the
commission for boys and men in Seattle
Washington oh yeah I did he sponsored a
a video of mine I think I called it
divide and conquer
uh and it was about the the pressures
that
keep men and women pitted against each
other or see that men's issues and
women's issues are zero-sum games
um like he's such a good guy and he's

[1:31:00]
um like he's such a good guy and he's
doing such amazing work and I've known
him for years he was an early supporter
on my channel even did some filming for
me back when I was still doing like
Street interviews just to get oh really
he was one of the guys who went out
he was he was one of the best yeah his
videos that he filmed for me got
hundreds of thousands of of views it was
fantastic but like I've known him for a
number of years and he's an ongoing
supporter he reached out to me on
patreon when I said like oh I'm gonna be
chatting with the guy from psychex um Dr
Orion he's like I know him he's great
tell him that you know me and stuff like
that and I just had dinner with um a guy
has been uh you know messaging me over
hey hero for like a number of times and
I just took a recent family trip to
Thailand and he lives in Thailand and we
you know caught up and I met his partner
and we had like a great time things like
that it's really good for socializing
and yeah it puts you in contact with
guys so you're not likely to just run
into your local town but
um
in Napa of all places which is not a
very big city
um and that always sort of jazzes me and
surprises me it's still kind of a new

[1:32:00]
surprises me it's still kind of a new
experience do you still do your
um retreats in Thailand I think you were
offering that at least a few years ago
maybe before the pandemic oh great it
was really great but yeah so yeah I was
out there kind of scoping out a little
bit for new um locations to to do so I
think post-pandemic people were a little
bit more skittish about traveling to
developing countries and across the
globe I think what's probably more
likely if we do those is I might
actually fly to Europe or North America
and we might do them there
um but I don't really think of Thailand
as developing personally I I've been
it's it's so safe they have all the
amenities of civilization it's a
wonderful place to visit
yeah I saw some [ __ ] like you know what
I mean like
like I would speak to the people who
live there and they tell you stories
about like like some of the crime and
some of the corruption and and things
like that it's no slide on the the
people the people are lovely and things
like that but
you know I

[1:33:00]
you know I
I I don't I don't know what the
appropriate label is I'm and I certainly
don't want to be accused of being down
on Thailand I've visited three times I
[ __ ] love that country but um it
certainly does feel different to here in
Australia oh sure yeah I just meant I
guess I never felt unsafe there like I
have potentially in other places that
I've traveled how far off road did you
go
um not far I went to Bangkok Chiang Mai
and Phuket
okay yeah no I mean and the people in
rural Thailand can be lovely but look
there's a lot of money to be made in the
in the tourism as well and where there's
money that it attracts you know some
negative stuff
um but you don't need to talk about this
I'm sure people aren't interested so
let's wrap it up and tell the folks
where they can find you if they want to
know more about what you're doing go on
to YouTube Type in uh Alexander Grace
that's my regular thing from that in the
description box of any of my videos

that's for more exclusive content so a
little bit more in depth uh if you want
my personal advice you'll find hey hero

[1:34:01]
my personal advice you'll find hey hero
that's where people can write to me and
I write back to them and um
yeah I I don't have any spots available
in my men's groups at the moment but
