too many people men and women mistakenly
believe that once they have defined the
terms of a relationship they don't have
to worry about maintaining those terms
over time in point of fact relationships
are negotiated and renegotiated
constantly however not in the way that
most people think in the context of my
economic model the term negotiation can
trip people up it can conjure images of
a boardroom in which the parties
explicitly Define the terms of the
relationship and aggressively barter for
their own self-interest and this almost
never happens most people in fact would
be very put off by that approach as one
of the unspoken rules of romantic
relationships is that the terms of the
transaction should be mystified behind a
veil of indirectness and suggestion as
much as possible the closest most people
come to explicitly negotiating is when
they have the defin the relationship
conversation in which they both pretend
to understand what the other means by
exclusive the vast majority of a
relationship is negotiated tacitly
unconsciously and more importantly
behaviorally
