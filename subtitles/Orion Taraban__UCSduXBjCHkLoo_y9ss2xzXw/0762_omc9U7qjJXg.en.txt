I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the beam
in your own so I try to take care of
myself physically I run most days and
lift a few weights and about a year ago
I started taking high-intensity interval
training or hit classes a couple days a
week now initially I was a little
concerned since this particular
franchise puts everyone's heart rate
monitor information on a big board for
the whole class to see I was afraid of
being judged or embarrassed or of the
class turning into a competition and
much to my relief none of that has
happened like that just hasn't been my
experience and I think the reason why
that hasn't happened is that I'm
typically so focused on simply surviving
my own workout that I don't have the
bandwidth to take in how any one else is

[01:00]
bandwidth to take in how any one else is
performing it's hard enough for me to
track what I'm doing you understand I
just don't have the capacity in an
allout Sprint to compare myself with
others let alone to critique what they
are or are not doing over time now the
Cory to this is that if by some chance I
do happen to start getting curious about
where I stand relative to the other
people in the class it means I'm not
working hard enough I'm not running fast
enough I'm not lifting heavy enough I'm
spectating more than
participating maybe you see where this
is
going the title of this episode comes
from a saying of Jesus in Matthew 7
Jesus asks the apostles how can you say
to your brother let me take the speck
out of your eye well there is still a
beam in your own eye First Take the beam

[02:00]
beam in your own eye First Take the beam
out of your own eye and then you will
see clearly to remove the speck from
your brother's
eye so I guess this is what I'm getting
at in my roundabout way if you ever
catch yourself finding fault with other
people complaining about them giving
them unsolicited advice or putting your
nose in other people's business then
you're not working hard enough you're
coasting none of these behaviors are
good looks because nothing communicates
I've got nothing better to do than
criticizing others like are you sure
about that my dude are you sure that
you've got nothing better to do you've
already attained to a state of
unflappable composure your health and
finances want for nothing you found your
higher purpose and are relentlessly
pursuing it you're surrounded by people
who love and respect you you always get

[03:01]
who love and respect you you always get
what you want and don't get what you
don't if not then I'm afraid that you do
in fact have something better to do and
you don't have time for this my
friend why are you so concerned about
other people's performance when in that
moment you are
underperforming like I guarantee that if
you were honest and you looked at
yourself with OB objectivity and Clarity
you would find plenty of things that you
could be improving right now if you have
the time in bandwidth to critique others
it probably means that you're not
adequately attending to yourself TR
trust me you'll have your hands full if
you do
that David Goggins once said you'll
never see a hater doing better than you
why is that because the reward of

[04:00]
why is that because the reward of
success is more work that's the Matthew
principle For unto everyone that hath
shall be given and he shall have
abundance when you start to succeed
people bring you more work more projects
more opportunities not because you're
the one who needs them the most but
because you have a track record of
demonstrated
ability as you take on more your time
your attention and your energy become
increasingly constrained successful
people are taxed they're sprinting and
they're typically so concerned about
just getting through the Sprint and
achieving their goals and discharging
their various responsibilities that they
don't have time to judge and criticize
others if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my

[05:03]
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description
so my friends if you ever find yourself
in a mood of complaint I would suggest
that this is your cue to increase the
difficulty level of your life stop going
easy on yourself as that laxity keeps
you weak and
undisciplined pick up a heavier weight
and start running a little faster you
should be so focused on your own
development your own own growth your own

[06:01]
development your own own growth your own
Perfection that you won't have time to
critique the lives of
others and what's magical about all this
is that the more you attend to these
things your development your growth your
Perfection the more useful to others you
become as you clarify your thoughts and
purify your heart your vision will
become much less distorted you'll see
reality more clearly and this will make
you much more helpful to other people
that's the second half of Jesus's
teaching then you will see clearly to
remove the speck from your brother's eye
without Clarity of vision action will
likely prove to be more destructive than
inaction even if the action is
well-intentioned
of course removal of your own beam is
probably the best if not the only
indication that you might be able to
help another with their Speck after all

[07:01]
help another with their Speck after all
why would you reasonably trust in
anyone's ability to remove specs if they
haven't yet been able to exercise their
own be your own guinea pig and practice
on yourself first this will help you
develop the skills that will be useful
to others once the time
comes however one final word to the wise
don't give unsolicited advice as a
therapist I can tell you that it's hard
enough for people to follow advice that
they asked for in my experience advice
they didn't ask for no matter how true
and potentially useful is rarely if ever
followed it's better to save your breath
and wait for the right moment which will
come in
time what do you think does this fit
