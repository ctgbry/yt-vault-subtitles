I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is suncax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is get a
side Hustle
new year new you and one of the best
things that you can do this year for
yourself is to get yourself a side
Hustle
if you don't you're going to be eating
Crumbs from your own table what does
this mean this means that the vast
majority of people give the best hours
of most of the days of the best years of
their lives to their jobs in exchange
for a salary which if you think about it
is pretty poor recompense for a life
and then content themselves with the
crumbs that are left over
and unfortunately because they spend the
best hours of most of the days of the
best years of their lives at their jobs
when they do have time for themselves
they're generally so exhausted that they
don't really have the energy or the
focus for any high quality activities
and so what do they do well for most
folks that means sitting in front of a

[01:00]
folks that means sitting in front of a
screen
and the fact of the matter is that
nobody at the end of their life is going
to regret not spending more time in
front of the screen
so you need to find a way out of this
problem and before I describe this exit
strategy please like this episode And
subscribe to this channel it takes less
than a second costs you nothing and it's
a direct way for you to support the idea
of a side Hustle
so do the thing
as I was saying you need to find a way
out of this problem it's one of the most
important things that you can do and it
will make a significant difference in
the overall quality of your life now if
you're like most people watching this
you are not independently wealthy and
you are not an entrepreneur
so you probably have a steady job
and the first step to getting yourself
out from underneath that job is to find
a way to supplement that income with a
side Hustle there are two basic ways to
do this you can either sell a product or
you can sell a service and of these two
it is far easier to begin by selling a

[02:02]
it is far easier to begin by selling a
service because all you really need is
yourself
this takes a weekend to set up
first you need to consider what service
you're willing and able to provide in
your free time you don't need to be
world class in order to get started
which is great because you won't be you
just need to be better at the service
than whoever might hire you and
obviously the better you are the wider
the swath of humanity that will include
but I'm here to tell you that no matter
who you are you're better than some
cross-section of humanity at something
and that can be the basis of your side
hustle service
next you need to develop a presence
online
accomplished in a weekend for around 250
dollars you can buy an annual membership
on a web hosting site and using their
templates create a basic home page who
you are and what you do
you can then create a free profile for
your business on Yelp and Google and

[03:02]
your business on Yelp and Google and
list your go your your business your
website that is and list your website on
Google search console so that it's
googleable this is important until you
register your website with Google search
console your website will be invisible
to the Google search algorithm however
this only takes a few minutes and it's
completely free
Yelp is also a fantastic resource
because it's a way to hack the Google
algorithm search for any service near me
on Google and I can guarantee that you
will see a Yelp search for that query on
the first page of results and if you can
get on the first page of that Yelp
search which often only takes a dozen
reviews you can functionally get on the
first page of Google without spending a
dime
I got this advice 10 years ago and I've
made a great deal of money over that
time from just this one tip alone
so establish establishing a side hustle
is actually not that hard the startup
costs are very low in terms of time and

[04:02]
costs are very low in terms of time and
money of course putting a line in the
water is easy it's catching the fish
that is difficult and that first fish is
the most difficult to catch now in the
beginning getting your side hustle going
might require you to work one and a half
to two jobs for a while you'll need to
work your steady gig and then spend some
time in the evenings on your side hustle
this obviously will make your days
longer and you'll have to find other
ways to take care of yourself so that
you don't burn out this is important as
the process will likely take one to two
years to really get going but if it's
going to take that long you might as
well get started
and once this gets going you can begin
to transition away from working for
others from eating Crumbs from your own
table
and toward living life on your own terms
and that is a really amazing feeling
a life-changing feeling I've done this a
number of times at this stage in my life
I've built a number of businesses up to
a six-figure annual income
so I have some experience with what I'm

[05:00]
so I have some experience with what I'm
talking about and if I can do it then
there's no reason that you can't do it
too
now in the next episode which I'm
releasing concurrently with this one I'm
going to go into some detail
on one of my side hustles so if you're
interested please keep watching until
then what are your business plans for
2023 is this the year you finally
launched that business
