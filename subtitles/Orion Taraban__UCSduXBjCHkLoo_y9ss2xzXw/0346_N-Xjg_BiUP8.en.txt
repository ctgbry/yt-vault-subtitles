as we're approaching Christmas I thought
I'd do a short in the spirit of that
holiday
who is the Immaculate Conception most
people out there think the Immaculate
Conception was Jesus because they
believed that Jesus was conceived
immaculately like there was no actual
sexual intercourse between the Virgin
Mary and Joseph hence an Immaculate
Conception but that's not actually true
according to Christian doctrine the
Immaculate Conception does not refer to
Jesus it refers to Mary
Mary is the Immaculate Conception
because she was born without original
sin according to Catholic Doctrine which
means that God intervened in the
staining of her spirit such that she
could be a pure vessel for the baby
Jesus and I think this has an important
spiritual lesson for us in the sense of
higher Consciousness is born from a
state of purity
