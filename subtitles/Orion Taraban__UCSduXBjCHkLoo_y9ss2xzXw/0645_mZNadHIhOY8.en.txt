sometimes there's this failure of
interex understanding so for example
like we were talking about earlier to
the extent that it's true that women
find men who are wealthy and
professionally successful more
attractive than men who are less wealthy
and less successful all of the things
being equal then they might think oh
well if I find that attractive in a man
then perhaps a man will find that
attractive in me so I'm going to
prioritize becoming High powerered and
and high earning and high status and
combine that with the idea that I'm
looking for my equal these women who
pursue that path are often not very
successful in the sexual Marketplace
because generally by the time they're
able to get access to those equally
powerful High status men they're much
older and those powerful High status men
don't want to wife up women in their
late 30s or early 40s especially if they
can get someone much younger who is a
more attractive reproductive option
