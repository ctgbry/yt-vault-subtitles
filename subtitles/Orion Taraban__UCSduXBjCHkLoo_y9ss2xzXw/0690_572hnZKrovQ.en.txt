I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
date without going
crazy so modern dating can be baffling
and infuriating the sexual Marketplace
is almost entirely disregulated and most
new relationships must be brokered
through digital platforms texting dating
apps social media that didn't really
exist as such even 10 years ago if
people enter into this scene equipped
with advice from people who have never
participated in this dating Market
they're very likely going to find
themselves confused and then frustrated
and eventually rather hopeless this is
not to say that it's impossible to find
good men or women or satisfying
relationships in today's day and age but
that it is functionally impossible to
find them using outdated dating strategy

[01:00]
find them using outdated dating strategy
the game has changed and people have to
adapt in order to stay relevant if this
doesn't happen people are subject to
thinking that dating today is hopeless
but that's not true it's more that their
strategies are ineffective however in
the absence of better strategies people
will think that they've done everything
they could and it still didn't work but
that's not really true either rather
they've done everything they thought
they could and it's still didn't work
it's time for people to broaden their
thinking today I'm going to talk about a
strategy that I have personally found to
be very useful for dating in the Modern
Age without losing my sanity it's called
Walking The Razor's Edge what does that
mean to succeed in today's dating
environment it's helpful to have no
conceptualization of the past and no
conceptualization of the future but to
abide as completely as possible in the

[02:01]
abide as completely as possible in the
present
moment this is very difficult to do
people go on dates and use dating apps
and put themselves out there because
they want things they want sex they want
a meaningful connection they want a
committed relationship and these wants
justify the risk and expense of dating
however the more these General wants are
projected onto the specific person or
circumstance they're dealing with the
harder it will be for people to satisfy
their desires this is because people
generally don't respond well to feeling
like they have to live up to other
people's
expectations especially when those other
people are more or less random
strangers so the idea is to surrender
any expectations that you will get those
desires met from the specific person
with whom you are actually interacting
and this is not the same thing as
surrendering your overarching goals the

[03:01]
surrendering your overarching goals the
trick is to have high hopes and low
expectations High Hopes and low
expectations it takes a little practice
to find that balance but once you find
it it's probably your best protection
against frustration and disappointment
in the game of mating and dating
maintain an unwavering orientation
toward the things you want for yourself
for your life for your future hopefully
believe that you can actually attain
them well at the same time Harbor
absolutely no expectations that the
person you're speaking to will actually
help you move in that
direction if you appreciate the insights
on this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating

[04:00]
women in the game of mating and dating
I also provide a lot of actionable
advice on how to get and keep more of
what you want in the sexual Marketplace
once you read the value of others you'll
never look at relationships the same way
again now available in ebook audiobook
and paperback formats the links are in
the
description this can require an almost
zen-like commitment to the here and now
in this practice there is no past and
there is no future only the Eternal
present hence walking the razor's Edge
as the present moment is vanishingly
thin whether you should or shouldn't if
you want to be successful in the sexual
Marketplace you kind of have to let go
of the past if all you can think about
are the dozens of boring dates that went
nowhere of the thousands of dollars you
spent on ungrateful candidates of the
flaky and disrespectful behavior of

[05:01]
flaky and disrespectful behavior of
uninterested lovers then how are you
going to be able to show up to another
date let alone show up to another date
in a non-bitter non-rental state good
daters are like good quarterbacks they
have short memories when a quarterback
gets sacked he needs to be able to get
back up and trust that his line will
hold for the next play otherwise he's
done so learn your lesson and keep
moving forward because the play clock is
already starting to tick
down by the same token irrespective of
whether you should or shouldn't if you
want to be successful in the sexual
Marketplace you have to let go of the
future and by Future I don't mean
Wedding Bells and happily ever after I
mean the realization of the smallest
next possible
step just because you swiped don't
expect you're going to match just
because you matched don't expect her to
text you back back just because she

[06:01]
text you back back just because she
texts you back don't expect her to agree
to a date just because she agreed to a
date don't expect her to show up just
because she showed up don't expect that
you're going to get laid just because
you got laid don't expect to ever see
her again etc etc etc surrender the
realization of the smallest next
possible step you kind of have to
suspend acknowledgement of the future
for quite some time in the modern
courtship process I've seen far too many
guys get far too excited about a
prospect far too early in the process
for better or worse ghosting is the
standard accept it just because you had
a great time including potentially a
night of fantastic sex that doesn't mean
that you'll ever hear from that woman
again let alone have the type of
relationship you would prefer to have
with her be grateful that it happened
and keep moving forward and if you can't

[07:00]
and keep moving forward and if you can't
handle that it's probably best that you
play a different game women have always
been interested in one night stands
however modern contingencies have
aligned to make this sexual strategy
possible for women in ways that have
only historically been open to men so
you might encounter plenty of hitandrun
behavior from women in today's
Marketplace and this can be surprising
to men who have been raised by culture
to believe that women just want
committed relation relationships they
don't women want different things from
different men at different times I
appreciate that's not very helpful but
that's the way it is with no memory of
the past and no expectation of the
future there is only the present moment
and irrespective of your hopes and
dreams there may yet be some inherent
value in the ability to participate in
the here and now and to forge a
connection with another human being
regardless of whether you will ever see

[08:01]
regardless of whether you will ever see
that human being again and regardless of
whether that human being gives you what
you want in dating the more Zen you
become the more likely you'll get more
of what you want by being present and
engaging and less of what you don't by
creating opportunities for frustration
and
disappointment what do you think does
