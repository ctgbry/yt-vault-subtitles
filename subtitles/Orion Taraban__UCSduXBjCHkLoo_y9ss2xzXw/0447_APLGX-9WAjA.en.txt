I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
overcome approach anxiety
most men have approach anxiety it's very
rare for a man to feel naturally
confident in his ability to go up to a
woman he doesn't know
strike up a conversation and move the
interaction in the direction of a sexual
relationship
the ability to do these things is a
skill set that men can and do learn but
it's difficult to do so as it requires
overcoming a significant fear as I
mentioned in a previous episode this
fear is deeply rooted in an unconscious
association between female rejection and
the threat of Extinction
so it's very difficult to eradicate and
it may never go away entirely however it
absolutely can be reduced to manageable
levels today I'm going to be talking
about how to do this
now overcoming approach anxiety isn't

[01:01]
now overcoming approach anxiety isn't
much different from overcoming any other
fear the way to do it
is to do it
you could watch hundreds of videos just
like this one and read a bunch of books
and take some courses and purchase
expensive coaching sessions but
ultimately the only way to overcome
approach anxiety is to approach women
there's no way around it if you approach
enough women you should gradually
diminish this anxiety and if you do
everything else except approach women
it's unlikely that you're going to move
the needle in an appreciable way
the trick is to actually do the thing
and have an emotionally disconfirming
experience in this case that means
approaching enough women to emotionally
trust that all other things being equal
approaching women is a non-terrible
experience
and if you have to do it to do it in my
opinion it's best to rip the Band-Aid
off and take Massive Action

[02:00]
off and take Massive Action
this is because it might take hundreds
of approaches before your emotional
programming begins to shift
if you approach women here and there
once or twice a week then it could take
you years before you hit that critical
threshold that's a significant amount of
time
a while back I worked with a man in his
20s to overcome his approach anxiety he
did it in a weekend
but he had to approach 676 women
and from the way he described it let me
tell you this man went on an emotional
Journey over those 48 hours from his
initial fear and Terror
to pain and shame to rage and contempt
to hopelessness and despair
until ultimately he arrived at emotional
indifference
and to his amazement
this wasn't an indifference he had to
fake or an indifference he had to try to
maintain it became his default Baseline

[03:01]
maintain it became his default Baseline
but to arrive here he had to be rejected
enough times
to emotionally understand that no is
just information
it doesn't have to hurt it doesn't have
to be personal and it doesn't have to be
permanent
and when he arrived here
he was positively rapturous he told me
it was the first time in his life he
ever felt truly free
it was a real breakthrough and he did it
in a weekend
and some guys won't do it in 10 years
obviously it wasn't a very comfortable
weekend but you know it might not
otherwise have been a very comfortable
decade

[04:00]
that makes all this happen I really
appreciate it
now let me talk a little bit about how
to approach a woman confidently as many
of you know I used to be an actor
some people have this belief about
acting that acting is lying
and I would counter that bad acting is
lying
good acting on the other hand is telling
the truth under imaginary circumstances
good actors are honest they're authentic
it's the situation that's made up
so let's talk about how to tell the
truth under imaginary circumstances from
the perspective of an actor
let's say that you're playing a
character whose pet rabbit died and he's
supposed to be completely crestfallen
and let's also say that you couldn't
care less about rabbits maybe you even
hate rabbits with their beady little red
eyes and their constant stench and their
unfriendly nature and you could give a
[ __ ] if a rabbit died obviously you
couldn't ask yourself how would I feel

[05:00]
couldn't ask yourself how would I feel
if my pet rabbit died it wouldn't work
for the scene
so what you would have to do in the
privacy of your own mind is either evoke
a memory or elaborate a fantasy as
vividly and as realistically as possible
that would actually cause you to feel
crestfallen and you would focus your
mind's eye on that memory or fantasy as
intensely as possible
externally you'll be saying your lines
are following your blocking you'll exist
in the artificial construct of the scene
but internally you'll be focused
entirely on your imagination
you'll actually be present to whatever
memory or fantasy you've elaborated in
your mind
and it's this skill of being
simultaneously aware of external reality
while focused on the internal
imagination that makes for good acting
that allows for people to be truthful
under imaginary circumstances it's a
skill which means like any skill it can

[06:01]
skill which means like any skill it can
be learned
so what does this have to do with
approaching women well
if you're in a bar and the scene calls
for you to approach an attractive woman
and you ask yourself well how would I
feel about approaching an attractive
woman in a bar if you're like most men
you're going to think well I would feel
nervous about that
but that's not what the scene calls for
right
so let's assume the scene calls for
confidence and poise
what can you do well in the privacy of
your mind you can either evoke a memory
or elaborate a fantasy as vividly and as
realistically as possible that would
actually cause you to feel confident and
poised and you can focus your mind's eye
on that memory or fantasy as intensely
as possible
if you can do this you can move through
external reality while remaining focused
on your internal imagination
and this will help you to act
authentically
and authentically confident in an

[07:01]
and authentically confident in an
imaginary situation
now you might respond well that's all
well and good for an imaginary situation
Orion but a bar is the real world
and I would counter
are you sure
like yeah the bar exists in objective
reality however if you examine yourself
very carefully you'll find that you have
a whole host of beliefs about who you
are and where you are and what's going
on that do not exist in objective
reality you might even be scripting
like it like a playwright the the
potential encounter in your imagination
my point is that if you have approached
anxiety you're already doing what I
described you're moving through external
reality while remaining focused on an
internal fantasy it's just that your
internal fantasy is negative and anxiety
provoking so you already know how to do
what I'm prescribing and if you change

[08:00]
what I'm prescribing and if you change
the fantasy you can change how you feel
one final note one of my acting teachers
once taught me that whatever I needed to
think in the privacy of my own
Consciousness whatever memory I needed
to evoke or fantasy I needed to
elaborate in order to produce that
authentic emotional response was
nobody's [ __ ] business
so whatever works for you is for you and
you alone so have fun and go for it
