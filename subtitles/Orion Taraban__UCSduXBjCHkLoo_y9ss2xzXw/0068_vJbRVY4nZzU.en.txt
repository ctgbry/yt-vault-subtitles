i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is serial
sevens
serial sevens is something that i'm
stealing from the psychiatric mental
status exam which is something that
doctors use to very quickly assess basic
cognitive functions
and serial sevens is one of the best
techniques that i've discovered to
distract myself from unwelcome thoughts
we all have thoughts that sort of show
up uninvited
thoughts that if we attend to them
predictably lead us to certain
unpreferred emotional states whether
that's anger or jealousy or despair
these thoughts that show up uninvited
are not our friends
and the earlier we can disrupt the
process that leads from thought to
feeling the less time we're gonna have
to spend both residing in and coping
with the unpreferred emotional states
and if they never get a chance to
fluoresce at all well so much the better

[01:00]
fluoresce at all well so much the better
serial sevens is a technique that can be
used to very quickly and effectively
distract ourselves when we become aware
that certain unfriendly thoughts have
shown up uninvited in our consciousness
so what is it
serial sevens is very simple
basically you start with a random number
like 150 and you mentally try to
subtract seven from that number every
second so it's like 150 143 136
129 122 115 108 101 94
[Music]
you can even speed it up if this is too
easy for you now this is a challenging
task for most people because sevens
don't have an easily recognizable
pattern
so it generally requires our focus and
attention to implement this quickly
and that's kind of the point the idea
here is to create a task that you can do
anywhere
at any time within your own
consciousness that actually consumes

[02:02]
consciousness that actually consumes
your cognitive resources that's the
secret of serial sevens you're
temporarily making your situation more
difficult so that all of your
attentional resources become absorbed in
this task that way there aren't any
resources left over to attend the
unfriendly thought that showed up
uninvited
so we want to observe all of our
attention into this task we want it to
crescendo and then we actually want the
task to fail
why is this
because when we fail at a task that has
absorbed all of our attentional
resources it's almost like a hard reboot
after a cpu crash
it force closes any open applications
and refreshes them to their normal
operating settings
and when our attention comes back online
whatever we were thinking about before
isn't going to be there anymore that's
the whole point
and the beauty of it is that this can
generally be accomplished in 30 seconds

[03:00]
generally be accomplished in 30 seconds
or less
serial sevens is entirely covert
completely free
and highly effective
try it out yourself
