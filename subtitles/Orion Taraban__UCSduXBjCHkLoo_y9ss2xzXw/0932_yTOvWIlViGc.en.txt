It's very bizarre how people arrive at
enlightenment when they arrive at
enlightenment. Like you hear stories of
Saul's conversion on the road to
Damascus where he is a Roman commander
and then he has a vision and he's

civic standpoint. Some of the most
celebrated saints and most famous
spiritual religious personages were
often folks of questionable virtue and
repute. So everybody's path is
