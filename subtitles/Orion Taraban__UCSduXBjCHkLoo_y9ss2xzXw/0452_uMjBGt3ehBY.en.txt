today I'm going to share with you my
recipe for creating meaning in life
there's this question that many
self-help gurus ask their clients the
question is what would you do if you
knew you couldn't fail and it's a good
question because it allows people to see
the extent to which fear is holding them
back from pursuing the life they really
want to live however there is another
really important complementary question
to ask and the question is what would
you do if you knew you couldn't succeed
now on the surface this sounds like a
ridiculous question you might respond
Orion if I knew I couldn't succeed why
would I bother trying and that is an
understandable response a lot of things
if you knew that you could not get what
you were striving for would you and
should you give up their Pursuit
absolutely but here's the thing there
are things in life worth doing even if
we don't wholly succeed in attaining
them in the world some mountains are
worth dying on even if you don't reach
the summit
