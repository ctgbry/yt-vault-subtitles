I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
difference between masculine and
feminine communication
now I'm using these terms masculine and
feminine as opposed to male and female
because the fact of the matter is both
men and women are capable of masculine
and feminine communication but in
general men tend toward masculine
communication and in general women tend
toward feminine communication so the
gendered terms aren't really tied to
biological sex but they are somewhat
correlated okay so there are some
significant differences between
masculine and feminine communication and
it's the failure to adequately
appreciate those differences that leads
to a whole host of conflict and
misunderstanding between the Sexes
however this can be mitigated through
understanding
let's start with masculine communication

[01:01]
let's start with masculine communication
masculine communication is about the
transmission of information
it does this by means of two general
strategies the first is to emphasize the
semantic content of the communication
this is why things like definition and
word choice are so important a single
improper word can Mar the entire
transmission
and the second strategy is to minimize
if not eliminate entirely the emotional
component of the transmission this is
because if the goal is to convey
information
emotion is Superfluous at best and
distortive at worst
in masculine communication we know that
the speaker has been heard if the
listener can accurately summarize or
paraphrase the essential information
contained in the intended message that's
masculine communication

[02:00]
masculine communication
on the other hand feminine communication
is almost entirely the opposite that's
because feminine communication is about
the transmission of experience in the
sense of felt subjectivity
while word choice isn't entirely
arbitrary it's much less important than
in masculine communication why because
in feminine communication words are not
primarily used for their semantic
content but as containers for emotional
energy
and this is true in direct proportion to
how emotional the speaker is man or
woman at the heights of anger
at the depths of despair
you see in feminine communication we
know that the speaker has been heard if

[03:01]
know that the speaker has been heard if
the listener ends up resonating at the
same emotional frequency as the speaker
think of tuning Forks when a vibrating
tuning fork is brought close to another
the second begins to vibrate at the same
frequency
and this is a big part of why women can
be so emotionally provocative for better
or worse they are trying to get you to
feel the same way she does in that
moment
now before I go any further if you're

which is those three little dots in the

you can hit that button and tip me in
proportion to the value you feel you
have derived from this episode I really
appreciate your support
now this is why from a masculine

[04:02]
now this is why from a masculine
perspective if we were to eavesdrop on a
group of women sitting around and having
a conversation it can almost sound
psychotic
one moment a woman is tearfully
recalling something sad that happened to
her
and as she starts to cry the eyes of all
the women at the table start to well up
and and then
a few moments later she reveals that she
was comically wrong about what she was
sad about and as she laughs the whole
table bursts into uproarious laughter
all in the span of a minute
from a feminine perspective the
conversation is an emotional Journey
whereby the listeners are conducted
through a succession of emotional states
that mimic the speaker's experience and
it's through that emotional resonance
that women connect with other people
here's the easiest way to think about it
masculine communication is like language
without vowels it's only consonants if I

[05:03]
without vowels it's only consonants if I
were to write you an email with all the
vowels removed you would likely be able
to figure out what I was trying to say
with little reduction infidelity and
that's because almost all the semantic
information in a word is contained in
its consonants
on the other hand feminine communication
is like a language without consonants
it's only vowels
at its extreme it's just pure
undifferentiated sound
and that's because almost all the
emotional information in a word is
contained in its vowels and this is why
some song lyrics just sound so
ridiculous when you try to transcribe
them the song isn't about the words the
words are merely containers for the
emotion which is untranslatable
now effective communication
occurs when you marry these two things
together effective communication is the
union of masculine and feminine
communication just like the fullest

[06:00]
communication just like the fullest
expression of language is to utilize
both vowels and consonants to do this
you use the masculine focus on word
choice to select appropriate words that
accurately reflect the information
you're trying to convey that is use the
masculine Focus to appreciate semantic
information while imbuing those words
with emotional content which is the
feminine contribution now I'm stealing
this term emotional content from Bruce
Lee in Enter the Dragon emotional
content is not anger emotional content
is not happiness emotional content is
not any emotion in particular emotional
content is like undifferentiated emotion
something like warmth or intention
you're putting a little of yourself in
the words you're communicating think of
it like Timbre which is a musical term
which means the quality of sound that
reflects the nature of the instrument it
is sounded upon

[07:01]
is sounded upon
specificity in language plus richness in
quality is the simple arithmetic for the
most effective forms of communication
