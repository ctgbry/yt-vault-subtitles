i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology so the
subject of today's short discussion
is that
value is derived from sacrifice
so let's talk about this in kind of a
basic everyday example so
um it's you know a little afternoon i'm
thinking about going to a cafe getting a
cup of coffee
in order to secure that desired good i
have to sacrifice
three dollars to obtain it
if i don't feel like the coffee is worth
the three dollars
i can keep my three dollars and be happy
about it if i believe
it's a fair transfer or even that the
coffee is is worth more to me than
three dollars i'll hand it over gladly
but i can't
have the coffee and the three dollars at
the same time
and on some level the fact that i'm
willing to sacrifice
the three dollars in the act the
transfer is actually what gives

[01:00]
transfer is actually what gives
the value of the coffee it's three
dollars it's it's just hypothetical
it's value until i actually put the
money
on the table for the cashier then it's
like oh this coffee really is worth
three dollars because i'm paying
three dollars for it okay so what does
this mean this means that um
the values the things that we have that
we value in life
have costs associated with them that's
why they are called values they're
valuable
and sometimes people have to pay a lot
in order to secure them
and the the simplest most basic way that
people pay for their values is with
money
the more complex ways that people pay
for their values
is through their security through their
freedom through their time
through their energy through opportunity
um
it's that which we choose to sacrifice
in order to secure
the desired good so what does this mean
this means that sometimes

[02:00]
this means that sometimes
we're given the opportunity to
understand just how much
we value our values when we have to make
sacrifices in order to
secure them or to maintain them
it's very easy to believe certain values
it's quite another thing to have to put
money on the table
as it were or time or opportunity or
security or freedom
in order to secure them oftentimes
people then
bulk at the price they like the idea of
the value
but they aren't often willing to pay the
price to secure it in which case the
value is actually hypothetical
if if i'm not putting the three dollars
on the table on some level that coffee
isn't really worth
even three dollars to me so
our beliefs are revealed by the extent
to which we sacrifice to obtain or
maintain them
so this can be a crossroads for people

[03:01]
so this can be a crossroads for people
and one of the things i counsel my
clients is to see
the opportunity to sacrifice as a good
because once you sacrifice in the
service of your values
they become that much more they become
that much more
worth worthy to you more valuable to you
and those values can can support you in
in positive and important ways
moving forward so that's what i have to
say about that please like and subscribe
we'll talk more in future episodes
