i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
speak what you want
into being
look
speech is magic i mean if you think
about it what are we really doing when
we speak
by squeezing certain muscles in our
larynx we can vibrate particles of our
exhaled breath such as they vibrate
other particles propagating distributed
patterns of energy through the air until
such patterns are filtered into someone
else's inner ear and cause the little
silly in their cochlea to bend thereby
transmitting electrical impulses to the
auditory processing center in their
temporal lobes which will reconstitute
those neuronal firings into hallucinated
sounds which are recognized as concepts
and in that way
by squeezing my muscles
in just the right manner
i can literally put thoughts into your
mind
i'm doing it right now

[01:01]
i'm doing it right now
i can conjure things into existence by
uttering the correct sequence of sounds
it's an amazing power to be able to
speak
in fact this is the meaning of the
magical phrase abracadabra it's a little
cheesy now but abracadabra originally
literally meant
i create as i speak
so we see in that phrase the magical
element of the spoken word
so this brief talk is about speaking
what you want into being and i'm here to
offer two simple tricks for doing just
that effectively the first is to use
your language to trap yourself
successfully that is to trap yourself
for your own good
unfortunately we're often subject to
using our language to sabotage our
process and the most frequent means by
which we do this is by offering
ourselves
easy ways out

[02:00]
easy ways out
so for example
we might say something like i'll try to
go for a run tomorrow
i mean
what a soft statement
if the threshold of successful action is
merely the attempt then how can we truly
fail
that said you might not end up with
anything worth having either
this type of language gives you a lot of
opportunity to fail successfully
and it does that by giving you an out
you don't actually have to run you just
have to try to run you see
contrast this with a statement like i
will go for a run tomorrow
well
now you're trapped by your own language
now you can actually fail
but the possibility of actual failure
might functionally increase the
likelihood that you engage in the
intended behavior if for no other reason
than to avoid failing
when you use phrases like i will do this
or this will happen

[03:00]
or this will happen
you firm your intention into a
commitment which will make it more
likely to occur
and if it's a commitment to a behavior
in the service of your success
then why create loopholes that would
allow yourself to break the commitment
without consequence it doesn't make
sense
the second trick when speaking what you
want into being is not speaking what you
don't want into being this means
worrying complaining gossiping
someone once said that worrying is like
praying for something you don't want to
happen
and i think that's true
on a side note i looked up who this
someone was and apparently it was
robert downey jr go figure i don't i
don't know if that's an rdj original or
if you got it from somewhere else but
that's what the fact checkers say so
thanks robert downey jr it's a good
phrase
when you worry or complain you're giving
the undesired outcome time energy money

[04:01]
the undesired outcome time energy money
and whatever we feed in this way gets
larger
so rather than ruminate on what you
don't want
or speak on the things that we fear
might transpire
use your words to cultivate desired
outcomes and bring what you want into
being
i hope this helps
