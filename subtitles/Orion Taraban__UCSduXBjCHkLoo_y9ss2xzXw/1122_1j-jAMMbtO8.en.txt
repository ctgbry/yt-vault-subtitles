Most people have what I call a thumb
screw. A thumb screw is an emotion that
for whatever reason they find
particularly difficult to tolerate and
which therefore is where they are most
vulnerable to emotional manipulation.
And for many men, their thumbcrew is a
crying woman or more accurately the
guilt and discomfort that arise in them
when they see a crying woman. And while
it's useful for all men to reconcile
themselves to a woman's distress, it is
absolutely essential for these men, the
ones with the relevant thumbcrew, to do
so. Why? Because offering some kind of
benefit, whether it's the provision of a
desired good through positive
reinforcement or the elimination of an
undesired ill through negative
reinforcement when a woman cries will
absolutely make it more likely that she
will cry more in the future. This will
happen whether or not the woman is
intentionally manipulative as
