I think another reason why it's so hard
for men and women, and I think women are
more guilty of this than men to be
honest, is that what they're looking
for, their criteria in a potential
partner, there's just too many things.
There's just too many things. And one of
the things that I've learned both
personally and professionally to make it
more likely to have a satisfying
romantic relationship is only ask of
your partner to do a couple of things in
your life. Mhm. And if possible, get all
the other emotional, psychological, and
relational needs met in other
relationships in your life, which is
basically how human beings have evolved
to live in small tribes or communities
with in multigenerational family houses
with lots of soft relationships that
they engaged with on a daily basis. For
so many people, especially postco, they
work at home. They live in fragmented
nuclear families. The only person they
see every day is their partner or their
spouse. And so now this person is your
best friend and your chef and your life
coach and your therapist and your

coach and your therapist and your
cheerleader and your mistress and your
uh confidant. And it's like wow that's a
lot of roles for one person to play. And
just like a chain is as strong as its
weakest link if you sometimes people
will throw out otherwise good
relationships when the partner fails in
any one of those roles. And I think
that's that's unfair. I don't think
anybody can wear that many hats
successfully.
