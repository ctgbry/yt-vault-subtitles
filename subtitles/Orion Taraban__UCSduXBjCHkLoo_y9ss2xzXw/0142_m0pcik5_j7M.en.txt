i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how is it good
if you take a look at your life and you
see certain habits or behaviors that on
the surface
seem to cause a lot of harm or stress or
difficulty for you
but that you still have trouble getting
rid of
ask yourself this question
how is it good
that is what function does this behavior
serve what is this behavior doing in the
context of your life how does it help
you
it has to serve a function or else it
still wouldn't be there
even if it's dysfunctional remember most
the word dysfunction
is the word function
most dysfunctional behavior is actually
functional it serves a purpose
it just tends to only function for a
while at a great cost
in the vast majority of cases
despite the obvious pain and suffering

[01:00]
despite the obvious pain and suffering
involved dysfunctional behavior is
considered a net positive
in the mind of the individual in
question
for example i often work with people who
are chronic worriers they worry about
things all the time hundreds of times a
day they understand rationally that most
of things they're concerned about will
never happen and that their constant
worrying is driving them crazy
and yet they often feel kind of
ambivalent about letting go of the habit
despite asking for help
and this generally has to do with the
function that this behavior is serving
in that person's life namely they
believe that on a deeper level
the worrying behavior keeps them safe
which is a good thing
they believe that if they weren't
worrying about the future they would be
even more exposed and vulnerable than
they already feel
so even though they understand the
worrying corrodes their quality of life
they believe on the whole
that worrying is a net positive for them

[02:00]
that worrying is a net positive for them
since the perceived protective factors
associated with worrying
outweigh the pain and distress it more
obviously causes
you can generalize this to basically any
quote
dysfunctional behavior in your life
it's still around because on some level
you believe it to be a net positive
that as problematic as this behavior has
become
maintaining it is still preferable to
giving it up
which might expose you to even more pain
and distress
this means that you can't really just
stop a dysfunctional behavior you
actually have to replace it with another
behavior that achieves the same ends
while creating fewer problems
this would mean that to address the
issue of say chronic worrying you would
need to find other ways to reduce the
felt experience of vulnerability or to
increase the feeling of safety
both of which are important needs
so if you're having trouble trying to
understand why some habit persists in

[03:02]
understand why some habit persists in
your life despite it causing you pain
and distress ask yourself how is it good
what is it doing in your life
how are you considering it a net
positive within your own subjective
understanding you might be surprised by
the answers you come up with
what do you think does this square with
your own understanding
