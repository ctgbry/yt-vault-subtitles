beautiful women are nuts so many of them
are this one's actually pretty simple
the reason why beautiful women are nuts
is that no one tells them the truth
especially if they're precociously
beautiful like I don't know have you
have any of the women of the 8,000
interviews that you've done talked about
this have they talked about going
through puberty when they were still
adolesence and and like dealing with the
new kind of attention that they were
getting from men yeah it comes up once
in a while it's like we don't want to
talk about it because it's like anything
that happens before you're 18 is like oh
we don't but you see that behavior well
you see
absolutely and and women young women
don't know how to handle it and why
would they or should they right but it's
like suddenly because their body is
changed the boys in their classroom are
treating them differently and looking at
them differently and not just the boys
in their classroom but the boys fathers
and the boys grandfathers it's like men
apparently never really stopped Desiring
young attractive women so these women
now have to deal with a great deal of
interest and attention from which is a
kind of power and it's a power that
they' done nothing to earn
