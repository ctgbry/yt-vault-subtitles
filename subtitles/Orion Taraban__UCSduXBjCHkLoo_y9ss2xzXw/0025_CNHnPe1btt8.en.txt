i'm dr orion taraban
and this is psych hacks better living
through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
fear
of disappointment this is something that
i encounter
fairly frequently in my clinical
practice people who are
overly concerned about disappointing
others
these are generally folks who by their
own admission are people pleasers
so more agreeable versus disagreeable
personality types
and in these cases the fear of
disappointing others can be
so paralyzing that it can lead the
syndromes of chronic worrying or even
panic attacks
of course the fear of disappointing
others is bound up with abandonment
concerns
that is if i were to estrange this
person's feelings if they were to not
like me anymore they would simply
leave me to my own devices okay so
listen there is justified disappointment
and unjustified disappointment justified
disappointment
occurs when a mutually agreed upon

[01:00]
occurs when a mutually agreed upon
commitment
is unilaterally violated by one of the
parties involved
so for example if you were to make a
plan to meet your friend at the pub down
the street tomorrow night at 8 pm
and at 7 45 your buddy calls you up and
says oh
man dude i'm so sorry i can't make it
tonight
that is justifiable disappointment maybe
the guy is a good reason
maybe he doesn't but the fact is that
there was a mutually agreed upon
commitment
that was unilaterally violated so your
disappointment in this case may be
justified
you came to expect that a certain thing
would happen
at a certain time and now that
expectation has been betrayed
however if there is no mutually agreed
upon commitment
if there's just a personal preference or
standard
or an expectation that hasn't been
verbalized and that exists only in your
mind or someone else's mind
then any violation of that expectation
would create an
unjustified disappointment not

[02:00]
unjustified disappointment not
meeting the unexpressed expectation of
another
isn't your problem that's their problem
and their disappointment is their
responsibility
for choosing to expect compliance with
an unexpressed commitment
disappointment in this case is like
trying to enforce
a non-consensual contract since
at least one of the parties involved
wasn't aware of the terms of the
agreement
this definitely wouldn't hold up in a
court of law
just to further demonstrate how
ridiculous this notion is
imagine coming into work on monday
morning and running into your boss
who says something like you know i was
really disappointed to see that the
johnson report
wasn't waiting for me on my desk when i
arrived and you said
what are you talking about i've never
heard of the johnson report and your
boss said
well that's no excuse a good employee
would have taken the initiative
to see if there were any reports i
wanted to compile you should have known

[03:00]
wanted to compile you should have known
i mean in this case you'd have an
actionable complaint with hr
rather a reasonable person would respond
with something like
you mean we actually haven't discussed
the johnson account
oh well it makes sense that you wouldn't
have compiled the report that you
didn't know existed i'm sorry so
what you need to do is da da da da da
that's how a mature person would respond
to learning
that one of his or her unexpressed
expectations has been violated
not with anger and blaming but with
understanding and apology
so don't worry about disappointing
others it's really nothing to be scared
of
instead focus on fulfilling your own
commitments
as this is the only way you could
justifiably disappoint another person
and this fulfillment generally lies
squarely within the domain of control
anyway
so that's what i have to say if you have
a topic you'd like discussed in a future
episode or would like to schedule a
consultation
