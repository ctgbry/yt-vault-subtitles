i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the right decision
doesn't exist
this is something that i hear from my
clients on an almost daily basis
they're at a crossroads at life
and they're feeling anxious about making
a decision because they want to do the
right thing
they want to make the right choice
understandable enough right
the problem
is that implicit in the idea of the
right choice is the existence of many
many
wrong choices
this creates a situation in which people
put immense pressure on themselves to
discern the one right way
from among the many many wrong ways
and that's not really how i see life
the older i get
the more i realize that there is no such
thing as the right decision
rather there are paths that take you in

[01:01]
rather there are paths that take you in
one direction
and there are past that take you in
another
that's it
like this path goes to the beach and
this path goes to the mountains which
path is better which path is right
the answers to those questions depend
entirely on where you want to go
the mountains aren't inherently better
than the beach and the beach isn't
inherently worse than the mountains both
paths will come with pros and cons
benefits and liabilities but one is not
necessarily better than the other
if you walk either path you will have
your experience no more no less
you won't have more life walking in the
mountains and you won't have less life
walking on the beach
either will fully constitute your life
and experience
it will just be different
the goodness or badness of your decision
is inseparable from your goals values
and objectives

which is better chinese food or italian
food both can be good and both can be
bad but no matter what you choose you'll
have a meal at the end of the day
conceptualizing the crossroads as the
point at which you need to make the
right decision
will likely place a lot of unnecessary
pressure on yourself which will probably
increase your anxiety which will tend to
lower your effectiveness so simply
believing in the right decision will
paradoxically reduce the likelihood that
you will find it within that context
until you're at the point of mastery
pressure is counterproductive
so
just clarify for yourself what it is
that you want and ask yourself do i want
to go here or do i want to go there
either way it can be good and in both
cases
you'll get your life
no more
no less
