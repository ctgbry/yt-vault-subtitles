i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
bond
and non-attachment
so today we'll take another foray into
pop psychology i am one of the world's
biggest james bond fans i'm very happy
to admit and i rewatched the excellent
no time to die just the other day and
something really hit home for me in this
reviewing that i would like to share
with you
namely bonds supreme indifference
now i don't want to give too much away
but in no time to die
bond enters into a kind of retirement
from mi6 and after some years he comes
to meet his replacement the new
007 and this is just an unprecedented
moment in history the franchise to
accept someone other than james bond as
double 07 is tent amount to the highest
conceivable heresy within that fandom
what's more the new double 07 is
obviously trying to needle him to get
under his skin by flaunting the fact

[01:01]
under his skin by flaunting the fact
that bond is no longer 07 and bond's
reply is so so excellent
with complete stoic indifference he
replies it's just a number
and yeah
it's a number that he had been
inextricably identified with for nearly
60 years so the ability to shrug it off
nonchalantly i think really embodies the
kind of indifference that makes bond a
powerful individual in his relationships
and makes him highly effective at what
he does
and there are examples of this
indifference throughout the series for
instance bond has evinced a let's say
casual relationship to all of his
gadgets and gizmos over the years he
gets all kinds of fancy watches and
flashy cars and he treats them with an
almost regal indifference and they
almost always end up getting destroyed
in the end
and i really like this attitude toward
materiality that james bond tends to
embody in his films a lot of people
they treat their electronics they or

[02:00]
they treat their electronics they or
their cars or their material possessions
with so much concern with so much pride
that it can border on narcissistic
attachment
people in such positions end up servants
of their things as tyler durden says in
fight club the things you own end up
owning you
bond on the other hand treats things
like things they're stuff
they're not that important or they're
important only to the extent that
they're useful to the mission after
which they become irrelevant
bond can make use of status and luxury
without becoming ensnared by them and he
does this by subordinating both
to the propotency of his mission
once these objects fulfill their
usefulness they're just stuff and it may
be necessary to even let them go to make
space for the tools for the next job
something to consider
