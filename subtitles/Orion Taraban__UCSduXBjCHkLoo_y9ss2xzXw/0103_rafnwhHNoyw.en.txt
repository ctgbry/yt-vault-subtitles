i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
hold people
like sand
i remember some years ago i was at a
gathering and i had the opportunity to
observe a nascent relationship
a woman who i had previously only known
as a single person
brought her new boyfriend to the
gathering i had never met the man before
but i had known the woman for several
years so it was my first time seeing
this woman in relationship
and the way that she treated this man
was shocking to me
throughout the gathering she was
constantly criticizing his responses and
micromanaging his behavior and generally
correcting his performance
the guy seemed pretty laid back and he
did his best to play it off but frankly
i had no idea how he put up with it
a few days later i pulled this woman

[01:01]
a few days later i pulled this woman
aside
and i told her that if she continued to
behave like this her boyfriend would
likely leave her
and the image that came into my mind in
that moment is that we have to hold
people like sand
if you squeeze too tightly
the sand will just slip through your
fingers
and you'll end up losing what could
otherwise have been a valued
relationship
however if you hold the sand loosely
you can actually hold a lot more for a
longer period of time
no one likes to be controlled
and when they inevitably become aware of
that intention
most people through a mechanism called
reactants
will do what is necessary to reassert
their autonomy and independence
which in the case of relationships
probably means bye-bye
and in fact this man did eventually
decide to end that relationship
this is really important
to love someone well you can't be too
loose but you certainly can't be too
tight
this is really a form of respect

[02:02]
this is really a form of respect
and people aren't going to stay in
relationships where they don't feel
respected
so if you want to have a stable loving
long-term relationship
hold your partner like sand
