the issue is that what tends to make
older men attractive to women doesn't
really shine through at the nightclub
like the main way these men can stand
out in the nightclub is through their
ability to spend tens of thousands of
dollars on bottle service and VIP
lounges which younger men typically just
can't afford and let's be real while
this will absolutely attract female
attention it will generally attract
immature and materialistic female
attention behaving in this way is going
to attract opportunistic gold diggers
who are going to attempt to exploit that
man for his resources because let's be
fair that's precisely what that man is
aggressively marketing he's good for if
a man baits his hook with money he can't
complain when he catches gold diggers so
the idea is for men to continue to put
themselves in contexts in which what
they have to offer is both highly
visible and highly salent this is akin
to seizing or creating opportunities to
be a contextual Alpha
