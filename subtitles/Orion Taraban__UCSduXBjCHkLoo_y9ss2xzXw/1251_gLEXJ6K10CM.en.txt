Who cheats more often?
&gt;&gt; Men, but they have to cheat on somebody,
right? Um and women are catching up very
fast,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; They're very fast. [music] So, um it's
still men, but the gap is closing. And I
think it's because of what I was just
talking about is it's like he who pays
the piper or she who pays the piper
calls the tune on some level. There's a
really interesting play by the Norwegian
playwright Henrik Ipsson called A Doll's
House. Have you heard of this play? It
rocked the world even though I think it
was written in the late 19th century.
And it's a little domestic drama about a
little bgeoa family in Norway. And the
the guy is like a normal guy. He's a
business guy. He's married to this woman
who is a housewife who raises the kids,
but he's kind of like a you know, he's
got that male privilege that we talk
about sometimes. [music]
And he has his mistress and you know, he
doesn't really listen to his wife and he
kind of does what he wants and he's the
king of his castle. And so his wife gets

that she's financially dependent on the
man. And there's no way that she can
kind of do her own thing or [music]
leave if that remains true. So, she
starts like some part-time side hustle.
And the husband and all of his friends
laugh at her. It's like, oh, a woman
making money. This is crazy. But she
just like ignores him and sticks with
it. And eventually the little side
hustle starts to take off and she starts
to make some money. [music] And at the
end of the play, we see her going out on
a Friday night to meet with her lover.
[music] So, it's like, why do people
fantasize about being rich and powerful?
Well, they want to get more of what they
want and less of what they don't. That's
not socially unacceptable. But probably
the other one is that they want the
rules not to apply to them.
