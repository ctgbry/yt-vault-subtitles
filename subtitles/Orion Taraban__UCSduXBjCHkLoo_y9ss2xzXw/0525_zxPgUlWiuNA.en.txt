I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
bring sex back into a relationship so I
consult with guys from all walks of life
and from all over the world we talk
about many many issues but one of the
most frequent topics of discussion one
of the main reasons why men reach out to
me is to help resolve their sexless
marriages let me tell you the number of
sexless marriages that exist in this
world today do not make me very
optimistic about that institution it's
extremely difficult to keep sex alive in
a marriage because among other things
marriage in its striving for safety in
security intentionally removes many of
the elements of passion that naturally
Kindle desire I talk about this more in
my episode why marriage kills sex and I
also provide some unconventional advice
on on how to approach a solution in

[01:02]
on on how to approach a solution in
today's episode I'm going to be talking
about how to rekindle sex in a sexless
relationship and this advice is
specifically for men It's usually the
case in a sexless relationship that it's
the man who has the desire and the woman
who is either rebuffing his advances or
giving him excuses it can happen the
other way around but that's less common
and that requires a different Suite of
solutions so this advice is for men who
are the frustrated party in sexless
relationships to begin with men you have
to understand that male and female
sexuality are extremely different from
each other in fact God is probably
laughing at us all from Beyond the
clouds because we're about as different
as we could possibly be in this regard
and yet we need to find a way to work
that out in order to get together for
instance to a woman sex is like the
fruit of a tree you have to plant the

[02:00]
fruit of a tree you have to plant the
seed and then it grows into a sapling
and then it leaves and then it flowers
and then it fruits sex with a woman is
generally the product of a lot of effort
and
cultivation on the other hand to a man
sex is the seed it initiates everything
else it's the motive force that compels
them to erupt out of themselves and move
out into the world sex is kind of the
end of a process for a woman and the
beginning of a process for a man
this is because women tend to give sex
to men that they like whereas men only
really feel liked when they get sex I
mean I could go on and on about all the
little ironies that exist between men
and women's attitudes around sex the
point is that if you're a man in a
sexist relationship you have to
appreciate that you're dealing with a
different kind of animal which is female
sexuality one of the perennial
complaints you hear from women in this
department is that men just want to go

[03:00]
department is that men just want to go
straight to intercourse women love
foreplay a lot of them need foreplay in
order to get in the mood and I don't
just mean physical stimulation though
that can obviously help they want to
talk and connect and cuddle and feel
heard and feel cared for and then they
want to build up to penetration with
kissing and touching and stroking Etc I
mean it can take a lot of [ __ ] work
just to get women to the point where
they are receptive to sex and the bad
news is
that that's how it's going to be for a
lot of them however the good news is
that foreplay is more than just fumbling
around immediately before intercourse in
fact if you do it right a lot of
foreplay occurs outside the bedroom and
hours before the sexual encounter this
means that if you put in a little effort
throughout the day your woman should be
much more open and receptive to having
sex when you're ready to have it at the

[04:01]
sex when you're ready to have it at the
end of the night however just like my
tree analogy you have to plant the seed
well in advance of when you want to
pluck the fruit this requires some
discipline and patience in the beginning
but once you get in the rhythm of things
you can functionally eat whenever you
want now before I go any further if

in proportion to the value you feel
you've derived from this message I don't
do product placements or corporate
sponsorships so I really do rely on your
support to keep everything going I thank
you very
much now to understand how this process
works you have to appreciate the core
principle at the heart of most seduction
techniques namely
tension and
release first you build the tension and
then you offer an opportunity to release

[05:02]
then you offer an opportunity to release
the tension just like food is most
enjoyable to eat when you're hungry sex
is most enjoyable when it's a release of
sexual tension without tension there is
one fewer reason for sex to happen
because why would you need a release if
you have no tension to let go of and as
the guy who's trying to Kickstart his
sexual relationship it's your job to
cultivate this tension between you and
your woman now you have to begin where
you're at it pains me to say but some
men are in such a bad situation that
they women like Wiz and draw back
whenever they so much as try to touch
them if this is you it's going to take
some time but it's still possible to
turn this ship around now one of the
reasons while your woman draws back from
you is because your touch isn't really a
touch it's a question and the question
is is can we have sex

[06:02]
is is can we have sex
now and it's probably a soft tentative
question because you're expecting to be
rejected which of course makes it even
easier to reject you however what you
have to understand is that your woman
probably isn't withdrawing from your
touch as much as she's saying no to this
implied question and she's saying no to
the implied question because she's not
in the mood at that exact
moment now I feel for you guys it is
just a kick in the teeth when your wife
the one person on this entire planet
with whom you are morally sanctioned to
have sex with the person for whom you
made a solemn oath before God to forgo
all others and the person who likely has
benefited a great deal from your
sacrifices over the years for her
well-being rejects you sexually I get
you and I'm here to empower You by
helping you understand your respons
responsibility in this Dynamic and your

[07:02]
responsibility in this Dynamic and your
responsibility lies in the fact that you
have trained your woman to associate
your touch with this question this
Association is your enemy it's working
against you and it will continue to work
against you as long as it is active to
solve this problem you have to
disassociate your touch your attention
your tension from this question and just
like in classical conditioning you do
this by presenting the conditioned
stimulus without the unconditioned
stimulus with sufficient
repetition this means that you're going
to give up on sex for the time being you
weren't getting it anyway right don't
ask not explicitly with your words not
implicitly with your actions and let
your touch just be your touch and your
attention just be your attention for
now once you begin to decouple these
things from a bid for intercourse you

[08:01]
things from a bid for intercourse you
can then begin to cultivate tension in
your relationship in small ways
throughout the day this could look like
coming up behind her and giving her a
really tight hug and then moving on like
nothing happened or smacking her butt
when you're walking past her and just
continuing on or getting in close and
making direct open eye contact and
opening your mouth a
little and then breaking things off and
moving on with your day whatever you
choose to
the idea here is to create moments of
physical stimulation or emotional
tension that are not associated with a
bid for intimacy you're not going to
move forward with having sex you're just
going to connect you're going to share
this moment of stimulation this moment
of tension and then you're going to
break it off got
it now it can take a while to get this
up to speed depending on how long the
sexual dimension of your relationship
has L dormant however what you event
want is for your woman to be in a kind

[09:02]
want is for your woman to be in a kind
of low grade arousal at all times if
you've primed the engine you can take a
ride whenever you want because the
accumulated tension has made her a
little squirmy you're much less likely
to be rebuffed you're much less likely
to be rejected when you eventually make
the bid to go for full intercourse
you've cultivated attention and now
there's a necessity for it to be
released understand and as the man it's
your responsibility to do this just like
in the courtship stage of a relationship
it was your responsibility to
confidently lead the interaction in the
direction of a sexual encounter like
there are few women who are going to
take the lead in that respect it is now
your responsibility to keep the sexual
fire Ablaze in your committed
relationship and I'm not going to lie
this can be very difficult especially
given the fact that this issue
apparently doesn't bother women nearly
as much as it seems to bother men
however if you could do it then you can

[10:01]
however if you could do it then you can
do it
