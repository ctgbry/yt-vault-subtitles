committed relationships generally don't
happen if men are just left to their own
devices most men are totally fine
keeping things casual indefinitely this
is because as I talked about in my
episode men treat women the way women
treat money we already had to work
really hard just to get sexually
selected so we want to enjoy our time
not take on a second job most men don't
have relationship goals like women do
that's because the goal of most men is
to get laid this is because the vast
majority of men are incredibly hungry
for sex and they would be absolutely
ravenous if they weren't anesthetizing
themselves with pornography when people
are starving all they think about is
food they're not really interested in
what happens after dinner now women you
might be disgusted by this you might
think oh I just want sex go somewhere
else but it's like that's actually men
are so easy to get into relationships
with because of that that's where
they're so vulnerable that's what I'd
like you to consider is that this is an
opportunity for you it's not something
that like should be considered beneath
you
