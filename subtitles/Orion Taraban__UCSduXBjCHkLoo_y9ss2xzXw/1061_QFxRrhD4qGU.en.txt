When it comes to a man, it's more
important for him to feel respected than
to feel loved. There's some empirical
evidence to back up his position, but it
definitely fits with my own personal and
professional experience. Now, it's very
easy to conflate these two things.
They're both positive goods, and of
course, men also want to feel loved, and
women also want to feel respected. So,
aren't we really talking about the same
thing? No. Um, no, we're not. Respect
and love are very different and it's
actually fairly easy to demonstrate this
to which you can respect someone that
you don't love and you can love someone
that you don't respect. For instance, a
general can have a good deal of respect
for his enemy's ability but still desire
to annihilate him in battle. And it's
very difficult to love someone you want
to destroy. By the same token, a person
can love a child like an infant baby and
not respect her ability to do well,
anything. It's like it's very difficult

anything. It's like it's very difficult
to respect a muing mess. Makes sense.
