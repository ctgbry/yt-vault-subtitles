well in the first place I don't really
love this question how do you know she's
the right one or the one the fact of the
matter is that there are many many
people that you can have a fulfilling
rewarding satisfying relationship with
in a world with eight billion people
you're kind of spoiled for Choice as
long as you're willing to put in the
work and be patient until you find what
you're looking for
it is of course important to vet your
potential partner because it is one of
the most important decisions you'll ever
make but even within this framework of
the one or the right one
the fact of the matter is is that
the right one becomes the one because
you chose them
until you choose them they're just an
option they become the one in the act of
you deciding that they're the one
you create the one it has nothing to do
with any qualities that they may or may
not have they become the one in the act
of your choice
