I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is women
punish the men they like
so ladies this is an episode for you I'm
going to explain how you might be
messing up in your relationships with
men this is going to be bitter medicine
for some of you but if you take it in
the right Spirit it might actually
significantly improve your relationships
now before I explain what I mean by this
please remember to like this video And
subscribe to the channel it takes less
than a second costs you nothing and it's
how you can support me in my mission to
deliver free high quality content to the
world so thank you for your help now in
order to illustrate how women punish the
men they like let's consider a little
thought experiment let's say you have
two men in your life one guy you could
kind of take her leave he's decent he's
okay to have some fun with every once in
a while but you're not that emotionally
invested in him and the other guy well

[01:02]
invested in him and the other guy well
you really like he's handsome charming
makes you laugh treats you well and
seems to have good potential the more
you like him the more you envision a
future with him and the more emotionally
invested you become so two guys now
which of these two men are you going to
be annoyed at if he doesn't text you
back right away
which of these two men are you going to
get jealous of if he spends time with
other women
which of these two men are you going to
pester if he's not showing sufficient
enthusiasm and doing what you want
do you get what I'm saying the second
guy whoever he is apparently has been
able to successfully attract you and
engage your emotions and as a
consequence of that he increasingly
becomes the target of your negative
emotions
if this guy doesn't feel like he's
getting the same slack and

[02:01]
getting the same slack and
permissiveness that you would give to
the guy you don't give a about he's
not going to stick around if he has any
decent optionality
and that's how your attraction drives
good men out of your lives
now I'm not saying you have to put up
with bad behavior
what I'm saying is that Emotions Don't
Change the definition of bad behavior
good or bad right or wrong is determined
by the explicitly negotiated agreement
of the relationship or by some
overarching morality that both parties
voluntarily subscribe to not by how you
feel about the person involved murder is
no less of a crime if no one liked the
person who was killed and it's not more
of a crime if everyone loved the
deceased do you understand so I'm going
to give you a good litmus test to help
you determine whether your negative
emotion is Justified when a man you like

[03:01]
emotion is Justified when a man you like
has done something you don't
the test is simple if another guy that
you didn't care about did the same thing
would you be angry or upset
if no then maybe this guy hasn't done
anything wrong
if the guy you could take or leave
doesn't text you back for a few days
don't get all up in arms if and when the
guy you like does the same thing
absenting some explicit expectation to
the contrary
if the guy you could take or leave dates
other women when you're not around
don't make a big deal about it if and
when the guy you like does the same
thing absenting some explicit
expectation to the contrary
this is your emotion talking and you
need to find a way to work through that
yourself because if you punish men as a
consequence of your attraction to them
your disincentivizing them to be

[04:01]
your disincentivizing them to be
attractive to you just keeping it a buck
