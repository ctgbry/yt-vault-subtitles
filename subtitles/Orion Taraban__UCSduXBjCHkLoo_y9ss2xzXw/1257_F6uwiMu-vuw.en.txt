A lot of times the experience that women
go through is [music] they'll have sex
with a man and they're hoping that then
he's going to stay.
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; But he leaves because that's all he
wanted. So on the one hand, we should
give him a taste because everyone is
giving out free samples. And I when I
say we, I don't really literally mean
me. I mean women. And then on the other
hand, when they do do that, men are
done. Okay, that's all I wanted.
Goodbye.
&gt;&gt; I disagree. And I have an episode about
this as well called why women get
ghosted, okay, after sex. Because this
is kind of women's greatest fear is that
the guy just wants to have sex and then
once he has it, he's gone.
&gt;&gt; I mean, it happens.
&gt;&gt; It does. But it's not because of the
sex,
&gt;&gt; right? Okay. What is it because of?
&gt;&gt; Because think about it. If it's true
that a guy only wants sex and you don't
give it to him, okay, then there's not
even the possibility of a relationship
to that begins initiated, right?
&gt;&gt; Mhm. If he only wants sex and you give
him consistently the best sex he's ever
had, what's the problem? Now you have

had, what's the problem? Now you have
access to the man. You can't do anything
as a woman without access to [music] the
man. Now, if you think you can just stop
there, you're mistaken. So, there's a
couple of reasons why women get ghosted.
One of them is they're just kind of
boring or [music] uninteresting or
selfish or difficult.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; In that case, the sex could be the best
part of that relationship. Fair.
&gt;&gt; So, blaming the sex is wrong. Okay.
&gt;&gt; And women might need to look at what
else they how else they might be showing
up in a way that could be offputting.
