How do men and women actually raise
their sexual market value? And I think
that comes with actually defining what
are the criterias of sexual market value
and how you actually determine what's a
peak or not or non-prime sexual market
value for men and women.

think it's always good to be cognizant
of the templates, the archetypes for
male and female beauty that exist in
your culture at any given time. And the
more that you can approximate those
archetypes, the more attractive you will
be to more people, which will mean that
you will have more optionality generally
in the sexual marketplace, which will
among other things expose you to more
possibilities and increase your
bargaining posture as it were. So what
does that mean? It's like men should
learn a little bit about style. They
should work out, make sure that they're
fit. Um, they should take care of basic
hygiene. I mean, that's something that I
hear from women a lot. uh women. I mean,
take care of yourself if possible. Yeah,
it's it's so hard to do this. It's like
I'm loathed to like tell women how they

more normatively attractive, that would
mean like being slim. That would mean
potentially dressing a little bit more

how to use makeup appropriately. Um a
lot of women are very good at these
things already. In fact, the average
woman puts way more effort into moving
towards that archetype than the average
man
