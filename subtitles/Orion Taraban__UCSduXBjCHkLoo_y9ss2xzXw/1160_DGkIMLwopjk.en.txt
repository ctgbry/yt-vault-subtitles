You got another idea which I loved about
overpaying is the cost of winning and it
feels like that's related here as well.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's connected to the idea that
getting what you want is disappointing.
So basically I talk about how life is
sort of an auction house and the way to
auction houses work is it's full of
things that people want. But it's not a
charity. In order to achieve those
goods, people have to outbid every other
person in the room. It's not a perfect
system, but it's kind of what we have
developed in order to maintain some form
of fairness or justice with respect to
the allocation of zero- sum goods.
Because the universe is abundant in its
generals, but it's zero sum in its
specifics, right? So, with respect to
the analogy with life, it's not just
about money, though it could be. It
could mean that you have to work harder
than anybody else. You have to work
longer than anybody else. You may have
to sacrifice your pleasure, your
well-being, your social life, your
friends. You might have to put that all
into your offer to increase the value to
surpass all other biders for that one
zero sum good. And if you actually

zero sum good. And if you actually
succeed in winning, it's because no one
else thought it was worth that much.
Like by definition, you must have
overpaid. Like the likelihood that you
hit the exact correct minimum amount of
value, if you went any lower, you would
have been outbid is functionally zero.
So, you paid more for that than you
needed to because no one else thought
that that good was worth what [music]
you did. And so, that's part of the
disappointment of actually getting what
you want is you probably overpaid. The
idea is, wow, I finally won. I got what
I was doing for, but look at all that I
had to give up. All of the years, all of
the the relationships, all of the
opportunities that I've had to surrender
to get this. Wasn't worth it.
