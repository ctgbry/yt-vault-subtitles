out that the woman's eggs are
problematic or something. Sometimes it's

partner and not the other. And you might
think, okay, well, we still have this
dream of having a family, but we can
adopt. We can get a donor or a
surrogate. But what so often happens in
that circumstance is they get divorced
and they break up because they basically

much. I want my own children. my own I
have always dreamed of having my own
biological children and I love I love
