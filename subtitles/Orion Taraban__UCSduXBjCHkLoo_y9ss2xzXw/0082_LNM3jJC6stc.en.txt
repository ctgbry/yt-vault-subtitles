i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
the problem of other people
so other people represent opportunity
we need other people to satisfy our
wants to support our goals and to
maintain society generally
however other people also represent a
problem
in direct proportion to the extent to
which they represent an opportunity
this is because they control some of the
means by which we hope to achieve the
ends i just mentioned
other people have what we want but might
not give it to us
so they are both an opportunity to be
seized and a problem to be solved
so we all have to learn strategies for
dealing with the problem of other people
and one of the best lenses i've
discovered through which to examine
these strategies is karen hornay's three
trends model
basically jorge noticed that there are
three general approaches to the problem
of other people

[01:00]
of other people
we can move toward we can move against
or we can move away
and i'll briefly discuss
each strategy in turn
however before we begin it's important
to understand that no one strategy is
better than the others each strategy is
effective and appropriate in certain
contexts and ineffective and
inappropriate in others
to that end it's really the inflexible
or over generalized application of a
certain strategy that can be problematic
not the strategy itself got it
first let's talk about move toward
in so many words the goal of the move
toward strategy is to arouse feelings of
personally relevant positive regard in
the other
and this is because people are much more
likely to assist and much less likely to
obstruct
those whom they like or love
so to that end move toward folks might
be kind attentive seductive friendly
pleasant attractive and generally
pro-social

[02:00]
pro-social
people generally like move toward
individuals they can be warm supportive
and easy going however these same folks
can have issues with people pleasing
assertiveness boundaries and resentment
an archetypal move toward personality is
scheherazade who was able to transmute a
death sentence into a marriage proposal
by enchanting her would-be executioner
next you have the move against folks
the goal of the move against strategy is
to cultivate dependence through the
establishment of dominance
and this is because though they might
not like it
it's hard for people to dispense with
the person who can do the job better
than anyone else
so move against folks tend to be capable
competitive
competent aggressive domineering and
analytical
they get what they want from others
through the demonstration of their
superior intellect superior strength
superior talent or superior ability
an archetypal move against personality

[03:00]
an archetypal move against personality
is dr house who was so brilliant that
people basically had to put up with his
abrasive personality
after all if i'm good enough it doesn't
matter if people hate me they will
respect me and that is how i will get my
needs met
finally we have the move away folks the
goal of the move away strategy is to
minimize vulnerability to the
obstruction of others by reducing
dependence upon them
that is if i want nothing from anybody
how can anybody be a problem for me
consequently these folks strive to
become as independent as possible they
tend to be self-reliant resourceful
eccentric creative inaccessible and
renunciatory
their motto is i'll do it myself
and to the extent that they succeed they
eliminate the possibility of being
frustrated and disappointed by others
an archetypal move away personality is
gatama buddha whose renunciation of the
world facilitated the transcendence of
his attachment to contingent beings

[04:02]
his attachment to contingent beings
so there you have it move toward move
against and move away
and it's useful to remember that you
have these three options when dealing
with the problem of other people
as that awareness will help you
intentionally choose the strategy most
conducive to success given prevailing
conditions
