in the domain of psychology we've come
to believe that understanding the origin
of a problem is synonymous with treating
the problem and this belief has migrated
into the popular imagination and has
significantly altered expectations in
romantic relationships the issue is no
longer that someone is untrustworthy or
critical or rejecting no these are just
symptoms of narcissistic abuse or an
emotionally unavailable parent or sexual
trauma Etc and once the person and
everyone around the person deeply and
thoroughly processes these experiences
the surface symptoms will disappear and
until that happens patience and
compassion and most of all understanding
is what is called for however I'm here
to tell you that at a certain stage of
the game it doesn't fing matter where a
problem comes from the problem is that
the problem still exists plain and
simple and understanding the origin of
this problem is an intellectual
curiosity at best and completely
irrelevant at worst
