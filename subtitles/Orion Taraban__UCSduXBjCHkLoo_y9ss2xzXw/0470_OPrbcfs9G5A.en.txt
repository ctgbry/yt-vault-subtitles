I think we gotta be careful about
romanticizing the days when people got
married at 17 and stayed together for 70
years personally I'd rather not go back
to that time with its lack of
optionality or recourse I like being
able to choose an option that's right
for me as opposed to having to settle
for the only thing available that said
this optionality is also a driver in the
present decline in relationships with
dating apps and social media many people
are ensnared by the illusion of infinite
optionality and this illusion has
exacerbated the Primacy of desire in the
modern game of mating and dating even
more than the elimination of necessity
by itself ever could why because if I
don't need someone and very desirable
Partners exist somewhere in that
infinite optionality then I have little
incentive to settle for anything less
than something very desirable and why
shouldn't I have it all I don't need to
settle for less I'm young and I have
plenty of time anyway
