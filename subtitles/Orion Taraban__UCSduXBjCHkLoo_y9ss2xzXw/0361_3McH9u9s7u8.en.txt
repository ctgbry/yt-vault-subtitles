I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why men
care about a woman's sexual history
most men on some level already
understand the answer to this question
so this episode is specifically designed
to help the women out there women
I imagine that the emphasis that men can
put on your sexual history can feel
somewhat baffling especially if we're
talking about experiences that occurred
before the man in your life even knew
you you might think all that is in the
past that was then and this is now and
I'm here with you now so really what's
the issue well I'm here to explain what
the issue is

so why are men so concerned about what
you did in the past sexually with other
men the answer is actually complex and
multifaceted there are two general
components here's how we can begin to
approach an understanding ladies
have you ever had the experience and I
bet you have
of buying an expensive piece of clothing
only to realize a week or two later that
a discount code existed that could have
gotten you 50 off the same item
when you learn about the existence of
that code
how do you feel
not very good right you may even have
complained and tried to get the company
to retroactively honor the code after
the purchase I've seen many women do
them
and why do you do that because learning
about the discount code actually changes

[02:01]
about the discount code actually changes
your perception of the item that you
bought
whereas two weeks ago you were more or
less happy to pay full price for that
piece of clothing
once you realize that you paid 100
percent more than you needed to
you can't look at the same item the same
way again it's not nearly as attractive
and desirable as it once was why because
it turns out you didn't actually
underpay for something valuable you
overpaid for something cheap
and that is not a good feeling
so what does this have to do with sexual
history and relationships well a number
of things first of all you have to
understand that broadly speaking there
is a sort of arms race between men and
women in the sexual Marketplace
in a highly simplified version it breaks
down like this men are trying to get as
much sex as possible from women for the

[03:00]
much sex as possible from women for the
least amount of time energy and money
and women are trying to get as much time
energy and money from Men for the least
amount of sex
this is obviously an oversimplification
but there must be at least some truth to
it because we typically don't see the
roles reversed
so when a man is actually in a
relationship with you in that he's
taking you out on dates and listening to
your problems and meeting your family
and taking you on trips and supporting
you emotionally in short when he is
heavily investing time energy and money
into you
and then he learns that you a guy
that you met at a bar an hour ago and
who ghosted you the next day
he's gonna feel like you did when you
found out about those discount codes
that is he's gonna feel like a total
schmuck for overpaying for something
that you are obviously willing to sell
for a fraction of the price
and I guarantee that will change the way

[04:01]
and I guarantee that will change the way
he perceives you forever
so that's one part of the answer the
second part of the answer of why men
care about a woman's sexual history is
even more pragmatic in general to
determine how people actually feel feel
it's far more accurate and reliable to
examine what people do
over and above what people say
the fact of the matter is that people
can move their lips and say anything
they can say things like I love you or
you're the best I've ever had or I can't
stop thinking about you
people can say whatever they want
and because of that there's always the
possibility of Doubt as to whether or
not the words actually reflect their
felt experience and objective reality
Now ladies it's also true that you will
do more in the bedroom with men you are
more attracted to
with men you like more

[05:00]
with men you like more
when your attraction is high you will
make yourself more sexually available in
every sense of those words and you will
willingly break the rules that you
rigidly enforce for others
so if you put two and two together you
can see that learning about a woman's
sexual history is a way for men to kind
of confirm a woman's words with her
actions and to determine how attracted
to a woman how attractive a woman
actually is to them
why
because if a man finds out that you did
other things sooner or more frequently
than you did or do with him
the reasonable conclusion that he is
going to draw is that you are not as
attracted to him as you have been to
other men in your past
with whom you were willing and
enthusiastic about doing those things
and this is also going to make him feel
like a schmuck because it's going to
make him feel like you are settling for
him
that's the second part and if you

[06:01]
that's the second part and if you
combine those two parts the result is a
man who now feels that he's paying twice
as much for half as much which is not a
great place to be
how does this play out in my own
personal life well if I learn for
whatever reason
that a woman is not willing to be more
sexually open available and freaky with
me then I know she's been with the guy
that she has been most attracted to in
the past
then I just concluded the relationship
is not worth my time
this is not because I think I'm entitled
to those things I appreciate that I'm
not everyone's cup of tea and some women
will find me more attractive than others
that is perfectly fine
I conclude that the relationship is not
worth my time because I only want to be
in a relationship with women who feel
like I'm the best she's ever had
with women who are extremely attracted
to me
with women who are enthusiastic and
excited about being there
that's the experience I'm looking for

[07:00]
that's the experience I'm looking for
and the best way for her to demonstrate
that feeling is by doing things with me
that she hasn't done with other men
everything else is just lip service
what do you think did my explanation
make sense
