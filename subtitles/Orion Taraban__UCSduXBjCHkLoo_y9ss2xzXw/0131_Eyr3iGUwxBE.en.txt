i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
covert contracts
as the name suggests a covert contract
is a quid pro quo that is not revealed
to the other party
now on the surface this arrangement
might seem somewhat silly i mean if you
don't explicitly negotiate a trade with
another person how can you reasonably
expect to get what you hope to receive
in that transaction this will only
happen rarely and kind of by accident
i think we probably all understand this
intellectually however in practice many
of our relationships both personal and
professional are subject to these covert
contracts every day of our lives
for example a very common professional
covert contract
is
that if i consistently go above and
beyond my contractual obligations this
effort will be recognized appreciated

[01:00]
effort will be recognized appreciated
and rewarded
that is not necessarily true at all in
many cases in fact this behavior has the
opposite effect from management's
perspective your hard work might create
a low-cost high-benefit solution for
them which will increase the likelihood
that you will remain in that role
as promoting you will require replacing
your previous position with a person
whose labor exhibits a higher cost
benefit ratio to management
but people routinely burn themselves out
at work in the service of this covert
contract and feel resentful and
exploited when things don't go their way
there are also tons of covert contracts
in the world of dating
what i like to call nice guy syndrome
for instance is dominated by the idea of
often disavowed quid pro quo
arrangements
if i buy her dinner and help her move
and demonstrate that i don't just want
sex like all the other guys and value
her emotionally psychologically and

[02:00]
her emotionally psychologically and
spiritually
then i will be rewarded with sex and
companionship
i'm not saying that any of those
behaviors are bad or wrong in and of
themselves
but that they're ineffective in
achieving the nice guy's ultimate goal
for instance women generally want to be
valued by the men they like
but a man's valuation
will not typically cause a woman to like
him
but men routinely work to prove
themselves to the women to whom they are
retracted
to whom they are attracted and feel
resentful and exploited when things
don't go their way
the fact of the matter is that gifts
recognition respect love sex affection
are always given at the pleasure of the
giver
there's nothing you can do to earn a
gift
you can earn a reward but you cannot
earn a gift
otherwise like by definition it's no
longer a gift

[03:00]
longer a gift
unsurprisingly you are much more likely
to receive gifts if you give gifts
yourself
the trick is to overcome the urge to
give in order to receive and to
cultivate more and more a pleasure in
giving it's a kind of generosity of
spirit
this will help you achieve greater
outcome independence which will create
the condition necessary for others to
feel like they can give freely and
spontaneously themselves
so how do you let go of covert contracts
there are really only two ways either
you cultivate the courage to negotiate
for what you want with others more
explicitly
or you work to divest yourself of
unjustified expectations of others and
this is probably a both and solution as
opposed to an either or solution you'll
know that you're on the right track if
you begin to notice a reduction in the
frequency and intensity of your anger
and disappointment
try it out for yourself
