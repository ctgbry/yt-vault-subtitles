i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is love is abundant this is also
something
that i discuss over and over again with
my clients
a lot of people stay in less than
satisfying relationships or even
destructive or abusive relationships
because of their scarcity mentality
which is basically like hey
you know this is a problematic
relationship and yet it might be the
best relationship i've been able to get
up until this point in time
i remember how difficult it was to even
get this flawed relationship
isn't this flawed relationship better
than no relationship at all
well that's not always true actually
sometimes being in a bad or mediocre
relationship
provides an opportunity cost that
prevents you from getting into a better
more rewarding relationship
there's that um

[01:00]
there's that um
but the issue here is that there's a
scarcity mentality which is that love
is a rare precious
unusual element
like uranium and it's something that
has great value and
we don't just we don't just throw it
away when it um
like uranium when it burns us and
what i'd like to suggest is that love
particularly between
um people in a romantic relationship is
very abundant love is extremely
common and it's it's something that
evolves and develops along very
predictable
lines it's also an experience that you
can have
with literally millions and millions of
other people on this planet
if you take two people and you
repeatedly see each other
once or twice a week for a few months
if you throw in regular sexual contact

[02:01]
if you throw in regular sexual contact
um
i don't care what your intentions were
that you're just going to keep it casual
that you don't want to catch feelings um
if you spend time with somebody
over and over and over again and you
throw in sexual intimacy
it's inevitable that you will become
emotionally
involved with that person it's
it happens whether you want to or not
now some people might deny that and they
might resist it
or they might take action in the
relationship in the structured
to prevent it from fluorescing however
that's it
it's like that emotional attachment you
have to somebody is is largely
um familiarity plus intimacy and that's
something that you can literally have
with almost anybody on the planet who's
willing to
to show up and reciprocate in that way
this of course means that one it's
important to
be intentional about who you decide to

[03:01]
be intentional about who you decide to
spend your time with
because it's inevitable that emotional
bonds will develop
just through repetition and exposure but
it also means that you don't need to be
so protective about
letting go of something that's no longer
serving it doesn't even have to be bad
maybe just
you want something different or this
isn't the direction that you want your
life to go in at a
current moment to know that there are
plenty of other people in the world
i can spend time with them i can
open myself up emotionally and and to
witness the
emotional opening of the other person
and if you do that
you know you mix it up you bake for
four to six months that's what you're
gonna get um
very common love is very common all
right
