acting from a place of emotion often
leaves you with consequences that far
Outlast the emotion that originally
produce the impulse to act and that's a
very dangerous asymmetry like you can
make a decision in anger or fear or
hopelessness once that will permanently
change the rest of your life it's not
fair but that's the way it is people
think emotions are personal because only
they get to feel them however behind
every emotion is a thought and the
thoughts that consistently create those
emotions are impersonal if I were to
think the same thoughts and believe them
to be true then the same emotion would
arise in me as well so we don't have to
consider emotions to be these inherently
valuable jewels that are more meaningful
or significant than other aspects of our
experience in my opinion it's better to
hold our emotions gently and to consider
them in light of multiple sources of
information our reason our senses to
decrease the likelihood that we're being
misled
