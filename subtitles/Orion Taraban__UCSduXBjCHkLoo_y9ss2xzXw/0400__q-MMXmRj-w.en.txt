you're you had a you seem to have a
particular
um bone to pick with male feminists and
I I find that phenomenon to be
interesting because it does sound from
this conversation so far I mean correct
me if I'm wrong that it doesn't seem
like feminism
[Music]
really advances
the
uh goals of men like it doesn't seem to
make them happy or it doesn't seem to to
get them better dating or mating options
why would a man become a feminist
I think it's a great mating strategy
because if you are that guy who can uh
it's like a dishonest signal in in the
animal kingdom where you have honest
signals of strength like a peacock's
Tales an honest signal of virility
because it takes resources to generate
that tail you can't fake it but there
are dishonest signals and uh
dishonest signals are lies essentially

[01:00]
dishonest signals are lies essentially
they're they're the illusion of vigor
and vitality without it really being
there and I think that for a male
feminist and you know I know some guys
are going to hate me for this and I I
have to say right out of the gate I
don't care
um for um for a man to adopt a
a feminist mindset and we should
probably Define feminism at some point
because we're talking about it as if we
all under we're working with a common
definition so let's define in a minute
but for a man to take on a feminist
mindset that is essentially anti-male he
is he's being sneaky he's saying look at
me ladies I'm on your side that guy over
there the guy that's working on the the
crane over there and actually building
that building across the street he's not
on your side he's a brute he's he
probably voted for Trump you don't want
anything to do with that guy I'm your
guy I'm writing these papers about how
we all need to to take better care of
you that's that's kind of a sneaky

[02:00]
you that's that's kind of a sneaky
dishonest signal do you think these men
are conscious that this might be a
mating strategy
I think some probably are to some degree
and I will give many of them the benefit
of the doubt they've been many men
marinade or you know they're marinating
in this ideology from day one and maybe
they just can't see past it you know
because they're getting it from from
kindergarten all the way through college
if they go to college or getting in
their entertainment they're getting in
from Marvel Comics you know they're
getting all the female empowerment stuff
which is fine this is not about being
anti-female
so maybe they just can't see past that
they've been told for for decades that
you're a good guy if you think this way
you're a bad guy if you think that way
that's really interesting what's coming
to mind is this
classic season of Survivor the TV show
I'm not a big fan of Survivor but I
think it's a fascinating game because
it's almost impossible to win
um and in this classic season it was men
versus women

[03:00]
versus women
and the way it generally works in the
beginning is that there's all sorts of
like physical challenges
and based on which side wins the other
side gets weakened and I think through
the first maybe month of the season
it was absolute Massacre I don't think
the women had won a single challenge
versus the men and they were dwindling
and yet the winners of that season were
all women like the top three finishers
were women and I was like why is that
how did this happen because
the women could not out compete the men
at a single event
the way it happened is that the women
drove a wedge between the men
the women
began
uh
they went to some of the lower status
the lower performing men in the other
camp and said look
you guys are going to beat us but as
soon as we're gone who do you think is

[04:01]
soon as we're gone who do you think is
next
you think you're going to beat these
Alphas
so you might think you're winning right
now and you feel really good but there's
no way that you're going to be
Mr Chad over there
and so basically the women succeeded in
negotiating a block with the lower
status men
at a strategic juncture of the season
and those that block succeeded in voting
out the highest status Alpha men who
were the most threatening to both the
women and the lower status men and then
as soon as they were gone
all of the lower status men were the
next ones to follow because the women
just voted them out
so that's fascinating isn't that isn't
that incredible I mean and the the
differences between the two camps were
so striking the men's Camp was running
like clockwork they had fire they had
shelter they were well fed the women

[05:02]
shelter they were well fed the women
were shivering and wet and hungry
they didn't have the Survivor Survivor
skills to like
they were barely hanging on at some
point it would they they resorted to a
desperate strategy but it worked and I
think one of the
uh so they they used fear to motivate
the lower status men against the higher
status men but I think they also used
the prospect of
I think they seduced them a little bit
too
so what the women lacked in physical
capability to mastering the environment
the men lacked in psychological ability
to recognize when they were being
plotted on and manipulated yeah those
those lower status men were definitely I
mean it was very fascinating because one
of the strategies was to to play the the
Damsel in Distress and the women would
come over to the men's camp and say oh
you know we're so cold we're so you guys

[06:00]
you know we're so cold we're so you guys
are so strong and you know all about
fire like couldn't you help us couldn't
you just spare the fire it costs you
nothing you know it's like really kind
of yeah and they're they're their
competitors in this season of survivors
men versus women so can you imagine a
rival pulling that card in like a
sporting match or something like that in
a boxing match
ridiculous but yes uh women are
generally much more Adept at let's say
emotional and psychological warfare than
men I made an episode about this that if
we had a no holds bar No Holds Barred
bar brawl between a man and a woman it
would be no contest I mean the vast
majority of men would just mop the floor
with a woman which is why we don't do
that it just seems like it's too unfair
of a fight
and to be fair that's generally not how
fighting occurs in most relationships
and the vast majority of relationships
is not a physical fight it's an
emotional or a verbal argument and the
vast majority of men are completely
outmatched completely outclassed by

[07:01]
outmatched completely outclassed by
women
they don't they don't know how to argue
like women do they don't know how to use
words to hurt in the same way that that
women do and that leaves them in a
significant disadvantage so I think that
it's really important for men to kind of
I mean there's this there's this trend
in society like not be a harmless man
like to you need to have strength you
need to have skills in a competent
strong man is
it's not a heart it's not a harmless man
he could cause harm he could also he
also has the power to do good
it's really the same power you know what
I'm saying you have to have power one
way or the other and I think it behooves
a lot of men to learn some of the tricks
of the trade when it comes to women so
that they kind of know how to
hold themselves in a fight
just like it I think it makes sense for
guys to to know how to like take a punch
or throw a punch it makes sense for guys
to know how to
how to recognize emotional manipulation

[08:02]
how to recognize emotional manipulation
and how to
potentially
tolerate and resolve their own
discomfort that comes up in the presence
of a woman's distress
yeah you said so much good stuff there
