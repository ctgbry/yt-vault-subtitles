What do you think? What's your criticism
of therapy? I mean, I guess you just you
just said it. It's too much affirming,
not enough directive. There's so many
criticisms that you could level that's

just the therapist is a co- for your
experience and validates your feelings
and doesn't ever challenge your
perspectives or doesn't actually give
you directive advice that could move you
in the direction of your stated
objectives. It's just, uh-huh, I can see
how you feel that way. That must have
been very hard for you. basically like
you're right, which is a very feminized
way of communication. It's like that's
the old joke between the husband and the
wife. The wife's saying the problems.
The husband starts offering solutions.
The wife says, "I just want you to
listen." It's like, "Of course, I'm
listening. That's why I'm offering these
reality based solutions." No, I just
want you to listen. Well, how is that

ah, you know, so I think it's a very
feminine profession. I have some
theories as to why that has become the
case. And I think feminine communication
is less about problem solving and more

is less about problem solving and more
about emotional coping.
