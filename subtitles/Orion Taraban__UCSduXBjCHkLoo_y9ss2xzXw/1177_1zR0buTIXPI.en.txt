There is nothing more perverse and toxic
than trying to convince other people
that they're living inside of the
nightmare the nightmare that you believe
that you're already inside of. Like that
to me seems to be like I don't know. I I
I think the world would be a
significantly better place if those
people just weren't allowed to talk.
&gt;&gt; H well it's their way of reducing their
own cognitive dissonance. I assume
because the the presence of other people
who don't see that life is a nightmare
who are living their lives in an
energetic way and moving in the
direction with hopefulness and
confidence towards their goals is a
palpable counter example counter
evidence counterfactual to their entire
worldview. It denies the validity of
that worldview and that's embarrassing
because it in some dim recess of their
minds calls up the possibility that
things could be different and that they
could be wrong and that's actually very
difficult to to to approach like this.
There are actually some coralates here
with depression. Like I've worked with

with depression. Like I've worked with
some folks who have been depressed for
years and years and years and at a
certain point after a certain amount of
treatment they do come to the
understanding that maybe they've
prolonged this condition longer than was
necessary. Maybe they have been
willfully mired in this state and the
possibility of recovery is isomorphic
with admitting that they kind of did
this to themselves and that they might
have been wrong for years. And that's
really difficult. That's the sunken cost
fallacy, right? And so if I actually get
better, it kind of admits that I could
have done this earlier and I'm having
real trouble making sense of that. Does
that make sense, Chris?
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Yeah.
