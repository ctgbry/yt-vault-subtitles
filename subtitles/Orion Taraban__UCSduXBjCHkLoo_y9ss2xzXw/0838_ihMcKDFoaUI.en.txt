I made an episode about how to be
disciplined. And the analogy I use is
that you have to channel your inner
postman. So in America, the USPS has
this motto that's basically like neither
rain nor snow nor even hail will keep
the postman from his appointed rounds or
something like that. Which is basically
to say that the postman doesn't wake up
in the morning, look out the window, and
say, "It looks cold. I don't really know
if I really feel like going out and
doing that." It's like it doesn't
matter. You deliver the mail because
that's your job. And so on some level
the worst question to ask yourself in
certain contexts is do I feel like doing
this or how do I feel because that opens
the door to an inappropriate doubt or
deliberation that will only hesitate or
obstruct the effective action or
dischargement of your duty. And a with
respect to depression I was saying about
behavioral activation it's like your
feelings. You have to do it in spite of
what you feel. Everything inside of you
is going to hate leaving your house or
interacting with other people or picking
up the phone. it.
