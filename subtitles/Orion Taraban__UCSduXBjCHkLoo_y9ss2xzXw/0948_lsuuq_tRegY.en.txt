I think that the ability to to attract
and seduce women successfully is very
inseparable from a man's sense of self
and self-esteem. Like if a man has
everything else going for him, maybe
he's very competent, he's professionally
successful, he's got great friends, he
has a beautiful house, but he for
whatever reason despaires of ever being
able to talk to a woman, to seduce her,
to move that relationship in the
direction of a sexual encounter, I don't
think he's going to feel very good in
him in his heart of heart. Yeah. Because
that's the driving motivator behind
those other things. Having a good body,
having money is the driving motivator.
So if you can't access women from it,
all of it feels in vain. Whereas if it
leads to women, it all feels like it's
worth it. That's right. It's all
sublimated sexual desire. It's like, why
do men work so hard in so many other
ways? It's a means of attracting women.
Though that is what I call an attraction
proxies. There's so many guys, I think
you've spoken about this, Saudia, who
just think, well, I'm going to work
really hard in making a million bucks
and then once I have a million bucks, I

and then once I have a million bucks, I
just have to show a woman my bank
account and she's going to fall head
over heels in love with me. And this is
a very rudimentary understanding of
female psychology.
