I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why
people self-sabotage
so this is a topic that has been
requested by many people over the last
several months so I'm happy to finally
be doing an episode about it
self-sabotage is a really complex
Behavior so I can't pretend that this
explanation will cover every aspect of
that behavior that said I do think that
it speaks to let's say the emotional
core of what self-sabotage is and at its
core self-sabotage is a self-defense
strategy
let me explain what I mean by that
so you've probably been out at a bar on
a Friday night and at some point you've
likely seen a friend of yours take
offense at something somebody said and
this guy jumps up and starts acting
really aggressively and making
threatening comments and gestures while
you and your friends are holding them
back from an escalating conflict
and the basic message of this guy's

[01:01]
and the basic message of this guy's
behavior is hey man you're lucky my
friends are here because if they weren't
I would [ __ ] you up
that's the message of his behavior
but the fact of the matter is if that
same interaction had occurred and that
man was alone
and he didn't have his friends there to
hold him back he almost certainly would
not have jumped up and acted as
aggressively as he did in the first
scenario he was able to act more
aggressively and to retain his
self-image as a force to be reckoned
with because he knew there was a limiter
in place to restrain his behavior and
that limiter actually made him feel
safer in that situation and this is
paradoxical of course because he was
acting much more aggressively which is a
much riskier Behavior he felt safer so
he acted riskier
we see this happen in a lot of different
contexts for example when people
practice martial arts in pads they

[02:01]
practice martial arts in pads they
suffer more frequent injuries than when
they Spar without pads the pads give
many people the false sense of security
and they end up putting themselves In
Harm's Way thinking that they're
invulnerable and by the same token the
strikers feel like they can add more
Force to their blows without consequence
and when you put two and two together
you have the perfect conditions for an
injury so what does this have to do with
self-sabotage self-sabotage is basically
a way of communicating potentially to
other people but really to yourself
if only my friends weren't here I would
feel your blood on my hands tonight
if only I weren't being held back
you would see how powerful I really am

now in my little Ballroom example
blaming his friends for holding him back
is a way for that person to protect his
ego which had recently been threatened
from a confrontation with reality
if those friends had not been there and
that man was acting a fool and a fight
actually had occurred there's every
possibility that he would have been
handed his ass
and that would have been painful in more
ways than one reality can be very
painful and very humbling especially
from the perspective of the ego which
would prefer to believe that it's very
powerful or very charismatic or very
intelligent or very competent or very
funny or very attractive or very what
have you
of course when we actually are those
things we generally don't create
obstacles in the demonstration of our

[04:01]
obstacles in the demonstration of our
virtues
but when we're not so sure we're subject
to protecting ourselves from learning
the hard way that we're not as powerful
charismatic intelligent competent funny
or attractive as we might think we are
by avoiding contact with reality
and we do that by putting things in our
way like the friends in the bar
that hold us back that way we don't
actually have to fight
and potentially lose
cell sabotage is a way for folks to
protect their egos by preventing contact
with reality because reality will let us
know just how powerful or intelligent or
attractive we really are
and because their egos were prevented
from coming into contact with reality
people can still operate under the
fantasy that they are powerful or
intelligent or attractive or whatever
the limiter prevents the potentially

[05:01]
the limiter prevents the potentially
disconfirming experience with reality
which is why self-sabotage is protective
it's protective of the ego's narcissism
and this creates a measure of comfort
for people specifically the comfort of
control
self-sabotage allows people to control
when they fail
and that makes people feel better
because as painful as it is to make
themselves fail
it's still less painful than failing on
someone else's terms which can include
trying as hard as you can
and still failing
that would not only be painful but it
would disabuse them of the fantasies
that they would prefer to continue to
entertain about themselves so it's at
least twice as hard
and because they feel some measure of
comfort in being in control of their
failure self-sabotagers like the Martial
Arts students who Spar in pads or the
guy being held back by his friends in

[06:00]
guy being held back by his friends in
the bar actually end up engaging in
riskier Behavior because they feel safer
and so we typically see people engage in
Risky behavior when they're
self-sabotaging abusing drugs and
alcohol picking fights in their Intimate
Relationships shutting down and
withdrawing Whenever there is a
difficulty
and these behaviors allow people to
preserve a Fantastical self-concept by
protecting their ego from disconfirming
experiences with reality
like I said it's a fascinating
phenomenon
