What if my man is wrong? What if I know
better than he does? Do I still have an
obligation to comply? Well, kind of.
Kind of you do. And here's why. The only
surefire way to prove that someone is
wrong, is by following their direction.
If you decide ahead of time that they're
wrong, which is called contempt prior to
investigation, or if you cherrypick the
parts that you like from the parts that
you don't, then you've added some
uncontrolled variables into the
equation. That is, if the desired
outcome is not obtained, we can no
longer tell to what extent that was due
to bad direction or to non-compliance.
For better or worse, the best way to
prove that someone is wrong is to do
exactly what they tell you to do and for
it to not work. Otherwise, we won't know
if it's his direction or your judgment
that is at fault. No one likes to hear
this, but as a doctor and a teacher,

you coming to me? I didn't hunt you
down. Understand? Ultimately, ladies,
you can't compensate a lack of obedience
with love. It doesn't work that way. So,
if you truly honestly, for whatever
reason, can't bring yourself to respect
the man you're with, which I can
understand. I wouldn't want to follow a
fool. Then go find one you can respect.
That's best for everyone involved.
