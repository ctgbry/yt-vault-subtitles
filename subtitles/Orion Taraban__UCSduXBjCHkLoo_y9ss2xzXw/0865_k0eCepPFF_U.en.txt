self-awareness is useful to kind of
figure out to what extent our
programming is aligned with vertical
reality. I guess what you're describing
is it's how I think about therapy. It's
it's going in and trying to understand,
you know, bad programming, the the false
conclusions, the distorted belief
systems that we have that are that are
causing us frustration in reality to
become aware of them and then change
them. Is that how you think about
therapy? Therapy is definitely helpful
for bringing that kind of self-awareness
to the individual, facilitating it. But
as I talk about in the first chapter,
that's not necessarily sufficient to
actually change the feeling or even to
change the behavior. Like a woman could
go to therapy for years and learn how
she's attracted to narcissistic,
manipulative men because it reminds her
of her alcoholic father and her mother
told her in so many ways that this is
just how women should behave and they
should be dmats and longsuffering, etc.
And she could potentially speak that
with all kinds of insight and

with all kinds of insight and
therapeutic language, but she could
still find herself authentically
attracted to narcissistic manipulative
men. she can be aware of it, which
actually could be kind of torturous.
Like, if I'm a machine, I'd rather not
be a self-aware machine who's aware of
its own deterministic patterns. You know
what I'm saying? So, I don't think that
awareness by itself is sufficient to
change people's patterns. They actually
have to do something different enough
times and to collect more good data to
kind of drown out the bad data that they
were trained on. Because for better or
for worse, we can't actually delete or
erase that
