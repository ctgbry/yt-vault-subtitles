I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psychs
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is there is
no need to understand this is really
important for people to keep in mind
while they're in the dating process as
you get to know somebody it's very
likely that you're going to encounter
some things about this person that
aren't very pleasant that aren't very
attractive and that you would prefer not
to see you want love these things but
some of these things you'll be able to
live with and some of these things you
won't however throughout this process
there is a trap that people are subject
to falling into and we could call this
trap the Trap of understanding once
people become cognizant of the
problematic attributes of the other they
can fall into the Trap of trying to
understand where these problems are
coming from because they believe that
understanding the origin of the problem

[01:02]
understanding the origin of the problem
will somehow lessen the impact of the
problem or resolve it
entirely this isn't true and no one acts
like it's true in any other medical
profession like if someone gets
diagnosed with cancer the doctors don't
spend months trying to get to the bottom
of where the cancer came from it's here
now so the question becomes what are
they going to do about it moving forward
once the disease has manifested in the
the patient the origin is an
intellectual curiosity at best and
completely irrelevant at
worst for some reason however in the
domain of psychology we've come to
believe that understanding the origin of
a problem is synonymous with treating
the problem and this belief has migrated
into the popular imagination and has
significantly altered expectations in
romantic relationships the issue is no
longer that someone is untrustworthy or

[02:03]
longer that someone is untrustworthy or
critical or rejecting no these are just
symptoms of narcissistic abuse or an
emotionally unavailable parent or sexual
trauma etc etc and once the person and
everyone around the person deeply and
thoroughly processes these experiences
the surface symptoms will disappear and
until that happens patience and
compassion and most of all
understanding is what is called for
however I'm here to tell you that at a
certain stage of the game it doesn't
[ __ ] matter where a problem comes
from the problem is that the problem
still
exists plain and simple and
understanding the origin of this problem
is an intellectual curiosity at best and
completely irrelevant at worst like in
the majority of cases the people you are
dating are old enough to have dealt with

[03:01]
dating are old enough to have dealt with
these issues by now as I've stated
previously it may not be their fault but
it is their
responsibility it could very well be
true that a woman's emotional
difficulties or a man's relational
problems stem from say a traumatic
childhood but that childhood could have
been 20 or 30 years ago what has that
person been doing in the intervening
time to solve the problem therapy well
if that could have solved the problem it
would have solved the problem by now
what else is this problem as much of a
problem for them as it is for you if not
you're going to have a tough go of it
people will only change for other people
to a point for change to be sustainable
it must be intrinsically
motivated I appreciate this can sound
harsh but frankly so is the prospect of
spending an inordinate amount of time in

[04:00]
spending an inordinate amount of time in
a difficult
relationship this is true irrespective
of the origin of the problem in question
yeah that child didn't ask for those
things to happen to them but that person
hasn't been a child for a very long time
you might have sympathy for their
ongoing difficulties but that absolutely
doesn't mean that you should move
forward with a relationship out of a
misplaced sense of pity or a misguided
desire to support someone out of their
unhappiness
if you appreciate the insights on this
channel I would highly encourage you to
get your hands on a copy of my book the
value of others over the course of 432
pages I delve deep into my economic
model of relationships and explain the
behavior of both men and women in the
game of mating and dating I also provide
a lot of actionable advice on how to get
and keep more of what you want in the
sexual Market Marketplace once you read

[05:01]
sexual Market Marketplace once you read
the value of others you'll never look at
relationships the same way again now
available an ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description if you're a longtime
supporter of this channel you know that
I often liken romance to business if it
works in one it tends to work in the
other and this holds true even with the
topic under consideration as I've said
before dating is an extended hiring
process and in that process the man is
the employer this is because the man is
expected to extend an invitation to the
woman and not the other way around so
let's imagine that you the man are an
executive at a company and you're
currently interviewing candidates for a
position at your firm if one of these
candidates interviews poorly if they are
socially awkward or aggressive or
arrogant or stubborn or bumbling do you

[06:02]
arrogant or stubborn or bumbling do you
really need to spend time trying to
figure out why that candidate didn't
interview well are you going to try to
understand why that particular candidate
was anxious or incompetent or entitled
absolutely not you might have sympathy
for the fact that the interview didn't
go well but that sympathy doesn't extend
to devoting time and trouble to figuring
out the origin of their problem let
alone offering them a position with the
expectation that you would be able to
change them into a confident competent
employee over time what you should do is
say thank you for taking the time to
come down here we'll take your
application under consideration and then
move on to the next [ __ ]
candidate and that's what men should do
in the courtship process once it becomes
clear that they have encountered a deal
breaker in the sense that it's going to
be difficult if not impossible to have a
long-term stable harmonious relationship

[07:01]
long-term stable harmonious relationship
with a particular woman given her
behavior or personality then he should
simply move on to the next potential
candidate higher slow Fire fast do not
fall into the Trap of trying to
understand why she is the way she is and
absolutely do not fall into the Trap of
thinking that you can help her get over
it this is because insight and emotional
support are often not enough enough to
solve many of these
problems appreciate that it's going to
be very poor consolation indeed if you
understand the origin of a problem that
continues to manifest in your
relationship you are not a saint at a
certain point your sympathy is going to
dry up and your patience is going to
wear thin and you're going to find
yourself in a high conflict or at the
very least a high stress relation ship

[08:00]
very least a high stress relation ship
better to say thank you but I don't
think we're compatible all the best to
you very simple easy to understand
advice right
so why don't guys follow it the reason
why guys don't follow it is generally
that they have already decided that this
is the woman that they want to have a
relationship with they emotionally
invested in the woman too soon because
they clearly didn't have access to
certain data points points that would
have impacted their decision to invest
had they been known and guys typically
do this because either the woman is very
very attractive or the man has low
self-esteem and or low optionality could
also be both in this case the man has
put himself behind the eightball he has
already decided that he wants to have a
relationship with a particular woman so
when the problems become manifest he now
feels like he is responsible for solving
her problem problems to get what he

[09:02]
her problem problems to get what he
wants and this is not necessarily the
case this is why it's important for men
to keep a tight r on their emotions
throughout the courtship process you do
not invest in a particular employee
until after you've hired him the same is
true for women do not invest in a
particular woman until after you've
sufficiently vetted her do this and you
won't fall into the trap of
understanding which is a symptom of
emotionally investing in a woman before
it's
