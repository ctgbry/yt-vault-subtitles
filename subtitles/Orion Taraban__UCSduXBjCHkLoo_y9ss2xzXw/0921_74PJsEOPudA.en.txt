The weapon that's been used for the last
15 years, 20 years or so, last
generation, is that all of those
principles of traditional masculinity,
the stoicism, the strength, the
confidence, the power, are toxic, at
least when they come from men, as we
were just discussing out there. Those
things aren't toxic when a woman
manifests them, but they're scary and
intimidating when a manifests them. So,
the idea is to get rid of that so it's
easier for women to compete. It's going
to be very difficult for anyone to beat
these really competent, powerful, high
status men. So, we got to get rid of
them. And we get rid of them slowly over
generations. How do we do that? Well,
there's the falling apart of the nuclear
family. More people are being raised by
single mothers. There's a variety of
reasons for that. Like
90% of kindergarten teachers are female.
Sizable majority of elementary school
teachers are are women. It's like it's
and their children, boys and girls are
being instructed in what masculinity is

being instructed in what masculinity is
by women for the initial part of their
conscious lives. Now, there might not be
anything inherently wrong with that, but
if you ask a woman whether she believes
that the traditional definition of
femininity, which historically was
created by men and imposed upon women,
was absolutely in women's best
interests, I don't think that they would
agree with that. So I don't think that
we can say that when women create
definitions for manhood and masculinity
that it's absolutely in the boys or the
men's best interests. Like there might
be some kind of gendered bias in the
expression of the opposite archetype.
