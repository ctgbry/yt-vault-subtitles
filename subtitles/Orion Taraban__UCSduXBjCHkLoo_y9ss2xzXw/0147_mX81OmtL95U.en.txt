i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
the position of the adored
this is a continuation of my episode on
the balance of attraction so if you're
new to this channel you may want to
start there
in this episode we'll be talking about
the position of the adored which in
romantic relationships is the one who
likes the other
less
now first off i'd like to begin by
saying that the adored often get a bad
rap what do you mean the one that likes
the other less how cold and cruel and
heartless
right
however
the fact of the matter is that the two
positions create each other
liking the other less
creates the opportunity for the adorer
to like the other
more
which is actually where some people
prefer to be
it's kind of like how taking isn't
necessarily selfish because it actually

[01:02]
necessarily selfish because it actually
gives others the opportunity to give
and many people are actually far more
comfortable giving than taking
now obviously this dynamic can be taken
to some pretty unpleasant extremes like
in codependent relationships or
relationships with personality
disordered individuals however the
fundamental truth remains constant even
within so-called mature high functioning
relationships remember the two positions
are actually value neutral and there are
pros and cons to each
the adored get to be loved by the ones
they're with
generally those in this position tend to
have a much more emotionally
equilibrated experience than you those
in the position of the adorer they don't
experience the same highs and lows as
the adorers which makes this position a
better fit for those who prefer not to
live as much in their emotions
it can also be a good fit for those who

[02:00]
it can also be a good fit for those who
for whatever reason are not as
interested in placing romantic
relationships in the center of their
lives
people who are more focused on their
career for instance can't really afford
to be an emotional roller coaster
they can appreciate the partner but
because they aren't
as emotionally preoccupied with the
other they tend to experience a greater
sense of internal freedom within that
relationship
on the other hand being in the position
of the adored
can be somewhat boring
these folks generally don't experience
the feeling of being in love as
intensely they're not with the ones that
they love they're they're loved by the
ones that they're with
which can make them feel like they're
missing out or settling
it can also feel strange to be put on a
pedestal because of the gap between the
other's perception of you
and your own self-knowledge
unless you're narcissistically grandiose
you're kinda aware of your shortcomings
which means that you're gonna kind of

[03:01]
which means that you're gonna kind of
feel like you're participating in
unreality when someone loves you more
than you love yourself
[Music]
figuring out which position feels better
for you
and determining your ideal gap in
subjective attraction requires
experience and accurate self-knowledge
some people prefer the balance of
attraction to be as close to equal as
possible
others prefer rather sizable gaps
just keep in mind that it's often the
case that the very things that attract
you to a person at the beginning are the
same things that drive you crazy in the
end so
choose wisely
