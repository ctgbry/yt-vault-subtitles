All of the women on this channel say,
you know, I shouldn't have to be I
shouldn't have to feel emotionally
unsafe. And you're right. I I want
emotional intimacy. That's one of the
biggest concerns we hear on this
channel, emotional intimacy.
&gt;&gt; And you can buy that. That's I'm sorry
to interrupt, but like that you can get
that from a therapist. And that's why so
many women have long-term relationships
with their therapist.
&gt;&gt; That is female prostitution almost is
therapy in in some fashions.
&gt;&gt; It's validation and understanding. And
women will pay a premium for that.
&gt;&gt; It is. And many many many many married
women that I work with, they say, "I
will not have sex with my husband until
he starts providing emotional intimacy."
That is a transactional way of thinking.
And many of them would be horrified to
even hear that described that way. But
that is a transaction. There is a price
on sex in that relationship. It happens
to be emotional intimacy, which is which
is more tolerable in cash typically, but
that is a transaction. That's exactly
what we're talking about here today. and
the negotiation of that. How much
intimacy is required for this
transaction? That's a negotiation piece

[01:00]
transaction? That's a negotiation piece
and it should be open and explicit.
&gt;&gt; Uh it's tough though cuz it's like the
more explicit the transaction, the more
it feels like prostitution. And that's
something that most people in long-term
relationships want to avoid. They want
to feel like this is an emergent thing
that we're just doing because of our
feelings and the love that we have for
each other. And the more we make it a
explicit quid proquo, the more it feels
like it it they feel like it cheapens
the relationship.
