I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is many
women are construction workers now I
don't mean this literally men still
overwhelmingly dominate the construction
industry as they do all Industries
associated with the critical
infrastructure necessary to maintain
civilization so thank you men I mean
this metaphorically a lot of women are
metaphorical construction workers and
I'll explain what that means in this
episode now this isn't true for all
women it's true for a specific class of
women but I'm calling attention to this
class because these women are
simultaneously very attractive to a lot
of men and also potentially very
dangerous to a lot of men as well let's
get to it to begin with let's imagine
what it might be like to be a
construction worker it shouldn't take
much effort to understand that this is a

[01:00]
much effort to understand that this is a
difficult and demanding job it requires
a good deal of physical strength and
endurance and for that reason it's kind
of a young man's game this is because
those attributes all things being equal
tend to decrease in men as a function of
time and this makes construction a risky
job why because any of those guys are
potentially one injury away from a
forced retirement and if these were
workers don't have any other education
or experience to speak of then they are
going to be particularly vulnerable to
this outcome as they're functionally
working without a safety net it doesn't
take a good deal of perspicacity to
understand that the job will become
harder and riskier as they age which is
why any young man working construction
with an ounce of vision is going to
start looking for a way out shortly
after he's found a way in

[02:00]
after he's found a way in
and for guys who want to remain in the
field this typically means a promotion
to a supervisory or managerial role
something much less physically demanding
and until that
happens the guy is going to be in a
fairly stressful and anxiety-provoking
situation this is not only because he
might not have a backup plan if the
current plan somehow goes sideways but
because he will also age out of the
current plan if he can't secure a
promotion even if nothing else goes
Ary and it's in this sense that some
women are construction workers and which
women are we talking about here the
women who don't really have anything
else going on in their
lives let me explain this type of woman
might have a very low-paying job with no
career prospects to speak of or she
might have no job whatsoever she is
generally not an active participant in a
personally relevant community and she
typically does not have a network of

[03:00]
typically does not have a network of
friends or family to support her she may
not even have any real Hobbies or
interests and finds it difficult to fill
her time with constructive or meaningful
action this all typically means that
she's fairly young as it's hard to
persist in that state indefinitely know
anyone like this now this type of woman
is actually very attractive to a lot of
men because men look at her and think
wow this is great she's not tied up in
her career because she doesn't have one
she's not going to prioritize her
friends over me because she doesn't have
any and she's not going to complicate
our arrangement with a lot of
pre-existing commitments because she
ain't got none fantastic this woman is
going to fit right in my frame she won't
need to accommodate her life to mine
because frankly she doesn't have a life
to speak of I'll provide the structure
and she'll just fit right in and that
certainly can happen however this
situation often comes with a number of

[04:00]
situation often comes with a number of
hidden liabilities in the first place if
a woman does not have a life of her own
then you will become her life and that's
not nearly as attractive as you might
think this is because a woman with no
life of her own is going to put enormous
pressure on the relationship to provide
things that it might be easier and more
appropriate for her to get outside of
the
relationship whether she's conscious of
it or not she will will expect that you
deliver not only what is appropriate for
a romantic partner to provide but what
is appropriate for a career and a friend
group and a community to provide as well
you will need to provide her with all
her meaning and fulfillment and
stimulation which is a very tall order
to say the least Arrangements like these
are unintentionally set up to fail
because no man can be nor should be all
things to a woman now before I go any

[05:01]
things to a woman now before I go any

okay let's get back to it now just like
their counterparts in construction these
women understand that they're playing a
Young Person's game this is because the
attributes that typically motivate a man
to offer a lifestyle structure to her
that is her Youth and physical
attractiveness tend to decrease as a
function of time and this makes her
position risky why because a woman like
this is potentially one breakup away
from living on the street and if a woman

[06:03]
from living on the street and if a woman
doesn't have any other skills or
resources to speak of then she is going
to be
potentially very vulnerable to this
outcome as she is functionally working
without a safety net it doesn't take a
good deal of perspicacity to understand
that her position will become riskier
and more tenuous as she Ages which is
why a young woman like this with an
ounce of vision is going to start
looking for a way out shortly after
she's found a way in and for ladies who
want to remain in the field this
typically means a promotion to a spousal
role something capable of providing her
with a material safety net and until
that happens she's going to be in a
fairly stressful and anxiety-provoking
situation this is not only because she
might not have a backup if the current
plan somehow goes sideways but because
she will also age out of the current
plan if she can't secure a promotion
even if nothing else goes

[07:02]
even if nothing else goes
arai this is why these women push the
hardest and the fastest for marriage in
the absence of their own extrapolated
lifestyle they don't have a safety net
which is why they will demand one from
the men in their lives a woman with
nothing else going on will feel very
anxious and insecure without a ring on
the other hand a woman with her own
skills and resources will be much less
pushy this is because she knows that
even if the relationship were to end
she'd be able to land on her feet
unfortunately the women who tend to
demand the legal commitment are those
who are least in the position to do
so and it's easy to understand why
they're not about to walk away if they
don't get what they want after all a job
without security is better than no job
at all such women monkey Branch to

[08:00]
at all such women monkey Branch to
another man but they certainly won't
make good on their threats without a
compelling
alternative it's also important to
consider that according to the family
lawyers with whom I've spoken the most
acrimonious and litigious divorces
almost always involve
Housewives since these women often did
not develop their own lives or careers
they are generally out for blood when
the relationship that functionally
constituted their existence is brought
to an end
without lives outside of their
relationships these women are both
aggressive in courtship and contentious
in divorce to my mind it's a much better
idea to find a woman for a long-term
relationship who has her own life but
who is willing and able to make the
primary relationship a priority this
allows both parties to be grounded
stable and appropriately
interdependent what do you think does
