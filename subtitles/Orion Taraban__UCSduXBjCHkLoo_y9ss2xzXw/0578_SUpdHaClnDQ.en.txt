by the time you get to 25 years old your
head is full of facts beliefs and
attitudes put there by your parents and
your teachers and your priests and your
government and your media and your
friends and your culture your mind is
literally full of thoughts that are not
your own but that you might identify
with in fact it may not be an
exaggeration to say that at this point
you may not possess a single original
thought many of the thoughts in your
head are wrong like objectively and even
more of them are useless every person
usually around 30 years of age has the
opportunity to start waking up but they
only find themselves in like a hoarder's
house a house full of crap in reality
they've been living in this house for
years but they've only recently become
sufficiently aware of their situation to
consider that their living conditions
might be circumstantial as opposed to
inherent to reality
