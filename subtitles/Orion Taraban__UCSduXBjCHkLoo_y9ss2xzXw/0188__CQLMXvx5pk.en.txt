i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
ignorance
and intelligence
these two concepts actually have very
little to do with one another but
not in the way that most people think
for instance i'm a very intelligent
person
and i'm ignorant about most things
i can't speak arabic
i don't know how to lay concrete i
wouldn't be able to pilot an airplane i
don't know what's going on inside your
head or even completely what's going on
inside of my head to be honest
the vast majority of things in this
world i am completely ignorant of i
don't know them i don't know about them
i don't know how to do them but that
doesn't necessarily mean that i'm dumb
now
ignorance can cause people to act in
unintelligent ways but intelligence is
the capacity to make use of what
knowledge you have
intelligence is pattern recognition it's
creativity it's reason it's problem

[01:02]
creativity it's reason it's problem
solving
it's not the same thing
as knowing something
now why am i bringing this up
because in the course of life
we will often find ourselves in the
place of a student
whether we're starting a new course of
formal study or a new job or entering
into a higher level of mastery with new
things to consider and challenges to
overcome
these are moments when we're more
conscious than usual that there's a lot
that we don't know
and ignorance can feel very close to us
and there is a tendency i've seen in
some people to over extend that
ignorance into their intellectual
capacity
and just because you don't know
something doesn't mean that you're dumb
not knowing is kind of the fundamental
human condition
and in some cases the smartest thing you
can possibly do
is to indirectly acknowledge that
ignorance and ask a question
it's actually very intelligent to put

[02:00]
it's actually very intelligent to put
yourself in the place of a student
relative to someone else who has the
knowledge and the willingness to teach
you
and just because you're their student in
one area doesn't necessarily mean that
they wouldn't be your student in another
so don't take it personally you're
probably just as ignorant as i am
and that doesn't necessarily mean that
you're done
something to keep in mind
what do you think
