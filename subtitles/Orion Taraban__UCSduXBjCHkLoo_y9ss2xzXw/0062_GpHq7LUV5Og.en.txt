i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is the
function of grief
grief if you've experienced it is just
an extremely painful emotion i mean
i don't think it's an exaggeration to
say that it can be excruciating
it's one of the most intensely negative
experiences from a purely hedonic
perspective a human being can pass
through grief can be very challenging
and having passed through grief a number
of different times in my life i had to
question
why does this exist
why is the human heart the human mind
capable of experiencing so much pain
it's like i get it can't it just stop
can't it be over already does it have to
be so painful for so long
it's so difficult to deal with sometimes
and this is something i really had to

[01:00]
and this is something i really had to
examine because i don't like the idea of
suffering pointlessly of suffering
without good reason so there has to be a
reason behind the suffering associated
with grief at the very least a reason
from an evolutionary perspective because
because if grief had no function it
would have been selected out long time
ago
and this is what i was able to come up
with
basically grief has to be painful
it has to be as painful as it is because
its function is to force a person to
stop
it has to be so painful that it causes
life to more or less grind to a halt
anything less painful
would not cause a person to stop
grief forces people to stop so that they
can re-evaluate the structure of their
lives
and make changes in a reality-based way
that accommodate the loss of the loved

[02:00]
that accommodate the loss of the loved
one
what does this mean
we can all understand rationally
intellectually that someone is gone but
if we were to continue to live in such a
way that we still on some level
believed that that person might come
back
that that person
is still in our day-to-day lives
then we could run into some serious
problems further down the road
for instance we might count on a source
of support that wouldn't actually be
there when we really needed it
so the point of grief is to disrupt
habit
the habits that we had created over time
in relation to the lost loved one
its role is to force us to examine these
habits that have been integrated into
the structure of our lives
and to make more intentional conscious
choices moving forward
that way we can develop a new structure
to get our needs met without relying on
the lost loved one anymore
so grief is actually in the service of

[03:02]
so grief is actually in the service of
our survival our long-term survival
though that of course is presuming that
we use grief appropriately that is for
that purpose
if we believe on some level that grief
is just this cruel and sadistic torment
that rubs salt in the wound of the
person left behind
then on some level we're still gonna
suffer
but we're gonna suffer for no good
reason
so this is the possibility
for grief to redeem our lives
i hope this helps
