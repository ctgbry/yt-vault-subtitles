I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is most men
blow the first date
so as a man it is hard to get a date
with a woman you generally either have
to approach a number of women in real
life or swipe through hundreds of
profiles online before finding someone
willing to give you a chance
both are difficult to do and require
different skill sets for Success however
just because you're able to get a date
with a woman that doesn't mean that it's
smooth sailing from there on out
all it means is that you've passed
through the first of many many filters
in the funnel and on a date things can
go wrong in a multitude of different
ways at nearly every moment
fun
and indeed the fact of the matter is
that most men blow the first date and
I'm here to tell you why that is the
case so you can prevent it from
happening in the future okay now when I

[01:00]
happening in the future okay now when I
say that most men blow the first date
you have to understand that on some
level
if you actually succeed in securing it
the first date is yours to lose men it
is yours to lose and what do I mean by
this I mean that if a woman is actually
going to block off her calendar put on
makeup get dressed up leave her house
and go out to see you as opposed to
seeing anyone else in the world when she
could be sitting at home in her
sweatpants watching reality TV it means
that her interest level in you at least
at the time she made the plan is more
than 50 percent
so all other things being equal she's
more of a yes than a no if she actually
shows up on the date and this means that
a lot of guys are snatching defeat from
the jaws of success
like I said If a woman shows up she's
more than 50 percent interested in you
but think about it
how could that possibly be the case

[02:00]
how could that possibly be the case
if you picked her up in real life you
probably just had a few minutes of
actual interaction and if you met on a
dating app it's possible that you've
never actually seen each other or spoken
to each other in real time
if a woman agrees to a date
she can't really be interested in you
because she doesn't really know who you
are
she has very little information on which
to base that decision one way or another
she's not in a position to evaluate who
you are as a person or as a potential
lover
this is something that is really
important to understand she's there on
the date not because she's attracted to
you
but because she's attracted to her idea
of you
basically you presented her with enough
raw material to serve as the basis for
an attraction that she subsequently
elaborated for herself
this means that she filled in the
sizable gaps in her knowledge base with

[03:01]
sizable gaps in her knowledge base with
positive fantasies of what she would
like to encounter there and the higher
her attraction the more positive the
fantasies she elaborates until she's
more or less attracted to the idea of
who she wants you to be or hopes you
could be
okay and that's why she's there
it's this fantasy in her mind that
motivated her to leave her house and
meet up with in many cases a total
stranger so you can appreciate that this
fantasy is a powerful thing
but here's the thing guys
you don't know what that fantasy is
this is really important to appreciate
you don't know what that fantasy is it
exists in the covert recesses of her
private Consciousness so how do men blow
the first date simple
they show up on the first date and they
try to impress the woman
and they generally do this because a
little knowledge is a dangerous thing
they do this because they watch some
YouTube videos about what women want and

[04:00]
YouTube videos about what women want and
they learned about hypergamy and they
think women are attracted to money
status and Power
no problem I'll make sure they know how
much money I have how much status I
enjoy and how much power I yield
basically they just need to know that
I'm a high value man and they'll be
begging for it
now this is not entirely wrong but in
terms of seducing a particular woman it
is mostly wrong especially given the
fact that men tend to go about
demonstrating their value in such
inelegant and ham-fisted ways too many
men think that bragging about their
professional exploits or their lifestyle
for an hour or two will get them laid
and it won't it will generally only get
them angry
now before I go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this video to someone
who might benefit from its message
because it's Word of Mouth referrals
like this that really help to make the

[05:01]
like this that really help to make the
channel grow you can also hit the super
thanks button which those three little
dots in the lower right hand corner and
tip me in proportion to the value you
believe you've received from this video
your support makes all of this happen so
thank you
now the question is if the general
truths about hypergamy are correct why
doesn't this strategy work
it's simple
in the act of trying to impress a woman
you will inevitably reveal more and more
details about who you actually are and
how you actually live
and the likelihood that any of those
details will actually correspond with
the fantasy that any particular woman
has in her mind about who she wants you
to be or hopes you could be
are functionally zero
at this stage of the game your actual
self has a near zero probability of
according with the woman's private
fantasy about who you might be

[06:00]
fantasy about who you might be
and remember it's the fantasy that is
actually motivating her to be there in
order to explore the possibility of some
kind of future together
men
you do not want to disabuse a woman of
her fantasy of who you are too quickly
and every time you open your mouth you
chip away at that fantasy a little bit
more with every word that you say
most men blow the first date because
they spend way too much talking about
themselves my God on a first date the
woman should ideally be doing the vast
majority of the talking as the man all
you really need to do is to provide her
with interesting emotionally compelling
prompts so that she can spend most the
time talking about herself and
experiencing her own emotions
do this and she will not only retain her
original Fantasy of you but she will
also become even more attracted by

[07:00]
also become even more attracted by
associating her felt experience with you
and this is something that you have to
take the lead on men because if you
don't the date will likely devolve into
a job interview where the woman's going
to ask a lot of clothes ended factual
questions because she doesn't really
know what she's doing and walk away
feeling that you were a nice guy but she
didn't really feel anything
the woman should be talking three to
four times as much as you
every once in a while she will ask you a
question
no problem answer it in brief and in
another open-ended question right back
at her
if you do this correctly she's going to
walk away from the encounter feeling
heard
feeling listened to and having
experienced all of these different
emotions inside of herself and that's
going to significantly increase the
chances that she'll want to see you
again
ideally at the end of an hour or two
when it's time to get up to leave she's
going to say wow

[08:01]
going to say wow
the time just flew by but I just talked
about myself the whole time there's
still so much I don't know about you
and it's like good because the longer we
draw this out the more likely that the
woman is going to be willing to stick
around once the fantasy she has of you
is inevitably shattered but if it's
broken too soon it's not going to work
and let me just say this isn't about
tricking women at least not any more
than women's makeup and fashion is about
tricking men
women why don't you show up on a first
date in sweatpants without wearing
makeup
because you don't want to do anything to
disturb the fantasy that the man might
have of you too early in the courtship
process maybe I don't know otherwise
he's probably not going to stick around
long enough to want to cultivate a
relationship with you possibly uh
you can show him later once he's already
hooked right

[09:00]
hooked right
so it's like it works both ways but this
episode is about men and men blow the
first date by talking too much about
themselves in their attempts to impress
the woman
