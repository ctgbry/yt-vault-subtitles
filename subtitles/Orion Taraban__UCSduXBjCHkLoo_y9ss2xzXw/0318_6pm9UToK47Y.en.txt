I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is
inside is overrated
so this might sound strange coming from
a therapist but this is a lesson that I
actually learned during my years as a
psychological intern during that time I
spent two years at an outpatient drug
and alcohol treatment program and it was
within this context that I understood
that insight into a problem that is why
it exists and how it operates
is not actually sufficient or necessary
to solve the problem Insight is in a
word
overrated now before I back this up
please remember to like this video And

now in my time I've worked to some
highly insightful but inveterate
drinkers our program was not their first

[01:01]
drinkers our program was not their first
rodeo many had been to several other
over the course of their lives and when
I sat down with these folks and asked
them why they drank they would tell me
Well my father and my maternal
grandfather were both alcoholics so
there's the genetic component and I grew
up in this dysfunctional family system
where my role was The Golden Child
because of that I had this enormous
pressure put on me to achieve and when I
failed I felt shame so I used alcohol as
a way to numb my shame rather than
process my emotions because I did not
have sufficient modeling for that
behavior I also Now understand that I
had an oral fixation likely because my
mother didn't breastfeed me and I was
using the bottle as a substitute for the
nipple and on and on and on and on about
all kinds of stuff
they also understood why they would
relapse they could do this really
specific in-depth chain analysis like oh
well I saw this commercial about
retirement homes which made me think
about my father who would always have a

[02:00]
about my father who would always have a
beer after work and I suddenly had this
fantasy about how nice would be to have
a cold beer on a hot day and watch a
baseball game and I thought well I
deserve to treat myself to a beer in a
baseball game after all the hard work
I've done and I thought that since I'd
already been sober for three months I
had some control over my drinking so I
decided to go out and have a beer as a
reward and one led to five and five led
to fifty and well you know here I am
these people
knew exactly where their problem came
from
they knew exactly what maintained their
problem
and yet they continued to drink
insight into the origin and the
operation of the problem was
insufficient
and I saw this play out over and over
and over again it was
boggling
on the other hand some guys would come
in and I'd ask them about their drinking
and they'd say
yeah I don't know it just didn't make me
feel good so I decided to stop
that's it
these guys didn't know why they didn't

[03:00]
these guys didn't know why they didn't
know how
but they managed to work toward a
solution and while it's a bit of an
oversimplification I think we can all
agree that not drinking is kind of an
important component to addressing one's
alcoholism
this is generalizable in the absence of
insight you can solve a problem by
changing your behavior you don't have to
even understand why it works and this is
good because spoiler alert no one really
knows anyway
at the end of the day all the Insight in
the world does not translate into an
ounce of action and it's action taking a
different path at the crossroads of Our
Lives that actually solves problems we
don't have to know where the problem
comes from we don't have to know how the
problem operates sometimes we just have
to make a different choice
hopefully that makes sense
what do you think please let me know in
