I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is women's
greatest enemy and I'm talking about
women's greatest enemy in the context of
the sexual Marketplace what is the one
thing that most prevents women from
getting the relationships they want with
the men they want to have them with it's
very simple ladies in a word women's
greatest enemy is pride your greatest
enemy is pride every everything you want
with respect to men is on the other side
of that Pride I alluded to this fact in
my series how to get any man you want
let me tell you ladies Pride is very
cold company it will not keep you warm
at night and in today's episode I'm
going to be discussing three of the main
ways your pride is keeping you single
first and foremost your pride tells you
that you are the prize

[01:00]
that you are the prize
and you are not at least not after you
turn 30 at 30 the average man's sexual
Marketplace value exceeds the average
woman's sexual Marketplace value for the
very first time and that Gap only
increases as time goes on believing that
you are the prize intrinsically and not
just the prize relatively and
temporarily is pride it's this Pride
that motivates you to squander your most
fertile and attractive years the years
in which you would most be able to
secure a committed relationship with a
high value man on either having fun or
prioritizing your career you've
conflated the privileged moment you pass
through with your inherent
self-worth and this is why you think
that there's no hurry once the prize
always the prize this sense of Pride
also stops you from initiating like why

[02:00]
also stops you from initiating like why
would I do that I shouldn't have to make
anything happen for myself that's the
man's job in anyway it will happen when
it happens I have plenty of time okay
just go back in time like 60 years men
didn't pursue women it was women who
pursued men it was women who dragged men
sometimes Kicking and Screaming to The
Altar and they did this because they are
the ones on a tighter timeline for
better or worse women don't have the
same Lu of waiting around as men do back
then everyone understood that if a woman
wanted a relationship she had to get out
there and make it happen and this sense
of urgency has been disrupted by the
twin beliefs I'm the prize and I have
plenty of time generated by Pride the
fact of the matter is that it has never
been easier in the history of the world
for women to get access to the men they
want to have relation relationships with

[03:01]
want to have relation relationships with
with social media you can find the
hottest richest most eligible bachelors
anywhere in the world and slide right
into their DMS and if your picks are
good enough you actually might get a
response that won't be enough to seal
the deal but you can at least get your
foot in the door what you do with that
opportunity is up to you and yet even
with this unprecedented access to high
value men which allows you to SA ly and
freely and instantly connect with almost
anyone on this planet you still don't
initiate and this makes it very
difficult to sympathize with women who
are single and don't want to be like get
off your ass and do something about it
if you're unemployed and don't want to
be make it your job to get a job and if
you're single and don't want to be make
it your job to get a relationship
expecting that the relationship that you
want is just going to fall into your lap
is as arrogant as expecting that your

[04:01]
is as arrogant as expecting that your
dream job is somehow just going to
materialize into your
life okay all right the second way that
pride is obstructing your success is
that it's causing you to disparage male
sexuality a lot of Western women even
seem to find male sexual interest
insulting like men should be
appreciating the beauty of your mind and
the depths of your soul rather than your
physical appearance you think that our
action has little to do with you like
the person inside your body and that in
any case if we just want sex we'd just
be better off hiring a prostitute the
attitude is basically that sex and
physical attraction are beneath you
which is a form of Pride now before I go
any further if you're liking what you're
hearing please consider sending this
episode to someone who might benefit
from its message because it's Word of
Mouth referrals like this that really
help to make the channel grow and if you
like what you're hearing you can also
hit the thanks button and tip me in

[05:01]
hit the thanks button and tip me in
proportion to the value you feel you've
received from this episode I don't do
corporate sponsorships or product
placements so I rely on your support to
make all this happen I really appreciate
it thank you very much now this might
hurt some feelings but ladies you have
to understand that if men did not
experience sexual attraction to you the
vast majority of them would have nothing
to do with you like nothing this is
because men can generally get all their
other needs met more cheaply more easily
and more enjoyably with other men like I
would rather talk about quantum
mechanics and Shakespearean literature
with other men I'd rather problem solve
with and confide in other men I'd rather
hang out with and have fun with other
men like do you see without my sexual
attraction which as a heterosexual man
is primed for feminine traits more
generally I might only rarely have

[06:00]
generally I might only rarely have
dealings with women in the normal course
of events and this is really how humans
have organically organized themselves
across culture and throughout history
men generally spend their time with
other men women generally spend their
time with other women and there's some
social comingling at the end of the day
so rather than see male sexual interest
through the lens of your pride as
something beneath you ladies you can see
it as an opportunity to gain access to a
particular man who may not yet have
another reason for dealing with you I
get that you want to be seen for who you
are deep down inside but spoiler alert
we can't [ __ ] see who you are deep
down inside what we see is your body and
if we didn't see that we probably
wouldn't be making the effort to see
anything else what's more we can hear
what comes out of your mouth now I can
appreciate that unwanted sexual interest
is awkward and uncomfortable I get that
however if the first thing that comes

[07:01]
however if the first thing that comes
out of your mouth in response to my
attraction is criticism judgment and
shame I don't think I really want to
know who you are deep down inside what's
just on the inside is distasteful
enough and the third thing that gets in
women's way in the sense of their pride
is their contempt for anything related
to
Domesticity cooking cleaning child care
just hire a maid just hire an ananny you
think that this is low value degrading
work work that in any case would prevent
you from fulfilling what is apparently
your true calling in life being an
employee the same women who insist that
they could never ever be obedient to a
man spend the majority of their lives
being obedient to their often male
employers they trade a family for a
paycheck this is the pride that cuts off
the nose to SP F the face ladies you

[08:01]
the nose to SP F the face ladies you
need to closely examine what is actually
so distasteful to you about domestic
activities I recently watched a podcast
episode in which an attractive young
woman was asked whether she would ever
do her man's laundry and she like
literally shuddered with revulsion it
was like the question triggered some
repressed trauma and this woman was
transported back to the handmaid's taale
where a simple Act of service was the
gateway to patriarchal oppression it's
not it's laundry
which thanks to modern technology is
literally the easiest of all the
household chores to complete you're not
down at the river bank with a washboard
scrubbing out the stains with a lie you
rendered yourself from pig fat you're
moving the clothes from the hamper to
the washer and pushing a button laundry
is not your enemy it's your idea of
laundry that is and this goes for most
of the other domestic activities as I
mentioned in the first episode of this
series the key to getting the

[09:00]
series the key to getting the
relationship you want with the man you
want to have it with is to be useful and
in order to be useful you have to allow
yourself to be
used your pride will wrankle at that but
that's a fact the good news is that as
long as you
exercise good discernment you will be
rewarded for being used it's just like a
job because you allow other people to
use your time time and skills and
expertise you are compensated with money
if you didn't allow people to use you
you don't get paid right the same is
true for relationships if you want a
high value relationship you must allow
yourselves to be used and to be used in
the way that those who are paying I.E
the men you want to have a relationship
with want to use you and keep in mind
that if something's not useful it's it's

[10:00]
that if something's not useful it's it's
decoration so ladies if you don't want
to be useful then you damn well better
be decorative and the fact of the matter
is that most of you are not attractive
enough to be decorative and that you
might not like it even if you were why
because what do decorations
do nothing they sit nice and quiet up on
a shelf where they belong attesting to
the reflected stat the man who bought
them so if you want a relationship with
a man who isn't that isn't primarily
decorative then you have to allow
yourselves to be used by him if not then
you are
useless and the world will pass you by
the things that make a man's life easier
and better are not beneath you they are
your ticket in so those are the three
ways that pride is standing in your way
ladies resolve these issues and you can
have the relationships that you want

[11:01]
have the relationships that you want
with the men you want to have them with
