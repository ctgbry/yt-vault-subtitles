I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is in a good
relationship the transaction is
invisible so the fundamental thesis of
my forthcoming book the value of others
is that relationships are the media in
which value is transacted where no value
is transacted no relationship exists nor
can a relationship exist on the other
hand the mere transaction of value is
both necessary and sufficient to have a
relationship now the idea that all
voluntary relationships are at heart
transactional can rub people the wrong
way sometimes it rubs people the wrong
way due to a deficit of insight or
self-awareness however it can also rub
people the wrong way because this
position kind of runs counter to their
felt experience like these people are in
relationships that they don't experience
as transactional they don't think of

[01:00]
as transactional they don't think of
their relationships in this sense and
they certainly don't feel like it fits
with respect to their particular
case however like so many other things
just because we can't see the
transaction doesn't mean it's not there
assuming sufficient Insight the reason
why people might not see the transaction
at the heart of their relationships is
because their relationships are working
you see in a good relationship ship the
transaction is invisible it's only when
the relationship becomes unsatisfying or
dysfunctional that most people can catch
a glimpse of that transaction allow me
to
explain like many people I'm in a
transactional relationship with a power
company in exchange for money they
deliver electricity into my house a
while back I set up automatic payments
to this company which functionally means
that I can go months without even
thinking about this utility when I flip

[02:00]
thinking about this utility when I flip
a switch the lights come on and when
they push a button they receive their
payment with respect to our own
transacted Goods everything is
effortless and mutually beneficial even
though both of us are functionally
pursuing our own self-interest in a
strictly regulated contractual
relationship so long as we are both
getting what we want the transaction is
invisible and I'm going to be satisfied
with this relationship in inverse
proportion to how much I notice the
transaction that serves as the basis of
our
relationship because when am I going to
notice this transaction not when things
are going well when things are going
well the transaction is invisible I'm
going to notice the transaction when
things are going badly let me tell you
when I experience a power a power outage
I am very aware of the transactional
nature of our relationship I'm thinking
I'm paying x amount every month as a
utility fee irrespective of my my
kilowatt hours and I subsidized their

[03:01]
kilowatt hours and I subsidized their
infrastructure with my tax money this is
an outrage they had one [ __ ] job and
they couldn't even do that etc etc etc
by the same token if I ever were to stop
paying my utility bill the transactional
nature of our relationship would become
highly visible to the Energy company
they would undertake increasingly
aggressive efforts to recoup their loss
and if they couldn't they would
ultimately shut my power off and I don't
think any person would consider these
responses to be somehow
unreasonable now the same thing holds
true for our romantic relationships when
we feel like we're getting a good trade
that is when we're getting at least as
much as we're getting then the
transactional element is completely
invisible to us we're not thinking about
it we're not talking about it and we
don't feel that it even exists we just
kind of think I'm in this relationship
because I love this person the
transactional nature of the relationship
only becomes visible and apparent when
things start to go wrong trust me if you

[04:02]
things start to go wrong trust me if you
start to give more and get less you're
going to become increasingly cognizant
of that Dynamic over time and of course
that would only be a problem if
relationships were
transactional now before I go any
further if you're liking what you're
hearing please consider sending this
episode to someone who might benefit
from its message because it's Word of
Mouth referrals like this that really
helped to make the channel grow I'm also
proud to announce that my book the value
of others is now available for pre-sale

content for my free newsletter every
week so if you'd like to sign up you can
do so on my website finally please fill
out an inquiry form on my website if
you're interested in booking a paid
consultation links to everything in the
description let's get back to
it if relationships weren't
transactional and they just ran on love
or Vibes or whatever then it shouldn't
matter whether you were getting a raw
deal

[05:00]
deal
the transaction should remain just as
invisible when things are going poorly
as when things are going well but that
is decidedly not what happens people
start to think things like you know I'm
doing a lot more of the housework around
here or I really think we should be
having more sex than we do and what
these comments and countless others
effectively communicate is I'm noticing
that I'm giving more value than I'm
getting in return and that perceived
unfairness is reducing my ability to
enthusiastically remain in this
relationship it's just like me paying
for electricity that isn't being
delivered when people feel like they're
not getting enough of what they want
given their investment in the
relationship in terms of time energy
money commitment Etc then the
transaction becomes visible and when
they are getting enough of what they
want given their investment in the
relationship or the perceived unfairness
is adequately addressed then the the
transaction once again Fades into

[06:02]
transaction once again Fades into
invisibility that doesn't mean that it's
not there it just means that it doesn't
require attention and it doesn't require
attention because it's
working what makes relationships so
challenging is not that they are
transactional in fact if we were
collectively more accepting and explicit
about this reality we would all probably
have an easier time with things what
makes relationships so challenging is
that the Goods being transacted are
typically not explicitly negotiated and
acknowledged and are subject to all
kinds of change and fluctuation over
time my relationship with my power
company is easy because we're both
consciously exchanging one thing for one
thing electricity for money and that
holds true over time now imagine you're
exchanging many things of fluctuating
value outside of both parties conscious
awareness

[07:00]
awareness
the fact that some people find a way to
do this indefinitely is nothing short of
miraculous however one of their secrets
might be in how these people count like
how people calculate how much they give
and how much they get is subject to all
kinds of squirl this is because in
general people overvalue what they give
and undervalue what they get which is
obviously a serious problem if Rel
relationships are essentially
transactional so if you're going for
longevity it's kind of a good idea to
consciously correct these biases that is
slightly undervalue what you give and
slightly overvalue what you get what's
more it's also a good idea not to count
too
precisely the closer you measure the
value of what you give and get the more
transactional your relationship is going
to feel and remember the awareness of
transaction is generally characteristic

[08:00]
transaction is generally characteristic
of bad relationships so bringing that
awareness into your relationship is
probably going to diminish subjective
Satisfaction by
association so punctilious and
overzealous measurement is not a good
idea on the other hand people in
relationships that Go the Distance kind
of take a fuzzy look at the numbers and
the transaction of value they don't look
too closely at the economic exchange
this doesn't necessarily mean that these
folks are turning a die to dysfunctional
or exploitative Dynamics it just kind of
means that they're okay with the
exchange residing in a rather broad
confidence interval that they are
willing to make allowances for exchange
fluctuations Over time however even
Within These relationship strategies if
your partner started to do much less and
you continued on as usual or even
started doing much more to pick up the
slack then this will tend to create
dissatisfaction conflict and resentment

[09:00]
dissatisfaction conflict and resentment
over time and this kind of wouldn't be
possible unless relationships were
transactional whether we like it or not
our feelings are tied to the perception
of value in a very deep and very
powerful way which is a theme that I
explore in much greater detail in my
forthcoming book so stay tuned what do
