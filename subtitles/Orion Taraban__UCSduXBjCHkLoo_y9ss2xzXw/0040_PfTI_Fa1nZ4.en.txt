i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
safe smart brave strong
many of you might not know this but in
my spare time i'm an avid outdoorsman i
do a lot of long distance backpacking
and mountain climbing and i often do
these trips solo which can increase the
inherent risk factor of these activities
somewhat
now i've been doing this for a very long
time now and i've developed this
personal motto or mantra
which is the title of this episode save
smart brave strong
and this is basically how i approach
moving into the wilderness independently
and i want to explain what this means
because i think that it can be
generalizable to a lot of other aspects
of our lives
basically there's an order to this
progression safe smart brave strong
because
if you're safe
you don't really have to be smart
i mean think about it think about those

[01:00]
i mean think about it think about those
birds that lived on isolated islands in
the pacific for hundreds or thousands of
years without any natural predators
when humans first showed up they could
just walk up to these birds bunk them on
the head and throw them in their ships
they were so safe for so long that they
completely lost all forms of caution and
cleverness and this was obviously to
their detriment on some level we see
this in western society today thousands
and thousands of people die every year
from an abundance of safety
that is there often doesn't seem to be
any immediate negative consequences to
making certain bad decisions
so for example
they eat or drink themselves to death or
die in ways that would have been
preventable with just a little prudence
quite the paradox that too much safety
can be dangerous but that's how it is
now if you're not safe
and moving into the wilderness is an

[02:00]
and moving into the wilderness is an
inherently risky venture if you're not
safe
you have to be smart
being smart
using your intelligence and good
judgment can help you to avoid a lot of
unjustified dangers and ultimately it's
much much better to prevent a disastrous
situation than to try to survive it
now that said
sometimes you're not always going to be
smart
sometimes you're going to zig when you
should as add
and if you're not safe and you haven't
made smart decisions
then you're going to have to be brave
you'll need to muster courage in order
to face the danger forthrightly and pass
through the difficult moment without
succumbing to fear or despair do you
understand it's better to avoid the
avoidable danger but if you can't
because of your decisions you have to be
brave
however
if you aren't safe
you weren't smart and you couldn't be
brave because you're afraid
then you have to be strong

[03:01]
then you have to be strong
it's the only option left
being strong means metaphorically that
you hold on as tightly as you can that
you put all of your will into your hand
and you refuse to let go no matter what
that's what being strong means it means
being able to endure to persevere to
survive no matter what
you make your will into iron and you
refuse to surrender
it's not a very pleasant place to live
and you don't want to stay there any
longer than you need to
but that's really our last option
if we aren't safe we weren't smart and
we couldn't be brave
now i bring this up because you'll
notice you don't lead with strength
strength is what you need when smartness
and bravery fail
so it's a good idea to develop your
strength of course no one has ever
wanted to be weaker but it's a much
better idea to develop your intelligence
your cleverness and discernment and your

[04:01]
your cleverness and discernment and your
courage and bravery because if you
develop those virtues sufficiently you
don't have to be as strong you don't
have to be in survival mode all the time
just enduring life and you get to have a
lot more fun to boot
so that's all i have to say on the
matter if you'd like to suggest a topic
