there's some theories that there's many
different kinds of narcissism and the
narcissism that's present in the DSM we
could call like the grandiose type so
this is generally the guy who's the
Conqueror of the world who thinks he's
sh doesn't stink he deserves Universal
Fame and all the women that he wants and
all this this kind of over-the-top um
Emperor mindset right um and that
definitely seems to be gendered more
towards men than towards women but that
in my experience isn't the only form of
narcissism for example one of the
characteristics of this kind of grandote
narcissism is that you're the exception
to every rule but in a positive sense
what's interesting is I've seen many
times in my clinical practice we could
say like an inverted form of that
narcissism which is the person is an
exception to every rule in the negative
sense I will never be loved I will never
be happy I'm so hopeless that no
intervention not even God himself could
help me it's like it's still this
grandiose exception to every rule it's
just valenced in a negative self-hating
direct Direction it's very strange
