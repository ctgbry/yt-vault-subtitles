in the interpersonal Effectiveness
module of DBT Marshall linahan talks
about the three possible goals of any
human interaction ideally we achieve all
three of these goals however like any
ideal this is actually extremely rare in
any case even if we do achieve all three
we typically can't achieve all three
equally which suggests that we have to
prioritize these goals in our dealings
with others as with many things
pertaining to mental health flexibility
is key if people just prioritize one of
the goals all of the time irrespective
of the goal this tends to lead to
suboptimal outcomes so what are the
three goals they are objective
Effectiveness which is getting what you
want relationship Effectiveness which is
making sure that the other person feels
good about you at the end of the
interaction and self-respect
Effectiveness which is making sure that
you feel good about yourself at the end
of the interaction again ideally people
get all three people feel good about
giving us what we want and we feel good
about getting it however in reality this
is not always the case
