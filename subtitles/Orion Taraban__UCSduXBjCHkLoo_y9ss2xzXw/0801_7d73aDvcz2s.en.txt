an idea that needs to be expunged from
the female Consciousness is that men
want a challenge this is not correct the
idea here is that if a woman is too easy
that is if she gives the man what he
wants without playing games with her
interest and her availability and her
sexual desire if she doesn't withhold
her affection and respect until the guy
has jumped through a number of Hoops
then that man is going to take her for
granted and exploit her as a sexual
opportunity and otherwise not consider
her to be a viable long-term partner now
like most ideas that have permeated the
general Consciousness there is some
truth to this however so we don't get
confused I'm going to ask you the
listener to create two different
compartments in your mind a Chase and a
challenge a Chase is not necessarily a
challenge and a challenge is not
necessarily a Chase men don't want a
challenge but they do want a Chase and
it's women's conflation of these two
ideas that sometimes leads to their lack
of success
