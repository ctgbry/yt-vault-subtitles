I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the two body problem
now this episode will be a continuation
of my previous episode entitled women
have more options in the sexual
Marketplace which is in turn a
continuation of an even earlier episode
entitled what is the sexual Marketplace
so be sure to start with these before
listening to this talk
in the women have more options in the
sexual Marketplace episode I argued that
women now have two good options down at
the dock they can either enlist as a
passenger or they can build their own
ships whereas men only still have one
they need to build the boat I ended that
episode by alluding to the fact that
this new optionality for women both
solved some problems and creates new
ones this episode will be about one of
the biggest of these newly created
problems it's called the two body
problem now before I explain what this

now what is the two body problem the two
body problem is the name given to a type
of relationship problem that is not
uncommon in graduate programs let's say
you're foolish enough to try to earn a
PhD
because it's such an intense and
isolating experience if you're single
going into the program it's often the
case that you'll end up entering into a
relationship with another grad student
in your program happens all the time now
after many years of sacrifice and
struggle let's assume the two
individuals succeed in graduating with
their doctorates and are now entering
the job market for academic positions
given the scarcity of Supply relative to

[02:01]
given the scarcity of Supply relative to
demand and the insane competitiveness
for what Supply does exist
what do you think the odds are of both
of these lovebirds receiving
appointments at the same University
functionally zero
hell their offers might not even be
within a thousand miles of each other
so why is this a problem because it
forces the individuals in question to
choose between their careers and their
relationship
and what's the likelihood that either
one of them is going to walk away from
an opportunity they devoted the last 10
years of their lives to creating
this isn't walking away from a job
it's walking away from a decade of
deferred gratification bought with Blood
Sweat and Tears do you see
in this case neither one is likely to be
willing to walk away for the other when
she worked just as hard as he did and

[03:01]
she worked just as hard as he did and
vice versa
so what does this have to do with the
sexual Marketplace
do you know how long it takes to become
a good captain
to build a boat
learn to sail and plot a course
it can take decades
the more time you invest in the process
of becoming a captain the less likely
you will ever be to abandon that process
for another person's preference
that's just the way it is
and this means that if a woman chooses
to be her own Captain if she Parks her
ship at the dock like all the other
captains she'll be competing for the
attention of the male passengers not the
male captains the men who have devoted
Decades of their lives to building their
own boats will never walk away from
their vessels to be the passenger on a
woman's boat just because she learned
how to sail

[04:01]
how to sail
the female captains will therefore need
to content themselves with attracting
the attention of men who for whatever
reason didn't succeed in becoming
captains themselves
their preferences may not be among their
available options and this is why a lot
of successful women today complain that
there's just no good men out there yeah
the captains are presumably just as
interested in getting on their ship as
successful women are interested in
getting on theirs the two-body problem
and the proposed solutions to this
problem are always some weird compromise
like well why don't the captains take
turns piloting the same ship or why
don't they just sail in their own ships
separately to the same destination
neither of which you ever see
implemented in any kind of paid
Enterprise
because they are inefficient and
ineffective they also serve to make the

[05:00]
ineffective they also serve to make the
captains slightly less Captain e which
is not really why a person goes through
the trouble of becoming one
so here's the two body problem created
by women's increased optionality in the
sexual Marketplace when the rubber meets
the road
who is going to give up their command
the more you invest in your captainship
the harder it becomes to walk away what
