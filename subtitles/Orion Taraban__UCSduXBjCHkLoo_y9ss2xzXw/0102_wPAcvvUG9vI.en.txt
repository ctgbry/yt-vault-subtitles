i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
simple
isn't easy
now every once in a while in the course
of my clinical practice i get a little
pushback from clients who bulk at the
apparent simplicity
of some of my proposed solutions for
instance
in order to stop drinking you need to
stop drinking
or in order to stop procrastinating you
have to
stop
procrastinating and all right fair
enough this is obvious it's even
tautological
but that doesn't mean it isn't true
i mean abstaining from alcohol
is the necessary and sufficient
condition to stop drinking
if you do that and nothing else you will
have succeeded
if you do everything else except that
you will have failed
so what does this mean
it means that the actual thing that
needs to change for a lot of people is

[01:00]
needs to change for a lot of people is
often very very simple
most the time people even know what they
need to do to do it
so what's the problem
the issue is that people are subject to
constructing a host of complexity as a
defense mechanism
that firmly embeds the problematic
behavior in their lives
so a lot of the work that i do as a
therapist is to slowly and
systematically work to dismantle the
unnecessary complexity that holds
maladaptive behaviors in place
for instance
when you speak with an alcoholic there's
always a reason why he just can't stop
drinking
when ultimately that's exactly what
he will have to do if and when he's
ready to move forward with that decision
there's always a reason why a person
will stop procrastinating
tomorrow
and those reasons which are often the
product of distorted thinking
are what defend the problematic behavior

[02:00]
are what defend the problematic behavior
from intervention
so part of the work is to
collaboratively discuss the truth and
utility of some of these beliefs
now simple doesn't mean easy
if simple meant easy then you'd already
be doing it
simplicity is a skill
and it's a sign of mastery
leading artists and scientists are
distinguished by their ability to
express complex ideas in a simple and
straightforward manner none of us starts
there
however it's a destination we can arrive
to
with training guidance and repetition
so the work here is to move in the
direction of greater simplicity by
shedding the unnecessary complexity that
may be making our lives harder than they
really need to be
