the vast majority of relationships don't
go the distance why is that
well one reason is that everybody is
more or less on their best behavior for
at least the first six months or to put
it more cynically everyone can kind of
hide who they really are for at least
the first six months but usually at
around this time you begin to see more
of the reality the situation you begin
to see more of who people actually are
and once the
preponderance of evidence becomes
undeniable couples face what I call the
crisis of disillusionment when they are
forced to confront the reality that
their romantic projections obscured from
them if you'd like to learn more about
this concept please see my recent
episode why most relationships don't
last thank you
