i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
it's not your fault but it is your
responsibility
this is something that i'm taking from
marsha lenahan's dialectical behavior
therapy
it's one of the core paradoxes at the
heart of her treatment modality and i
think it's something that's really
important to keep in mind when
approaching mental health treatment in
general
look
a lot of the issues with which adults
struggle in the present have their
origins in the distant past
they were put into motion by events that
transpired in their childhoods within
their families of origin
children in general are not fully
conscious agents
this means that they tend to respond
unconsciously to their environments in a
way that at least in their own mind
is best suited to cope with their
situations
children don't sit down and consciously
decide for example to be people-pleasers
or counter-dependent or disorganized

[01:03]
or counter-dependent or disorganized
these attitudes represent solutions to
environmental problems that represent
the child's best thinking at that time
and these solutions persist through time
because they are at least somewhat
functional remember most of the word
dysfunction
is the word function which means that
the solution mostly works it just may no
longer work in a different time and a
different place
so how the child developed in response
the difficult circumstances of its past
is not the child's fault
that said
we are no longer children
and however we decide to respond to
reality now
irrespective of what happened to us in
the past is our responsibility
and i'd like to emphasize the literal
meaning of this word responsibility
response ability the ability to respond
i cannot change the wounding in your
heart

[02:00]
heart
your parents cannot change the wounding
in your heart your partner cannot change
the wounding in your heart
only you can because only you can access
it
only you can feel it and touch it and
change it only you have the ability to
respond to its wounding in either
effective or ineffective ways which
means that you are responsible
responsible for that wounding
and on some level this is fair
because if you do heal that wounding
only you will benefit from it
i don't feel better if you heal
your parents don't feel better if you
heal your partner doesn't feel better if
you heal
you will feel better more secure more at
peace more content if you heal with
responsibility comes commensurate reward
so in conclusion the things that happen
to you are not your fault
but they are your responsibility to

[03:00]
but they are your responsibility to
address on a go forward basis
and assuming that responsibility
makes you eligible to receive the
commensurate reward
