I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is when
women hedge so this is a conversation
that I've had with many young women in
both a personal and professional context
over the years basically when I talk
with women in their 20s the question
often arises as to why they choose to
focus on their education and
professional development in the decade
that all other things being equal
their sexual Marketplace value is at
their Peak and they would be most able
to secure the most favorable terms with
the most attractive men for a long-term
relationship why do they choose to
prioritize the one set of goals over the
other and the response that I almost
always get from these women is something
like well the career is kind of a hedge
Orion in the first place I can't just
sit and wait for a rich man to snatch me
up things cost money and if no one else
is buying I need pay for myself but even

[01:02]
is buying I need pay for myself but even
if I were snatched up by a rich man I
wouldn't ever want to be in a situation
where I am financially dependent on my
husband as this would leave me in a
vulnerable and Powerless State what
happens if the relationship goes
sideways say I NAB a guy at 22 but I
don't go to school I don't enter the
workforce I don't build a career and
then at 40 he leaves me for his
secretary like where does that leave me
so I've decided to prioritize my career
as a hedge against this possible
outcome now I've tried to report this
honestly to give the steel man argument
in support of this decision and now I'm
going to share the response I typically
give to this line of reasoning first
I'll concede that there is some grain of
Truth to what these women are talking
about like Virginia wolf noted a century
ago that in order to write one must have
money and A Room of One's Own Henrik

[02:02]
ibson in a doll's house clearly
Illustrated that financial means are
necessary for any kind of Independence
or autonomy whether you're a man or a
woman this is true to have power and
control over your own life from a
practical standpoint you need money this
means that women either have to control
their own money or they have to control
someone else who controls the money he
or she who pays the piper calls the tune
right and if you don't have the cash you
better learn to like the
music so as a man as a captain I
understand this perspective like it
would be really hard for me to be
dependent on somebody else and I would
never want to put myself in a position
where I would have to go along with
something that I didn't like or didn't
agree with just because I didn't have
the means to make it on my own that's
why I've prioritized what I have in my
own own life so I can't chide women for

[03:02]
own own life so I can't chide women for
doing the same this strategy really
works for me because I'm not a very
agreeable person and I like to have
things my way and this is because over
and above my personal preference which
everyone has when things go my way
things tend to work in any event I chose
the captain's way and this path
functionally requires a good deal of
resources to
walk but here's the real issue with this
line of reasoning the bet that these
young women are
making is not really a hedge they may
think it is but in point of fact it's
actually the primary bet in reality they
are using marriage as a hedge against
their careers not the other way around
and just to be clear the issue is not
that women are doing this as I said I
have no problem with women doing this I
did it myself the issue is that women
often don't understand they're doing

[04:00]
often don't understand they're doing
this which can lead to a host of issues
further down the road let me
explain in the first place it's
important to understand that most women
don't have careers because most people
don't have careers most women have jobs
which for most folks is a 40-hour a week
commitment careers on the other hand can
easily consume 70 to 80 hours a week of
your life they typically demand that you
work longer and harder than jobs do and
even when you're not working you're
working you're thinking about work
complaining about work recovering from
work strategizing about work etc
etc now the more people the more time
people devote to their careers the less
time they devote to getting and
maintaining relationships this is
because the time's got to come out of
somewhere and there are only so many
good hours in a week when women give the
Lion Share of those good hours to their

[05:00]
Lion Share of those good hours to their
employers they don't have much left over
for dating as a result it's not uncommon
for young career oriented women to go on
like two three dates a month do you see
where this is
going if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description at 2 hours a day date this

[06:00]
description at 2 hours a day date this
is 4 to 6 hours a month devoted to
dating compared to 160 hours a month
devoted to a job and 320 hours a month
devoted to a career so if you do the
math the woman with a job is spending 32
times the amount of time energy and
money on her job than on dating and the
woman with a career is spending a
whopping 64 times the amount of time and
energy and money on her career than on
dating ladies when one bet is 64 times
larger than the other it's not your
hedge that's your primary bet the Hedge
is the small bet you're making to offset
a catastrophic downside this means that
if we're being honest women aren't
investing in their careers in order to
hedge against a husband leaving them in
midlife without any skills or experience
for that to be the case her career would

[07:00]
for that to be the case her career would
need to be the smaller bet what it means
is that women are treating marriage as a
hedge against no longer wanting to work
they're hedging their relationships to
save them from the downsides of a career
not the other way around this is
important for both men and women to
understand again if this is actually a
woman's intention there's nothing wrong
with it but many women don't understand
that this is actually what they're doing
when they devote their 20s to their
career it's not rocket surgery in
general when what people invest much
more time energy and attention into is
much more likely to succeed than what
they invest much less time energy and
attention into and this is why we all
have to be careful and intentional about
what we're investing with our time
energy and attention we are much more
likely to get it this means that if you
want marriage in a family you cannot

[08:02]
want marriage in a family you cannot
reasonably expect to get those things if
you only give that goal
one% of the time energy and attention
you give to your professional
development only extremely attractive
women can get away with that and most
women are not extremely attractive by
definition and since most women are
making career their primary bet it's
important for them to clearly understand
understand what they win if that bet
pays off namely the ability to work for
the next 50
years
hooray and this is very strange to men
to be honest because very few men want
to win that prize but they Place their
bets here nonetheless because they don't
really have a choice there is no Hedge
for a man women on the other hand have a
choice so it's boggling to many men that
this is where they're choosing to put

[09:00]
this is where they're choosing to put
their money in any case using marriage
as a hedge against a career isn't
actually a good idea why well imagine
working and struggling and competing for
20 years only to be rewarded with the
prospect of 30 more years of work and
struggle and
competition people don't have the
stamina at 40 that they had at 20 the
intern might think it would be so cool
to be involed involved in certain
meetings the corporate officer might do
anything in her power to avoid those
meetings when you're young and broke
money is more valuable than time when
you're old and Wealthy time is much more
valuable than money etc
etc now if a woman at 40 decides to cash
in her hedge that is if she decides to
marry out of her career she's gonna find
herself behind the eightball she gets
the worst of Both Worlds at 40 is not
going to be an attractive option in the

[10:01]
going to be an attractive option in the
sexual Marketplace and she will find it
hard to beat out her intrasexual
competition for the most attractive men
and if she does leave the professional
Arena she's going to seriously damage
her lifetime earnings as she's going to
stop working precisely when she's likely
just starting to really rake it
in like most things if you're going to
go go all the way it's okay to have plan
B's and C's little Hedges along the way
but be sure that you're giving the thing
you really want the majority of your
time energy and
attention what do you think does this
