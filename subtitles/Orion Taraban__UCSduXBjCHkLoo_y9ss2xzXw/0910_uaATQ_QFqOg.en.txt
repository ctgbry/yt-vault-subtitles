I think that the reason why women tend
to fall in love with toxic men has to do
with the fundamental feminine romantic
fantasy, which I think is Beauty and the
Beast, where it's like most people
misinterpret that fairy tale and they
think that Belle, the girl, can see like
past the beastly exterior and she loves
him despite being an animal. No, no, she
loves him because he's an animal. And
this gives her an opportunity to like
get to conquer on some level. Conquering
the beast is the female equivalent of
just like sexual conquest in men. And so
there's this sort of emotional challenge
that is very attractive to a lot of
women and they think I can fix him
through my patience, through my love,
through my loyalty. I can show him that
not all women are like this and that
there's more to life. And at the end,
the fantasy of course is he transforms
into the prince, the love worked, and
they can live happily ever after. Of

they can live happily ever after. Of
course, if Belle fell in love with the
beast, what the [ __ ] is she going to do
with the gentleman? Like, how long is
that attraction going to last? Right?
Women seem to want a bad boy who's good
to them, and men seem to want a good
girl who's only bad with them.
Yeah.
