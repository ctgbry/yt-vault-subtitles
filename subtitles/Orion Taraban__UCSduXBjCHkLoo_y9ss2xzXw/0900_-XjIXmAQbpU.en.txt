The women that genuinely want a good
relationship will put attraction first,
then worry about what he offers her and
what he's going to do for her. But the
attraction has to come from her end
first. Sugaring means what does he do
for me first and foremost. How much does
he obsess over me and I don't even care
if I'm attracted to him. So she'll have
an ex that might be an Indian man, a
Chinese man, a crypto guy. There'll be a
range of exes and there's no consistency
in what they look like, only in their
finances. And that's when you know she's
sugaring because there's no actual type
of what she goes for. Whereas women that
want a traditional household don't
compromise on attraction. They just
still want to love the guy, but the guy
should do a lot for her. That's the I
would say the key difference. Yeah. I
think that that's just the way that
people are. It's like there's plenty of
folks who do jobs for companies and they
don't believe in the mission. They don't
believe in the real purpose of the
service or the good. They're doing it
for money. That's true. It's like we
enter into relationships of all kinds in
order to derive benefit. Mhm. And I do
think that there is this way that we can
use love or you're actually saying
attraction which I think is probably

[01:00]
attraction which I think is probably
more accurate to kind of cover over that
because if we remove that we see each
other and ourselves in a really stark
light where our needs and desires are
laid bare and that's not actually very
virtuous. It's not very enabling. It's
not very attractive. And so we as a
culture and as individuals, we like to
cover that over with a patina of romance
and love and attraction and feelings.
But I think if the fundamental value
exchange isn't present, then in the vast
majority of cases, those romantic covers
that we use to obscure that aren't
sufficient to keep the relationship
alive. So we need a bit of that.
Absolutely. Yeah. line to I agree.
