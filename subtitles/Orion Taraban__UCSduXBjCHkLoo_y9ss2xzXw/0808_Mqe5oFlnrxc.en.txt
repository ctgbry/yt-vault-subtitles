I think everyone is has the right to
have his or her own like deal breakers
the things they just really can't stand
or the things that get under their skin
and they don't want to have in their
relationships it can be useful for
people to examine where that distaste
comes from that doesn't necessarily mean
you have to force yourself to live with
it some things are going to be more
charming and quirky other things are
going to be gross and distasteful and on
some level the practice of love is to
accept the other person for who he or
she is and to hope that they also give
you the same Grace as well in return you
certainly don't show up to a
relationship hoping to be changed by the
other person to be more in lined with
who they would like you to be but people
go to relationships all the time
consciously or not to change their
partner sometimes we can say that it's
well-intentioned like I can see the
potential in you right you can be so
much better than you currently are but
on some level that's kind of a
disrespect to the individual as he or
she is and another person might not see
anything wrong with that behavior or
that trait it really is a subjective
thing
