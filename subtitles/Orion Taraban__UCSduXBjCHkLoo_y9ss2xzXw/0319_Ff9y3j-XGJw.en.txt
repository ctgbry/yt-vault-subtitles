well the main reason for this is dating
has gone online
a lot of women don't really appreciate
how anxiety provoking it is for most men
to go up to a strange woman that he's
attracted to and strike up a
conversation with the objective of
picking her up
it's not easy
I'm not saying that you women are
intimidating I've approached hundreds
and hundreds of women in my time and not
not a single one of them has ever been
rude or aggressive
in fact even if they tell me no they
tend to be flattered by the attention
but a lot of guys they they get in their
heads they which leads to hesitation
paralysis
it's very difficult for the average guy
to approach a woman when they can just
swipe anonymously there is absolutely no
threat of rejection online and that's
why men don't approach women anymore
