I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
have a fulfilling life so this is
something that many people are looking
for and I don't blame them a fulfilling
life is a supremely good thing today I'm
going to tell you how to go about doing
just this first off you have to
understand that if you want to have a
fulfilling life you a specific
individual you will need to create it
for yourself inhabiting a lifestyle is
kind of like buying clothes if you buy
them off the rack the best you can hope
for is like an 85% fit and that's the
best possible outcome and generally
requires a lot of shopping around if you
want more than an 85% fit you will need
to have those clothes custom tailored by
the same token if you're looking for a
fulfilling life you will need to Custom
Tailor it to your own
specifications just like you in Abit a

[01:00]
specifications just like you in Abit a
unique and individual body that is not
quite like any other body on the planet
you are a unique and individual person
who is not quite like any other person
on the planet so we'll need to roll up
our sleeves and get to work so what does
that work entail to have a fulfilling
life you really need two things you need
vision and you need want you need both
and it's the union of these two things
that allow for the actualization of a
lifestyle that will be fulfilling to you
personally let's get into this first
let's talk about Vision vision is
Imagination plus granularity it's the
ability to imagine at a fine resolution
of detail the best metaphor I have for
vision is an architect's blueprint once
a blueprint has been completed in some
respect the structure has already been
built All That Remains is to erect it a

[02:00]
built All That Remains is to erect it a
completed blueprint has attended to
every detail of the structure down to
the size of the screws in the hinges in
the basement this is the level of
resolution necessary for the task now

episode this helps to keep the channel
going I really appreciate your
support now with respect to creating a
vision for a fulfilling life rather than
imagine all the things you want to have
accomplished or achieved in say the next
five years a much better idea is to
imagine in excruciating detail how you
would like to be spending an average
Tuesday 5 years from now and that's
because no matter how EXC exciting or

[03:00]
because no matter how EXC exciting or
exotic your life may be you will have
far more average Tuesdays than Peak
experiences so you want to create a life
in which most of your days are
fulfilling not a life in which once in a
blue moon you experience some degree of
satisfaction as a result of a
significant achievement so imagine with
some measure of granularity an average
Tuesday in your life 5 years from now
where do you wake up when do you wake up
who do you wake up next to how do you
spend your morning your afternoon your
evening how do you feel who do you
interact with what do you have to look
forward to try to really dial in what
that looks like so that you can reverse
engineer from the intended
destination now vision is good but
Vision Without want is a trap some folks
are very intellectual and have
powerfully extrapolated imaginations and
these people can get lost in their own

[04:00]
these people can get lost in their own
Visions they endend up endlessly
creating these fantastically complicated
intricate systems of living that never
get built so we have to understand that
while the structure is in some sense
completed in the blueprint you can't
actually live in a blueprint you can
only live in the erected structure so at
a certain point we all have to stop
planning and start acting an action
requires some degree of want which is is
like a combination of desire and will I
don't love the word want but it's the
best I've come up with desire is to
associated with pleasure and emotion
will is too disembodied and intellectual
however their combination the union of
embodied and disembodied agency is a
Dynamo and I'm calling that want it's a
strong sustainable emotionally
compelling
drive without which nothing really ever

[05:00]
drive without which nothing really ever
gets done want is connected with the
life force whose primary expression is
the sex drive which is why one of the
best ways men can increase their want is
to stop
masturbating this way the sex drive can
be increasingly sublimated toward
constructive action in the real
world now want is good but want without
vision is also a trap some folks have a
powerful want and a great deal of agency
for action
but without Vision these people can fall
into recklessness impulsivity and
short-term gratification people with a
high degree of want and no vision are
like dogs who spend all day chasing cars
they run after one until another goes
off in another Direction and they turn
around and chase after that one instead
dogs like this can chase cars all day
and never leave the block similarly
people with high want and low vision
often don't get very far in life and
they end up squandering a very valuable

[06:02]
they end up squandering a very valuable
resource so to have a fulfilling life
you need to have Vision which is the
completed blueprint and you need to have
want which is the drive to actualize
that Vision in reality if you develop
both of those capacities and you
harmonize them with Prudence you will be
able to create a fulfilling life for
yourself I guarantee it and one final
thought it may sound strange but people
are actually happiest when they are in
the process of becoming not when they
actually become so if your vision has a
Terminus that can actually be attained
you might be somewhat disappointed when
you actually arrive the blueprint for a
fulfilling life is kind of like the
schematic for the Westchester Mystery
House which was always under
construction as long as its owner was
alive a wise Vision will always provide
you with something to do not just
something for you to have done this is
because it is the process of sublimating
your want

[07:00]
your want
in the service of your vision that most
people experience as extremely
fulfilling what do you think does this
