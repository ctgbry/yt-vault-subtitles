so this book seems like it's intended to
help both sides oh yeah win on some
level a game that can be won once and
for all is bad game can you imagine if
like one day men won or one day women
won it's like that would the game would
be it gets boring well not get boring no
one could play anymore like once
somebody wins the game is over no one
can ever win once and for all because we
want the game to go on for as long as
possible infinite game we want an
infinite game and that game will
continue to evolve and the rules will
change some of the laws will basically
stay the same but we want a game that
can't be won and also on some level a
game that is hard to lose because we
want the players to kind of engage with
the game as long as possible especially
because this game the game of Ming and
dating is connected to life and the
perpetuation of our species like we we
don't want any side to win we want the
game Life to go on for as long as
possible it seems like the game is
pretty broken right now yeah but again
that's also the opportunity right right
every crisis is an opportunity right
