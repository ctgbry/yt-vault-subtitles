I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is talk
about people behind their backs
so this is probably the opposite advice
that you've heard from other people in
fact on the surface it even seems to
contradict some of the advice I myself
have given in previous episodes namely
that one way to be impeccable with your
word is never to say anything behind
someone's back that you wouldn't be
willing to say to that person's face and
I stand by that that is generally a good
approach to dealing with gossip and
interpersonal relationships however
today I'll be talking about an advanced
tactic
if you're not ready for it just stick to
the previous orientation it will serve
you well but if you're ready for the
next level there is a way in which you
absolutely should talk about people
behind their backs and this is
especially true when talking about

[01:00]
especially true when talking about
people you used to have relationships
with exes old roommates former business
partners in all these cases
you should talk
positively about people behind their
backs
let me explain in the first place you
should never complain about anyone you
were previously in a relationship with
outside of a very small trusted circle
of confidence there are a number of
reasons for this one of those reasons is
that those complaints no matter how
Justified or true they may be generally
find their way back to the ears of the
people they refer to and now you have an
interpersonal conflict by proxy and
that's going to make your life more
difficult than it needs to be
another one of the reasons why you
should never complain about someone you
used to have a relationship with is
you [ __ ] chose them that's your
ex-girlfriend that's your former

[02:02]
ex-girlfriend that's your former
business partner that's your old
roommate you're the one who entered into
the relationship with them of your free
and spontaneous will by complaining
about people used to have relationships
with you're basically advertising I am a
bad judge of character
I don't know how to vet women
I am easily exploited
none of which are judgments that you
really want to have associated with you
in the minds of others so don't
Telegraph your mistakes
and three it tends to make you look
unhinged
if you start talking about how your ex
was a narcissist or your business
partners were corrupt
Etc
even if it's true
you're going to look like you still
haven't gotten over it
you think you're talking about other
people but in that moment you're really
just spouting unmitigated negativity
which is not a good look and it's

[03:01]
which is not a good look and it's
unlikely to win you any support anyway
so this is why I generally say it's not
a good idea to talk about people behind
their backs now before I go any further

but we're here today for the advanced
tactic this is the one instance when you
are allowed to say things about people
behind their backs that you wouldn't
necessarily say to their faces namely
when you say good things about these
people this is an advanced strategy
because well
it's really hard for people to say nice
things about people that used to have
relationships with sometimes especially

[04:01]
relationships with sometimes especially
when they are still feeling anger or
resentment or disappointment
now to do this we don't ever want to lie
if you can't do this honestly and
authentically stick to the general
orientation however in the vast majority
of cases you should be able to identify
at least one thing that you appreciated
about that person or that you enjoyed
about that relationship
great focus on that one thing and if
you're ever asked about that person or
that relationship this is what you can
discuss my ex
best thing about her was that she had
dinner on the table waiting for me every
night when I came home from work I loved
that I haven't heard from her in a while
we decided to take different paths
through life hope she's doing well
now the path that she may have taken
could have been narcissistic sociopathy
but do we really need to talk about that
all these years later
talking positively about people behind

[05:02]
talking positively about people behind
their backs especially if there was some
kind of falling out between the two of
you does a number of things
like the complaints the positive words
tend to find a way back to the ears of
those they refer to and hearing the
positivity is going to put them in a
strange place
learning that someone used to have a
relationship with and you had a falling
out with is talking [ __ ] about you
behind your back kind of confirms your
belief about them and your perception of
the relationship however if the gossip
is positive
it creates a dissonance inside of people
like
my ex said that
really that is
not what I expected it causes people to
kind of doubt their own perception and
memory and to create an opportunity for
them to form a new conceptualization of
you in their minds but here's the real
reason

[06:00]
reason
if someone were to ask me about my ex
and I gave them a positive review and a
month later the same person asks my ex
about me
and my ex has the bad judgment to
complain about me which most people do
now she's going to look unhinged
even of her complaints about me were
completely valid
the other person is going to respond
with something like huh well that's
really interesting you know I talked to
Orion last month and he had nothing but
positive things to say about your time
together huh
this will cause the other person to
doubt the legitimacy
of that person's complaints because they
now seem to be so unilaterally negative
and therefore divorced from reality they
seem unhinged and unbalanced whereas you
seem reasonable and self-controlled
who seems more trustworthy
now this tactic is not a silver bullet

[07:01]
now this tactic is not a silver bullet
it's not going to change someone's
deep-seated impression of you but it can
move the needle in a positive direction
and it's absolutely free PR it costs you
nothing to say positive things about
people used to be in relationships with
and there's no real downside to doing so
with a lot of potential upside this is
what makes it an advanced and effective
interpersonal strategy give it a shot
