I made an episode about this a long time
ago, which is that winners almost always
quit. The idea that winners never quit
is probably incorrect. And it speaks to
that kind of mental monologue that you
were describing just a few minutes ago.
The fact of the matter is is that
mastery is very, very difficult to
achieve. And so anybody who actually
succeeds in arriving there must have
quit pretty much everything else in
their lives in order to devote
themselves single focused on this one
endeavor. Right? So you actually have to
quit pretty much everything else in
order to arrive at some degree of
mastery. Now I think that once you have
some success, you have some money, you
have built a business or you develop
some sort of fame, it's almost like you
have a kitty that you can gamble with.
And so it's possible now to take bigger
risks without necessarily compromising
the fundamentals of your lifestyle or
your survival. And so that's why I think
it's necessary for people to just get
some sort of like stability in their
lives and then they can think about the
next thing. They can think about the
thing that's connected to let's say more

thing that's connected to let's say more
personal fulfillment or their passion,
whatever that means, as opposed to going
after that right out of the gate. That
might be poor advice for a lot of folks,
especially young folks. There's a Jason
Pogan quote where he says, "Actcept that
all of your heroes are full of your
heroes aren't gods. They're just regular
people who probably got good at one
thing by sacrificing literally
everything else.
