on the whole Japanese women are slender
and physically fit feminine and demure
friendly and courteous and respectful
and appreciative not all Japanese women
I'm sure but the vast majority of them
as far as I could tell when I spoke with
them the feeling I got was that they
felt lucky to be interacting with me
which is a total reversal of the
attitude you generally encounter in the
west I've gone on a lot of dates in my
day and the prevailing Vibes were either
a that I should feel that the woman was
allowing me to buy her a drink or B that
the woman needed to make sure I could
give her what she wanted by conducting
the date like a job interview there's a
lot of entitlement and narcissism here
it's all about her on the other hand my
sense is that in Japan women feel
grateful for the opportunity to be there
considered as a potential partner it was
extremely refreshing to say the least
