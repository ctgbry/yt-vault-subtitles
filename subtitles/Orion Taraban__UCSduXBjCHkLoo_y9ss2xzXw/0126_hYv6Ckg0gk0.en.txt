i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is the
empty canoe
this is a metaphor that i'm borrowing
from zen master charlotte joko beck who
i believe wrote about this in her book
everyday zen
which is just full of straightforward
brass tax wisdom i must have read that
book over 20 years ago and the metaphor
has stayed with me through the present
day
the story goes something like this
imagine that you were in a canoe
paddling along on a serene lake on a
particularly foggy day you can barely
see five feet in front of you
suddenly another canoe emerges out of
the fog on a collision course with yours
you don't have time to respond and the
second canoe knocks into yours almost
spilling you into the lake
once you recover from the initial shock
you react with anger shouting at the
other paddler hey watch where you're
going what are you doing are you trying

[01:01]
going what are you doing are you trying
to kill us both what's wrong with you
however
once the canoe drifts a little closer
through the fog
you realize to your surprise
that there's no one in it
it's an empty canoe
drifting mysteriously through the fog
and just like that
your anger vanishes
there's no point in remaining angry at
an inanimate object
it's wasted energy and it generally
shuts off fairly quickly at that point
regardless of your intentions which is
to say that it's actually kind of hard
to stay angry and it didn't matter at an
inanimate object even if you wanted to
and that's because the imputation of
agency is actually a core component of
the experience of anger in human beings
remove the imputation of agency
and the anger disappears
i like to remember this metaphor
of the empty canoe when dealing with
frustrating people in my everyday life

[02:01]
frustrating people in my everyday life
in these moments it's sometimes helpful
for me to think of these people as
inanimate objects drifting through the
fog
they don't really mean it they're just
particles coraming through an
indifferent universe
they might speak and move and act that's
objective reality but any agency that i
experience in them
is actually my own projected psychology
it may or may not be true
and it may or may not be serving me in
that moment so i don't need to remain
attached to that interpretation of
reality
and when i drop the imputation of agency
the anger vanishes almost instantly a
profound lesson from zen
if the world is empty
why fill it with the ingredients of our
own frustration
