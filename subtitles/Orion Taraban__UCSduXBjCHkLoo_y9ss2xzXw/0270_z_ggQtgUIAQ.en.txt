in my episode all mental illnesses are
compromises Marcelo Enrique Almeida asks
how does this relate to anxiety
it definitely holds true with respect to
anxiety disorders because like name some
anxiety Source social phobia the fear of
being judged by other people or
agoraphobia the fear of being in open
places or let's say specific phobia the
fear of pickles or Bridges or things
like that all of those are fears
associated with something that's
actually not in the vast majority of
cases inherently threatening and that
behind the scenes there is a more
existential fear of death
and what the person is doing is avoiding
the actual reality in which death is an
inevitability and putting the fear and
anxiety into something that is actually
fairly innocuous because it's some way
easier to navigate and manage does that
make sense
