i'm dr orion taraband and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to get people to like you more
there is a very simple trick to get
people to like you more it takes three
seconds to explain what it is but be
sure to watch through the end of the
episode if you want to know why it works
the trick to making someone like you
more
is asking them to do things for you
told you it was simple
and why does this work the leading
hypothesis is basically that the
increase in attraction that results from
asking people to do things for you is a
byproduct of their attempts to eliminate
the cognitive dissonance created by this
situation
and what does that mean
look
people don't go around doing favors for
other people
so if you ask a favor of someone and
they do it they kind of have a problem
it's like within their own consciousness

[01:00]
it's like within their own consciousness
they understand that they typically do
not go out of their way for other people
and yet
they're apparently going out of their
way
for you
hmm
and why might that be
well the most common way of resolving
that cognitive dissonance is to decide
that they're going out of their way for
you
well
because they
like you because
you must be a special person to them
yeah that must be it that's why i'm
going out of my way for this person and
doing things i wouldn't ordinarily do
for other people i must really like them
so to increase attraction you should ask
other people to do things for you on the
other hand to increase attraction you
should not
do things for other people
especially
unasked four things
when you do things for other people
you make them feel special
within their frame of reference they

[02:00]
within their frame of reference they
think oh
the reason why this person is giving me
gifts are going out of their way which
they don't do for other people
is because
i'm a special person
and as a special person i deserve
gifts or people going out of their way
for me
if you do things for others they might
think oh you're such a sweetheart
or
you're such a nice guy
so if that's what you're going for great
but
they're definitely not going to feel
more attracted to you as a result
back to asking people to do things for
you these don't have to be big requests
it could be hey could you bring a bottle
of wine to dinner or hey could you send
me your notes from yesterday's biology
class or hey could you pick me up a loaf
of bread on your way home from work
the requests don't have to be big in
fact it's better if they're not
but if the other people comply the

[03:00]
but if the other people comply the
upshot is that they will come to like
you more
whether they like it or not
that's the hack
try it out for yourself and let me know
how it goes
