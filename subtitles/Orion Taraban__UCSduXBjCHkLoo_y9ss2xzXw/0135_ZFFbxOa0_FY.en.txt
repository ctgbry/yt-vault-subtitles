i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
the truth about romance obstruction
so this is the third part in my series
of episodes on this subject remember as
i discussed in my episode the origin of
romance romantic love is really the
transliterated dogma of a religious cult
that exists in the south of france in
the 11th and 12th centuries that was
secularized to avoid persecution by the
catholic church
this is why we see in the experience of
romantic love so many vestiges of
religiosity
in this episode i'm going to talk about
another truth of romance which is the
fact that romance thrives on obstruction
and if no obstruction exists in a
romantic relationship
one or both of the partners will create
one consciously or not in order to
stimulate the romantic imagination think
about romeo and juliet

[01:01]
about romeo and juliet
do you think it was just oh
a strange coincidence that the capulets
and montagues hated each other
and that it was just bad luck that romeo
would have been killed if he were found
in the capulet's garden
can you imagine what the story of romeo
and juliet would have been like if lady
capulet had come to juliet and said hey
you know what about that nice romeo boy
who lives next door what a gentleman we
just adore his parents and we think it
would be adorable if you two got
together
there actually is just such a character
in that story paris that the capulets
approve of as a match for their daughter
and juliet is like oh god mom that guy
no thank you
so it's not an accident
that romeo and juliet came from warring
families because whether the lovers were
conscious of this or not that danger
that prohibition that obstruction
fueled their desire for each other their

[02:01]
fueled their desire for each other their
story could not exist without it
we also see this in play in the
prototypical romantic myth the tragedy
of tristan any soldier that i would
highly recommend that you look into
obstruction is the fuel of romantic fire
and this is why there's often a lot of
passion and romance in long distance
relationships
and extramarital affairs
there's something about the fact that a
we shouldn't be doing this
and b
there's something preventing us from
truly being together
that fans the flames of desire
most likely this is due to the
unconscious desire to reduce dissonance
it's dissonant to do something that we
shouldn't be doing
so our unconscious mind reduces that
uncomfortable dissonance by making us
believe that the fact that we're doing
what we shouldn't
must mean that we really want what we're
doing
this is important to keep in mind

[03:00]
this is important to keep in mind
because sometimes our feelings are
actually more of a response to some of
these obstructions and prohibitions than
a reflection of our actual authentic
desire for the other person something to
consider
what do you think does this square with
