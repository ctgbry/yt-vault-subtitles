I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how women
make it difficult to love them so this
one is for the ladies ladies I'm here to
help you if you are not interested in
having more love in your life then this
is not the episode for you you can
kindly move on but for those of you who
are still listening I'm going to teach
you how you can get more love in your
life it's actually very simple it will
cost you nothing and you can start today
with what you already have sound good as
I often do I'm going to begin by first
extrapolating an analogy with the
professional world and then
demonstrating how that mirrors what
occurs in a romantic relationship why
because people are generally so much
more rational in understanding when it
comes to business and the fact of the
matter is that what tends to work in one
tends to work in the other in any case

[01:00]
tends to work in the other in any case
Cas in this scenario let's pretend that
you're running a business as a result
I'll assume that you'd be interested in
making more money more sales for your
product more clients for your service to
that end as the business owner you will
need to ensure that it's easy for your
customers to part with their money like
if you're selling a product you don't
want there to be more than three clicks
involved in that funnel
it's like add to cart fill in my little
credit card security code and buy now
boom that's it the more streamlined and
intuitive you make that process the more
money is going to come your way it's not
a good idea to put obstacles between
your customers and your accounts
receivable I mean how do you feel when
companies make this process difficult
it's like buy
please what

[02:00]
please what
I have to make an account first uh okay
guess but they're asking for my credit
card now oh so they're going to auto
bill me later gez okay fine I'll just
make a reminder to cancel the membership
before it renews all right what now they
need to verify my identity so I have to
upload an ID Jesus okay H I think I have
a pick on my phone somewhere oh it has
to be scanned no pictures accepted okay
[ __ ] this [ __ ] it it's not it anymore
and you're going to go find a comparable
good that you can acquire without all
this
rigoll now
imagine if this same company then looked
at its balance sheets and then blamed
its customers for its
Revenue well if they really liked our
products then they would have found a
way to make it work if they wanted to
they would and since they didn't I guess
they didn't really want to so next I
mean how difficult is it to a driver's

[03:00]
mean how difficult is it to a driver's
license you'd think we'd make some kind
of unreasonable request here but how
else are we supposed to verify someone's
identity so they can make an account to
buy a membership to have access to our
products G
customers like can you imagine can you
imagine mistaking your complex business
funnel for your customer's lack of
Interest I'll say that one again can you
imagine mistaking your complex business
funnel for your customer's lack of
Interest
that would be wild wouldn't it
paradoxically the only business that
could possibly get away with something
like this is the one that is so in
demand that is it perceives such high
interest in its customers that it
actually needs to create obstacles to
slow down the transaction process so
that it isn't overwhelmed and most
businesses ain't got that problem do you
understand as I discussed at length in
another episode a bad business blames
its customers if you want things do not

[04:02]
its customers if you want things do not
make it difficult for people to give you
said things because that would be
stupid now before I go any further if
you're liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this episode to someone
who might benefit from its message

channel grow I'm also proud to announce
that I'll soon be publishing my book the

let's get back to it now the same
principle applies to relationships
ladies let's say that instead of money
you want to receive more love in your
life just like a successful business you
need to work to make the point of
transaction streamlined and intuitive a
lot of you ladies create these really

[05:00]
lot of you ladies create these really
complex and elaborate funnels that make
it harder and harder for you to receive
the love that you say that you want and
just like the business with the
complicated sales funnel that is
ultimately to your detriment for
instance I have heard women say that
they felt unloved when a man didn't read
a book she recommended or when he didn't
notice her new manicure or when he
didn't want to watch a show with her or
when he wouldn't listen to her problems
without offering Solutions or or when he
didn't let her pick the side of the bed
in the hotel room or when he took her to
a place he once took his ex-girlfriend
or when he infantilized her by doing
things for her or when he abandoned her
by not doing things for her or etc etc
etc these frustrations and
disappointments reveal a complex
evolving and often unconscious system of
requirements a woman is subject to
imposing on her relationships for
instance if we were to work backwards it
would suggest that an order for this

[06:00]
would suggest that an order for this
woman to feel loved which presumably is
something that she wants she needs a man
to read her book recommendations notice
her manicure watch her shows listen to
her problems without offering Solutions
let her pick her side of the bed take
her only to places he has never taken
anyone else do certain things for her
not do certain other things for her and
be able to know the difference between
those two categories all this does is
unnecessarily complicate her love funnel
which will absolutely result in her
receiving less love not more and if she
were to go one further and blame the man
for his inability or unwillingness to
navigate this
complexity then she is going to have a
tough time out there a business that
operated like that would not have a very
bright
future and I don't think anyone else is
telling women this like there are so
many things in popular psychology that
seem to validate and support this kind
of complexity like take love languages

[07:00]
of complexity like take love languages
the construct of Love Languages
fortifies the idea that complexity is
not only normal but should be
accommodated it is the emotional
equivalent of a business saying that it
only accepts Albanian Lex and American
Express now businesses can do whatever
they want but functionally insisting
that its customers change their currency
or open a new line of credit just to do
business with them will absolutely
result in less Revenue not more on the
other hand a business that is interested
in making money will go out of its way
to accept an Ever growing diversity of
payments cash credit personal checks
cryptocurrency [ __ ] bartering like
bring me a basket of apples and we're
good all of the things being equal that
business is going to make more money
because it has made it easier for its
customers to part with that
money and we all kind of already knew
that love languages were [ __ ] anyway
if for no other reason that they are so

[08:01]
if for no other reason that they are so
inconsistently applied like the same
woman who insists on certain forms of
Love payment from her husband is not
going to insist on those forms of Love
payment from her children like while I
appreciate the crayon drawing of me
sweetie you should understand that
mommy's more of an ax of service kind of
girl moving forward like a good mother
makes it easy for her children to love
her and sees the value of that love in
their
intentions not in her prefer
a good woman does the same for her
man ladies if you've created a situation
in your minds that require people to do
certain things in order for you to feel
certain ways you've really made it that
much more difficult for anyone to love
you and that's obviously not to your
benefit it's a better idea to simplify
the process by which you receive love
and to increase the forms in which you
accept Love Don't don't make it

[09:00]
accept Love Don't don't make it
difficult for people to give you what
you want and you will get more of it
