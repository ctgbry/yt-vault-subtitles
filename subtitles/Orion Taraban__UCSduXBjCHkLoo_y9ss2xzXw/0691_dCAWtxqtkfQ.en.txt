today I'm going to talk about a strategy
that I have personally found to be very
useful for dating in the Modern Age
without losing my sanity it's called
Walking The Razor's Edge to succeed in
today's dating environment it's helpful
to have no conceptualization of the past
and no conceptualization of the future
but to abide as completely as possible
in the present moment this is very
difficult to do people go on dates and
use dating apps and put themselves out
there because they want things they want
sex they want a meaningful connection
they want a committed relationship and
these wants justify the risk and expense
of dating however the more these General
wants are projected onto the specific
person or circumstance they're dealing
with the harder it will be for people to
satisfy their desires this is because
people generally don't respond well to
feeling like they have to live up to
other people's expectations especially
when those other people are more or less
random strangers
