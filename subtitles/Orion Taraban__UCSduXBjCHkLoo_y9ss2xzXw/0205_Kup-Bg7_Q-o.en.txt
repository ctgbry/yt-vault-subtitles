hi everybody so today i'm going to be
answering a question posted by valerie
palkavik
on my recent video how to love without
emotional attachment and valerie asks
what constitutes good milk it's kind of
the crux of the matter unfortunately i
can't get any more specific than that or
else the
analogy the metaphor is ruined why is
that because it's
the cat who decides
what milk is good if i tell you that
good milk is having a lot of money or
having sex very frequently with your
partner or always supporting their
agenda or challenging them appropriately
you'd take that and it would work in
some cases and not work in other cases
the fact of the matter is is that each
cat has idiosyncratic tastes and so your
job is to sort of experiment and observe
put out milk and watch how the cat
behaves the cat will teach you what it
believes is good milk
