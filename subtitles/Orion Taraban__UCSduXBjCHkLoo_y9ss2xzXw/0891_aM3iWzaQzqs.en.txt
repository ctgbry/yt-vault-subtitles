What are your thoughts on the saying
right person wrong time in terms of what
we were saying about a guy not being
ready to settle down when he's young and
kind of waiting until more the mid-30s

sufficiently attractive people will do
that obviously or they'll do both at the
same time. But I think what they're
basically saying is that I know this is
an attractive package. This is a good
product. I just don't need it. I just
don't need it right now. You probably
get that. I mean, what when do you

that from uh Mark Manson who basically
says if it's not a yes, it's a
