Modern women exchange their sexual
opportunity outside of marriage and they
often proudly discuss their low body
counts. They do this because they
believe that their low number means that
they're not prostitutes like some out
there. But that's kind of like a
murderer denying he's a serial killer
because he's only killed like five or
six times. You want a serial killer? Go
talk to Stalin or Mao. I'm practically a
law-abiding citizen in comparison. And
that of course is absurd. I doubt the
police would be convinced. You're either
a murderer because you killed someone or
you're not. And it would be strange and
potentially infuriating to talk to
someone who has killed repeatedly, but
who rejects the appropriate label. All

people who get married are virgins. And

people who get married are virgins. And
that percentage includes both men and
women. And as I discussed in my episode,
Body Count, even the absence of
penetrative intercourse does not
guarantee purity or inexperience. So I
would argue that fewer than 1 in 100
women can consider themselves ladies
under the old definition in the sense
that they have refuse to transact sexual
experiences outside of that level of
commitment. This means the lady is
functionally extinct.
She does not exist anymore.
