i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is the very worst question you can ask
yourself and i talk about this with my
clients all the time
it's a very innocuous seeming question
and it is
what do i feel like doing today
now the question what do i feel like
doing today seems very harmless on the
surface but in my opinion is one of the
most
dangerous questions a person can ask him
or herself and the reason for that
is that if you're like me
in the vast majority of human beings
you're likely
in any given moment going to prefer
the comfortable the easy
the convenient the painless
option among your
your currently available menu of
alternatives

[01:01]
alternatives
uh it seems like human beings were just
sort of biologically
programmed in that way and you know it's
nice to feel pleasure it's nice to be
comfortable from time to time
but nothing worth having in life
is ever gotten through taking the easy
convenient comfortable path
and if we leave our day
to be decided by our emotions
our days are mostly going to be tending
in the direction of the comfortable
easing the convenient which is generally
to the detriment of our long-term plans
so rather than ask ourselves what do i
feel like doing
we plan at least
one day in advance which means that we
plan tomorrow today
now you don't have to plan it down to
the minute but you should know more or
less
where you need to be when and what are
the tasks that you've decided that you
want to accomplish

[02:00]
want to accomplish
for that day before it happens
so that when the time shows up and you
show up into tomorrow
you can just you can just show up you
already know what you're there to do
you can just you can just go through it
and pass through that moment and do what
has already been decided
treat that activity planning as if
it's a decision that is ironclad like it
came from something
other than yourself um
and then you just have to show up and
look pretty as i say you get to
enjoy the experience and pass through
the experience and
as a result of that you've accomplished
things at the end of the day
you've either made money or you've
worked on writing that book
or you've done the gardening that you've
been putting off or you've called that
person that you've been
sort of avoiding for a while it's like
at the end of the day
you can see i did this this this and
this not because i
felt like doing it but because it had
already been decided

[03:00]
already been decided
that today was the day that i was going
to do x y and z
and in this way you can begin to more
intentionally shape
the course and direction of your life
so that you can meet
really impressive and meaningful
long-term personal goals so we'll
definitely talk more about this in

i'll see you next time
