The first thing that's important to
understand is that disrespect is
typically a process. It happens
gradually over time. The best predictor
of overt disrespect is covert
disrespect, which are small behaviors
that have plausible deniability. So, if
you don't want to have a larger problem
on your hands further down the road,
it's important to address disrespect
while it is still in its smaller forms.
The clearest examples of the process of
disrespect are seen in high schools and
prisons. A bully doesn't usually go
straight to shaking down his target.
That's actually pretty risky. If he
doesn't know who he's dealing with, he
could always pick the wrong guy to mess
with, and that's going to make his life
more difficult and complicated than he
intended. So, what these folks tend to
do is they kind of test their victim. A
classic example is bumping into their
target as they're crossing paths in a
hallway and seeing how he responds. This
is a subtle test because there's some
plausible deniability here. Like, oh

plausible deniability here. Like, oh
well, maybe this person just wasn't
looking where he was going. It happens.
Sometimes people jostle into each other.
However, if the bully bumps into the
target and the target says, "Excuse me,"
that person is now pegged as a target
for escalation. On the other hand, if
the target were to respond appropriately
and cast a warning glance at the bully
or issue a verbal warning, that bully
could always play it off. Whoa, hey man,
chill out. What got you so worked up?
But he would probably think twice about
escalating the situation.
