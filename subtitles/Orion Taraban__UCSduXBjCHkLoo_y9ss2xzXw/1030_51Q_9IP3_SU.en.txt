No one, man or woman, is going to be
universally liked. Anonymously interview
every person anyone has ever dated, and
I guarantee there's going to be some bad
reports. And this is why an app like Te
is fundamentally flawed. It cannot
possibly show a man in a positive light.
It can't. Even if the reports are mostly
positive, a negative review will likely
be more impactful. It will both precede
any potential interaction a man might
have with a woman and follow him for the
rest of his life. A man with only
positive reviews is not possible. Why?
Because a woman who reports that there
is absolutely nothing bad about a man
she did not end up with
selfinccriminates.
If she dumped him, it potentially
incriminates her as foolish or
delusional for rejecting a perfectly
fine man. or if he dumped her, it
potentially incriminates her as being

[01:00]
potentially incriminates her as being
too damaged or unattractive to maintain
his commitment. And very few women are
going to stand up and declare that they
fumbled a perfectly good thing all on
their own. Women can and routinely do
throw men under the bus to save face
with their friends and family who
generally do not challenge their
interpretation of events. This creates
an echo chamber that reifies their
official narratives in a positive
feedback loop. The best a man could
possibly hope for in this case is to not
be featured on the app at all, which
could also be tantamount to a negative
review as it suggests that literally no
woman has wanted to date him. Women want
what other women want, which in this
case means that women want men that
other women want but can't have. And we
can presume these women to comprise a
sizable portion of the reviewers of any
desirable man. Paradoxically, the only
men who could have only positive reviews
are the men that women don't want. And
these men would have no women to review

these men would have no women to review
them.
