even though virtue can't provide the
things that most people most want it is
still very useful to cultivate virtue
for two important reasons in the first
place virtue is important to cultivate
because even though it can't reliably
get you worldly Goods it can help you to
keep them if you're fortunate enough to
find yourself rich in worldly Goods
loving relationships successful
businesses positive reputation then you
will need virtue to keep these worldly
Goods in your life if you don't have
some virtue already you're going to
it up because you won't be able to
handle your good fortune with prudence
and dignity for many people the absolute
worst thing that could possibly happen
to them is to suddenly become rich and
famous suddenly becoming rich and famous
without virtue to temper the experience
is more dangerous than heroin and people
die from this experience all the time
