Misery is unsustainable. Which is why
I've said that sometimes things have to
get worse before they get better. So
people avoid the present moment because
generally speaking, the present moment

It's so boring. Like the Buddhists
figured this out a long time ago. Remove
judgment and expectation and

pleasant or unpleasant. It just is what
it is. And there is nothing we can do
about that. There's nothing to do about
that. Empty sensuous experience doesn't

case, simply perceiving sensual reality
is experienced by most people as
extremely boring, which is one of the
most aversive states that humans can
experience.
