there's something called sublimation
have you heard this term before I have
but I don't know it I think it comes
also from psychoanalysis and it's the
idea that certain impulses inside of us
are real they're powerful and yet
they're socially unacceptable the libido
the desire for sex is never going to go
away because it's connected to the life
force itself through sex new life gets
created if the libido were actually
domesticated it would be very bad for
Humanity that's why sex is always kind
of like this wild west this untamable
Wilderness that exists even the in the
heart of the most repressive societies
on the planet like it cannot be tamed
and we shouldn't try to tame it too much
right so that said we can't give free
reign to our sexual impulses all the
time life would be chaos right so what
folks generally learn to do is to
Channel or sublimate that sexual energy
into other pro-social activities or
behaviors socially acceptable behaviors
exactly civilization is built on the
repression of the libido
