I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic today short talk is how to deal
with haters
so as soon as you make the decision to
stand up and stop hiding and to show the
world who you are and what you believe
you will start to cast a shadow one of
the costs associated with becoming
somebody is that you will attract
opposition
this is because in this world of Duality
everything under the sun has an
antithetical element
no matter how good and right and correct
you believe yourself to be there will be
people who disagree with you and
depending on their own level of
awareness these people may attempt to
criticize denounce ostracize and destroy
you
and the brightest lights throughout
history have often been fringed with the
most profound darknesses
so if you dare to stand up you will cast

[01:00]
so if you dare to stand up you will cast
a shadow it's unavoidable and once you
do you will attract haters
haters are people who are loudly
negative with respect to who they think
you are and to what they believe you
believe
now I say it like this because in my own
experience haters almost never carry an
accurate conceptualization in their
minds of your arguments and beliefs
these conceptualizations are typically
warped straw man substitutes for your
actual beliefs maintained through
selective attention to evidence that
supports their Distortion and selective
inattention to evidence that disconfirms
it they rarely possess a measured and
comprehensive understanding of your
position
and they also seem very personally
invested in proving that you're wrong
generally this is because your very
existence as someone who has stood up is
itself the shadow of someone who has
remained in hiding

[02:01]
remained in hiding
you represent parts of themselves that
for whatever reason they have not
allowed themselves to accept and
integrate
these parts are denied
disavowed and projected into others
haters then try to purify themselves by
purging the world of the darkness they
have projected into others
of course this never works and it
creates an incomprehensible amount of
unnecessary suffering
but this is why it happens
there's a quote from David Goggins that
bears repeating here you will never meet
a hater doing better than you
yep that's right and to understand why
that's right we have to understand that
hater
is actually something of a misnomer
hating isn't so much about hate as it is
about Envy
and envy is a really complicated and

[03:00]
and envy is a really complicated and
Insidious emotion to experience Envy a
person must perceive a deficit relative
to a perceived self-relevant good with
respect to a perceived equal that was
complicated so I'll say it again to
experience Envy a person must perceive a
deficit with respect to a perceived
self-relevant good relative to a
perceived equal there's a lot of
perception going on here which kind of
makes sense because Envy is really in
how you choose to look at things
and you need all of those elements to
Kindle this emotion
there's a lot to unpack here but the
component I want to draw your attention
to here is the final bit Envy can only
exist relative to a perceived equal you
take away that part and you don't have
Envy anymore you have admiration
but if you believe that a perceived
equal someone who you believe really
shouldn't be doing all that much better
than you has much more of something you

[04:03]
than you has much more of something you
want than you do especially if that
something is related to your identity
you're going to feel Envy now you can
control what you do with that feeling
but on some level you won't be able to
not experience it if all the conditions
are met
the greater the perceived equality the
easier it is for nv2 fluoresce and this
is why this is going to be tough but
it's true this is why your biggest hater
is someone that you know
someone who is probably very close to
you
because of the perceived equality
Criterion the greatest potential for
Envy always exists among peer-aged
friends and siblings
Envy is why Cain killed Abel
if Abel weren't Cain's brother God's
preference the self-relevant good for

[05:00]
preference the self-relevant good for
Abel's sacrifice wouldn't have hurt
quite so much after all Abel was just
Kane's brother
and just Kane's little brother at that
so there was nothing in Cain's
conceptualization of Abel to justify
God's preference
Envy is more prevalent in families and
among peers because in those circles
you're not only just a friend or just a
brother or just a spouse
but you're just my friend and just my
brother or just my spouse
you're not special
you're potentially just someone who
exists relative to me
as Jesus said only in his hometown among
his relatives and in his own house is a
prophet without honor
Envy is the reason why
now before I go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this episode to someone

[06:00]
consider sending this episode to someone
who might benefit from its message
because it's Word of Mouth referrals
like this that really help to make the
channel grow
and you can also hit the super thanks
button it's the three little dots in the
lower right hand corner and tip me in
proportion to the value you feel you've
received from this message your support
is what makes all this happen I couldn't
do it without you and I really
appreciate it thank you
now this quote from Jesus also suggests
that the same Prophet might be honored
outside of these circles the good that
you do is generally recognized by people
outside of your immediate family and
friend group where that recognition will
not be experienced as personally
threatening as a narcissistic injury
and this is why your biggest fan is
probably someone you haven't met yet and
why you should take the risk to stand up
so that these people can recognize you
from afar
be huge in Japan as the saying goes
because the last place in the world that

[07:02]
because the last place in the world that
may celebrate what good you bring is
where you came from
tragedy here is that just because when
people start to stand up they are not
recognized and supported or even that
they are chastised and censured by the
10 or 20 people closest to them
these people believe that there's
nothing particularly special about them
or that they don't have anything of
value to give and that may not be true
it may be that their value may be
ignored or discounted because it is
threatening to the other people's
egocentrism or their vanity
for this reason I strongly recommend
setting your sights outside the little
circles you entered by accident the
accident of birth the accident of being
assigned the same homeroom the accident
of working two desks down
put your value out into the world and
attract the people who really resonate

[08:02]
attract the people who really resonate
with what you're about that's your real
Community the people who resonate on the
same frequency as you and in my
experience this only happens to be the
people immediately surrounding You by
some sheer miracle
so what's the best way to deal with
haters in general the best response to
haters is no response this is because
engagement whether it's Defending Your
Position or debating your criticism or
their criticism or responding in kind is
generally reinforcing it's like with
children for whom negative attention is
better than no attention at all and some
children will act up and get into
trouble because they prefer that to
being ignored so the best response is no
response on the other hand if you are
somehow required to respond the second
best response is a non-reinforcing
response this is as close to a truly
neutral response as you can muster no

[09:00]
neutral response as you can muster no
expression no emotion
a non-reinforcing response suggests that
there is nothing in the hater's
communication that made enough sense to
even perceive it as a communication
requiring a response it's almost like
the hater made sounds that I couldn't
quite make out his words
so I can't really respond one way or the
other
it kind of doesn't accept that
communication even occurred like I
discussed in a previous episode we
transform an object into a weapon when
we communicate that we've been hurt by
its application
we communic by communicating a
non-reinforcing response you disarm the
hater by responding in a way that
expresses that no harm was experienced
most haters won't try that tactic again
as it was apparently unable to achieve
the desired result
so that's how you deal with haters and

[10:01]
so that's how you deal with haters and
if you've recognized Envy in yourself
and would like to divest yourself of
that emotion great check out my episode
