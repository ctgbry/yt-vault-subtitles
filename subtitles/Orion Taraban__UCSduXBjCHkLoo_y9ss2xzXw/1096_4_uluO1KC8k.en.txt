We don't like to admit this
forthrightly, but it is the natural
order of things for the strong to
oppress the weak. Just look at nature.
Heavy things press down on lighter
things. The gazelle can eat because it's
bigger and stronger than the grass. And
the lion can eat because it's bigger and

in any human society, some people are
going to be stronger and more powerful

think this is why women tend to choose
the bear over the man. Like, projection.
Anyone? Some women have spent a lifetime
provoking or disrespecting men.
