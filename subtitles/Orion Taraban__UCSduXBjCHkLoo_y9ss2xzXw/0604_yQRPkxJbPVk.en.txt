I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why men
get married so this episode is for the
ladies so I've been doing a lot of
consultations with women these days and
while my consultations with men tend to
run the gamet with respect to the topics
under consideration every single one of
my consultations with women has been on
one single topic namely how do I get
married Orion and these conversations
have been very enlightening to say the
least make sure you listen all the way
to the end one of the many things I've
learned is that a lot of you ladies
don't seem to appreciate that men don't
approach the idea of marriage like you
do in fact at any given moment most men
are not going to be interested in the
prospect of settling down and this
creates a problem for you women because
it can be very difficult to
differentiate between the men who might
be interested in getting married and the

[01:01]
be interested in getting married and the
men who just aren't you certainly can't
tell the difference just by looking at
them however while every situation is
different some general rules tend to
apply leaving aside the question of
whether men should get married today I'm
going to explain to you why men do get
married when they choose to do so in the
vast majority of cases men don't get
married to their ideal woman it's not
like the movies in which a confirmed
Bachelor is persuaded to tie the knot
when the right woman comes along that's
not how it works for men in the vast
majority of cases ladies listen real
close men get married to a woman who is
good
enough when everything is
working this means ladies that being the
perfect woman is less important than
choosing the right moment and that being

[02:03]
choosing the right moment and that being
perfect is less important than being
unpr
problematic you have to appreciate that
from the perspective of any relatively
sane man starting a family is an
enormous responsibility no reasonable
man is going to do that when he is
feeling financially insecure or his
career prospects are uncertain or he
hasn't yet secured his place in the
world or conversely when you threaten to
leave the relationship or you are
emotionally volatile or you nag or
complain or criticize or provoke or
neglect or otherwise create unnecessary
problems for him like I said a man gets
married when everything is working both
in his career and in his
relationship starting a family when
everything is not working is
irresponsible it's not a good idea to
bring children into the world when
material conditions are unstable
uncertain or insufficient and any decent

[03:01]
uncertain or insufficient and any decent
man is going to appreciate that fact the
right woman at the wrong time does
nothing to change this what's more a man
who hasn't yet achieved the status
influence or professional success he
would like to enjoy will be very
reticent to start a family because of
how much time energy and attention a
wife and children require time energy
and attention that could otherwise be
channeled into their personal and
professional development so men who for
whatever reason haven't yet arrived at
Material stability who H or who haven't
yet found their place in the world are
not going to be interested nor should
they be interested in getting married
why because it's not about you it's
about his moment in life the upshot of
this should be obvious women if you want
to get married sooner as opposed to
later you absolutely need to Target a

[04:01]
later you absolutely need to Target a
man who is stable who is financially
successful and who already has attained
to some status in the world and this
generally means older men it takes time
to do all of these things and there's
only so much a man can do to hurry it
along in general a man who has
everything else in place will eventually
turn his attention to starting a family
haven't your girls read Jane Austin like
the first line of Pride and Prejudice is
it is a truth universally acknowledged
that a single man in possession of a
good fortune must be in want of a wife
correct it doesn't go the other way
around why because once a man has a wife
it's harder for him to possess a good
fortune this is because the wife tends
to use up not only the fortune but the
time energy and attention needed to
create additional Fortune as well well

[05:00]
create additional Fortune as well well
you women are expensive and when we're
dealing with you we're not dealing with
anything else in any case Austin was
right the fortune has to come first so
Target older men because they're more
likely to have it now before I go any
further if you're liking what you're

let's get back to it now targeting older
men is especially important to consider
if you're a woman looking to find a
husband in a major city like New York or
San Francisco or Los Angeles the cost of
living in these cities is so insanely

[06:01]
living in these cities is so insanely
high that men need a lot more money to
feel like they have enough to take on
dependence like it's hard enough to have
a decent Life as a single person in
these places throw in a wife and kids
and a lot of guys are going to feel like
they first need to increase their
earning potential or their net worth by
an order of magnitude and it takes a lot
of time and effort to do that so that's
one of the main reasons why men are
getting married later in life the
material Threshold at which men feel
comfortable about responsibly taking on
women and children is getting higher and
higher as the cost of living increases
across the board and this is made even
more difficult by the fact that men now
need to compete with you women for the
same
money like a lot of women out out there
busting their ass

[07:00]
busting their ass
thinking they need to provide for a
husband and kids most women wouldn't get
married to a man who required financial
support a lot of you are earning money
to hedge your bets in case the marriage
thing doesn't work out but because
you're doing that you actually make it
less likely that you will get married
because it's going to take more and more
time and effort for the men around you
to get the money they will they need to
feel in order to feel like he's ready to
share it with you and the kids without
completely losing his life in the
process and if and when he gets there
he's probably not going to want to sign
over all of that hard-earned money to a
woman with two good years of fertility
left which is another reason why women
should Target older men especially while
they're still young and here's the most
important part of all this it's the most
important part because it's the part you
women actually control men get married

[08:00]
women actually control men get married
when everything is working especially in
the
relationship every problem that you
unnecessarily introduce into the
relationship is a stumbling block that
you're throwing in your own path why
because when a man is thinking of
getting married he's gonna look at his
woman and
think could I deal with this for the
rest of my life that means if you're
issuing demands and ultimatums he's
going to think am I going to have to
deal with demands and ultimatums for the
rest of my life and you know what I
don't care who he is he is not going to
want to deal with demands and ultimatums
for the rest of his life so why the [ __ ]
would he sign up for that same thing
with jealousy or criticism or laziness
or emotionality or judgmentalism or
sexlessness or any of the hundreds of
things that women are subject to bring
to their

[09:00]
to their
relationships to get married as a woman
you do not need to be
hot you do not need to be
Charming you do not need to be brilliant
or accomplished or anything nearly so
positive you have to be unpr
problematic that's it because a man's
imagination will magnify and extend
every problem that you introduce into
the relationship into the indefinite
future
trust me this is enough to terrify an
otherwise reasonable and well-meaning
man away from marrying you so let's
recap men get married when everything is
working this means that he has achieved
some measure of wealth and status and he
has a clear and realistic vision for a
future characterized by prosperous
stability when a man attains to this
state he will consider marrying a woman
provided she is not introducing any more

[10:01]
provided she is not introducing any more
difficulty into his life everything is
not working when a woman creates
unnecessary arguments or frustrations or
disappointments and he will likely not
move forward unless and until these are
resolved and if he's dealing with these
issues he's not spending time and energy
on making the rest of his life work
which will further compromise his
willingness to commit so whatever you do
don't rock the boat you'll probably
probably just end up getting tipped out
of it what do you think does this fit
