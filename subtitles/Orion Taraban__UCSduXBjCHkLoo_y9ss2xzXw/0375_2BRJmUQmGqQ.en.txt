I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is what you
need to heal a betrayal so betrayals are
subject to occurring within
relationships and I'm going to be honest
with you they are very hard to work
through in many respects it is often
easier to start over with a new
relationship than it is to heal a
betrayal in a pre-existing relationship
this might not be what you want to here
but I don't want to you however
let's assume that you are interested in
working through a betrayal with your
current partner what then well one thing
you have to understand is that violating
trust is basically like folding a piece
of paper you can kind of fold it back in
the opposite direction and work out the
damage but that paper is going to be
creased forever to some extent the
relationship will never go back to the
way it was before the awareness of the
Betrayal occurred

[01:01]
Betrayal occurred
but before I explain how to actually
work out this crease please remember to

are two things that need to occur in
order to have any kind of reasonable
prognosis that the healing process here
will actually be successful action is
required from both parties so both
people need to be very honest with
themselves before agreeing to start off
this process so what needs to happen
well in the first place the transgressor
the one who violated the trust needs to

[02:00]
the one who violated the trust needs to
non-defensively accept responsibility
for the transgression and commit himself
or herself to a course of corrective
action with full transparency afforded
to the transgressed party if the
transgressor isn't willing to take full
responsibility for the transgression
then it's a non-starter assuming partial
responsibility yeah I did this but only
because you did that is also not
associated with a positive
prognosis however accepting
responsibility is not enough after all
the best apology is changed Behavior
what is going to be different moving
forward that is the commitment to
corrective action which could mean
surrendering a relationship going to
therapy or seeding to other reasonable
demands and this corrective action
cannot be done in private as this is
where the Betrayal occurred transparent
accountability is essential at least for
a time to restore trust after a

[03:00]
a time to restore trust after a
betrayal this phase of the process can
take 6 months to a year sometimes more
depending on the magnitude of the
Betrayal it will be timec consuming
expensive and difficult so transgressors
really need to be honest with themselves
about their willingness to surrender to
this probationary period that will
likely require significant effort and
behavioral change if you don't think you
can do this or if you don't want want to
do this it might just be better to move
on however this is only half of the
equation the transgressed party also
requires a healthy dose of self-honesty
albeit in a slightly different manner
this person needs to determine whether
if the transgressor were to complete
this transparent course of corrective
action he or she would actually be
willing to move on which means to Let It
Go

[04:00]
Go
and never bring it up again and this can
be extremely hard why well besides the
pain and hurt engendered by betrayals
there is a lot of secondary gain that
can occur to the transgressed party as a
consequence of that very Betrayal on
some level we believe that the injured
party now has the justifiable power to
dictate the terms of the relationship
because of X now I get to go through
your phone or now you have to report
into to me on the hour or now you have
to ask my permission to do things there
is a measure of power and control that
is predicated on the continuance of
their victim status and so
unsurprisingly there can be resistance
to letting go of the Betrayal on the
part of the transgressed because letting
go of the Betrayal means simultaneously
letting go of the Privileges that can
acur to to occupying a position of

[05:02]
acur to to occupying a position of
victimhood and that will likely destroy
the relationship the transgressor is
going to think hey you know I've jumped
through all these hoops I've
demonstrated my good faith I've tried my
best I've served my time and you still
don't trust
me that's not what I signed up for if
conditions are met the transgressed has
to be willing to forgive the Betrayal
completely this means that they don't
get to bring it up and hold it over the
other person in a fight years after the
fact this is an emotional manipulation
strategy to secure leverage in a
relationship and it's toxic I'm not
saying that the transgressed party
should be able to completely forgive any
betrayal what I'm saying is that if the
transgressed party can't completely
forgive the Betrayal for whatever reason
he or she probably stood shouldn't still
be in a relationship with a transgressor

[06:01]
be in a relationship with a transgressor
and it might just be better to move on
without these two things full
responsibility and a transparent course
of corrective action on the one hand and
a willingness to completely forgive the
Betrayal if conditions are met on the
other there is honestly little point to
trying to work things out healing a
betrayal is timec consuming difficult
and expensive there is no guarantee that
it will work even under ideal
circumstances and without those two
conditions which require a good amount
of self-honesty from both parties it's
not worth the attempt what do you think
have you gone through this process
yourself let me know in the comments
