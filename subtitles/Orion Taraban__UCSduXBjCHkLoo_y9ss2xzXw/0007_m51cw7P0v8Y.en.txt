i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology the
subject of today's short
video is let people be wrong
this is something that
i think that we can all use a reminder
of from time to time
for the vast majority of people one of
the most painful
experiences is this feeling that we're
in the wrong
and that's actually what motivates a lot
of unnecessary conflict in the world
both you know kind of an interpersonal
scale and also on the global scale
which is this need to prove that i'm not
wrong in fact i'm right
and potentially you're wrong
i'm not wrong you are i'm right you're
wrong okay
so this is interesting because
it on the other hand rather than engage
in what is
often a fruitless debate that
very completely can escalate to just
all-out conflict and aggression

[01:02]
is that there's very little downside to
letting people be wrong
there's there's really two potential
outcomes
now if one is that you let somebody be
wrong
and they are for lack of a better word
objectively
wrong like they're they're shown by the
consequences
of their actions through the rest of
reality the rest of life
that they're wrong that they suffer that
they they experience
failure that they experience rejection
um
in which case great you are vindicated
not by the force of your dialogue but
because of the outcome of reality
um and we also know the experience
of being wrong it's it's painful which
is why we're often motivated to argue
and prove that we're right
so on some level what what worse
punishment can you inflict on somebody
than
their own wrongness it's it's the
experience
the state that we often try to squirm as

[02:01]
the state that we often try to squirm as
much as we can to avoid
in dealing with other people so what let
people be wrong
and the other hand the other possible
outcome is that um you were wrong about
their being wrong that
they went ahead with their lives and um
they seem to be successful um they seem
to be prosperous there doesn't seem to
be any problems
and in this case good for you too
because you've been spared sort of the
shame and
ignominy of kind of betting on the wrong
pony as it were
and you can potentially examine your own
beliefs
to see how it could be that um your
expectations didn't align with what
actually ended up occurring so by
letting people be wrong
you want to avoid the pain of backing
the wrong horse as it were
and two if you're right you're
ultimately vindicated in your
perspective anyway
so you know let people be wrong if
they're wrong um
nothing that you can say to a person is
really going to dissuade them from their
wrongness only the experience of their

[03:01]
wrongness only the experience of their
own pain frustration and failure
will cause them potentially to examine
the beliefs that brought them to that
point
so please like and subscribe we'll talk
more about these subjects in future
episodes thank you
