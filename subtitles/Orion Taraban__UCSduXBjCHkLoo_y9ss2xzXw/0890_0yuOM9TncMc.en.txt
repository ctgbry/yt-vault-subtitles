I think guys are more afraid of like her
friend who's the trainer that trains her
at the gym or some guy that came to a
party that she knew and and things like
that. So then if hypergamy does exist,
how do we explain the fact that they all
cheat on their six-figure man or seven
figure man for their you know Twao
instructor? How would you explain that?
Um because and I think this works for
both men and women that I think when
people cheat they often we often see
them cheating down like James Ston
mentioned that the other woman is
generally not as attractive as the wife
and sometimes the wife's lover is the
pool boy or the trainer or something
like that. It's like what's going on?
How does that fit into your idea? And I
think people are trying to get all of
their needs and desires met across
multiple relationships. So if you're in
a stable, secure, loving relationship,
you don't need more security. You don't
need more stability. You might need some
excitement. You might need some passion.
You might need some danger and
uncertainty. And you're going to find
that ne potentially with the insecurely

that ne potentially with the insecurely
attached guy with three children by
three different mothers. By the same
token, maybe you're a man and you are in
a contentious, conflictual relationship
with your wife. You might have an
emotional affair with a woman who's just
a safe haven. It might not even involve
sex at that point. So people are trying
to get their unne unmet needs met in
their affair relationships.
