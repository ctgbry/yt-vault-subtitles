I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is sync
hacks Better Living Through psychology
the topic of today's short talk is
talking is overrated
how ironic now this might sound strange
coming from a therapist but I'm here to
tell you that in relationships talking
is overrated
but Orion isn't communication the key to
good relationships yes it is however you
have to understand that while all
talking is communication not all
communication is talking talking is good
for some things like planning Logistics
and it is absolutely terrible for other
things the most common misapplication of
this principle is assuming that if
communication is the key to good
relationships then you have to talk
about everything all the time and that
is absolutely not true a fair share of
effective communication is knowing what

[01:00]
effective communication is knowing what
not to talk about and understanding when
talking is useless
at this point in my life I'm convinced
that I could have a peaceful loving
respectful relationship with a woman who
couldn't even speak English
why because the point of a relationship
is not to convey semantic information
and everything essential to a
relationship can be communicated without
words I'm also a fantastic partner which
as we'll see makes a big difference
however this hasn't always been the case
I've been in some relationships in the
past where most of the relationship
consisted of talking about the
relationship what did you mean when you
said that how are we doing where is this
going and that is death
why because the point of a relationship
is to come together and experience each
other in the world through that
connection
and while you can do this through
talking it is almost always less

[02:01]
talking it is almost always less
interesting and vital than doing
which would you rather do
have sex or talk about having sex
be on holiday or talk about the trip you
took six months ago
talking is to doing as imagination is to
reality the former is a pale imitation
of the latter and all other things being
equal the more time you spend talking
the less time you spend doing and that's
where all the good stuff is
here's another reason why talking is
overrated how often has it happened in
your life that your partner has said to
we need to talk
and when you sat down with this other
person he or she said I need you to know
that last week when we were having a
discussion about my mother
I never felt so heard and respected and
validated in my life you need to know

[03:00]
validated in my life you need to know
that I'm very satisfied with this
relationship and I'm extremely content
with the way things are going and I'm
only concerned that I just might not be
able to love you any more than I
currently do
like that never [ __ ] happens does it
and why is that because when people say
we need to talk it's because somebody
has a problem
and they believe that talking is going
to resolve that problem and again this
is going to sound really weird coming
from a therapist but that is often not
the case only a small subset of problems
can really be solved by talking about
them and in many cases talking about
problems becomes a problem in and of
itself

also hit the super thanks button and tip
me in proportion to the value you feel
you've derived from this episode I
really appreciate your support
[ __ ] act actually helps to reduce an
undesired Behavior it's generally
because the possibility of talking about
the behavior again is more aversive than
giving up the behavior itself
that is talking is a punishment
Marcia Linehan the creator of
dialectical behavior therapy understood
this to be true when a client violated
his or her treatment agreement Say by
missing a group session or arriving late
she would not allow the therapy to
proceed until the behavior was
exhaustively discussed
the client would be eager to talk about
an argument she had with her boyfriend
or a conflict he had at work and she
wouldn't let them she would take time
out of what the client wanted to do
to talk about something he or she had

[05:01]
to talk about something he or she had
done and clients generally hated that so
much that they changed their behavior it
was the punitive component of talking
that moved the needle not the problem
solving or understanding potentialities
of talking that most people assume to be
responsible for the behavior change
to the extent that we need to talk works
it's because it's punitive and
punishments reduce the frequency of
behavior
but should you really be punishing your
partner it's generally not a very good
idea for a number of reasons in the
first place to the extent that it works
it increases the power imbalance in a
relationship why for the simple reason
that punishments can really only issue
from the more powerful to the less
powerful
so the more you employ punishment the
more powerful you become and the less
powerful your partner becomes which

[06:00]
powerful your partner becomes which
isn't usually sustainable as it leads to
resentment on both sides punishers are
resentful because they increasingly feel
parentified and critical and punishes
are resentful because they increasingly
feel infantilized and criticized
what a drag after all good relationships
are about enjoying who your partner is
not about changing them into who you
want them to be
now
when do people feel like they need to
talk
when somebody was disrespectful or
somebody was lazy or somebody was
irresponsible or somebody was
inconsiderate or somebody was
withholding
Etc
unpopular opinion but talking will not
fix any of those things
talking will not make a disrespectful
person respectful or a lazy person
productive or a irresponsible person
responsible and insisting on talking

[07:00]
responsible and insisting on talking
about these issues is really a kind of
intolerance for the partner you chose
the way to solve these problems is not
by talking but by being respectful
productive responsible considerate and
generous
if you are a good partner and you choose
people who are also good partners there
really won't be much to talk about
this is why I believe that I could have
an excellent relationship with someone
who doesn't speak my language I know how
to be a good partner and I know how to
recognize people who know how to be good
partners
all the things that I'm looking for in a
relationship kindness loyalty tenderness
sensuality patience generosity
positivity prioritization connection
do not need words
in fact they can all be communicated
wordlessly in actions and in a general
attitude toward life

[08:00]
attitude toward life
I have plenty of people to talk to if I
feel the urge to do so
I don't need a woman to talk to I need a
woman for other things
the fact of the matter is is there is
little need to talk about most problems
because the vast majority of problems
spontaneously remiss which is to say
they tend to take care of themselves
you don't have to talk about every
little thing you don't have to process
every uncomfortable emotion that you
experience throughout your week these
things come and go
on the other hand talking about a
problem enshrines that in the memory of
the relationship
such that something that could have been
a temporary issue becomes a permanent
fact
the only issues that really need to be
discussed are deal breakers and there
are really these are really just two
minute conversations if a problem is so
bad that it would destroy the
relationship all by itself then give
people the option to choose between the
problem
or the relationship and move on with

[09:01]
or the relationship and move on with
your life
it's not easy but it really is that
simple
and that's what I have to say for the
