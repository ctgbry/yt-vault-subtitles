I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is women
have to allow themselves to be
used this one is for the ladies a
provocative title I'll admit but I hope
the episode justifies its usage let's
get right to it ladies it's my
understanding that one of your primary
concerns about modern dating especially
in an age where sex precedes a
commitment is that you will be used that
is you might enter into a sexual
relationship with a particular man
however this might not lead to the
relationship outcome you would prefer
maybe you're ghosted afterward or you
enter into a vague situationship that
doesn't seem to go anywhere and women
are subject to considering these
outcomes to be exploitative or a waste
of their time and I'm here to address
this concern and help you navigate this
reality successfully to reduce the
likelihood of this occurring there are
three things you have to do the first is

[01:02]
three things you have to do the first is
exercise appropriate discernment like
there are guys out there who will never
give you the relationship outcome you
would prefer no matter what you do ever
so you need to get better at figuring
out who these guys are simply asking men
what are you looking for is stupid and
ineffective it is stupid and ineffective
because both the man who who lies and
the man who tells the truth will say the
same thing I'm looking for a long-term
relationship men have learned long ago
that you punish any other response to
this question more on that in a future
episode so ultimately this is a problem
that you created for yourselves if you
punish the truth you're asking to be
lied to it's not a very popular opinion
but I'd like you to consider that it's
not men's respons responsibility to be

[02:01]
not men's respons responsibility to be
honest and transparent with you like
they shouldn't outright lie but you also
shouldn't expect that they're going to
like tell you everything either I want
you to consider that it's not their job
to tell you the truth it's your job to
figure out the truth just like it's
their job to vet you it's your job to
vet them and if you can't get better at
Discerning the opportunities that are
likely to lead to the outcome you would
prefer that I'm afraid you're just going
to run into the same issue over and over
and over again we all make mistakes and
to a certain extent we all have to learn
the hard way but it's like learn your
lesson and make different mistakes
moving
forward consider this problem from a
professional standpoint wanting to get
married to a high value guy is kind of
like wanting to be the CEO of a
successful company lots of people want
it the vast majority of them will be
disappointed in their wanting

[03:00]
disappointed in their wanting
if you get hired at a certain company
there is typically no assurance that you
will ever become the CEO even if you
work your ass off for 40 straight years
there is absolutely no guarantee that
you will end up in the seite and
generally no company will guarantee that
outcome when they hire you but you sign
up for the job anyway and you generally
sign up for the job because you like the
compensation package at the position for
which you were hired
and this means that even if you never
get promoted to CEO you also can't
really complain that you were exploited
as you were compensated for your time at
the rate you agreed to otherwise you
probably wouldn't have accepted the
position now you're going to have better
chances at career advancement at some
companies over others aren't you however
both types of companies will generally
tell you that they offer growth
opportunities during the interview
process so if being the CEO one day is

[04:01]
process so if being the CEO one day is
very important to you then you have to
use your discernment to figure out which
type of company you're dealing with this
is because no company ever will tell you
that they're hiring for a dead-end job
while they're still in the hiring
process okay now before I go any further

okay

[05:00]
okay
let's get back to
it now this Segways into the second
thing that you ladies have to do in the
absence of an explicit guarantee that
you will become the
CEO how do you increase the likelihood
that this will one day occur as the
employee you're not going to get there
by making demands or insisting on
commitments you're going to increase the
likelihood that you'll get promoted by
showing up and doing your [ __ ] job
really really
well every single day for as many days
in a row as you can possibly
muster
otherwise you're acting deluded and
entitled like in a professional context
imagine believing you can get promoted
without exceeding
expectations or thinking you only have
to work for a few months before you get
a corner office the CEO is a very high

[06:02]
a corner office the CEO is a very high
position and lots of people want it to
the extent that it's in demand you
increase the likelihood of winning that
position by
overpaying which means doing your job
really really really well just keep in
mind that your job isn't really what you
think your job is it's what your boss
thinks your job is it's your boss
not you who decides if you exceeded
expectations and put in the appropriate
effort remember the cat decides what
milk is
good however let's not be naive the
world is not a meritocracy the position
doesn't always go to the most capable
and sometimes people who do good work
get passed over and this leads us to the
third thing that women can do namely
play their cards right if you're
shooting for the SE Suite then you have

[07:01]
shooting for the SE Suite then you have
to be willing to play The Game of
Thrones if not then set your sight lower
or go find a less successful company
where the competition is lower I talk
more about how to do this in my
forthcoming book the value of others and
my video series on how to get any man
you want in any case those are the three
things you have to do ladies to secure
your commitment you have to exercise
your discernment you have to do your job
really really well and you have to play
your cards right make
sense now let's focus on step two for a
moment to do your job really well this
is true of anyone men and women to do
your job really well you have to allow
yourself to be used there is no way
around it if you don't allow your
employer or your customers to use you to
use your time or your service or your
expertise then you cannot expect to get
what you want from them a highly skilled
worker who does not allow herself to be

[08:00]
worker who does not allow herself to be
used is
useless and useless things typically
aren't very valuable the potential
doesn't count for anything the fact that
you could if you wanted to is
meaningless if you don't and it's
usually the case that you have to allow
yourself to be used in advance of
getting what you want kind of like how
you have to work two weeks before you
receive a paycheck and this means that
there's always a chance that you'll put
in the effort and not get what you want
after all no one really likes this like
everybody men and women would just
prefer to be given what they wanted and
everybody men and women are acutely
aware of the possibility that they won't
get what they hope to receive for
instance I've spoken with hundreds of
guys who don't want to date women
anymore because they think that women
are just using them for their resources
and there are women out there who
absolutely use men for their resources
at every level of the relationship
funnel

[09:00]
funnel
and there is no guarantee that the next
woman they go out with isn't going to do
the same however there's really not a
way around this if men don't allow
themselves to be used they rarely get a
chance to access women's sexual
opportunities this is because all men
pay it is what it is however just like
women can get better at using their
discernment and identifying the men
unlikely to give them their preferred
relationship outcome men can get better
at using their discernment and
identifying the women likely to Simply
use them for resources it works both
ways now in my experience men have kind
of made their peace with the necessity
of being used this is because the world
treats useless men very badly so they're
kind of used to it women not so much
However the fact of the matter is that
in today's sexual Marketplace you have
to allow yourself to be used women in
order to get what you want

[10:00]
order to get what you want
and you may need to allow yourselves to
be used longer than you might expect
this isn't your parents let alone your
grandparents generation when it comes to
sex it is a buyer's market not a sellers
one this means that you might have to
work longer and harder than you think
you should just to get your foot in the
door like think of the fashion industry
is it right is it fair that people work
for years as UNP paid interns with no
guarantee of succcess in order to launch
their careers right or wrong it's what's
required given prevailing Market forces
there's so many people who want in that
industry and there's only so many jobs
it's for you to decide whether it's
worth it not for you to decide what is
necessary for better or worse there is
only one way for women today to secure
the commitment they might want without
allowing themselves to be used if they
don't want to be used they can be

[11:01]
don't want to be used they can be
ornamental however in order to be
ornamental you have to be really really
really pretty and just keeping it real
with you by definition the vast majority
of you are not really really really
pretty so you're not going to be
ornamental and you might not want to be
anyway because what does an ornament do
haha trick question nothing it's not
supposed to do anything it's just
supposed to keep quiet and testify to
the status of its owner not a
particularly flattering position in
reality in any case in today's sexual
Marketplace securing commitment from a
high value man is comparable to becoming
the CEO of a successful company to get
either you have to use your discernment
to pick your appropriate opportunity you
have to do your job really really really
well and you have to play your cards
right and the way to actualize all three
of these things is to allow yourselves
to be be used you got to give to get and

[12:03]
to be be used you got to give to get and
most of you ain't going to get anywhere
unless you give it up
