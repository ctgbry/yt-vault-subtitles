Are there things that men should be
doing on their dating profiles in
general to stand out?
&gt;&gt; Holding fishes with their shirts out of
here.
&gt;&gt; No, I'm [laughter] okay.
&gt;&gt; Uh, one thing that they could definitely
do is level up their pictures. Like,
[music] you know, most guys only have
pictures of themselves on vacation.
Okay, fair enough. And with their guy
friendss, maybe. So to actually get
photos of yourself on a nice camera like
an SLR with good lighting, it doesn't
have to look like a professional headsh
shot, but just having high quality
images can put you ahead of like 90 95%
of men on dating apps.
&gt;&gt; That's huge.
&gt;&gt; Sure. And you just need what? Six of
them. Anybody can get six [music] good
pictures. A great way to do this that
I've recommended to guys is to use
Airbnb experiences. Have you heard of
these? Airbnb most people know for these
short-term rentals. But a few years ago,
they launched kind of a complement to
that site. So, you can either get the
rentals or experiences.
&gt;&gt; So, let's say you're traveling to LA or
to Bali and you don't know anybody. You

to Bali and you don't know anybody. You
don't have anything to do and you want
to you don't want to just go to all the
touristy places like the, you know,
Sunset Boulevard and the Hollywood sign.
So, there are locals who are like, I'll
take you to the real Chinatown or I'm
going to show you the best hidden spots
for Korean barbecue or something like
that. You probably wouldn't know
otherwise. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; half of those experiences are
professional photographers who will say,
"I will take you to the golden hour to
this beautiful spot and I even help you
with outfits or poses and they cost 100
bucks." That's within the means of most
people.
&gt;&gt; After this episode, Airbnb is going to
get booked out. All the experiences
[laughter] they have.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Maybe I should get into affiliate
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly.
