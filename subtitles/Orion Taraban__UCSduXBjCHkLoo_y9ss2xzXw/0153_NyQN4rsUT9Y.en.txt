i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
how to suffer less in life
i mean
who wouldn't want to know how to suffer
less in life that's pretty much the top
of my list of hobbies and interests
now what i've discovered over the years
is that the root of a great deal of my
unnecessary suffering lies in my
decision to say no
to whatever is happening in the present
moment
for whatever reason i've made the
decision that what is happening is
something that i don't want
and therefore i put myself in the
position of resisting reality
this saying no this turning away this
resistance
creates friction
and this friction is a source of a good
amount of unnecessary suffering on this
planet
here's the thing
our resistance to the present moment
does not improve the present moment
if anything it provokes resistance and

[01:02]
if anything it provokes resistance and
defensiveness in those around us
which often leads to the exacerbation or
the worsening
of the unpreferred situation
it also instills the spirit of suffering
inside of me
which prevents me from responding
optimally to whatever's going around
going on around me
so regardless of whether we should or
shouldn't resist a given outcome we can
certainly make the argument that it is
less effective to do so
it generally doesn't help us get what we
want
on the other hand i've learned that if i
can find a way to turn toward the
present moment to say yes to it to
accept that it is what it is
then at the very least
i succeed in
not making my situation any harder than
it already is
and if i'm lucky this turning towards
can even improve my situation
how
by adopting a posture of willingness

[02:00]
by adopting a posture of willingness
to work with what is
as opposed to a posture of willfulness
that insists that reality conformed to
my preference
i give myself the best possible chance
of recognizing the potential that may be
inherent in the situation
very few things in life are so
completely categorically negative that
they can't be used to some advantage
and by adopting a posture of willingness
we can continue to work towards our
goals regardless of the prevailing
conditions
now surrendering to the necessity of the
present moment is easier said than done
it's simple but it's not easy
one thing that helps is to remember that
you're doing this out of enlightened
self-interest
you practice willingness
not because you condone or approve of
what's happening
but because you want to suffer less
and by suffering less you allow yourself

[03:00]
and by suffering less you allow yourself
to be in that moment with let's say more
of your faculties intact so that you can
respond more effectively to whatever
happens to be in that present moment
by turning towards and saying yes you
can even
sometimes but not always
improve the situation
what do you think have you found this to
be effective in your own experience
