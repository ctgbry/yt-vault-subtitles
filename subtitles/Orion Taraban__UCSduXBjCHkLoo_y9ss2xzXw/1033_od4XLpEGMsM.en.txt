The coolage effect, which has been
established in not just human men, but
in males more generally, is the
psychological phenomenon that males find
novel sexual partners more attractive
than partners they have already slept
with. What can we do about this? As far
as I can tell, there are really only
four, count them, four solutions to this
problem in the context of a long-term
relationship. There are pros and cons to
each, but as far as I can tell, they
represent the totality of responses to
the demonstrated need of males for
novelty. The first is to get creative.
Walk into any adult superstore and what

directly or indirectly to turn your

environments or impose rules and
regulations.
That is, you may have to do something in

people just aren't. It is what it is.
And even those who are creative often
have to bend over backwards trying to
inject a novelty that is only partially
satisfying into a relationship. There
may in fact be easier solutions. Like
number two, open the relationship. Oh
boy, we went there. Perhaps it's open on
both sides. Maybe it's an asymmetrical
arrangement, but the prospect of actual
occasional novelty has helped many,

occasional novelty has helped many,
many, many, many men remain in long-term
relationships. As Alexander Duma wrote,
