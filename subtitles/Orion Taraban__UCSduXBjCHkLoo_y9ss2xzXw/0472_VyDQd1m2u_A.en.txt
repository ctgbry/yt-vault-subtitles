I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is women and
acceptable loss
all right by now we should all be duly
familiar with the concept of hypergamy
in short hypergamy is the tendency in
women to mate and date up in status
hierarchies for instance women generally
want men who are older taller stronger
higher status higher earning Etc
we've also talked about how women treat
men the way men treat jobs this means
that all things being equal women are
going to choose their most compelling
overall offer and this also means that
women mate or date for gain they want
something better than they currently
have that's the hyper part of hypergamy
Simply breaking even is generally not
sufficient incentive for a woman to
initiate a sexual relationship
irrespective of whether it's something
casual or something more long-term women

[01:02]
casual or something more long-term women
must benefit from the interaction in
order to justify the risk and the
opportunity cost of pursuing that
particular relationship so far so good
now let's look at it from the other side
if what I've said is true if it's true
that women mate and date for gain then
men mate and date for acceptable loss
I'll say that again if it's true that
women mate and date for gain then men
mate and date for acceptable loss to the
extent that the woman is successful in
securing a relationship with a higher
status man who can improve her situation
then that man secures the same
relationship at some degree of loss to
him in the vast majority of cases in
terms of time energy money commitment
and opportunity most women will consume
more value than they provide and of

[02:00]
more value than they provide and of
course that's why they're there
because it's a net positive for them and
good on you women
I I'd improve my situation by securing a
relationship with a higher status woman
if I could as well so I don't blame you
at all that said while the statement
women mate and date for gain sounds
reasonable enough the statement women
consume more value than they provide
tends to melt some faces even though
it's exactly the same statement like it
literally wouldn't be possible for women
to mate and date for gain if they didn't
consume more than they provided if they
provided more than they consumed then
they would be mating and dating at a
loss which is an unlikely or at least an
unsustainable situation
and the objection that men and women
provide each other value equally is an
attempt to mystify the reality of the
situation
those with less generally call for
equality the loudest because an equal

[03:02]
equality the loudest because an equal
split would improve their situation
however in relationships inequality is
the rule and equality is not always
Justified I'm not saying this is either
good or bad it's just the way it is
in any case men if you're looking to
enter into a relationship with a woman
you need to make peace with the fact
that you will incur some loss in the
transaction however there is an enormous
difference between acceptable loss and
unacceptable loss and it's for every man
to determine for himself where the line
between the two lines it's often not a
hard and fast line most of us would
likely agree that there are Arrangements
that are very clearly acceptable losses
and Arrangements that are very clearly
unacceptable losses but there's
definitely a lot of Gray Zone in the
middle
now before I go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this episode to someone
who might benefit from its message

[04:00]
who might benefit from its message
because it's Word of Mouth referrals
like this that really help to make the
channel grow you can also hit the thanks
button it's the three little dots in the
low right hand corner and tip me in
proportion to the value you feel you've
received from this episode it's support
from you that makes this all happen and
I couldn't do it without you so thank
you very much
now to understand how to go about doing
this men do you understand where to draw
the line of acceptable loss I'd like you
to imagine that your generals trying to
win a war
if you wanted to win a war without any
one of your soldiers dying you would not
be able to do so it would be impossible
you'd be far too conservative and
cautious and that pattern would be
quickly exploited by your adversary
Victory would just not be possible on
the other hand no General in good
conscience would throw a man's life away
callously it's no small thing to order a
battalion into a skirmish with a low

[05:01]
battalion into a skirmish with a low
chance of survival because of the
Strategic Advantage it affords however
these sacrifices are almost always
necessary to secure the ultimate goal
which in this case is to win the war
there is a measure of acceptable loss
generals must tolerate in the pursuit of
their goal and there is a measure of
unacceptable loss that generals must
avoid if their Victory is to be
meaningful
if all their soldiers were destroyed in
the process there would be no one left
to enjoy the victory this is
unacceptable and this is why the Advent
of nuclear weapons have more or less led
to a stalemate so far in terms of world
conflict no one wants to rule over a
pile of Ashes
so somewhere between I can't lose a
single man and I'm prepared to sacrifice
my entire Army is the line between
acceptable and unacceptable loss
so what does this have to do with women
well just like the generals men need to
approach mating and dating through the

[06:02]
approach mating and dating through the
lens of some overarching purpose if the
generals weren't fighting for something
they believed in then even the smallest
sacrifice might not be worth the price
of victory
and there are things that you can do
with a woman that justify acceptable
losses Chief among them is starting a
family and creating a legacy for
yourself and there are others that
depend on an individual's goals and
inclinations
however without such an overarching
purpose then even the smallest cost
might not be worth securing the
relationship the Jews generally isn't
worth the squeeze without it
one thing that I routinely advise men to
do is to clarify their intentions with
respect to a given woman before they
interact with her
this generally improves Effectiveness
regardless of their specific Intentions
by increasing congruence across the
various levels of communication
and this also helps to define the line
of acceptable loss

[07:00]
of acceptable loss
the more casual the intention the more
cheaply the acceptable loss is
calculated for instance even the
smallest cost or the least amount of
risk would nikely would likely not
justify an undesirable sexual activity
however a more meaningful or desirable
goal would also likely inspire a dearer
loss estimation
and it's important to emphasize that
it's not for anyone else not for me not
your women not your culture to tell you
what you should consider a meaningful or
desirable goal this is for you to decide
for yourselves
I understand a lot of men's reticence
about entering into relationships with
women
since women mate and date for gain men
must typically resign themselves to some
measure of loss the inescapable reality
here is that all men pay
and while it's true that the more a
given woman likes you the greater the
discount it's also true that the more

[08:01]
discount it's also true that the more
meaningful or desirable the opportunity
the more the cost is Justified like a
good General you just have to learn how
to choose your battles
