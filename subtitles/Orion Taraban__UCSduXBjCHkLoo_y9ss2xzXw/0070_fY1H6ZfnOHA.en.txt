i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is life is
like disneyland
this is one of my metaphors for some of
the existential realities of being alive
on this planet
what is the point of life
what are we supposed to do
i'm not saying that i can definitively
answer these questions i'm not sure
anyone can but here's a perspective that
i've developed to provide a reasonably
satisfying response
i'd like you to consider that the point
of life
is to experience life
what if it's that simple
we come here to this planet so that we
can fall in love and swim in the ocean
and feel the sunlight and experience
friendship and understand betrayal and
know the thrill of adventure and the
glory of triumph and the joys of
contentment and the pangs of grief and
the brilliant intensity of midday and
the gentle warmth of dusk and to feel
very very big and very very small at the

[01:02]
very very big and very very small at the
same time
in short we come incarnate in life
in order to experience life
that's the point
so in this way i liken life to
disneyland the point of disneyland is to
go on the rides you go to disneyland to
experience disneyland
you can't win or lose disneyland you
can't beat
or fail disneyland
you can't do disneyland right
or wrong
if you want to go on the teacups 50
times in a row because by god that's
your favorite ride you didn't do
disneyland badly
by the same token if you want to ride
every single ride in the park
you don't get a gold star
you didn't do disneyland
well
in both cases you did what you wanted
and you had your experience
so life is like being in the park
which offers us this multiplicity of

[02:02]
which offers us this multiplicity of
potential experiences we can ride the
thrilling rides or the gentle rides
we can even spend our whole time just
watching other people ride the rides
each experience is different
but on some level they're all equally
existentially full
they all constitute one day at
disneyland
that's it
and at the end of the day we go home
there's no way to do it right
there's no way to do it wrong
there's no way to win
there's no way to lose
life is just a theme park of experiences
and when evening comes
maybe we can leave with some good
memories
