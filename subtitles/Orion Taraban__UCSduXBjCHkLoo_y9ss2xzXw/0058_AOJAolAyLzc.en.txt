I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is the
game of please
no many of you might not know that
psychology is actually my second career
I got my start as a theater actor and I
was a professional actor for over a
decade in New York City I began this
career at a very prestigious acting
Conservatory there and for the entire
first year of my training my acting
class was entirely devoted to one single
exercise which was called the game of
please no and I've since come to
understand that the game of please no is
the fundamental game of human
interaction so I'd like to briefly
describe what this game entails and why
I think the way that I do the game of
please know is very simple it's always
played between two people one person can
only say the word please and the other
person can only say the words yes or no

[01:03]
person can only say the words yes or no
and this person has to start from a no
position the game is over when the
please actor successfully persuades the
no actor to say yes that's it no other
words are allowed and the game can go on
as long as it needs to among other
things this game is an excellent way to
develop non-verbal communication skills
tonality proxemics posture gesture
Rhythm pacing Etc however the the aspect
of the game that I want to focus on
today is its relation to the negotiation
at the heart of all human interactions
in the real
world as I've mentioned in a previous
episode the universe lives closed which
is to say that the default starting
position of the universe is no can I
have this job no can I have this house
no can I have this date no and at the
end of the day people are successful in
life in direct proportion to their

[02:00]
life in direct proportion to their
ability to transform NOS into yeses or
to put it in another way in direct
proportion to their Mastery of the game
of please
no if you ever decide to play this game
yourself you'll very quickly learn that
success is not a one-size fits-all thing
the same game played between the same
two individuals on one day will have a
very different progress and potential
outcome than the same game played
between the same two individuals on
another over time you'll also see that
the various methods or strategies
utilized by the pleas actors to secure
their yeses are varied but not infinite
in fact they tend to fall into a few
easily identifiable General categories
such as seduction
intimidation humor supplication
earnestness Etc and these strategies
will work differentially on different
people on different days the trick to

[03:01]
people on different days the trick to
mastering the game of please no is being
able to sus out as quickly and reliably
as possible the strategy that is most
likely to be effective in that
particular moment with that particular
individual and you do this by learning
to listen more carefully to the no
response and becoming more sensitively
perceptive to the information contained
therein because the fact of the matter
is is that the way a person says no
always contains a clue about how to get
them to say yes provided you know how to
listen I think that's good for an
introduction we'll definitely talk about
the game of please know in future
episodes in the meantime if you'd like
to suggest a topic for a future episode
