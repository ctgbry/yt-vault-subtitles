i'm dr orion taraban and this
is psych's better living through
psychology and the subject of today's
short talk
is overcoming new problems
so every day is a challenge that brings
with it new and unexpected difficulties
to overcome
and sometimes it can be intimidating
when confronted with a problem that
you've never encountered before
it demands a solution from us but we've
never worked through that in the past
so i'm here to offer you two little tips
for overcoming new problems in your life
whatever they may be the first
is to look around and ask yourself are
there
any other people who have successfully
dealt with this problem
for example i've worked with a lot of
new parents in my practice and
some of them understandably experience
anxiety over their
new role after all taking care of a
child might not be something they've
ever done before
so i asked these folks hey look around
do you see any other people

[01:01]
do you see any other people
who have successfully solved this
problem yes
there are literally billions of people
on this planet who have become
parents more or less successfully to
their children
and then i think if these people can do
it
if these people can do it
then why not me i'm no better or nor
worse than
any of the other people who have managed
to overcome this same problem
so if they can do it i can do it
the second little trick is to refocus
attention on
your own ability your own capacity so
for example
i'll look back over the course of my
life and remember
hey there's been hundreds if not
thousands of times in the past that i've
encountered
a novel problem without precedent in my
life
and here i am today so i must have been
able to overcome it in
one way or another that means that

[02:01]
one way or another that means that
the experience of overcoming an
unprecedented problem
actually has a good deal of precedent
i've gone through that
hundreds or thousands of times in my
life
the details are different but the
underlying experience is the same
so i can feel confident in my ability to
respond appropriately
to novel problems because i've done so
consistently in the past
i will either find a way or i will make
a way
that's a quote from hannibal the ancient
general of carthage and one of my
personal favorites i will either
find a way or i will make a way
and this novel problem is in actuality
nothing new so i hope this helped
