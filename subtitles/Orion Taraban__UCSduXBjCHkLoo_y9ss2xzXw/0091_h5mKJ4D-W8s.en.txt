i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
if you've done nothing wrong
don't apologize
so
it is sometimes the case that as we move
through life
people might become angry or upset with
us in response to something that we said
or did or didn't say or didn't do
and these folks will bring their hurt
feelings to our attention sometimes
demanding an
apology however the truth is that hurt
feelings are not in and of themselves
a sign of transgression
if someone is upset with you it doesn't
necessarily mean that you've done
anything wrong maybe you have maybe you
haven't
now if folks bring their hurt feelings
to you and you independently conclude
after examination in your own conscience
that the behavior they are indicting is
in fact in conflict with your own moral
or ethical beliefs

[01:00]
or ethical beliefs
then such folks are your friends
they're pointing out something that you
may have missed or preferred not to see
so that you can live in greater
alignment with your own beliefs
when this happens the right move is to
disabuse yourself with the behavior
apologize to those impacted and make
amends for any damages
however
if your independent examination
critically and dispassionately concludes
that the behavior they are indicting is
not
in fact in conflict with your own moral
or ethical beliefs
then you must conclude that you've done
nothing wrong
and in such cases you absolutely should
not apologize for that behavior
the issue here is that there are a lot
of folks who are rather soft-hearted and
conflict avoidant
they observe the other person's distress
or discomfort they legitimately don't
want the other person to suffer
and so they apologize in an attempt to
reduce the other person's suffering
such apologies are basically i'm sorry

[02:01]
such apologies are basically i'm sorry
you feel that way apologies which don't
make anyone feel any better
in fact such compassionate apologies can
make the situation much
much worse
this is because the person demanding the
apology can hear such an apology as an
admission of guilt
an admission that the apologist has
committed some form of wrongdoing
and that the intentions imputed to the
apologist were correctly divined by the
person demanding the apology
such an apology proves
that the apology demander was right
furthermore since apologizing is a
confession of guilt it often doesn't
mollify the apology demander if anything
the apology can justify more punishment
in the mind of the apology demander
so only apologize if in your own
consciousness you conclude that you have
in fact violated your own moral or

[03:00]
in fact violated your own moral or
ethical code
otherwise anyone demanding an apology
can go pound sand
