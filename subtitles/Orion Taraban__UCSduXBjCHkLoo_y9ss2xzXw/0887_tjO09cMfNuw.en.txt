So, it seems like in today's day and
age, every woman has a narcissistic
ex-boyfriend or a narcissistic
ex-husband. And that's amazing because
the most recent epidemiological data I
could find suggests that between 1 to 2%
of Americans have NPD or narcissistic
personality disorder. And that number
includes female narcissists. So, it's
pretty hard to imagine that 2% of the
men have dated like 100% of the women.
So, what's going on here? Certainly part
of the issue is that the popular
imagination has significantly expanded

years. It's more commonly used for its,
let's say, moral connotations than for
its descriptive purposes. Narcissist has

balanced. And in my conceptualization,
it's the adorer who gives more and feels
more and the adored who takes more and
feels less.
