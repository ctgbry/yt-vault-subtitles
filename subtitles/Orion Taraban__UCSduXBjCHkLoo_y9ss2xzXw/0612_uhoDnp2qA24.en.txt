I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is what most
people don't understand about mental
illness the source of the problem so
this two-part episode isn't about women
or relationships that's okay watch it
anyway it may actually be more important
for you or someone you know to hear
about this so let's get to it right now
about one in four American adults are
living with mental illness that's 50
million Americans suffering
unnecessarily if you're shocked you're
not alone because it didn't used to be
this way these numbers have only gone up
significantly in the past 40 years not
only is mental illness extremely
expensive both to the individuals
themselves and to society more broadly
but it creates an enormous existential
toll on the lives of countless others as
well how did it get to be this way and

[01:00]
well how did it get to be this way and
why is it getting worse to answer these
questions we have to understand the word
reification reification comes from the
Latin word re meaning thing so
reification kind of means thingification
it means to make a thing out of
something that isn't actually a thing
and if there's one word that will help
us understand mental illness it is
reification what does this mean this is
the the diagnostic and statistical
Manual of mental disorders published by
the American Psychiatric association now
in its fifth edition it contains nearly
300 different illnesses this is up from
the two mental illnesses first
identified by creolin in the early 20th
century dementia precox which we might
Now call schizophrenia and manic
depressive Insanity which we now call
bipolar one Disorder so it would
certainly seem as though we've made
major strides in the diagnosis of mental

[02:01]
major strides in the diagnosis of mental
illness wouldn't it just like chemists
200 years ago didn't know and couldn't
know that there were nearly 100 more
elements out there Physicians a century
ago apparently had no idea that they
were missing no fewer than 300 different
mental illnesses
progress but here's the
thing none of these nearly 300 mental
illnesses can be objectively
assessed for all of these illnesses
diagnosis is primarily based on
self-reported criteria checklists of
symptoms this means that you could book
a session with a doctor say you've had
five of these eight symptoms over the
past month which has caused you a lot of
distress and boom you now have a mental
illness the upshot of this is that in
the case of mental illness it's
functionally the patient who decides
whether and to what extent he is is sick

[03:01]
whether and to what extent he is is sick
can you imagine a medical system in
which the patient tells the doctor that
he has strep throat or pancreatic cancer
or brain aneurysm and that the doctor
has no way to objectively confirm that
assessment and of course if there were
no way to objectively confirm the
presence of these diseases then there
would also be no way to objectively
confirm whether the diseases ever went
away
with
there like pause this episode and
briefly consider what medicine would
look like if there were no way to trust
to test the presence or the absence of
any specific disease what do you think
would
happen well modern Psychiatry provides
us with a potential vision of what that
might look like again there is no
genetic or physiological or
neuroanatomical or neurochemical or
radiological

[04:00]
radiological
or any objective assessment for any one
of these illnesses let's flip through
the pages and let the book speak for
itself now shall we we can start with
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
ADHD that's one that people hear a lot
about right ADHD okay here we go
Associated laboratory findings there are
no laboratory tests neurological
assessments or attentional assessments
that have been established as Diagnostic
in the clinical assessment of attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder
huh that's
odd okay the book continues tests that
require effortful mental processing have
been noted to be abnormal in groups of
individuals with attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder compared with
peers oh really you don't say since
often has trouble holding attention on
tasks or you know trouble with effortful
mental processing is one of the
self-professed criteria for ADHD it it's
hardly surprising that tests that

[05:01]
hardly surprising that tests that
require effortful mental functioning
might be abnormal in groups of
individuals already classified as having
trouble with effortful mental processing
this is because as I'm sure you can
appreciate tests don't really have much
diagnostic
potential if you run them on people who
have already been
diagnosed fortunately the book has the
intellectual honesty to admit this
circular reasoning and goes on but the
tests are not of demonstrated utility
when one is trying to determine whether
a particular individual has the disorder
it is not yet known what fundamental
cognitive deficits are responsible for
such group
differences okay that's fascinating we
can't see ADHD on any scan test or
assessment but no one today doubts that
it
exists whereas 40 years ago a boy might
be said to be restless probably over the

[06:02]
be said to be restless probably over the
prospect of being forced to sit still 8
hours a day in arbitrary compliance to
Scholastic busy work of dubious import
he is today thought to be suffering from
ADHD that is
reification now before we go any further

please fill out an inquiry form on my

a paid consultation link is in the
description okay let's get back to
it all right but maybe that's just
because ADHD is usually diagnosed in
children who can't really advocate for
themselves effectively what about
something like major depressive disorder
that that affects a lot of adults right

[07:00]
that that affects a lot of adults right
okay here we go associate laboratory
findings no laboratory findings that are
diagnostic of a major depressive episode
have been
identified
H that's weird I mean we give people
chemicals to treat that Disorder so
shouldn't we be able to see that the
chemicals are out of whack before we
applied the
intervention guess not all right right
but that's probably because that's a
mood disorder and everyone knows that
mood is hazy and subjective right what
about schizophrenia H everyone knows
that that is the exception it's the gold
standard for the biological basis of
mental illness genetics brain anatomy
and all the rest here we go Associated
laboratory findings no laboratory
findings have been identified that are
diagnostic of
schizophrenia okay all right so I'm not
going to bore you by going through the
other 297 disorders they're all more or
less the same so are you saying that

[08:01]
less the same so are you saying that
these are fake problems Orion are you
saying that people are just making this
up and lying about their suffering no
I'm not while malingerers exist I
believe the vast majority of people are
accurately reporting their subjective
experience and that they are actually
suffering however I also believe that a
lot of this suffering is
[Music]
unnecessary which is one way to approach
Neurosis like my personal definition of
neurosis is taking a fake problem into a
real problem which then absolutely
becomes a real problem for instance
worrying about the straightness of your
picture frames a fake problem while your
house is on fire a real problem is
actually a real problem both for the
worrier and for the people around him
now it's actually hard to overstate the
importance of this issue as the
inability to objectively diagnose mental
illness opens the door to a lot of
potential squirl one of the most

[09:00]
potential squirl one of the most
important consequences is that it kind
of makes the individual less responsible
for the problem he is suffering from and
this is kind of by design it was part of
the intention behind medicalizing mental
illness it's cruel to hold people
responsible for things outside of their
control sometimes people might look
strange or act strange through no fault
of their own however this does not
necessarily mean that they brought this
condition on themselves or that they can
do anything about it now that it's here
so persecuting or ostracizing these
individuals just because they're
different is heartless and inhumane and
it's a big part of why we've
collectively come so far from the stigan
insane asylums of the 19th
century however most mental illnesses
are not like congenital or genetically
determined most of the symptoms that
constitute most mental illnesses are
brought on at least in part by the indiv
idual themselves and these people

[10:01]
idual themselves and these people
generally can do something about them
now that they're here but reification
can obscure this responsibility for many
people they believe that being depressed
or anxious is kind of like being
colorblind or congenitally diabetic
there's an issue inside of them that
kind of has nothing to do with them that
they just kind of have to learn to live
with and you can see this understanding
reflected in the language that people
use to describe these issues for
instance as you'll recall has trouble
holding attention is one of the symptom
criteria of
ADHD so when someone tells me H you know
I'm sorry Orion I'm having trouble
concentrating because of my
ADHD what I actually hear is H I'm sorry
Orion I'm having trouble concentrating
because of my trouble
concentrating right I mean after all as
far as we can tell the symptom is the
disorder so you can't really blame the
symptom
on anything other than itself but

[11:02]
on anything other than itself but
reification kind of creates a thing a
disorder inside of people that they can
blame in lie of assuming personal
responsibility over at least that
proportion of the variance of the issue
that resides within their domain of
control now maybe we do have this thing
inside of us that for whatever reason we
just can't see with all of our Advanced
Technologies like that's certainly
possible I mean the strong nuclear force
wasn't discovered until the 1930s and it
certainly existed before then so it's
very likely that we still can't see many
things that in the future will seem
manifest in obvious but right now we
can't but we act like we can and it's
this acting like that in my opinion is
creating a lot more problems than it's
solving and the biggest problem that
it's creating is an inappropriate
dependence on a privileged class of
Specialists who enjoy a monopoly on the
indic at treatment I'll talk more about

[12:01]
indic at treatment I'll talk more about
this in the second part of this episode
