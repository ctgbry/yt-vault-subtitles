Here's the real paradox, the real
tragedy of human relationships. If you
give people what they want or need, then
they will no longer want or need you. As
I say in the book, no one continues to
pay the plumber. You've undermined the
basis of the relationship in the
dischargement of the relationship. It's
totally messed up, but that's the nature
of things. And it's why relationships
are so difficult to maintain in the long
term. We enter into relationships
because we want or need things. But when
we receive those things, we no longer
need or want the relationship as much.
And as I've said before, the game does
not run on gratitude. A lot of people
get this wrong. A lot of people think
that because they've gone out of their
way to satisfy the needs or wants of the
other sometimes at great expense or
sacrifice to themselves that this will
secure them continued relationship into
the future. This is not true. Nothing

the future. This is not true. Nothing
guarantees continued relationship into
the future. But the best way to increase
the likelihood of continued relationship
into the future is to continue to
possess the means that will satisfy the
wants or needs of others.
