now in the beginning I would pray for
specific things to happen like may this
person's cancer go away or may this
person's heartbreak be resolved or may
this person's business be successful Etc
it's like I saw how people were
struggling and I wanted to remove what
seemed to be the external causes of that
suffering understandable right wouldn't
the world contain less suffering without
that disease or that pain or that
difficulty and I did that for a long
time however you really only have to
think about this for about 30 seconds
before realizing how silly it is praying
like this is treating God like Santa
Claus it's like sending your wish list
to the North Pole and waiting for
Christmas morning now there's nothing
wrong with asking for good things it's
certainly better than the alternative
but the idea that suffering is going to
be removed from this planet miraculously
by some Supernatural Force providing the
outcome I wish for in my own private
Consciousness is absurd and immature
prayer doesn't work like that and it
doesn't work like that because that's
not how suffering works
