I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is May all
beings be free of suffering
so like many of you I have a morning
routine that includes a prayer and a
meditation and one of the components of
this practice is that I consciously ask
for and intentionally pray that all
beings may be free of suffering this is
a traditional Buddhist chant or prayer
and it forms the essence of what we
might call a loving-kindness meditation
I do this almost every morning and I've
done this almost every morning for years
as a therapist I get to see the
suffering of individuals firsthand at
first blush many people seem to be
perfectly fine they are high functioning
they can hold a job pay their taxes and
maintain their relationships however
when people start to tell the truth
about how they're really feeling you
quickly realize how much suffering and
how much unnecessary suffering exists on

[01:00]
how much unnecessary suffering exists on
this planet and I hate to see it like I
wish it would just all go away
and that's what motivated me to begin to
pray that all beings be free of
suffering
now in the beginning I would pray for
specific things to happen like may this
person's cancer go away or made this
person's heartbreak be resolved or may
this person's business be successful
Etc it's like I saw how people were
struggling and I wanted to remove what
seemed to be the external causes of that
suffering understandable right wouldn't
the world contain less suffering without
that disease or that pain or that
difficulty and I did that for a long
time
however you really only have to think
about this for about 30 seconds before
realizing how silly it is praying like
this is treating God like Santa Claus
it's like sending your wish list to the
North Pole and waiting for Christmas
morning
now there's nothing wrong with asking
for good things it's certainly better

[02:00]
for good things it's certainly better
than the alternative but the idea that
suffering is going to be removed from
this planet miraculously by some
Supernatural Force providing the outcome
I wish for in my own private
Consciousness is absurd and immature
prayer doesn't work like that and it
doesn't work like that because that's
not how suffering works
what does this mean
the fact of the matter is that the vast
majority of suffering on this planet is
unnecessary and that unnecessary
suffering is caused by ignorance of
course malice exists but malice is
actually a special form of ignorance and
ignorance of the underlying nature of
reality
if it's true that most people are
generally doing the best they can then
it must also be true that most people
have a lot to learn
their consciousnesses are dark and
confused and they are also mostly
responsible for the suffering that they
experience which has more to do with
their thoughts beliefs and behaviors

[03:01]
their thoughts beliefs and behaviors
than with external reality
just think about it
was that cancer patient peaceful and
content prior to his diagnosis
was that heartbroken woman grateful and
joyful before her relationship ended
was that business owner hopeful and
equilibrated before his money problems
almost certainly not if it wasn't cancer
or heartbreak or failure it would have
been something else
just consider how discontent so many
people are in the midst of relative
safety abundance convenience comfort and
stability
if suffering especially the unnecessary
kind has much more to do with our
judgment and understanding than it has
to do with external reality
then what real good is it to change the
circumstances of external reality
that's like a doctor who treats a
patient's symptoms because he lacks the
knowledge or ability to cure the
underlying disease
it was at this point that I realized

[04:01]
it was at this point that I realized
that in praying that all beings may be
free of suffering what I was
functionally asking for and hoping for
was for people to finally wake the [ __ ]
up
and understand the extent to which they
are contributing to their pain and
suffering and difficulty by examining
themselves their thoughts and beliefs
their words and actions their judgments
and perceptions
people need to understand that suffering
arises within themselves and that it
this must be the place from which that
suffering is removed
the desire that people be free of
suffering is isomorphic with the desire
that people wake the [ __ ] up
that's what's actually required to
transform this world
now before I go any further if you like
what you're hearing please consider
hitting the thanks button it's right
underneath the video that you're
watching right now and tip me in
proportion to the value you feel you
derive from this message

[05:00]
derive from this message
it's word of it's these little donations
that make all of this possible you see I
don't do a lot of like big product
endorsements and things like that so I
kind of rely on these donations to make
everything possible I really appreciate
your support thank you
now
don't think about the person that really
needs to hear this message
you're the person who really needs to
hear this message you're the person who
needs to wake the [ __ ] up
you still suffer and I'm sure you do
this message is meant for you
if you continue to suffer you haven't
yet arrived at full awareness if you
continue to experience impatience and
anger and despair and hopelessness and
envy you haven't woken up yet your
thinking is still clouded and your
beliefs don't yet align with reality
and as you awaken you will experience
pain
among other forms there will be the pain
of realizing how wrong you've been for
so long and the pain of realizing how

[06:00]
so long and the pain of realizing how
little time you may have left to make
things right
the pain of Awakening
is painful but as I discussed in one of
my very first episodes pain is
inevitable we need to choose the path
that takes us where we want to go as
opposed to the path that seems to
contain less pain that's likely an
illusion and with greater awareness we
can divest ourselves of our delusion and
ignorance and increasingly walk in the
direction of light and Truth
and that's probably the only way we're
going to get out of here
it's also important to appreciate the
general Consciousness on this planet is
still very low it's higher than it used
to be but still pretty low
however what I've discovered is that as
a person wakes up that Awakening
radiates out from that individual
through his or her relationships to
affect others and that these individual
Awakenings begin to create a positive
effect for their close relationships for
their communities for their little parts

[07:01]
their communities for their little parts
of the world
and these Awakenings make it much more
likely that another person will be
willing and able to drop the illusion
the delusion and the ignorance and begin
to wake up as well
sometimes all it takes is a model of
courage and peace a lot of people didn't
have that
a lot of people have had bad teachers
which helps to explain their performance
as students if you don't have one find
one and if you found one be one
that's the path forward
so that's what I wanted to say stop
seeking the causes of suffering outside
of yourself because you're looking in
the wrong place if you still suffer you
need to look inside and determine what
beliefs thoughts or behaviors are
responsible for that suffering and work
to bring those things more in line with
truth and reality it's not an easy
process it's not a process devoid of
pain but really what the [ __ ] else are
you going to do with your time
it's our best possible chance not only

[08:02]
it's our best possible chance not only
of minimizing our own unnecessary
suffering but of making the world a less
hellacious place as well
