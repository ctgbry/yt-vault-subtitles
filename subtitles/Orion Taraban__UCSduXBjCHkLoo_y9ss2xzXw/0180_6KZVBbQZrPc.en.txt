i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
we'll see
this is a real simple mind hack that
i've developed to guard myself against
disappointment and frustration look i
talk to people for a living and as a
consequence of spending tens of
thousands of hours in conversation with
other people
i can tell you
that you shouldn't put too much faith in
what people say
people will say things and they won't
follow through
or they'll follow through for a time and
then drop it entirely
they'll tell me they want one thing but
they'll chase something completely
different
people are not always honest with me
because they're not always honest with
themselves and to a certain extent this
is inevitable because we all have blind
spots but my point here is that you
should basically take everything people
say with a grain of salt
if someone tells me that they're going
to do something my emotional reaction is
like oh
thank god relief they're finally gonna

[01:01]
thank god relief they're finally gonna
do it yay victory
when someone tells me they're gonna do
something i say to myself
we'll see
unless the person has exceptionally high
integrity the fact that that verbal
commitment occurred is actually no
guarantee of future action
all know that somebody has actually made
the commitment when their behavior
aligns with that commitment over time
and until i see that behavioral
alignment i'm going to withhold judgment
as to whether or not this behavior is
actually going to occur
i don't doubt people per se
i don't roll my eyes and think uh yeah
right you're full of it
i don't doubt them
but i don't really trust them either
i don't take their their verbal
commitment as proof of their inevitable
behavioral alignment both my doubt and
my trust are earned
by watching whether people do what they

[02:00]
by watching whether people do what they
say they're going to do
and because i kind of neither trust nor
doubt words
i often
don't feel disappointed or frustrated
with other people
so take what people say with a grain of
salt when someone says that something is
going to happen or it's not going to
happen mentally say we'll see
until you have consistent behavioral
confirmation that aligns with that
commitment
what do you think
