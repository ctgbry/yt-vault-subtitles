I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cicax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is you can't
have any relationship with anyone this
took me so many years to understand so
please learn from my pain so that you
don't have to experience it yourself
basically when I was younger I used to
believe that I could have any type of
relationship I wanted with anyone or to
put it another way I used to believe
that I could have the type of
relationship I wanted with the person I
just happened to be attracted to and
that is not true you can't have any
relationship with anyone you can only
have certain relationships with certain
people if you believe that you can have
a relationship with anyone you are
likely going to be fitting a square peg
in a round hole you're going to believe
that you should be able to make it work
if you just put in enough effort
relationships take work right so you're

[01:01]
relationships take work right so you're
going to believe that if you only
communicate better or go to therapy or
understand each other or learn to
compromise or work even harder then you
should be able to have the type of
relationship that you want with the
person you want to have it with
this is the consequence of believing
that you can have any relationship with
anyone and this belief gets people into
a lot of trouble it creates a lot of
heartbreak a lot of wasted time a lot of
unnecessary expense and it adds to the
host of human misery on this planet
fortunately there is a way out
however before I explain what this is

so what's the alternative to this belief
a much better idea is to try to fit the
relationship to the person instead of
the other way around
get better at understanding the type of
relationship you can have with the
specific person in question and how do
you do this
by developing your discernment you have
to be able to look at someone
objectively and dispassionately and this
is no small thing if you are highly
attracted to them because attraction
distorts perception this is why I say it
is generally a very good idea to date
for at least six months minimum before
you allow yourself to become emotionally
involved with someone if you allow your
heart to get involved too early in the
process you compromise your ability to

[03:00]
process you compromise your ability to
accurately discern the other person
which can lead to some very painful
realizations further down the road once
the Euphoria of the initial attraction
wears off this means that you have to
have some measure of discipline with
respect to your emotions to be able to
see the other person clearly enough to
know what he or she is capable of and
potentially what he or she is not
capable of
the good news is that if we're being
honest with ourselves crazy is actually
pretty easy to spot yes there are some
malicious and predatory people out there
who can hide it well but you can
generally see most Troublesome people
coming from a mile away the issue is
that people tend to lie to themselves
and turn to Blind Eye to the obvious red
flags because
they believe they can have any
relationship with anyone and because
they have already decided to become
emotionally involved

[04:01]
emotionally involved
and the complement to dispassionate
discernment is accurate self-knowledge
this means knowing who you are and what
actually works for you over and above
what you want which is something else
entirely people want things that are not
good for them every single day of the
year this is not only because people are
foolish and emotional but also because
most of what people think they want was
not self-generated it it was interjected
into their minds by their families of
origin and their larger culture this
does not constitute accurate
self-knowledge
we can now put two and two together on
the One Hand by knowing who you are and
what actually works for you and on the
other hand by learning to see people
with dispassionate discernment you can
make much more prudent decisions with

[05:01]
make much more prudent decisions with
respect to whether the person you're
actually dealing with has the capacity
to give you the type of relationship you
might be looking for
this isn't very sexy
and this is not always fun it's way more
fun to just get carried away and let
passion take over but I've discovered
that that's an invitation to chaos and
misery further down the road
as far as I can tell if you want to have
a harmonious peaceful relationship that
can actually go the distance there's no
way around this you have to know
yourself well enough to know what
actually works for you and you have to
have enough critical discernment to
accurately vet the other person
otherwise you're just rolling the dice
or bullshitting yourself
what do you think have you found this to
be true in your own experience let me
know in the comments below and thank you
for listening
