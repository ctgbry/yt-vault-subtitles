I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psychs
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is
responding to my female critics so as
I've said in previous episodes the
overwhelming response to my channel has
been positive and I'm very appreciative
and grateful for that however a very
small percentage of the feedback that
I've received has been quite negative
and it always involves my discussions on
intersexual Dynamics and even within
that space the thing that has gotten me
the most Flack is my discussion on
women's optimal dating strategies within
the Contemporary sexual Marketplace I've
done a series on this topic on my
channel and I've spoken about these
strategies on some of my media
appearances and even within that topic
the thing that has generated by far the
most vitriolic reaction is my advice
that women be the nastiest
versions of themselves with the men they
want to have relationships with like

[01:00]
want to have relationships with like
that one piece of advice is probably
responsible for 90% of my negative
feedback and because I'm authentically
interested in helping people and because
this seems to be an issue I want to use
this episode to respond to a few of the
more substantive pieces of criticism
I've heard with respect to this piece of
advice and I Ed the term substantive
because the vast majority of that
feedback was not substantive and does
not deserve to be discussed okay here we
go the first first thing you have to
understand is that women have to be the
nastiest versions of
themselves with
somebody like they have to that's the
nature of superlatives so whether she's
consciously intending it or not the fact
of the matter is that every woman will
be the nastiest version of
themselves with
someone what I'm advising is that she be
the Nast version of herself
with the man she wants to have a

[02:00]
with the man she wants to have a
relationship with so if you're
disagreeing with that statement and you
concede that she has to be the nastiest
version of herself with
someone that means that you're
functionally arguing that she should be
the nastiest version of
herself with someone she doesn't want to
be in a relationship with and how
exactly does that serve a woman's dating
goals like if she has to be the nastiest
version of herself with
somebody why shouldn't she use that
behavior instrumentally and
strategically in order to secure a
relationship with a good Prospect
because it will absolutely help her to
secure a relationship with that prospect
on the other hand encouraging the
Converse that a woman should be the
nasty as version of herself
like irrespective of whether she desires
a relationship with the man in question
like that's even than what I'm
recommending do you understand what I'm
saying so if it's
inescapable that someone must benefit

[03:00]
inescapable that someone must benefit
from that side of her why not have it be
the man with whom she desires a
relationship use that side strategically
okay so that's the first piece of
substantive criticism the second piece
goes a little something like this well
Orion wouldn't following your advice
just create this like slippery slope to
the bottom like if every woman has to be
the nastiest version of
herself with every subsequent man she
wants to have a relationship with
wouldn't this just lead to women
becoming these like degraded sexual
animals now I have a couple of responses
to this criticism in the first place
like I mentioned in the original episode
this advice doesn't necessarily have to
do with sex now obviously it could but
if you're a young woman and all you've
ever done is hold a boy's hand this
advice still applies because there are
ways of holding a boy's hand that
communicate say platonic friendship and
there are ways of holding a boy's hand

[04:02]
there are ways of holding a boy's hand
that directly impart say a tantalizing
sensuality in giving this advice I'm
trying to include as many of the
straight women in the sexual Marketplace
as possible which includes young
inexperienced women who may still be
virgins and I'm definitely not
suggesting that they just throw that
away wanly all right now in the second
place there might be some truth to this
objection like if you follow this advice
it does mean that with each subsequent
attempt to secure a relationship a woman
will need to be at least as nasty and
as the last attempt but here's
the thing between holding hands and like
porn star sex 10 minutes into the first
date there is a
long long

[05:01]
long long
distance you do not go from one to the
other overnight so if that's what's
happening the issue is not with my
advice my advice is good the issue is
with the woman's discernment with
respect to the men to whom she is
strategically showing that side of
herself because if the woman is in the
degraded porn star stage that probably
means that she's implemented this
strategy incorrectly dozens if not
hundreds of times so the problem is not
the strategy it's in the deployment so
that's the second piece of substantive
criticism now before I go any further if
you're liking what you're hearing please

get back to it now the third piece of
criticism kind of Dub tals with what I
was just saying which is that this
advice just doesn't work like if there
are women who have implemented this
advice dozens or hundreds of times
doesn't that suggest the strategy was
ineffec in securing the
relationship good question what we have
to understand is that in today's sexual
Marketplace in which sex proceeds
commitment I'm sorry in which sex
precedes commitment but in which men
continue to be The Gatekeepers of
commitment women generally have to use
sex to secure commitment men are
defended against commitment in the same
way that women are defended against sex
like women don't and shouldn't give sex

[07:01]
like women don't and shouldn't give sex
away to every man who wants it by the
same token men don't and shouldn't just
give commitment away to every woman who
wants it remember wanting is free it
costs nothing to want but it costs
something to give and women providing
sex is no longer sufficient to secure
commitment this is because in today's
sexual Marketplace it is expected and
just like women don't NE necessarily
reward men just for doing what is
expected of them men don't necessarily
reward women for the same it is what it
is the point is just like women are
disincentivized from opening the gate of
sex to everybody and anybody who wants
it Men Are disincentivized from opening
the gate of commitment to anybody and
everybody who wants that women what's
going to open that gate is not you
standing outside declaring that you're

[08:01]
standing outside declaring that you're
looking for a serious
relationship that is like a Salesman
knocking on your door and saying Hey I
want to make some money here open up
it's like yeah I get that but what's
that got to do with me both are entering
the interaction exclusively focused on
what they want I want to make some money
I want a committed relationship let me
in like what are you talking about so
how does a Salesman actually get you to
engage AG by offering something that the
other person might want and with respect
to relationships between men and women
it's safe to assume that something the
other person might want is sex if a
woman stands in front of a man's gate
and instead offers a sexual opportunity
it will significantly increase the
likelihood that he will open it up and
invite her in that's why I say this is
the Trojan Horse of getting a committed
relationship now that in itself is not

[09:00]
relationship now that in itself is not
enough to secure a relationship that's
why I did a series on this topic it's
not just one thing but it is generally
enough to get you through the door and
you have to get through the door in
order to stay in the house now a lot of
women are afraid of just being used for
a short-term sexual experience and then
cast out but that does kind of mean that
you're further along like you have to be
let in first in order to be cast out and
this strategy is for women who have ulty
getting in with the men with whom they
most want to have relationships in order
to stay in you need a different strategy
just like it's presumptuous or entitled
to assume that you should just be let in
it's arrogant or cluess to think that
you need to do nothing to stay there
this is functionally equivalent to
thinking that just because you went to
the interview you should get the job now
in some markets attending the interview
will be sufficient however if you're in

[10:00]
will be sufficient however if you're in
a very competitive industry where
they're interviewing hundreds of
applicants it's probably not enough just
to show up to the interview you might
have to follow up and leverage your
connections and go above and beyond to
demonstrate that you're the most
compelling applicant for the position
and if you don't it's like too bad so
sad because the cost of winning is
overpaying to beat your competition you
have to be willing to do things that
they won't you you have to understand
that from a professional standpoint if a
company is interviewing a 100 applicants
the likelihood that the position will go
to the most objectively deserving person
is quite small obviously the position
will go to the one who checks the boxes
but there's probably going to be more
than one person in that cohort who
checks the boxes so the position will
likely go to the one in that smaller
subset that plays his or her cards right
and the way to play your card right with
a man is after you get access to him by

[11:02]
a man is after you get access to him by
communicating a sexual opportunity to
make yourself
useful being useful is what will prevent
you from being cast out if you've been
let in and the higher the value of the
man you're targeting the more you will
likely need to contend with competition
to secure a relationship with him and
you win that position just like in
business by being willing to do what
your competition won't make sense I hope
that clears a few things up and I wish
all the ladies out there happy Hunting
