I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology the
topic of today's short talk is the
fundamental attribution error
the fundamental attribution error is a
very important cognitive bias shared by
almost all human beings that's why
psychologists have termed it fundamental
or the most basic or Universal
attribution error or form of bias that
they've observed in people across
cultures consequently it's important to
understand what this is because it's
almost certainly operating in your life
and probably to your detriment now
before I explain this error please
remember to like this video And

so what is the fundamental attribution
error it's very simple it's basically

[01:00]
error it's very simple it's basically
that I evaluate my successes character
logically and my failures contextually
but I evaluate other people's failures
characterologically and their successes
contextually
so those are a lot of big words
therefore let's make sure that we're on
the same page with a concrete example of
the error at work
when I show up on time
it's because I'm somebody who values
punctuality but if I'm late
it's because I was stuck in traffic
on the other hand if somebody else shows
up on time it's because they're just
doing their job
but if they show up late it's because
they're disrespectful
make sense
do you see how this might create all
kinds of nastiness and interpersonal
relationships
in the fundamental attribution error we
are basically giving ourselves the
benefit of the doubt and throwing other
people under the bus
we also tend to Rob others of their good

[02:02]
we also tend to Rob others of their good
qualities and think inappropriately
highly of ourselves
now it seems like this is the default
mode of evaluation which is why it's the
fundamental attribution error according
to psychologists so we don't necessarily
have to beat ourselves up
if we recognize this tenancy in
ourselves
but we can also work to overcome this
bias as well it's not easy but it's
possible and if you're interested the
best way to overcome this bias as a
mental discipline is to consciously
reverse the attribution
give other people the benefit of the
doubt and be harder and stricter with
yourself
this creates generosity in interpersonal
relationships and this is generally well
received it makes people like you more
and by being harder and stricter with
yourself you give yourself the
opportunity to grow and develop as a

[03:01]
opportunity to grow and develop as a
person with the right attitude you can
see your failings as an opportunity for
growth over which you have some measure
of control and responsibility
these failings become your growing Edge
and in this way by consciously reversing
the bias you're constantly given fuel
for your own self-improvement and how is
that not to your benefit something to
keep in mind
