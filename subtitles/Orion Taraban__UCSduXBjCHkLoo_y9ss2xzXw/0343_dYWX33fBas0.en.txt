I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is if it's
worth doing
if you grew up in the United States you
probably know the rest of this saying
that is if something's worth doing
it's worth doing well
and absolutely there is some truth to
that it's generally a positive force to
strive after Perfection and there are
certain things that absolutely shouldn't
even be attempted if you're not willing
to do them with a high degree of
competence brain surgery
and deep sea exploration come to mind
that's because even a small error in
each of these Endeavors could frustrate
the entire project
that said I've come to adopt a different
view of this adage as I've grown older
and before I tell you what that is
please be sure to like this episode And
subscribe to this channel it takes less
than a second costs you nothing and it's
how you can demonstrate your own
commitment to Excellence so do the thing

[01:01]
commitment to Excellence so do the thing
as I was saying nowadays I see things a
little differently that is I now believe
that if something is worth doing it's
worth doing poorly
let me try to make an argument in
defense of this reframe sometimes people
are prevented from taking positive or
constructive action because of their own
perfectionistic tendencies
and these inactions and hesitations over
time can have a substantially
deleterious impact on people's lives and
well-being let's take a concrete example
I think we can all agree that exercising
and being physically fit is something
worth doing well if that's true then
it's worth doing badly that is it's
worth doing even if you're not going to
get shredded and end up with six-pack
abs it's worth doing even if you're not
going to break any records for Speed or
strength or distance and even exercising
once a week which isn't all that good is

[02:00]
once a week which isn't all that good is
probably better than not exercising at
all
if something is worth doing it's worth
doing poorly because these poor attempts
can accumulate over time and create
significant progress
or at least delay significant decay a
lot of the difficulties that people
encounter in their lives are directly
attributable to their tendency to
Discount small improvements
one push-up does not make you strong
dieting for one week does not make you
sick
working for one month doesn't make you
rich
because there is no immediate positive
reinforcement for their efforts people
tend to minimize and discount these
constructive actions and I think that's
ultimately to their detriment by the
same token because there is no immediate
negative punishment for their inaction
people tend to minimize and discount
their non-constructive evasions
and what happens put two and two

[03:00]
and what happens put two and two
together and the bad tends to accumulate
while the good goes neglected
this is why I believe that if something
is worth doing do it sloppily do it
infrequently do it imperfectly do it
poorly
but do it anyway
why because it's worth doing
in many cases a little of a good thing
is preferable To None of a better
and I believe this principle holds true
at all levels of analysis from
individual health
all the way to the fate of humanity
what do you think let me know your
comments in uh the section below and
thank you for listening
