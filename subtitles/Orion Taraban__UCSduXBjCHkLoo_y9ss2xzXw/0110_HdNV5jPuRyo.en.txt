i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
truth and lies
now we as a society have been dealing
very intimately with the concept of
truth these past two years
for example one way we deal with truth
on a daily basis is in the form of
social media fact checkers whose stated
purpose is to restrict suppress and
censor alleged misinformation
disinformation and lies
unfortunately even if we assume good
intentions on the part of those who do
perform this service
there is a problem with this approach
the problem with this approach is that
while lies can be dangerous
the suppression of dialogue which
reveals truth is actually much more
dangerous than the dissemination of lies
if lies circulate it's likely
unavoidable that at least some people

[01:00]
unavoidable that at least some people
for some time will be ensnared in the
untruth
but over time if truth is also freely
circulating it's not really possible for
the lies to get much of a foothold in
the collective consciousness
in the vast majority of cases it's a
self-corrective process
it's only possible for circulating lives
to enjoy widespread uptake through the
suppression of truth and dialogue
and that's why only truth needs to be
suppressed lies don't need to be
allow them to circulate and the truth
will dispel them in time only truth
needs to be suppressed because truth can
destroy lies but lies can't destroy
truth
all the darkness in the world can't
snuff out a single flame
and a single flame is all that is
necessary to dispel the surrounding
darkness
now
in the time between the circulating of a
lie and its obliteration by the truth a
great deal of harm can be done
so if we give them the benefit of the

[02:01]
so if we give them the benefit of the
doubt
we could presume that those looking to
prevent the circulation of a lie are
trying to prevent or at least reduce the
harm caused by its circulation
but the problem with that perspective is
that no one side and certainly no
centralized authority has a monopoly on
the truth
and what i think we've discovered in our
collective experiments in civilization
over hundreds or thousands of years is
that the truth most reliably manifests
in open dialogue between opposing
viewpoints
this isn't always the case but i think
that all other things being equal the
free exchange of information is our best
bet for facilitating the emergence of
truth
and that truth is a natural antidote to
lies
so we might not need to be so concerned
with the circulation of lies if we also
have free and open dialogue from which
truth can emerge and propagate

[03:01]
truth can emerge and propagate
in my mind the suppression of alleged
misinformation
would be equivalent to launching a
crusade against all viruses bacteria and
pathological agents that could
potentially cause harm to humans as
opposed to the cultivation of healthy
immune systems in common sense
this is because the former is likely an
impossible goal while the latter is not
a healthy immune system and common sense
can also effectively stave off most
viruses and bacteria suggesting that
that should be our frontline defense
focusing on one while ignoring the other
would be foolish
my argument is that the same holds true
with truth and lies the suppression of
all alleged misinformation
is likely an impossible goal and one
that should be less of a collective
priority than ensuring the free exchange
of information which facilitates the
emergence of truth
