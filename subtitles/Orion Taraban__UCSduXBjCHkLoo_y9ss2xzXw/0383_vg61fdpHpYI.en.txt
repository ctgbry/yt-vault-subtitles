I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is rejecting
women is a skill men this is extremely
important to learn how to do for several
reasons first and foremost you must
understand that wanting is free that is
it costs the wanter absolutely nothing
to want things but it costs The Giver
something to give things so there is
actually this inherent asymmetry in
wanting and giving wanting is free
giving is costly this is why it's
actually a fairly decent interpersonal
strategy to want a lot of things this is
because it's a low-cost low resource
strategy that every once in a while will
actually succeed in securing The Wanted
thing so it's almost like magic through
wanting you are sometimes able to
conjure value out of nothing simply by
wanting it from the right person

[01:02]
wanting it from the right person
add to this the social script that men
are taught from Boyhood that their role
is a provider in a relationship and you
have the perfect conditions for an
unconscious reinforcement protocol on
the one hand there is little incentive
for women to stop wanting things from
men because at least every once in a
while the wanting works so it's
maintained through variable reward
schedules and on the other hand men are
often punished for not giving women what
they want usually with emotional
punishments like shame guilt-tripping
and withholding and so the male behavior
is maintained through negative
reinforcement it's a simple trap but it
ensnares millions of men the fact of the
matter is that most people especially
women will never stop wanting things
from you and the more successful you
become the more people will want more

[02:00]
become the more people will want more
things from you and this is certainly
true in the sexual Marketplace the more
successful you are with women that is
the more optionality you have the more
desirable you are the more attractive
you become more women are going to want
more things from you their wanting is
free however your giving will cost you
time energy opportunity and money
this is why it is very very important to
learn how to reject women whether you
like it or not you have limited
quantities of these resources and if you
spend them as if they were unlimited you
will eventually find yourself depleted
and alone this is because women
generally don't stick around when you
have nothing left to give and among the
various resources spent by givers the
limiting factor especially the more
successful you become
is time time is your most precious

[03:01]
is time time is your most precious
resource simply wanting time is not
sufficient grounds to give it
I'd want my time too
so just like you're not out there on the
street handing out a hundred dollar
bills to everyone who asks you can't
give your time to everyone who requests
it men must learn to reject women now

now the main reason why guys really
struggle with rejecting women besides
the cultural scripting mentioned earlier
is scarcity mentality most men do not

[04:02]
is scarcity mentality most men do not
have options with women and this puts
them in a place where it's really tough
for them to reject them even when the
women are obviously not good for them
it's like if I only had one client it
would be pretty tough for me to say no
to that client even if his requests
deviated from my standard practice I'd
be caught between my values and my
livelihood which is a pretty difficult
place to be
I might need that client more than that
client needs me
which would put me in a disempowered
position relative to that client
this is why success and optionality can
actually make men more virtuous
as they are not pulled to compromise
their values for any one person or
opportunity
so a lot of guys just can't fathom
saying no to a woman because that woman
is like their only client however let's
now assume that you're actually a

[05:00]
now assume that you're actually a
successful guy who has increased
optionality with women
another reason why guys struggle with
rejecting women is that for lack of a
better word they fear their emotional
response they are afraid that saying no
will provoke the woman's anger or
jeopardize the continuation of the
relationship and let's be real that can
certainly happen
there are a lot of entitled women out
there who are used to being Daddy's
Little Princess and have not experienced
enough personal rejection from men she
has yet to develop the emotional callous
that would enable her to treat no as
information and not a personal affront
so while it's possible that a woman May
storm out of your life if you don't give
her what she wants it's probably for the
best that she created a vacancy
a lot of guys fear this negative
emotional reaction because of the way
that they were brought up
maybe they grew up with mothers or
sisters who were tyrannical and

[06:00]
sisters who were tyrannical and
emotionally manipulative and with
fathers or brothers who were unwilling
or unable to stand up to them spending
the first 18 years of their lives in
this environment trains men to believe
from a very young age that a
relationship with a woman is predicated
on catering to her desires or else
and that is absolutely not the basis of
a healthy or fulfilling relationship for
either party
however if a man does not challenge this
script he can find himself in all kinds
of really difficult relationships as an
adult
so you need to be able to reject women
in order to safeguard your limited
resources but why is this a skill
it's a skill because you can learn to
reject women
in ways that actually make them feel
better as a result
believing that rejecting another person
will hurt them is kind of a
self-fulfilling prophecy if you go into

[07:01]
self-fulfilling prophecy if you go into
an interaction with the assumption that
you're about to deliver a painful
hurtful piece of news that will be
difficult for the other person to hear
you might be training the other person
to feel hurt as a consequence of your
delivery
consider the possibility that you could
actually leave a woman better than you
found her as a result of rejecting her
don't believe me let me give you a quick
example from my own life several years
ago I had a first date with a woman we
met for a drink had an easy flirtatious
conversation with good chemistry and
went our separate ways a week later I
texted her to schedule a second date two
minutes after I sent the text she called
me on the phone
and we had a three minute conversation
that I swear to God
basically went like this she said Orion
I got your invitation and here's the
thing
I know based on our date last week that

[08:00]
I know based on our date last week that
you're a man that I could fall deeply
passionately in love with
you're attractive you're intelligent
you're successful
you have everything that I'm looking for
in a man
and because of that I'm afraid of losing
myself in a relationship with you
so while I'm tempted by what you're
offering I have to stay away
as I'm just so attracted to you and
wouldn't know how to control myself
and I said all right well thanks for
letting me know and if you change your
mind you know how to find me and we hung
up and I left that conversation feeling
like a million bucks I mean what just
happened this woman said no to me she
said no to a second date let's not have
any Illusions about this she rejected me
but she rejected me in such a way that I
felt really good about being rejected
her rejection was like a compliment
now she was probably just feeding me a
line but that doesn't really matter the
point is that rejection doesn't have to
be a painful hurtful experience for the

[09:01]
be a painful hurtful experience for the
recipient if you approach it in the
right way
this is why rejecting women is a skill
and all successful men must Master it
