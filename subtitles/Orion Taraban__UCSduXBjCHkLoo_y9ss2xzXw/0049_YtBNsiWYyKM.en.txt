i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
get some side quests
in case you don't know i'm a big fan of
video games and of role playing games or
rpgs in particular and i'm stealing the
concept of the side quest from this
source
in your average rpg you have kind of
your main story arc in which you and
your fellow adventurers are trying to
save the world or something
however along the way there are often
hundreds of opportunities to engage in
smaller tasks at smaller stakes and we
call these side quests
completing them isn't necessary to
progress the game but they can be a lot
of fun and a welcome break from pure
plot development they also generally
offer a host of rewards both tangible
like money and items and intangible like
stat increases in character development
and finally they could simply be a means
to a virtual trophy or a sense of
completion accomplishments in their own

[01:00]
completion accomplishments in their own
right
in my clinical practice i highly
recommend that my clients get some side
quests
the main story arcs of your life your
character development your marriage and
family take
decades to complete
if you don't interrupt their development
from time to time with some more
immediately rewarding goals
your life is subject to becoming a
joyless slog with little novelty or
variety
side quests spice things up and help
ensure that you receive some meaningful
intermittent rewards along the way to
your ultimate destination
so let's identify some side quests
to do this i would encourage you to
differentiate the various domains of
your life your personal life your health
and fitness your friendships your
spiritual development etc
and then come up with some goals for
each one of these domains and these
goals should have different deadlines as
well
for instance there are some goals that i
would like to accomplish before i die

[02:00]
would like to accomplish before i die
which means that i take meaningful
action towards their completion every
year
on the other hand there are some goals
that i would like to accomplish within
the next 12 months which means that i
need to take action toward their
completion every week
this is important because if i've
already enumerated all of these goals
whenever i have some free time on my
hands i can just go to my menu
peruse the list of side quests i've
accepted and determine which would be
the easiest to complete given my current
status
and in this way
i can lead a life that's rather varied
and productive and interesting and
rewarding and if i can do it you can do
it so get yourself some side quests
they're where the fun is
