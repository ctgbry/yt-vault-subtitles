i'm dr orion tarabam and this is psychax
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is do you
want your boss's job
so most of us are not quite where we
want to be in terms of our respective
career trajectories and this is normal
since we're talking about a process that
can often take years if not decades to
accomplish
we're in a process of becoming
and to this end it is
very very important to carefully examine
whether the path you're on will actually
take you where you want to go
in the majority of cases the easiest way
to do that is to ask yourself
would you want your boss's job
if you continue on your current
trajectory the most likely outcome is
that one day
you will come to occupy your
supervisor's position
is that position what you want
look carefully at what the person who
currently occupies that role is doing

[01:00]
currently occupies that role is doing
the actual duties and responsibilities
what's the quality of this person's life
like
does this person seem happy and
fulfilled
it's very easy especially when you're
young and relatively new to business to
idealize positions of power and
privilege in dominance hierarchies but
the truth is that it's not all fun and
games when you get up there
in fact many of these folks are
overwhelmed by demands responsibility
and decision-making
they don't have good work-life balance
and their roles often consume larger and
larger portions of their lives this is
often due to the competitiveness of
these roles if they don't take on more
there will always be someone else who
will
so for a lot of folks success actually
produces a rather joyless and stressful
existence
that said these folks are of course
generally very well compensated however
many don't have time to spend the money

[02:00]
many don't have time to spend the money
they work so hard to earn
so their efforts often benefit others
more directly
look very carefully would you want your
boss's job
and if the answer is no
on some level you owe it to yourself to
have a really honest conversation with
the person in the mirror
you might need to course correct before
you invest even more years of your life
to secure that outcome
i mean if you don't want the prize don't
play the game
play a different game make sure that
that game has a prize you consider worth
winning
i hope that makes sense if you like what
