i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychex
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is rest is
not a waste of time
i talk to a lot of stressed out burned
out individuals in the course of my
clinical practice
and a recurring refrain from these
individuals is that they're too busy to
rest
if they had more time
then they would be able to take a break
however given current demands they can't
afford to slack off
and this belief of course facilitates
the burnout and increases the likelihood
of accident illness
and collapse
now if you examine this perspective
its existence must be predicated on some
variant of the belief that rest is
wasted time
that it's unproductive time
and that it's therefore economically
unreasonable to prioritize rest over
more
task directed activity

[01:00]
task directed activity
but that's sort of like arguing that
stopping for gas is a waste of time on a
road trip
or believing that you should be able to
drive indefinitely without refueling
if you actually were to drive your car
as if you never needed to fill up the
tank
eventually that car is going to stop
functioning which will compromise the
overarching objective of that road trip
you're literally not going to get very
far with that attitude
a more reasonable perspective is
considering refueling to be absolutely
essential to the success of the
long-term goal
it's not something that can be dispensed
with as wasteful or needless it's
neither
right now i'm thinking of the adage
attributed to abraham lincoln if i had
eight hours to chop down a tree i'd
spend the first six of them sharpening
my axe
it's generally more effective to
implement concerted incisive action that
is supported by longer periods of rest
and preparation
than it is to expend all your energies

[02:01]
than it is to expend all your energies
in unrelenting and tireless activity
so i'd invite you to really examine this
do you believe that rest is a waste of
time
if you do you might need to content
yourself with more modest achievements
for greater endeavors
rest must be understood as a necessary
condition of your ultimate success
