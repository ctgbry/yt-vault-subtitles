I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology the
topic of today's short talk is
overcoming imposter syndrome
feeling like an imposter is actually a
fairly common psychological experience
it generally affects young people which
makes sense Young Folks are just
starting out in life and initiating
their careers they have limited
experience by definition and they can
find themselves in roles that have more
impressive titles than their competence
May warrant and so there is a felt
disjunct between the expectations of
others and their own capacities to
discharge them imposter syndrome however
is not unique to young people it can
afflict anyone especially when they move
into a position with a higher degree of
power and responsibility today I'm going
to be talking about the Paradox at the
heart of imposter syndrome how to
resolve it generally and my own
experience overcoming this feeling as a
novice therapist
that's right what you have to first

[01:00]
that's right what you have to first
understand is that there is a paradox at
the heart of this syndrome rationally it
makes no sense whatsoever here's why
on the one hand imposters believe that
they are completely incompetent and
inept and that it's only a matter of
time before the more competent and
capable people whom they serve and work
under will discover the truth about
their incompetence
and on the other hand in order for the
syndrome to exist imposters must also
believe that they are sufficiently
competent and capable to fool all the
people whom they serve and work under
people that they also believe to be more
competent and capable than they are into
believing that they are in fact
competent and capable
that's the Paradox at the core of
imposter syndrome I'm incompetent at my
job but I'm competent enough to fool
everyone around me into thinking that
I'm not you see it's completely
irrational both of those things can't

[02:00]
irrational both of those things can't
really be true at the same time
so how does one resolve imposter
syndrome
I think the way to resolve this feeling
is to understand it for what it really
is namely a bid for reassurance
when we enter into a new role or a new
position of responsibility the vast
majority of people reasonably want to
know whether they are meeting
expectations whether they're doing it
right whether they're doing a good job
they lack an internal capacity to
evaluate their own performance and
oftentimes in the beginning external
feedback isn't necessarily forthcoming
it can take some time for example in a
corporate role you generally don't get
your first evaluation until six months
or even a year into that position how do
you manage in the meantime
on some level it's entirely reasonable
to seek out reassurance especially when
you haven't yet internalized the
standards or expectations of that
position
that generally comes with experience
which you don't yet have
so the seeking after reassurance is

[03:01]
so the seeking after reassurance is
understandable however the liability
inherent in reassurance seeking is that
it tends to cultivate dependence which
frustrates the development of authentic
confidence no bueno
the way to navigate this is to establish
as quickly as possible and as
objectively as possible these standards
of performance talk to your supervisor
talk to those who may have more
experience with the role ask them for
the explicit criteria which they will
use to evaluate your performance or by
which they measure their own performance
try to make these standards objective
and behavioral as opposed to subjective
and psychological this means that
someone on the outside should be able to
tell whether or not you're meeting that
standard as opposed to relying on your
own feelings about whether or not you're
meeting the standard
so far so good
so what do you do with these standards
once you've got them well every time the

[04:00]
once you've got them well every time the
pain of insecurity arises within you
with respect to your position rather
than seek out reassurance externally or
simply suffer quietly within your own
subjective experience measure your
performance against these objective
standards you have established for
yourself this should stop you from going
too far off the rails by essentially
providing a reality check evoking these
criteria will with time and repetition
internalize these standards so that you
can kind of act as your own supervisor
and this will help prevent the
inappropriate cultivation of dependence
on external sources of reassurance which
may not be role appropriate after a
certain amount of time
this is the foundational skill for
overcoming this syndrome
now before I go any further if you're

like this that really help to make the
channel grow you can also tip me by
hitting the thanks button it's just
below this video that you're watching
and tip me in proportion to the value

[05:00]
and tip me in proportion to the value
you feel you've derived from this
message because it's your support that
makes all this possible couldn't do it
without you and I really appreciate it
thank you
now there are some other things to keep
in mind that will also help to
accelerate your process in overcoming
this imposter syndrome first of all it's
useful to appreciate the vast majority
of people don't really know what they're
doing and they're in positions of power
and authority anyway this is because the
number of problems that exist greatly
exceeds the number of competent people
capable of solving them Society is a
conglomeration of imperfect people
imperfectly helping each other
remembering this should not only help
people approach others with greater
patience and compassion but allow people
to treat themselves with greater
patience and compassion as well you
should also keep in mind that most
people don't have the bandwidth to
really look too closely at whatever
you're doing because they're too
preoccupied with themselves you are at

[06:00]
preoccupied with themselves you are at
best a cameo in the lives of almost
everyone else so the pressure is kind of
off no one is looking at you even a
fraction as closely as you believe that
they might be
and this is all important because the
cultivation of authentic confidence
which is the consistent felt experience
of success can take some time when I
first started out as a therapist it took
me about five years to really find my
clinical voice and my professional
identity and I might not have been able
to get there any faster even if I knew
then what I know now these things just
take time and repetition and a
willingness to tolerate that process
finally
especially in the beginning it might be
useful to set your standards for
satisfactory performance pretty low like
you might have done a good enough job
simply by virtue of the fact that you
didn't make the situation any worse than
it was before
when I would bring my doubts into
supervision with my first clinical

[07:00]
supervision with my first clinical
supervisor all those years ago he would
ask whether I a killed the patient or B
slept with the patient
and when I responded that no I hadn't
done either of those things he would say
sounds like a good enough therapy
session
of course my Professional Standards for
myself are much higher now than they
were a few months into my training but
hopefully you get the point you can
start low and then titrate up as you
gain more experience and expertise this
is appropriate it's like a scaffolded
approach to professional competence okay
so that's what I have to say to you
today about overcoming imposter syndrome
it's a good idea to internalize those
standards of performance so that you
don't cultivate inappropriate dependence
and remember nobody is looking at you
all that carefully and they're
imperfectly doing their own jobs as well
