I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is creating
a monster over the duration of my career
I've done a lot of consultations with a
lot of different men and many have
spoken to me about their unsatisfactory
marriages and relationships and this has
allowed me to discover points of
convergence throughout most of their
cases and I want to share some of my
findings with you today first and
foremost I've discovered that bad
relationships are almost always based on
poor selection I cannot say this enough
you can't have any relationship with
anyone there's a whole chapter of my
book on this concept alone you can only
have certain kinds of relationships with
certain kinds of people for whatever
reason certain people are not
temperamentally or emotionally or
psychologically able to have stable
peaceful loving

[01:00]
peaceful loving
long-term relationships and it's not
your job to figure out why or how to fix
them so you can get what you want from
them if you insist that you should be
able to have the relationship you want
with the person you want to have it with
independent of whether or not that
person can emotionally or
psychologically do so then my friend
you're on the path of pain it won't work
out for you but you'll only figure out
that I'm right after years of conflict
heartache and despair no bueno in any
case it's poor selection that is almost
always to
blame but that doesn't really help
someone who's already in a difficult
relationship now does it he can't turn
back the clock and pick someone else and
even if he could would he in any case
I'm going to spend the rest of the day
discussing the second most prevalent
Factor common to unsatisfactory
relationships after listening to the
arguments and stalemates of hundreds of
men it has become clear to me that a lot

[02:01]
men it has become clear to me that a lot
of these men were complicit in creating
the Dynamics of which they complained
now they almost always did this
unconsciously and unintentionally but
they did it nonetheless I call this
process creating a monster in my
experience most monsters aren't born
they're
created let me explain what this looks
like using a very obvious example have
you ever seen a little girl have a
temper tantrum in a store because her
father wouldn't buy her a toy chances
are you've seen this happen if not it's
fairly easy to imagine girl says she
wants the toy father says no her eyes
start welling up with tears girl says
she wants the toy father says no the
child starts crying girl says she wants
the toy father says no the child flops
down on the floor father says no and now
the girl is was kicking and screaming

[03:01]
the girl is was kicking and screaming
father says no and the kid yells I hate
you father says no and the girl
threatens to call CPS and report him for
child abuse father says no and the kid
starts to break and throw things father
says no and the girl starts hitting her
own head against the floor now the
father has done a good job holding the
line up until this point however if the
stakes are now too high if he suddenly
caves and says [ __ ] it fine here's the
godamn toy just stop it okay then that
parent would have created a monster that
day he certainly didn't mean to do that
but that's what he would do when he
rewards the child for behaving like a
monster he taught the child the location
of his thumb screw the emotional
experience that he isn't willing or able
to tolerate and functionally instructed
her in the behavioral protocol she needs
to follow in order to get what she wants
the father could scold the child with
his mouth after afterwards tell her that

[04:01]
his mouth after afterwards tell her that
good girls don't act like that he could
sit down and have a conversation with
her about her behavior and get a
commitment from her not to behave like
that in the future he could use threats
of future punishment to dissuade her
from doing that again but none of that
really matters none of these
interventions are really going to work
because he rewarded he reinforced the
bad behavior contingencies Trump
communication if you you appreciate the
insights on this channel I would highly
encourage you to get your hands on a
copy of my book the value of others over
the course of 432 pages I delve deep
into my economic model of relationships
and explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never

[05:00]
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description the next time that child
wants something what do you think is
going to happen her behavior is going to
escalate to headbanging probably even
faster than the first time because the
parent has taught her that that is how
to turn my no into a yes all the child
has to do is make things sufficiently
comfortable for that parent and he gives
in and the parent has taught the child
that the most effective way of doing
just that in this case is to hit your
head against the floor over time this
transforms the child into a monster
which is obviously not good for the
child as no toys were such a
metamorphosis and it's certainly not
good for the parent who becomes
increasingly angry resentful and
hopeless giving in at that point was the
worst possible thing that that parent

[06:00]
worst possible thing that that parent
could have done if the parent was honest
with himself and understood that there
was something his daughter could do that
would cause him to fold that it actually
would have been better if the parent
just got the kid the toy when her eyes
started to well up that way Not only
would he not have had to deal with a
temper tantrum at all but he would have
reinforced a much more manageable
Behavior as well basically if you're
going to give in it's a good idea to
give in as quickly as
possible on the other hand the parent
could have decided not to give the child
no matter what not if she breaks stuff
or calls CPS or screams until she loses
her voice not if it takes hours and
hours and hours of patience and
self-control to hold the line it doesn't
matter if he chose not to give in no
matter what none of the bad behavior
though manifested would have been
reinforced and this means that it would

[07:01]
reinforced and this means that it would
already have begun to
disappear like that kid might try those
Shenanigans a few more times and it will
likely be a very uncomfortable few more
times for that parent but if the parent
holds firm then the kid will eventually
learn that [ __ ] doesn't work and the
child will eventually abandon that
strategy in favor of some other kind of
tactic or manipulation because it's not
so stupid that it will continue to
execute behaviors that don't work and
have never worked do you understand
dealing with bad behavior is kind of
like the prisoners dilemma if you're
eventually going to give in you should
give in as quickly as possible on the
other hand if you're not going to give
in you shouldn't give in no matter
what the reason why so many people end
up in suboptimal situations is because
they think they won't give in but they
weren't honest with themselves with

[08:00]
weren't honest with themselves with
respect to how they would stand up to
escalation great now let's bring this
over to adult relationships with women
now in most cases the first issue is
actually caused by the second that is
the reason why so many women might be
poor candidates for good relationships
is not because they're like inherently
broken but because they were trained in
monstrous Behavior by other men in their
lives most like
their fathers or their exes you're
seeing that behavior in your current
relationship because it worked in their
previous relationships and she's
expecting that you won't be much
different make sense now don't think
that the kind of behavior I just
described is unique to disregulated
children I have seen more than once with
my own eyes grown women doing all of
those things and more the kind of [ __ ]
that can happen in relation
relationships behind closed doors is

[09:01]
relationships behind closed doors is
almost
incomprehensible in any case it's quite
possible that you have seen or will see
Behavior like this at some point so the
question men need to ask themselves is
how much am I willing to
take of course the most common thumb
screw in adult relationships is
threatening to leave proposed to me by
the end of the year or we're done kind
of a thing many men give in at this
point but like the hypothetical father
in the toy store this is the very worst
thing they could possibly do all it does
is make threatening the basis of the
relationship more likely in the future
and you can't have a stable harmonious
long-term relationship with someone who
threatens the basis of the relationship
every time she doesn't get what she
wants it's just not possible my dudes
but here's the kicker she only does this
because it works
and why does it work because you taught

[10:01]
and why does it work because you taught
her that it works my dude in reality
that guy should have seen the ultimatum
coming over a long enough timeline it's
almost inevitable if that man were
honest with himself and he understood
that he wouldn't be able to emotionally
tolerate losing that woman then he
shouldn't have waited for the ultimatum
by acting first he not only avoids
reinforcing monstrous Behavior but he
also Remains the leader of the
relationship and the point of origin of
his own decisions as
well on the other hand if for example
that man just doesn't want to marry that
woman or doesn't want to marry period
Then he has to be willing to hold the
line no matter what and this includes
the willingness to suffer the pain of
losing any particular woman some women
will leave and in doing so they kind of
confirm your decision as their behavior

[11:00]
confirm your decision as their behavior
reveals that they love what they want
more than they love you so why would you
increase your commitment on the other
hand some women will stay and if you
resolve this challenge successfully they
will learn not to threaten the basis of
the relationship in the future because
you've taught them that it doesn't
work and of course in adult
relationships there is a third option
you the man can remove your yourself
from the relationship and I don't mean
threaten to remove I mean just
remove you can just leave and you can
just leave at the first red flag without
waiting for the bad behavior to turn
into a battle of wills and you'll start
to do this when you stop putting your
desire for any particular woman ahead of
your peace and your mission and your
self-respect so those are your three
options gentlemen either leave concede
as early as possible or hold the line no

[12:02]
as early as possible or hold the line no
matter what because if you're not honest
with yourself and you mix up those
strategies you're going to have a
monster on your
hands what do you think does this fit
