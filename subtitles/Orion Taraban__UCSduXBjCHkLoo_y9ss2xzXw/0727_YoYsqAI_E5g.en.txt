I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why
successful men are
jerks I would have said [ __ ] but
episodes with profanity in their titles
are penalized in any case that's the
sentiment here from a woman's
perspective it can seem like the more
attractive a guy is the more High status
better looking higher earning Etc the
more difficult he is to deal with the
less he's seems to care the more of an
[ __ ] he seems to become and today I'm
going to explain to women why this might
be the
case first of all ladies you have to
understand that men use different
strategies with women as a function of
their
circumstances most successful men
haven't always been successful in fact
the vast majority of successful men used
to be unsuccessful men why does this
matter well when you're unsuccessful you

[01:01]
matter well when you're unsuccessful you
generally have time but not money and
when you're successful you generally
have money but not time however men in
both groups will attempt to utilize the
resource they have in Greater abundance
to improve their success in the sexual
Marketplace this is why I made the
argument in a previous episode that
romance is for men that is it's a sexual
strategy utilized by unsuccessful men
the idea here is that these men may not
yet have a lot of what women might be
looking for with respect to a long-term
relationship he may not yet have
stability or lifestyle or status or
career or wealth so how can such a man
possibly compete with the men who do he
can use romance he can stimulate the
woman's emotions why because he has the
time but he doesn't have the money now
romance doesn't require money it doesn't
but it absolutely does require time and

[02:02]
but it absolutely does require time and
effort and thoughtfulness it's about
going that extra mile to show that you
listen that you care that you cherish
and unless our guy is extremely
attractive this might be the
unsuccessful man's best shot at
competing with the men who can offer
more tangible benefits like if you can't
put a woman in a house or fly her to
Fiji or pay her bills you better be able
to light some candles or leave a
handwritten note you know what I mean
and if you're not willing to do that and
you're not very attractive then best of
luck to you now women what you have to
understand is that men don't actually
want to do these things most men don't
like buying flowers and candles and
sending good morning texts and calling
to check in about nothing and all that
[ __ ] but they do it because a they think
you like those things and B they don't
yet have the things that you really
really like like it's true that women

[03:02]
really like like it's true that women
like flowers but they really like not
paying rent and who can blame them I'd
rather get a check than a handful of
dying
buttercups this is why women might like
the sweet romantic guys but they date
and [ __ ] the men who are successful and
established and while these women might
complain that these men never buy them
flowers They're not leaving them for the
men who do are
now at a certain point guys figure this
out and they typically figure this out
as they start to become
successful nothing much has changed from
their perspective they haven't become
more physically attractive or masculine
or charming but suddenly women seem to
be looking at them in a different way as
men become successful they learn the
things that women actually respond to
which are very different from the things
that women and Society have told him
women respond to and this is actually a

[04:03]
women respond to and this is actually a
relief to most men why because most men
don't really want to do all that
[ __ ] like I would argue very few men
organically have the desire to buy a
woman roses in the vast majority of
cases this was an idea that was put into
his head by his
culture it didn't come out of him
spontaneously when he does so he's not
enacting an authentic emotional impulse
and most men on some level know this
maybe you see where this is going as men
become successful they begin to
experience firsthand what women really
respond to which empowers them to
increasingly dispense with the behaviors
they never really wanted to do and which
don't really seem to have a significant
impact on outcomes
anyway these men have learned that even
though you might not love the fact that
they don't buy you flowers or light

[05:00]
they don't buy you flowers or light
candles you will still [ __ ] them and
they learn this by observing your
behavior ladies so you are at the very
least somewhat complicit in creating the
conditions you
lament if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook Audi book and
paperback formats the links are in the
description here's another way to look
at this money money is many things to

[06:01]
at this money money is many things to
many people and one of those things that
money is is Liberation from drudgery
like when I was broke I had to put my
clothes in a hamper and walk three
blocks down to the laundromat and feed
quarters into the janky machines and sit
there for hours like a sucker because I
didn't have my own washer or dryer but
when I got a little money guess what I
just Dro those clothes off at the dry
cleaners downstairs because suddenly my
two hours was worth more than the 30
bucks I had to pay one of the best uses
of money is that it can liberate you
from the drudgery that you'd rather not
do and that's exactly what's Happening
Here ladies men don't actually want to
buy you flowers and send good morning
texts that [ __ ] is laundry to men
whether they're right or not these men
believe that having money and providing
all these other benefits like lifestyle
and status and comfort allows them to
escape the drudgery of Romance of

[07:00]
escape the drudgery of Romance of
jumping through all the [ __ ] Hoops
that they didn't really want to jump
through in the first place but might
have felt that they had to if they were
to have a chance with you when they were
less successful like me and my laundry
these successful guys believe that they
have finally finally arrived at a place
where they can dispense with all that
[ __ ] like no one is more satisfied with
a washer dryer than someone who had to
go to the laundromat for 10 years you
hear what I'm saying they're never ever
gonna feed quarters into a machine again
now whether or not you agree with this
ladies I would argue that for your own
Effectiveness it's important that you at
least try to appreciate the perspective
complaining that successful men are
dispensing with romance is not in your
best interests despising the 99% of what
you're getting in favor of the 1% of
what you're not will only make men
resent you like I've been on dates I
[ __ ] you not where I've taken care of
everything kicked the woman up took her

[08:00]
everything kicked the woman up took her
out to eat at a nice restaurant planned
a fun activity for afterwards put a lot
of effort into the experience covered
all the expenses and at the end of the
night she said no
flowers it's like are you [ __ ]
serious how infuriating and invalidating
as I've stated previously never punish
people for doing what you want all that
does is demotivate further effort that
certainly was the case in my experience
I remember responding I would hope that
the fact that I'm here with you and
literally not anybody else would have
been special enough however if you
really want flowers I'm sure you can
pick some up for yourself on your way
home she did not get another date in any
case that's why so many successful men
are [ __ ] for better or worse they
believe that they finally arrived at a
point where they don't have to do the
[ __ ] anymore and they believe that
by observing how you responded them
differentially over the process of
becoming successful

[09:00]
becoming successful
