One of the dirty little secrets of both
therapy and psychiatry is that according
to the research, the vast majority of
mental illnesses spontaneously remit.
They run their course. Like even
schizophrenia, that one is a little bit
more chronic and pervasive. But for
example, Zimbabwe has better clinical
outcomes associated with schizophrenia
than the United States. In general, the
more industrialized the medical care of
a society, the worse its mental health
outcomes are. Wow. And part of that is
because kind of what you're discussing
is that when somebody in in America has
schizophrenia, it's immediately
conceptualized to them that this is a
lifelong disease. They will always have
this. They will always have to take
their psychiatric medication, and they
may even need to be sequestered from the
rest of the population for their own
good and safety. Whereas, this might be
a bit of an oversimplification, but in
Zimbabwe, they like, "Oh, yeah, that's
uh Uncle Alex. He sometimes talks to
people who aren't there, but we love
him." you know, they kind of they're not
going to ship them off to a institution.
They don't have the resources to do that
and often, but they might not want to do

and often, but they might not want to do
that anyway. They make allowances for
people and they find ways to continue to
integrate them into the community. And
there's still ways absolutely that
people with schizophrenia can be useful
to themselves and others. But we often
don't even allow people with
schizophrenia to do that in
industrialized societies.
