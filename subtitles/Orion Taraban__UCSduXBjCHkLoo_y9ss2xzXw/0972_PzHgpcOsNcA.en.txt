What people do is the clearest
indication of what they value. And that
is why whenever there is discrepancy
between what someone says and what
someone does, you should always, always,
always, give priority to what they do.
It doesn't mean you ignore what they say
completely, but you absolutely take it
with a large dose of salt. And the
larger the discrepancy, the larger the
dose. Anyone who succeeds in making you
believe their words over and above their
actions has cast a spell on you. That
person is a magician. And when they go
so far as to insist that their words
should take precedence over their
actions, then they become like Oz, the
great and powerful, who insists you pay
no attention to the man behind the
curtain. Because if you do, you'll
realize there is no magic involved.
