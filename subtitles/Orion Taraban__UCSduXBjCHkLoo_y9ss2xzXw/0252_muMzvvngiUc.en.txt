i'm dr orion taraband and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is a
bad business blames its customers so
this is true literally and as we'll see
it's also true figuratively when applied
in the context of romantic relationships
so
if a company has a bad quarter if its
profits are down if its earnings are
dismal if it's shares or tanking
the higher ups are going to get together
for a strategy meeting
do you think they're going to
collectively blame their idiot customers
for their problems like can you imagine
well
the real problem is that too many people
are just too stupid to see what a
fantastic product we offer they're even
deluded enough to believe that our
competitors who are clearly inferior to
us in
several important ways offer a better
solution for their needs it's just an
unfortunate reality that no one
appreciates a good product anymore

[01:03]
appreciates a good product anymore
come on
it's a bad business that blames its
customers
shaming or blaming people for choosing
not to part with their hard-earned money
to purchase your product or service is
arrogant and misguided
why
because the fact of the matter is
that most people are happy to part with
their money
provided they believe it represents the
best value
for a solution to a personally relevant
problem
and if they're not handing over their
money with a smile on their face it
means that the company isn't doing that
and that means there is either a problem
with marketing like with the
presentation of the solution or with the
solution itself
or both
a good company that isn't yet
experiencing the success that it would
prefer to enjoy fiddles with those knobs
it takes an objective look at how it's
being presented and received in the

[02:00]
being presented and received in the
marketplace maybe they do have a great
product but no one knows about it so
it's an awareness issue or maybe people
get the wrong idea of the product from
the promotional materials so it's a
branding issue
on the other hand maybe they have
excellent marketing but their product
isn't very good so they don't get repeat
business or it's being sold at the wrong
price point the idea is to locate the
problem in oneself and not in external
factors
now
we can very easily generalize this
perspective to dating and relationships
i've talked to a lot of folks who tell
me that they can't find a good man
because they're all narcissistic and
avoidant and afraid of commitment or
that they can't find a good woman
because they're all and feminist
and capable of pair bonding
and i'm here to tell you guys
that it's a bad business that blames its
customers
if you are not yet experiencing the
success that you would prefer to enjoy
in the dating market
then you have a problem with your

[03:00]
then you have a problem with your
marketing a problem with your product or
both
people are always looking for sex
connection and relationship
that will never change ever
the opportunity to obtain those things
is all around you
especially if you live in a major
metropolitan area so if you're having
trouble you need to locate the issue in
yourself
and not in external factors
maybe you're giving off the wrong vibe
and you need to invest in your look or
your appearance
or maybe you need to do some work on
yourself in order to increase your value
relative to your competition in the
sexual marketplace because
it's a shark tank out there guys
locate the issue in yourself
because if you do
you'll be able to do something about it
it's hard to take the long hard look at
the person in the mirror but if it helps
you get what you want it's ultimately
worth it

[04:01]
worth it
