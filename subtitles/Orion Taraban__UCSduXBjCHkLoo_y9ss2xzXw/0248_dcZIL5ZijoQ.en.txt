i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the three goals of human interaction
now i'm taking this concept from marsha
linehan who expands upon it in her
dialectical behavior therapy skills
workbook
i love dbt you're unlikely to encounter
a more comprehensively elaborated system
of healing anywhere i have a lot of
respect for dr linehan and what she's
been able to create
and in her module on interpersonal
effectiveness she talks about how there
are really only three goals that we can
have when we enter into any human
interaction
now ideally we achieve all three of
these goals in the course of the
interaction
however lenny linehan points out that
sometimes that's not practically
possible
sometimes it's necessary for us to
prioritize one of these goals above the
other two but that we can and should do

[01:00]
other two but that we can and should do
this consciously and intentionally
so what are these three goals in so many
words they are effectiveness
harmony
and self-respect effectiveness harmony
and to elaborate how these three differ
from one another i'm going to provide
some extreme examples in which one goal
is prioritized far above the other two
so if i were to prioritize effectiveness
above harmony and self-respect
then i'm prioritizing getting what i
want
i don't care if you don't like me i.e
i'm de-prioritizing harmony and i don't
care if i have to beg or grovel to get
it i.e i'm de-prioritizing self-respect
what is most important to me in this
moment is that the thing gets done
it's not important how you think about
me
or how i think about myself afterwards
obtaining the desired good is paramount
on the other hand if i were to
prioritize harmony above effectiveness

[02:01]
prioritize harmony above effectiveness
and self-respect then i'm prioritizing
the continuation of the relationship
above all things
no matter what happens it's most
important to me
that you continue to feel positively
about me when this interaction is over
this means that i'm potentially going to
go along with things that i don't think
will work i.e i'm de-prioritizing
effectiveness
or with things that i even find
distasteful or degrading i.e i'm
de-prioritizing self-respect
it's not important if i fail
or how i think about myself afterwards
as long as we're together i'll be all
right
and finally if i were to prioritize
self-respect above effectiveness and
harmony then i'm prioritizing
being able to live with myself when this
interaction is over
i need to stand up for myself and for
what i believe to be right
this means that i'm willing to fight a
losing battle i.e i'm de-prioritizing

[03:01]
losing battle i.e i'm de-prioritizing
effectiveness
and that i'm willing to bear your hatred
or animosity i.e i'm de-prioritizing
harmony
the issue is bigger than me and this
relationship and if necessary i'm
willing to die on this hill
so those are the three goals and my
examples though somewhat extreme should
have been common enough in the economy
of human interactions to be recognizable
to you
now like i said in most cases we should
generally be able to get what we want
and feel good about ourselves
and ensure the continuation of our
relationships it's not always possible
but it's generally possible
like most problems however issues
present themselves when folks are too
rigid or inflexible about implementing
one strategy over another it's not like
one of these strategies is inherently
better than the others
but if all you have is say self-respect
you're probably gonna be a tough person
to get along with to be honest

[04:01]
to get along with to be honest
and if all you have is harmony then you
might end up quietly resentful over all
the potentially needless sacrifices
you've made to make other people happy
catch my drift
flexibility is key
