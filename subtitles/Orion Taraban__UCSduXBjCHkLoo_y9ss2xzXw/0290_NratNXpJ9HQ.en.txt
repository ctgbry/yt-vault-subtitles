i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
why modern dating doesn't work
or
privilege and responsibility
so on the whole i think that comedians
do a much better job of understanding
men and women and sexual dynamics than
do the vast majority of academic
psychologists and one of my favorite
comedians on this topic was patrice
o'neill that man was funny as hell and
he understood a lot of uncomfortable
truths about men and women
patrice had this line about what men
want and the line was
men want to be alone
but not by themselves
that is men want their space they want
their freedom they want their privacy
and they want women but on the periphery
of their lives i'm not saying this is
good or bad or right or wrong but i do
think it's accurate it is what it is

[01:00]
think it's accurate it is what it is
now before i unpack what this has to do
with modern dating please remember to

so please thanks for your help
now what does this have to do with
modern dating well to the extent that
this is true
from a man's perspective there is a
significant mismatch between the
privileges awarded to
and the responsibilities expected of men
as a relationship progresses
and this
disincentivizes men from entering into
relationships which to the extent that
relationships are what women want is bad
for women
what does this mean
in an ideal world
privilege and responsibility
are balanced
you want more privileges then you have
to be willing to assume some
responsibilities you want me to take on

[02:00]
responsibilities you want me to take on
more responsibility then you have to be
willing to give me more privileges do
you see
as workers climb the corporate hierarchy
they are expected to work harder make
more difficult decisions and assume
greater responsibility and
accountability for the success of the
company
why would anyone want to do this
because corporate officers enjoy
fabulous compensation packages and other
intangible perks the privileges are
increased to match the responsibilities
so what does this have to do with dating
well
if what a man wants
is to have access to women and be left
alone
when is he most likely
to enjoy these privileges in the course
of a relationship
in the earliest stages of the courtship
in modern dating men can go on a date
with a woman or even multiple women have
sex and then not see or even communicate
with the other person for a week
or two
that's not a bad deal for a lot of men

[03:02]
that's not a bad deal for a lot of men
unless a guy is chomping at the bit to
get married or start a family men in
this stage of the relationship get a lot
of what they want they get high quality
interactions characterized by novelty
excitement and sex followed by periods
of separation at this point men enjoy
their freedom and autonomy and they get
what patrice says they want to be alone
but not by themselves
and what happens from there in the
conventional progression of the
relationship
well a man comes to take on more and
more responsibilities and enjoys fewer
and fewer privileges for his trouble
i've personally been in relationships as
a responsible committed adult where i
had fewer freedoms and privileges than i
enjoyed as an irresponsible selfish
teenager
sex dwindles expenses increase friends
and interests are sacrificed freedom and
autonomy vanish
and vibrant mustangs become the plow

[04:00]
and vibrant mustangs become the plow
horses of women and children
now the men who allow this to happen are
responsible for their fate so i'm not
blaming women here
my point is that this is how we as a
society
believe a relationship should go
and that this is a raw deal for a lot of
guys
as a professional analogy
the relationship progression for men is
akin to starting off in a private corner
office
these folks don't need to clock in they
can come and go as they please to
supplement their income
they might have some side hustles or
personal investments and this isn't a
problem for the higher-ups as long as it
doesn't cause them any trouble
these men can decide their own course
they can choose to work on certain
projects and veto others with immunity
and they have fantastic benefits
unlimited pto and lots of industry
schmoozing
now imagine that a promotion at this
company entails moving the man out of
his corner office into a public cubicle

[05:01]
his corner office into a public cubicle
on the floor
he's now expected to account for his
whereabouts at all times and to ask for
permission to come in late or leave
early the man is also expected to sign a
non-competition clause and to divest
himself of all personal income streams
furthermore he's expected to build
consensus for his decisions and to
submit to the direction of an or to
submit to the direction of another
finally he is expected to be at the
office twice as much to forego the perks
of his status and reputation and only
vacation on company sponsored retreats
oh and they cut his salary in half
does this sound like a promotion to you
it doesn't to me
and it doesn't to a lot of the guys who
have opened their eyes to the situation
so what's the upshot modern dating
doesn't work because men are
disincentivized to progress
relationships with women
they're expected to do way more for much
less
and because of this lack of incentive
relationships are not progressed

[06:00]
relationships are not progressed
rationally
but emotionally
which works until it doesn't and the
fallout of which affects men and women
and children if present
the fact of the matter is that men would
enter into relationships
enthusiastically
if they believed they got more of what
they wanted as a consequence of entering
into them
the privileges have to match the
responsibilities
