Hey everybody, just going to take a
moment of your time to give you an
exciting update about the Psychax
channel. Basically, after four months of
reduced production, I am prepared to go
back to my usual two episode a week
cadence starting next week. That's
right. Starting next week, you're going
to get two new originals episodes every
week. They will launch on Mondays and
Fridays at 800 a.m. Pacific time. Thank
you so much for your support during this
process. It was really great for me to
see that the world doesn't fall apart
when I take my foot off the gas. It
allowed me to kind of catch my breath,
to become more inspired, and now I'm
ready to get back to work. And I'm very
excited about some of the episodes that
are coming down the pipeline. I've
worked really hard on them, and I think
you're really going to like them. So,
look forward to two new episodes a week
starting next week. Thank you.
