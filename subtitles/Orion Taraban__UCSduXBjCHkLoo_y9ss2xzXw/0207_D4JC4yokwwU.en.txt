i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
killing the hope is an emotional
survival strategy and one that is most
applicable in the wake of a breakup
so let's say that an important
relationship has ended and while you
understand intellectually that it's over
emotionally you still retain the hope
that somehow in the future you will be
reconciled with your ex and there will
be a chance for the two of you to get
back together it's not rational but you
feel it nonetheless
you know that this is the case because
you catch yourself ruminating about the
ex you can't let them go and you can't
move on to somebody else the space in
your heart is occupied by the memory of
that person
and even though that memory causes you
nothing but pain you hold on to it
and that's because there's a sense that
if you were to surrender the pain
then there would be nothing left to bind
you to the lost loved one
you harbor the hope

[01:01]
you harbor the hope
because you believe the pain
is preferable to nothingness
and you believe that if you don't hold
on to the pain which is the hope of
reconciliation
and that your ex has already surrendered
that pain then once you relinquish that
pain
then the relationship will be completely
and irrevocably lost
and that's a lie
that's actually not true and i'll
explain why in a moment however right
now the important thing is to understand
that your hope is corroding your heart
it's killing you from the inside
now it's not for me or for anybody else
to tell you when it's time to kill the
hope because hope is a very precious and
intimate thing
and yet in order to survive
in order to continue to emotionally live
sometimes it's necessary to kill the
hope and once you decide to do that
there's no turning back
it's a ruthless procedure but one that
could save your life

[02:00]
could save your life
to kill the hope you have to eliminate
any interior contact with the
internalized object of your ex there's a
lot of talk on youtube about no contact
but not communicating with another
person is only the most superficial
understanding of what no contact means
true no contact means not coming into
emotional contact with the internal
object with which is the memory the
image the fantasy of the other person
every time that internal object is
activated you vigorously block and
replace it with something else and you
do that over and over and over and over
and over again sometimes hundreds of
times a day and you thereby weaken the
power of that hope
internal no contact is like applying a
tourniquet it cuts off the blood flow to
that part of you so that it withers away
and dies
not a very pleasant operation but one
that in certain cases might be essential

[03:01]
that in certain cases might be essential
to survival
now the reason why letting go of the
hope doesn't actually make your
situation objectively hopeless is this
let's say that after six months after 12
months after two years whatever your ex
for whatever reason were to come back
into your life
and if this person were to find you in
exactly the same state that he or she
left you in
six months 12 months two years ago
then whatever motivated them to leave
you in the first place would likely
still be present
they're gonna think wow
i dodged a bullet
i was right to leave this person they
haven't changed at all
exes often do come back however a lot of
times they're just spying on you from
afar to help them feel better about
ending the relationship
and if they ever actively re-enter your
life it will not be because they sense
that you are still holding on to a
candle of hope for their return
it will be because they like who you

[04:00]
it will be because they like who you
have become in the interim
so killing the hope doesn't objectively
decrease your chances of an eventual
reconciliation however paradoxically
by killing the hope you resign yourself
to moving on with your life without any
expectation that you'll ever see that
person again as long as you live
it's ruthless but effective
