I'm Dr Orion taravan and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is shared
interests
are overrated
so this is something that I see a lot of
people doing on the dating Market
they're filtering potential partners for
shared interests and I can appreciate
the rationale for doing so has a grain
of truth to it like if there's zero van
overlap between what you like to do in
your spare time and what the other
person likes to do in their spare time
it's going to be difficult to move the
relationship forward
however shared interests are generally
not what bring people together and
they're definitely not what allow a
relationship to flourish now before I
explain my own reasoning please remember
to like this video And subscribe to this
channel thanks less than a second costs
you nothing and it's what you secretly
want to do anyway so do the thing
here's the situation a person's
interests are facts I like reading
hiking dining and meditating

[01:02]
hiking dining and meditating
they are more or less objective
verifiable and utterly boring
people do not become attracted to others
by virtue of factual disclosure even if
and this is important even if those
things may be what the other person is
looking for guys do this all the time
when they drop subtle and not so subtle
hints about how much money they make on
a date it doesn't work
on the other hand people do become
attracted to how you feel about your
interests there's a big difference
between saying I like hiking
and I love the feeling of pushing myself
outside my comfort zone is it weird to
say that I also like the danger and
Solitude like I feel so alive when I
realize I'm on my own
get the picture
the sheer fact that you like the same
music or movies or that you both like to
travel or dine out tells me absolutely

[02:00]
travel or dine out tells me absolutely
nothing about whether you're the type of
person
I would actually like to do those things
with
turns out that people don't like their
interests so much that they'll do them
with just anybody
and most interests aren't even reliable
proxies for personality traits or
characteristics did you know that DMX
the rapper was an avid Orchid gardener
fact
what initially brings people together is
attraction which largely pertains to
what you did to get the date to begin
with and chemistry which pertains to how
you feel with the other person on that
date
shared interests do not increase
attraction or chemistry so it doesn't
really make sense to sort for them why
because best case scenario you might end
up with someone who seems like a good
fit on paper
but for whom you feel nothing for and
that's not really ideal
but here's the real reason why shared

[03:00]
but here's the real reason why shared
interests are overrated think of all
your interests today
were they the same interests that you
had five years ago
about 10 years ago
20 years ago
probably not
maybe one or two things have remained
constant but the vast majority of your
interests are different today
okay so every seven to ten years you are
functionally going to become a different
person and every seven to ten years your
partner is functionally going to become
a different person
if the basis of your relationship is
shared interests and your interests
change every seven to ten years and
their interests change every seven to
ten years
then what's the basis of your
relationship seven to ten years from now
it's like either you can't allow people
to change which is a kind of death
or you have to admit that there's
something that keeps a relationship
together Beyond shared activities
in my opinion what's way more important

[04:02]
in my opinion what's way more important
than shared interests is mutual
tolerance for example I like to go
backpacking I like to go out into the
Wilderness and rough it and sleep on the
ground and get real dirty and not every
woman is into that it's nice if a woman
expresses interest in that then we can
do that every once in a while but she's
probably not going to be into it as much
as I am and that willingness probably
isn't going to be sufficient reason for
me to enter into that relationship with
her all things being equal anyway
and that's okay
she doesn't have to be into it as long
as she tolerates that I'm into it and
that means she doesn't obstruct or
otherwise punish me for doing that in my
spare time without her
we don't have to do everything together
in fact that's usually a recipe for
generating all sorts of resentment in a
relationship it's much better to filter

[05:00]
relationship it's much better to filter
for tolerance of another person's
differences than for alignment in
similarities
