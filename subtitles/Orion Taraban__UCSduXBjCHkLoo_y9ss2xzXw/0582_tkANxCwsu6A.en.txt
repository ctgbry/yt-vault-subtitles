I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
keep a woman so this is something that
is very important for men to understand
especially men who are considering going
down the path of marriage and children
for these relationships to succeed it is
essential that you maintain a woman's
long-term commitment this is because the
more you invest in any one woman the
more leveraged you are in that
relationship and the riskier it becomes
For You especially in contemporary
Society there are no risk-free options
boys but there are ways to mitigate your
risk in a long-term relationship and
today I'm going to be talking about one
of the easiest ways to keep a woman
around for the long term if that's what
you're interested in doing now this is
going to be a hard pill for many men to
swallow but the fact of the matter is
that everything that you've ever done

[01:01]
that everything that you've ever done
for a woman is
irrelevant it does not matter if it's in
the past it's gone and this can be very
frustrating because some guys have done
a lot for their women they've taken them
to Fiji and they've bought them a car
and they've given them a ring and the
house and the kids on their timeline
they have done a lot for their women and
these men often believe that what they
have done somehow entitles them to some
measure of consideration love sex
respect or commitment now in the present
moment and unfortunately that's not true
I'm
sorry on some level I think this is a
failure of interex understanding the
conception of reasonable entitlement is
how men think it's not necessarily how
women think if the two of us were at a
bar and you bought me round the next
time you needed a drink I would buy you
round why because I would feel in some

[02:02]
round why because I would feel in some
small way as if I were in your debt and
I would feel compelled to discharge that
debt through equivalent action and this
is likely because among other things if
I didn't do that you would eventually
stop buying me drinks and I might also
earn a reputation as a sponger and this
could detrimentally affect my status in
our shared Community which has very
negative consequences for men now women
have their own inex status games but
they're not quite the same as men's and
both games change in intersexual
relationships so inspecting that
incurred debt reasonably entitles you to
some equivalent action from a woman is
probably not warranted that's just not
how it works with them women are like
your
stomach reminding your stomach that you
had dinner last week isn't going to help
if you're hungry today your stomach
needs food

[03:00]
needs food
constantly and when it hasn't had it in
a while it will painfully remind you of
that fact even if you've eaten three
meals a day every single day of your
entire life your stomach will tell you
will never tell you that it's had enough
to get you through whatever time you
have
left the issue is that no longer how
long you've been eating you're going to
experience problems if you L don't have
access to food and this is especially
relevant for men in relationships with
women because
eventually you kind of run out of things
to give
her just consider the way things tend to
progress along the relationship
escalator all right I just gave her my
commitment now what well then I told her
I loved her okay what next well I
suppose we'll move in together

[04:00]
suppose we'll move in together
okay then what um I guess I can
propose okay great now what well we'll
have a a wedding oh she'll like that now
what uh well I guess I can give her a
kid or two uhhuh okay and
then and
then you you don't you don't have
anything else you may have 50 years of
life left my dude and it's precisely at
this point when the man is as invested
as he could possibly be in the
relationship that women are subject to
leaving with the cash and prizes why
because a divorce is the only thing left
to give her this is not a good position
for a man to be in now before I go any

toprated gr study program at Stellar
g.com wrote it all myself you love the
content let's get back to
it another way to think about this is
that everything you have ever given a
woman is like safe she can't lose it and
it can't be taken away from her she
can't lose all of those trips and
holidays her memories can't be taken
from her and all the time and energy and
money that you've spent on her can't
ever be refunded all of those things are
safely hers because they're in the past
and so can't ever be taken away what you
have to understand is that if a woman

[06:01]
have to understand is that if a woman
leaves she takes with her everything
you've ever given her the only thing she
loses when she walks away is that which
she wants and hasn't yet
received what keeps a woman in a
relationship is what she hasn't gotten
yet this and only this do they lose when
they
leave this is why as a man it's always
always essential that you remain future
focused whatever woman you're dealing
with needs to be looking forward to
something that she wants and that she
hasn't yet received and that's also why
it's a good idea to draw out what you
give her as long as possible you do not
want to paint yourself into a corner by
giving her everything that she wants too
soon because once she has everything
that she wants what can you Poss
possibly give her and a woman who does

[07:01]
possibly give her and a woman who does
not expect any future benefit from a man
is not going to stick around just like
you are probably not going to stick
around to spend the rest of your career
in a dead-end
job so you have to cultivate desire in
her for things that she can hope to
receive now successful seducers do this
all the time they call this future
faking they paint a woman a beautiful
picture with their words that they never
ever have any intention of fulfilling
and that's dangerous and low Integrity
eventually if you play with people's
hopes long enough they get fed up and
leave so this can't really be an
effective strategy for keeping a woman
around longterm though it can and does
work for short-term prospects in any
case I don't really recommend it so the
desires you cultivate should not only be
things that she wants because if they
are things that she doesn't
want uh there's no compelling reason for
her to stay in the relationship anyway
even if she doesn't have them yet
but they should be things that you're

[08:01]
but they should be things that you're
actually willing and able to fulfill on
a reasonable timeline as well and there
you have it to keep a woman around long
term you need to cultivate in her
desires for things that she might want
but hasn't yet received that is her
incentive to stay in the relationship as
she will lose these things and only
these things if she chooses to leave I
wish it were different but that's just
how it works with women what do you
