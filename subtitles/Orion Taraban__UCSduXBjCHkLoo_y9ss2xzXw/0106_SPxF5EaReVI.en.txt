i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
what is heaven
so i was thinking about this subject the
other day
and immediately what came into my mind
when i considered the concepts of heaven
and hell
was that heaven was a place of eternal
pleasure and comfort
like being fed grapes by gorgeous angels
while i recline on some divine divine
and that hell was a place of unrelenting
pain and suffering
like being stabbed with pitchforks by
hideous demons while i'm pursued through
fire and brimstone
and i think this is a very superficial
conceptualization
but i also think it's the most prevalent
view of those concepts in society
and you can see how obviously they are
connected to hedonic principles that
hell is pain and heaven is pleasure
then i looked at that a little more
carefully
because it only takes a modicum of
additional intellectual effort to

[01:00]
additional intellectual effort to
understand that abiding in a place of
unremitting pleasure would almost
certainly become hellish in its own
right
if for nor the reason that it would
likely become insufferably tedious and
boring
so then i thought that maybe for me
personally
heaven doesn't look like just
luxuriating in pleasure and comfort
so what might heaven look like for me
and i thought heaven for me might
actually look like a video game an
action adventure game like the legend of
zelda or a role-playing game like final
fantasy
in the game i have to overcome great
challenges by overcoming smaller
challenges collecting key items and
leveling up important stats along the
way
and all of these challenges are linked
in an overarching quest to save the
world or to defeat a great evil or
something like that
and so i thought heaven for me
might be the opportunity to become
victorious
in a difficult and complex quest

[02:00]
in a difficult and complex quest
throughout the world
and then i thought about that further
and i realized that the only way this
quest would be personally compelling
would be if i were not all-powerful or
all-knowing or all good
a lot of video games for instance have a
new game plus feature which allows you
to start a new game with the save data
of a finished game
this allows your character to begin the
adventure with most or all of his
in-game stats and items in tow which
obviously makes the game significantly
easier
playing with such an overpowered
character however can make the game
rather boring because on some level the
threat that you will be unsuccessful is
almost completely eradicated and your
victory becomes a foregone conclusion
now heaven must be a game that we can
win which means that hell must be a game
that we can't
these games after all have a
predetermined narrative that destines
the protagonist to victory so long as he
continues to overcome the difficulties

[03:01]
continues to overcome the difficulties
placed in his path
but by the same token for the game to be
emotionally compelling
it has to at least seem as though we
could possibly lose
so what i realized is that heaven for me
must be an opportunity to overcome
difficulties in a narrative that
predetermines my victory
but that denies me knowledge of that
predetermination
as this would create at least the
illusion of stakes in order to
facilitate emotional participation
and then i realized that this definition
of heaven is actually very similar to
life
the only possible difference between the
two
is really this idea of whether or not
our victory is predetermined in a game
we know that the narrative progresses
along a predetermined trajectory toward
victory in life it doesn't seem to be
the case
so there are two possibilities
either it doesn't seem to be the case
because it isn't the case or that it

[04:00]
because it isn't the case or that it
doesn't seem to be the case
because we are denied knowledge of that
predetermination which of course is my
working definition of heaven
this means that the way to transform
life into heaven
is through the actualization of faith
because it would only be through faith
that we could approach the conviction of
a guaranteed victory that we were denied
knowledge of
so that we could pass through the
emotional experience of being alive
and this is actually a pretty compelling
idea that the life we are living right
now
can potentially be transformed into a
heavenly experience through the power of
faith
that we can't not win
but we kind of have to be made to
believe that we can lose
for our own good
so i wanted to share that thought with
you hopefully it makes sense
and if you've ever heard of a theologian
or a philosopher that talks about this
please get in touch with me i'd very
much like to know if anyone else has
thought along these same lines

[05:01]
thought along these same lines
