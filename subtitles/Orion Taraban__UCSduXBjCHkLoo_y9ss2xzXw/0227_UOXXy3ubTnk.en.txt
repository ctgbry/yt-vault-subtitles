in my recent episode the fear of
commitment cece soy comments sometimes
you offer anything and everything
it is still not good enough well that's
actually true
but
what i'm getting at here is that
value is more about quality than
quantity
imagine you're at a restaurant you ask
the waiter for a refill on your water
and he pours and pours and pours from
his pitcher until the cup is full
and he keeps pouring and the water
starts spilling over the cup and onto
the table
you actually didn't want
everything and anything that the waiter
had to offer you want you wanted enough
to fill your cup and anything above that
was actually
not only superfluous
but
distasteful now there's water everywhere
and you're wet and
it's not pleasant so
it's about
quality and appropriate quantity it's
not necessary to offer everything to
people
