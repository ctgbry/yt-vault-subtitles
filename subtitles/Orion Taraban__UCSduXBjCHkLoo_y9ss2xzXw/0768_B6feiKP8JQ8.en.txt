Mother Love in its ideal state is
probably the closest thing to
unconditional love that you can find
between two human beings that child grew
and developed inside the mother's own
body and was nourished and maintained by
that mother for some time afterwards
it's really a flesh in My Flesh Blood of
My Blood kind of a thing and I think
that when a woman goes through that
process and puts all that time and
effort and Care into forming the
physical structure of a human being and
delivering it into the world and nourish
ing it with her own milk and bonding
with it at such an intimate level and
over such a prolonged period of time
then she often cultivates a kind of
unconditional positive regard for that
child this regard is similar to the
balanced positive regard that healthy
high functioning people feel about
themselves like these people might fail
they might make mistakes but that
doesn't mean that they beat themselves
up about it or talk down to themselves
as a results and I think these two
things Mother Love and healthy
self-regard are related to each other
