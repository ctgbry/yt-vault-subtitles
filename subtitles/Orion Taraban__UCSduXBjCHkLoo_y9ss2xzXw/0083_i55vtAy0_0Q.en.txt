i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the mind cannot decide
this is a limitation of the analytical
thought process that is very important
to appreciate especially if you're prone
to using logic and reason as the
principal tools by which to navigate
reality
so
when we're confronted with a major
choice point in our lives it makes sense
to collect information relevant to the
decision and to extrapolate possible
outcomes associated with the options
available to us
doing both allows us to make informed
decisions correct
however
sometimes folks are subject to
overreaching the capacities of the
analytical mind believing that it's
capable of actually making the decision
for them
incorrect
if we're honest the highest to which the
analytical mind can attain is the
calculation of odds ratios associated
with various outcomes given a model
utilizing certain assumptions

[01:00]
utilizing certain assumptions
basically assuming these things to be
true and given the data that we have
there is a 87 percent chance that
outcome a will obtain and a 42 chance
that outcome b will obtain and so on
that's the best the analytical mind can
do
it cannot answer the question as to what
you should choose or whether something
is worth doing
the answers to both of these questions
depend on value judgments and value
judgments are irreducibly subjective
since they can't be objectively measured
they are non-quantifiable which means
they don't really lend themselves to
quantitative analysis
furthermore your rational analysis will
be flawed
because there will be inaccuracies in
your measurements and incomplete because
there will be unknown unknowns that were
not included among your assumptions and
both will inevitably skew the accuracy
of your predictions
the decision
to move forward is not an analytical
deduction
it is an act of the will
decision is an act of the will

[02:01]
decision is an act of the will
and as such it's more emotional than
rational
it's like yup i've done my due diligence
i know i have an 87 chance of success
given my model of reality i know it
might work i know it might not work and
i'm ready to roll the dice i'm good to
go i've decided
decision is a turning in a certain
direction as a result of a willful
choice
so it's fine to use the analytical mind
to do your due diligence in the service
of that decision
but it's actually not rational to expect
that analysis to decide what you should
do this will likely only increase your
confusion and indecision
appreciate the limitations of the
analytical mind and spare yourself the
headache
