I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is you never
lose someone all at
once this is an important concept to
keep in mind if you are going through a
breakup or thinking of ending a
relationship you never lose someone all
at once what does this mean generally if
you're thinking of ending a relationship
it's because things have been
unsatisfying or difficult for quite some
time
though you likely still have some
positive feelings for the other person
you're reaching the point where the
negatives are exceeding the positives
and it's time to re-evaluate the
feasibility of the relationship under
these conditions it can be hard to pull
the trigger and have that conversation
but frankly this can be done in less
than a minute you sit down with your
partner and you say I want to get a
divorce or I think it's time we go our
separate ways or whatever it doesn't
need to be long drun out discussion

[01:01]
need to be long drun out discussion
because it's not really a discussion
you're past the point of discussion
you're just informing the other person
of your decision to end the relationship
and this doesn't take long to do at all
this means that on some level a
relationship can be terminated in 30
seconds however as I discussed in the
episode the two relationships that level
is the level of the label or the
consciously negotiated structure of the
relationship
however it would be wrong to conflate
that with the level of the bond or of
the felt emotional connection with
another person the structure of a
relationship can end in a minute with a
single conversation but a bond that has
been established between two people and
nurtured over years or
decades that's not going to disappear
overnight and this is important to
understand you don't break up with
someone when you move your mouth and say

[02:02]
someone when you move your mouth and say
we're
done or you only break up with them at
the most superficial level when you do
this indeed this is why X's sometimes
get back together months or even years
after the termination of that structure
because the bond that connects those two
people is still alive do you understand
you only really truly break up with
someone when that emotional bond loses
its
Primacy you may always care for an ex
but you only really break up with that
person when you start to care about
someone else even
more and this is a big part of what can
make breakups so confusing for people
like if things have been hard or
conflictual in your relationship for a
while and you sit down with your partner
and terminate the
relationship your initial emotional
response could very well be one of
relief thank God thank God I don't have

[03:01]
relief thank God thank God I don't have
to deal with that person's
anymore I'm free free no more jealousy
or sulkiness or irritability or guilt
tripping or
whatever the feeling of leaving your own
apartment without having to tell someone
else where you're going and when you'd
be back and what you'd be doing there is
rapturous it's the subtle quickening of
a spring Breeze after a long harsh
winter
an incomparable
emotion in any case when things are bad
there can be an upselling of positive
emotions once a relationship ends relief
giddiness even expansive Joy however
this is only the end of the relationship
at like the logistical level which again
can feel like an emancipation if the
relationship was difficult little if any
grieving occurs at this time and why

[04:00]
grieving occurs at this time and why
would it grief and joy can't really
coexist in a single heart that said the
bond the cultivated emotional connection
between two people can persist for some
time afterwards it doesn't just
disappear because things were hard in
fact the bonds formed in difficult
relationships can be some of the hardest
bonds to surrender these bonds also
don't just disappear as a function of
time like there are people that you have
haven't spoken to in years that you
could probably call up and reasonably
expect that they will make themselves
available to you right this isn't about
time it's about
investment if you're interested in
taking your understanding to the next
level I would encourage you to check out

description for more information hope to
see you
aboard as I've said the emotional
connection starts to disappear when you
begin to prioritize another Bond ahead
of the one you cultivated with your ex
and when your ex apparently succeeds in
doing this first it can really hurt what
I've discovered and this is a especially
true for guys is that men typically do
not grieve a relationship when it ends
they grieve it when they learn that
their ex is now seriously involved with
someone else this is because you don't
lose someone when you break up with them
or stop talking to them or start dating
other people you lose them when they
begin to move on with someone else when
you learn through her decisions that
another man is now in sh shrined in her

[06:00]
another man is now in sh shrined in her
heart and this happens gradually you
don't lose someone all at
once it's this knowledge and the pain it
can create that can motivate men to
urgently and desperately seek to
preserve a bond that they feel is
slipping away this could be months or
even years after the official
termination of a relationship and it's
why programs that purport to get your ex
back constitute a billion- dooll
industry now I'm not saying that men
should act on these impulses and
actually try to get their ex back that
is almost always a terrible idea I'm
simply explaining where these impulses
come from they arise when a man hasn't
sufficiently grieved his previous
relationship and or hasn't prioritized a
new Bond in the intervening
time that said this bond is chipped away
bit by bit you lose someone

[07:00]
bit by bit you lose someone
when you learn that she has started
dating someone else then you lose her a
bit more when you learn that she has
moved in with him and you lose her a bit
more still when you learn that she's
engaged and you lose her a lot more when
she gets married etc etc and this seems
to hold true despite a lot of men's
macho posturing in my experience guys
often think they're well and done with
something before they really are but
with each new law L they experience a
flare up of the old pain and panic and
they discover that they still have a
little bit more to grieve ideally this
becomes easier and easier at each
subsequent stage but my point here is
that you lose someone by degrees as she
reinvests the love and affection she
once felt for you into other
relationships Time by itself does not
destroy that
Bond so what can be done about this

[08:00]
Bond so what can be done about this
well in the first place this pain can be
mitigated if you genuinely and sincerely
can wish her well like let's be honest
you should want her to get involved with
somebody else let's not be so bitter and
Petty that we want every former partner
to live the rest of her life in
loneliness and despair because she's not
in a relationship with you anymore
that's pretty narcissistic like why
would you want that for anybody let
alone somebody that you purport to care
about you can want the best for an ex
while understanding that she's an ex for
a reason right after all the decision to
love someone is entirely independent of
the decision to be in a relationship
with that
person and in the second place men can
get better at grieving their
relationships at earlier stages of the
game this can mean sitting with their
emotions or honoring the positives or

[09:00]
emotions or honoring the positives or
rewriting the story of the relationship
Etc guys who don't do this are often hit
harder further down the road when they
learn of their ex's investment in other
people just keep in mind that grief is a
mysterious process it tends to come and
go in its own time and For Better or
Worse it's something that you will
probably have to deal with at some point
in your life this is because few men are
such cold-hearted gangsters that they
won't have to process the end of an
important relationship to some degree
nor I would argue should we want to
