in my recent video the fear of
commitment there was a number of
comments that basically suggested that
whereas
maybe most men do not have a fear of
commitment that a subset of men
typically those who are anxious avoidant
men do have a fear of commitment and i'd
like to say that that's i don't actually
agree with that perspective and here's
why
again anxious avoidant men
typically do not fear commitment many of
these are like software programmers they
have high paying jobs they have leases
they get into contractual agreements all
the time
what anxious avoidant men and women are
afraid of is not commitment
or just the
consistent discharge of obligation
they're afraid of engulfment
and this was a point that someone made
one of his comments which is sometimes
it's not about offering more because
more can be a worse offer to an avoidant
person sometimes less is more
