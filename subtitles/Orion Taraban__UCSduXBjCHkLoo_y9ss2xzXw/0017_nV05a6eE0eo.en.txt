i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is setting
effective boundaries this is like a
fundamental skill
with respect to a clinical practice it's
something i talk about with my clients
all the time
and there's definitely a right way and a
wrong way or at least
an effective and an ineffective way to
set boundaries with other people
in short the ineffective ways anything
that tries to control
the other person's behavior
generally that just doesn't work if
anything it can make the situation even
worse through a phenomenon called
reactants which is basically that no one
likes being told what to do
and so sometimes we go ahead and do the
opposite just
to to assert and to remind ourselves the
other person of our freedom and autonomy
so trying to control other people's
behavior generally isn't it
isn't effective and creates reactants so
instead

[01:00]
instead
um effective boundary setting has to do
with
elucidating the consequences of certain
behaviors
namely what are you going to do
in response to a certain
action a certain behavior
um it's kind of like saying the other
person
you can do whatever you want you can get
angry and throw things
you can drink until you're in a stupor
every night
you can go off and philander and break
our
you know exclusivity agreement you can
do whatever you want
but if you continue to do that i'm going
to tell you what the consequence for
that action will be
which is fundamentally that i'm going to
take myself out of that situation
now of course you can't say that unless
you're actually willing to follow
through with that consequence
you don't want to set
reinforcements that you're not able or

[02:00]
reinforcements that you're not able or
willing to follow through on
but it's like if you you're free to do
whatever you want but if you do that
this is what i'm going to do because i'm
also free to do whatever i want and i
don't want to stay in a relationship
that's mistrustful or that is
inebriated or is abusive in some way or
just disrespectful
is i'm going to take myself out of the
situation and effectively ask the other
person to choose between you know
the problematic behavior from your point
of view and
the relationship that that person has
with you
um and if that person
continues that behavior then you
execute the the consequence that you had
discussed with that person previously
and that's boundary setting it's not
that the person
won't read
um that it's not like that other person
might not ever do that problematic
behavior again
it's that you are no longer going to

[03:02]
it's that you are no longer going to
enable or tolerate a behavior that's
unacceptable to you
in a relationship anymore and i think
it's really important to come across
boundaries from this perspective because
it's empowering to the individual
setting them
if it's about controlling the other
person's behavior well that's something
that's ultimately not in your power to
to do so whereas you
you have control over whether you
continue to participate in a
relationship or not
whether you physically take yourself out
of a situation or not the vast majority
of the time
so it it seats the power back
inside of a person's domain of control
so that's what i have to say on that
subject please like and subscribe we'll
talk more in future episodes
