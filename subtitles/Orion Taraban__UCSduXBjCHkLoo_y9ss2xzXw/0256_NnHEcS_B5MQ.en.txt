i'm dr o'ryan taraban and this is
psychax better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
all mental illnesses are compromises
so what does that mean
well before i offer an explanation

thanks for your help
what it means is that as people move
through life they are subject to
experiencing great pain suffering and
trauma
and when they come into contact with
pain suffering and trauma there is a
healthy tendency to avoid that which is
causing the problem
the issue is that the problem the pain
suffering and
trauma
exist in reality
and by avoiding the problem they're
avoiding reality
now if they avoid reality too much they
will create other forms of pain

[01:02]
will create other forms of pain
suffering and trauma
because they will be acting in a way
that's not grounded in reality
as
ein rand said you can avoid reality but
you can't avoid the consequences of
avoiding reality
so all mental illnesses constitute a
compromised solution
they seek to avoid the pain that exists
in reality as much as possible
while actually avoiding reality itself
as little as possible
and the degree to which folks will be
successful in their compromises depends
on a host of factors including their
temperament their intelligence their
social context and their overarching
culture pretty interesting huh
when folks are fairly successful in
their compromise solutions we call them
neurotic
this means that they've distorted
reality somewhat to avoid coming into
contact with the pain that exists there
but that their reality testing is still
largely intact
neurotics suffer from a mitigated pain

[02:01]
neurotics suffer from a mitigated pain
of reality in addition to the pain
created by their reality distortions but
the sum of both is considered to be less
than the unmitigated pain of reality
on the other hand when folks
significantly distort distort reality to
avoid coming into contact with the pain
that exists there we call them psychotic
their reality testing is no longer
intact and their beliefs and behavior
can be very bizarre
psychotics often no longer suffer from
the pain of reality but they can suffer
a great deal from the pain created by
their reality distortions
that said the pain created by their
reality distortions is still considered
to be less than the unmitigated pain of
reality so this does represent a
solution of sorts
the various factors i mentioned before
temperament intelligence context culture
will flavor the compromise in specific
ways for instance one person will
compromise in a way that we describe as

[03:00]
compromise in a way that we describe as
ocd
and another will compromise in a way
that we describe as schizophrenic and
yet another will compromise in a way
that we describe as body dysmorphic
these are all just fancy scientific
sounding terms for the flavors of
compromise
a compromise that seeks to avoid the
pain that exists in reality as much as
possible while actually avoiding reality
itself as little as possible
hopefully that makes sense what do you
