i'm dr o'ryan taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
not everyone can be saved
so this is an uncomfortable topic
it's one that we would collectively
prefer not to hear but i would be lying
to you if i suggested in any way that it
was not true
but before i explain why please remember
to like this video and subscribe to this

costs you nothing and it's how you can

high quality content to the world
thanks for your help
now
we don't have the belief that everyone
can be saved in the medical sciences
like we do in clinical psychology
if a patient comes into an emergency
room after a terrible car accident and
his body has been pulverized and he's
bleeding internally in a hundred
different locations and his brain is
swelling out of his skull
only a grossly incompetent or an
arrogantly deluded doctor could examine
this person and say yes i can put this

[01:01]
this person and say yes i can put this
person back together
just as good as he was before the
accident
we all understand that the human body
the physical structure the stuff of
which were made has certain physical
limits and that once we exceed those
limits the body cannot be healed
sometimes not completely sometimes not
at all
when a person does recover from a
physical injury
the scar tissue doesn't have the same
suppleness and sensitivity as the
original flesh did
and that's something that will never
change
and we generally do a good job of
accepting that fact
however for whatever reason we
culturally have this idea that no matter
what a person suffers emotionally or
spiritually
that he or she can be restored to their
previous level of functioning and
wholeness and well-being
not only can these wounds always be
healed but always be healed completely
but they can be healed completely

[02:00]
but they can be healed completely
without scar tissue
and that if some rigidity or
insensitivity persists well
that's just a failure of the therapy or
the patient which could be addressed
with more or different therapy
and unfortunately i'm here to tell you
that that's not true
people are subject to passing through
experiences sometimes it's a single
traumatic experience sometimes it's a
series of traumatizing experiences
that more or less leave them
permanently disabled at least in part
from a psychic or an emotional
perspective
even more frequently when people heal
from the bleeding injury and an
emotional scar forms
they don't return to the same degree of
sensitivity and openness that they
previously enjoyed in fact
that's what healing might look like
for some folks
and more or different therapy won't make
a difference
on some level we all need to grieve the
loss

[03:00]
loss
of that which doesn't return in our
healing however this is not the end of
the story
despite our losses we can focus on those
resources and faculties that we do still
possess and that may yet still allow us
to move forward in the direction of our
goals
humans possess an indomitable spirit and
this indomitability can more than make
up for whatever was lost in the course
of a lifetime in most cases
there's enough left over for us to make
a good show of it moving forward
