i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is how to forgive forgiveness
is really at the core of healing when it
comes to the psychotherapeutic process
it's a skill and it's a skill that at
least in my own experience
no one really taught me how to do even
though my loved ones in society more or
less expects forgiveness from me on a
regular basis
the first thing i want to clarify with
respect to forgiveness is that
forgiveness
is an intrapersonal not interpersonal
behavior
that means that forgiveness doesn't
actually involve
the other person you can forgive someone
without
ever talking to that person again for
the rest of your life
forgiveness is an intrapersonal behavior
it's something that you do
within your own heart and mind and you
do it for yourself forgiveness
also does not approve or condone a

[01:01]
also does not approve or condone a
certain behavior
forgiveness is a skill by which you
relieve yourself of the resentment
that would otherwise embitter your heart
as a result of moving through a painful
experience now the issue
when it comes to forgiveness is that too
many people get hung up on the specific
behavior in question they think for
instance
this person cheated on me and i would
never cheat so i can't get around the
fact that someone will decide to do this
it's
unforgivable or this person
lied to me i would never do that i would
never lie to someone
so i'm hung up on this specific
unforgivable behavior
now this is what i would like you to
consider instead of focusing on the
specific behavior
try to shift your focus to the
conditions
from which the behavior likely emerged
think about it if this person acted that
way
and what they did was really bad

[02:02]
and what they did was really bad
then they must not have really
understood the consequences of that
action
which means they acted out of ignorance
and confusion
they were lost in darkness they thought
in the moment that what they were doing
was good
but they were wrong they were deceived
by their emotions
and here's the key i know what that's
like
i know what it's like to be ignorant i
know what it's like to be confused
i know what it's like to be lost in
darkness and i've definitely made
choices in a highly emotional state that
at the time
felt right but i eventually came to
regret
and i also know that i don't think of
myself as
all bad so this person and i
actually do have some things in common
some important things in common
at least with respect to the underlying
conditions that give rise to poor
decisions
i also remember that i was in a lot of

[03:00]
i also remember that i was in a lot of
pain when i made those choices
i definitely wasn't living my best life
so by making use of this perspective
taking exercise it's possible to
transform
anger into a kind of pity for the
experience
of being lost in darkness we all know
what that's like
and i don't think any of us would choose
to revisit that state
and that's precisely the state the
person i'm angry at was in
when they chose to do what they did now
depending on the circumstances
you may have to do this perspective
taking exercise hundreds of times
but it's something that you can meditate
on in the privacy of your own heart
in order to let go of resentment over
time
and that's how you forgive i hope this
helps
