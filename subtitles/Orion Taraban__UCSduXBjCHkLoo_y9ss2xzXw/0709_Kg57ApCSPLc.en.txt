I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is dating
off the beaten path so this episode is
specifically addressed to all the
unconventional people out there who are
struggling to meet someone to have a
relationship with you're on the apps or
you're going to parties but you're not
finding anyone that you resonate with
and you're beginning to feel exhausted
and hopeless about the whole Endeavor as
a very unconventional person myself I
know what that can feel like and I have
some ideas about how to break out of
that unfulfilling
spiral the inspiration for this episode
was actually an article that I read
several years ago despite my efforts I
have not yet been able to track it down
again but I'll do my best to summarize
what I remember basically the article
was written by a young male doctoral
student in the math department at
MIT and he was calculating the
probability of finding girlfriend based

[01:01]
probability of finding girlfriend based
on his various criteria and the
statistical data available his criteria
were things like she has to be a woman
she has to be single she has to live
within 50 miles of me she has to be
between 22 and 29 years old she has to
be reasonably attractive and this is the
kicker for our intents and purposes she
has to be at least somewhat conversent
in advanced mathematics as that
constituted a significant part of his
life
and after listing out about a dozen
criteria he then calculated the
probability of meeting this woman in the
next six months as one in 6

m547
212 as you might expect he was not
particularly encouraged by this finding
and yet despite all the odds the article
ends with him finding a girlfriend

[02:00]
ends with him finding a girlfriend
now you might think given his calculated
odds ratio how the [ __ ] did that happen
well it's actually not that surprising
if you think about it and the answer
actually helps to explain why statistics
like these can be so useless and
misleading think about it if you're
looking for a young woman located within
50 miles of MIT who is conversent in
advanced
mathematics where do you think you'd be
most likely to find her the bowling
alley some house party in South Boston
or I don't know the [ __ ] math
department at
MIT and that's precisely what happened
the author of the article met a fellow
grad student in his Department who had
an office like four doors down from his
they just hadn't yet crossed paths
because their schedules were different
kind of crazy right so I understand that
this is just anecdotal evidence but I

[03:01]
this is just anecdotal evidence but I
think it's suggestive to me the moral of
the story is that if you are in any way
unconventional like you have an
unconventional intelligence or an
unconventional lifestyle or an
unconventional religion or an
unconventional interest that is a core
part of your
identity then you actually want to go
further off the beaten path to meet
someone with whom to have a
relationship on the other hand if you're
a conventional person then you need to
go where the masses congregate but it
doesn't work for a conventional person
to go off the beaten path and it doesn't
work for an unconventional person to go
where the masses
congregate now I'm not using either one
of these words judgmentally it's not
better to be one or the other and each
comes with its own challenges and
benefits however it's for people to look
inside themselves individually to
determine which group they fall into
like By definition most people will be
conventional they want what their

[04:00]
conventional they want what their
culture wants for them so these people
just need to go where the people are as
most of those people will also be
conventional and want more or less the
same things it's not always that simple
but it's far simpler than dating for
unconventional people who tend to be
more singular and
complex if you appreciate the insights
on this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of of others over the
course of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the

[05:03]
description if you're unconventional and
you go where the people are to date
you're going to hate your life you're
going to feel misaligned with the people
you're coming into contact with which
can make you feel even more lonely and
isolated than had you just stayed home
alone which could just be what you
decide to do the next time you're
invited out fortunately there is an
alternative Beyond going out to the club
and staying home by yourself and that is
what lies off the beaten
path this means that you're actually
going to want to lean into whatever
makes you unconventional even more and
this can be scary for folks because they
think I'm already not having much luck
with the people I'm meeting but isn't it
a numbers game if I go off the beaten
path there will be even fewer people to
interact with so won't that decrease the
likelihood of finding what I want I know
it sounds counterintuitive and it tends

[06:01]
it sounds counterintuitive and it tends
to conflict with let's say the
probabilistic mindset we encountered in
the article earlier but even though you
will meet fewer people off the beaten
path the people you meet there will
almost certainly be more qualified
applicants this is because they are very
likely to be unconventional in many of
the same ways that you are
unconventional like for example if
you're living in Brooklyn and you are
into some esoteric offshoot of venas
yoga then you might need to travel to
India and spend some time in an ashram
there and I bet you dollars to Donuts
that if you do so you'll likely meet
some other Seekers there who are as
committed to the path as you are I
wouldn't even be surprised if some of
them traveled from Brooklyn to be there
if you are an unconventional person you
may just have to go Halfway Around the
World to meet someone in your own
neighborhood with whom you might be

[07:00]
neighborhood with whom you might be
compatible it's
counterintuitive but it's
true lean into your particularity the
further you go off the beaten path the
fewer people you'll encounter but the
greater the likelihood that those you do
encounter will be worth meeting leave
the crowds behind and move in the
opposite direction I guarantee that
wherever you go you won't be the first
person there there will already be
people there who have gone before you
and more people are likely to arrive in
the future and in my experience this is
where the most interesting people always
are so take a risk and lean into it at
the very least you know that you'll be
doing something that you enjoy which
will also make you more attractive to
the people you find there so it's a no
lose proposition Happy
Trails what do you think does this fit

episode along to someone who might
benefit from its message as it's the
word of mouth referrals like this that

word of mouth referrals like this that
really helped make the channel grow and
anyone looking to join my free Weekly
Newsletter or book a paid consultation

I also have a number of exciting
upcoming opportunities for this channel
I have a lot of things that are cooking
behind the scenes and I really can't
wait to share them with you um I'm
nearly there uh I just ask for a little
bit more patience um but they're coming
down the pipeline very soon
um probably released in Q4 of this year
in any case I appreciate your support
and thank you for listening
