If a guy is potentially dating a girl,
does her relationship history matter?
Yeah, to a certain extent it does. I
have an episode that's coming out soon,
maybe it's already out, called her
narcissistic ex. And it seems like in
today's day and age, every woman has a
narcissistic ex, some gaslighting,
arrogant personality disordered former
boyfriend. which is shocking because
according to the official
epidemiological data, 2% of the American
population has NPD, narcissistic
personality disorder. And that includes
both men and women. So how 2% or like 1%
of the population is having sex with 50%
of the population seems unusual, right?
I talk about why that might be a red
flag that a woman has a narcissistic ex
or certainly multiple personality
disordered toxic disastrous
relationships in her past. I mean, she's
likely contributing to that issue in a
way that she might not even be willing
to recognize. But it's rare for

to recognize. But it's rare for
lightning to keep striking the same
place over and over again, as it were.
If it keeps happening in many
relationships at set level, you have to
realize that you're the common
denominator. And I'm not saying that
it's necessarily that you're you're
responsible, that you're a bad person,
but you might be doing things to attract
that kind of dynamic into your intimate
circle. The issue with putting too much
stock in a woman's relationship history
is that women will treat men radically
different depending on how attracted
they are to them. So just because a
woman has been in one long-term
relationship before you met her, you
might think, "Oh, she's got a low body
count."
uh she's a stable girl because her
relationship history. She's just got
one. She's not just sleeping around.
That doesn't necessarily mean that she
wants a long-term relationship with you.
Mhm. She might not want any relationship
