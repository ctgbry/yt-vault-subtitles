what's the average age of uh marriage
for men and women is it like 30 and 28
is that 30 and 29 in this country so so
right 29 for women correct in no culture
on the planet is average woman's age at
first marriage more than average men's
age at first marriage it ranges from
like less than a year to almost a decade
on average in some culture do you guys
know how those numbers how those ages
have gone up over time like do you know
what it was like 50 years ago oh it's
definitely gone up and it was 1970
that's saw the big spike in ages the
average age at 1970 at marriage was like
22 24 now it's at
293 interesting I don't think it'll go
much higher than that why because it
wouldn't be in women's best interest for
it to go higher than that so you have to
understand that the reason why the data
looks this way is because it makes a lot
of sense for women to secure a lifetime
or a long-term commitment from a man at
the last moment that they enjoy an
relative advantage in the sexual
