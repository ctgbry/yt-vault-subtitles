I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is younger
men and older women
so this episode is a response to some of
the questions that were posted in the
comments of my episode why men like
younger women folks wanted to know well
what about the opposite what about when
younger men enter into relationships
with older women what does that mean
what do you have to say about that well
it turns out I have a lot to say about
that but before I get into it please
remember to like this episode And
subscribe to the channel it takes less
than a second costs you nothing and it's
a great way to get the Cougars to come
running if that's what you're into so do
the thing back to it so what does it
mean when a younger woman excuse me when
a younger man enters into a relationship
with an older woman well in the first
place it probably means that the man is
Young this Dynamic is much more likely
to occur when the man is 25 and the
woman is 40 and when the man is 40 and

[01:00]
woman is 40 and when the man is 40 and
the woman is 55. so this kind of
relationship younger man older woman is
kind of time-bound it generally occurs
when men are in their early 20s and
women are in their late 30s early 40s
and I gotta say
this Arrangement has a lot to speak for
itself it can be a really good
relationship and I'm speaking from
personal experience when I was in my
early 20s I had a number of lovers in
their late 30s and I'm really grateful
to these women we had a fantastic time
they really helped me to become more
confident in relationships and I'm still
on good terms with all of them today I
wish them all the best so I I would
actually highly recommend this
relationship to the young men out there
and there's a number of reasons why this
Dynamic can be really good for both
parties let's go back to my handy Bandy
graph on sexual Marketplace values as a
function of age derived from the Paper
aspirational Mate selection and online
dating markets here it is so where are

[02:02]
dating markets here it is so where are
the young men they are here
and where are the older women the women
in their late 30s they are
here
and would you look at that
these two groups are on the same power
level how fascinating and this kind of
makes sense there's nothing wrong with
young men per se but in general women
don't want them they have no wealth or
status or experience and there's nothing
wrong with older women per se but in
general men don't want them they're not
as physically attractive as their
younger competition so what you have are
two gendered classes at two different
stages of their lives that are generally
equivalent with respect to their
normalized sexual normalized sexual
Marketplace values so it kind of makes
sense that they would find each other
now this Dynamic younger man older woman

[03:02]
now this Dynamic younger man older woman
is really good for the short term like a
few years Max and that's because on some
level both parties know
that starting a family is probably not
in the cards and that works both ways
the woman probably isn't going to want
to reproduce with a young guy in his
early 20s who may not have a job or a
career or much in terms of material
prospects and vice versa the man
probably isn't going to want to take on
that kind of responsibility with a woman
who's nearing the end of her biological
window so it's like both parties know
that they're there really to enjoy
themselves
socially we think that the older man
younger woman Dynamic is primarily
sexual
however that's not the case and that's
because beyond the sexual element both
parties are actually in an ideal
situation to reproduce and start a
family the conditions are at least ripe

[04:00]
family the conditions are at least ripe
for that to happen and there is a
reality-based likelihood that it will
that's not really the case in a younger
man older woman Dynamic which typically
is primarily sexual these relationships
are all about enjoying the pleasure of
each other's company and there are a few
reasons why this Dynamic lends itself to
a sexual relationship so well in the
first place a young man's libido is
never gonna get higher they're basically
insatiable at that age on the other hand
there's a lot of research that indicates
that women's desire for sex tends to
increase as they get older so you have
two people entering into a relationship
with very high sex drives if not the
highest sex drives that they will ever
have across their entire lifespans young
men want to have sex and older women
often don't have the same Hang-Ups about

[05:00]
often don't have the same Hang-Ups about
sex that younger women do so there's
less game playing about it
and here's something else to consider
men are just sort of expected to know
what to do with a woman
no one's really supposed to teach him
and no one really does he's just
supposed to know
and when he doesn't he can feel
inadequate and his Partners if he's
fortunate enough to have any can feel
resentful
young women in particular generally have
neither the ability nor the inclination
to teach men how to be good lovers they
can be extremely impatient and they can
get away with being extremely impatient
on the other hand older women can have
this patient feminine energy about them
that can help a guy learn without
shaming or blaming him when he
inevitably makes mistakes and this of
course can serve the woman in question
as well because she can sort of subtly
guide him toward what works for her if
she's willing to put in the time to do

[06:00]
she's willing to put in the time to do
so it can be a win-win relationship
and that's what I have to say today
about younger men and older women
there's more but I'll save that for
another episode let me know what you
