You can get a very good feel for the
ideas and attitudes that are circulating
at any given time by viewing memes. And
one of these memes provoked a response
in me that I'm going to share with you
today. It was a textbased meme, and I'm
going to paraphrase it as I don't have
it up in front of me. It went something
like, "If you're dating a woman in her
30s and you're not serious about moving
things along, then don't waste her time
because in the next 6 months, she's
trying to get married, start a family,
launch a business, get her mental health
in order, lose 20 lbs, and travel the
world. She just doesn't have time for
your bullshit."
And this was clearly a sentiment that
resonated with people. The meme had tens
of thousands of likes and many
supportive comments almost exclusively
from women that validated this
perspective. The real flaw in the
attitude represented by the meme is that
it sets women up for failure. With the
exception of maybe losing weight, not a

exception of maybe losing weight, not a
single one of those goals can
realistically be accomplished in less
than 6 months. As a consequence of their
choices in their 20s, they become
impatient to make up for lost time. And
this impatience both restricts the
amount of time they allocate to any
individual project and motivates them to
take on too many projects at once, both
of which are associated with sub-optimal
outcomes. Couple this with an entitled
attitude that life should accommodate
their abbreviated timelines, and you're
off to the races. Women, if you want
better outcomes, you have to make better
choices.
