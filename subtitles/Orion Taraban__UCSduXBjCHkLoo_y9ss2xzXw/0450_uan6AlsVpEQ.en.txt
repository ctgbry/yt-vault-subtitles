[00:00]
the reality has a certain
like we all know that when you when you
take reality and then you distort it
through your own interpretation your
lens and you use it to play out some
fantasy like if you find an average girl
with an average personality but you
project on her all this amazingness and
you live out this pretend fantasy for a
couple of weeks that she's this
incredible girl she's gonna solve all
your problems there's a kind of like
like an amphetamine style like high that
comes from that is like oh I'm getting
away from reality I'm doing this but
you've got to keep kind of going
and it's it's it's not very satisfying
in fact it's anxiety provoking it's not
really that good so in case you're like
inclined to not process your grief
because you don't want to give up these
delusions about how special and amazing
women are then to solve all your
problems you'll be happily ever after in
case you don't want to do that work let
me tell you that you're not really
giving up anything that's that's special
you know what I mean playing out that
fantasy is not that good the reality of
a good relationship it's it's more like

[01:01]
a good relationship it's it's more like
calm it's like gentle it's peaceful you
know what I mean there's a sort of quiet
satisfaction and pride that never
expresses itself with really intense
emotions or a huge rush of thoughts or
or aspirations about the future no it's
quite grounded and based on on the
present moment and it's infinitely more
satisfying so
like grave because you're not giving up
anything good like what you get
what you get at the end of The Grieving
the the dream as Dr Ryan just said is
you get reality and reality is so much
better than anything that you could
imagine if you do it right I suppose
yeah yeah this reminds me of the origin
myth of romantic love which is the um
the myth of Tristan and his oldie are
you familiar with that myth I'm not and
just as a small technical thing is your
camera like bobbing up and down ever so
slightly is it I maybe I'm oh I'm
knocking the table so it kind of okay
I'll try not to do that thanks for

[02:00]
I'll try not to do that thanks for
calling that out so um
this is like the foundational myth of
Western romantic love it originated in
the south of France in like the 13th
century and it's a very interesting
story
um Tristan is a knight in the service of
his King and he basically drinks a magic
potion that causes him to fall in love
with
the king's wife and she drinks the same
poster so she falls in love with him and
so they have this horrid passionate love
affair that
exists even though they don't even know
each other even though they don't even
really like each other they kind of are
miserable when they're apart but also
like especially miserable when they're
together and in the course of this story
Tristan actually like swears this woman
off ah this is crazy I have to stop
seeing this woman and she's like no I I
have to we can never do this again and
he gets involved with a woman who's

[03:01]
he gets involved with a woman who's
in this in the myth is also named
assaulty but it's a different facility
and she's the assaulty of the white hand
and in this relationship they can have
they live together like she is a textile
person and they have dinner together and
they they like create a household
it's a peaceful ordinary relationship
that's functional
and Tristan is completely bored like he
can't stop thinking about the first
facility
and he eventually leaves that
relationship because it felt
unfulfilling like something was missing
and I think this is really important
because what you talked about is you
maybe you can't get everything that you
want from a relationship maybe part of
the problem here is that people are
going to relationships expecting the
wrong things but
it could be that if you leave those
expectations to the side there's enough

[04:01]
expectations to the side there's enough
that you can get out of an actual
relationship to justify let's say the
sacrifices involved in creating and
maintaining it
oh my God yeah really well put so to add
on to that just to flesh it out and put
some flesh on the bones here
a lot of people did not grow up with
having all of their emotional needs and
their attachment needs adequately met by
their parents parenting in the west is a
bit of a disaster
um I think we're getting better in some
regards but for the most part for the
generation of me I'm 35 Dr Ryan's 40 I
think a lot of people kind of become
adults but they're stunted emotionally
they have a bunch of unmet needs and
then you couple that with the fairy tale
happily ever after Hollywood soul mate
kind of fantasy myth I've got to find my
missing half a lot of people are
bringing a huge amount of expectations
to their partner they're going to solve
this they're going to solve that like
they're going to fix all of these things
and it's unrealistic but if you can
understand what the limitations of a
woman what a wife or even a boyfriend if

[05:02]
woman what a wife or even a boyfriend if
this doesn't have to be gender but what
a partner can do for you then in the
course of that relationship you will try
and get those unmet needs met realize
that it's not appropriate and then if
you're diligent you can work through it
and that the relation relationship
itself can become an Arbiter of reality
of what's appropriate to ask of another
person and what's not and you never
delve too deeply into codependence you
actually work on becoming too
interdependent people that's quite
functional and so it becomes a vehicle
for self-growth in a sense and once
you've used that process to its
completion you realize holy it's
through this relationship that I've
actually discovered where I start and
where I begin like where my boundaries
are who I am and I've also helped this
other person come that way at that point
when you're not bonded through
obligation or codependence that's I
think where True Love Actually exists
it's a pair bonded trust respect Mutual
enjoyment of each other's company and
it's incredible it's amazing
but it's specifically all those good

[06:02]
but it's specifically all those good
things because it never tries to be
something that it's not it's a lot of
guys are coming to me and the fight to
having their girlfriend are just
variations of this exact theme and so
what I I tell them is that
you'll probably love this as a
practicing clinician but there's nothing
wrong with the emotions that you have
the needs that you that you have the the
unmet needs it's just that she's not the
right person to fix that girlfriends are
not your mothers and he's like well I
have a relationship with my mother
like what am I going to do I'm like a 30
year old man now I was like yeah I get
that go see a therapist you know go see
Dr Ryan go see somebody else because
there are actual qualified professionals
who exist to help you work through all
of that stuff and you can be codependent
you can have transference with that
person you can play out all of your
insecurities in that therapist's office
and get those needs met and it's so much
healthier to do that with that person
than to try and do it with your
relationship because there are so many
good relationships that are ending

[07:01]
good relationships that are ending
simply because of unrealistic
expectations and that's a tragedy
well yeah a lot there so Robert Johnson
am I making really long monologues I
apologize this is great man I'm really
enjoying talking with you so Robert
Johnson is a jungian psychologist he
wrote a book called we which is a really
wonderful book it's about 100 pages long
people can read it in an afternoon and
it's a jungian interpretation of the
Tristan and soldiment and basically his
fundamental
thesis is that romantic love is a
conflation of the human and the Divine
and that's symbolized by the magic
potion that Tristan they sold a drink
it's made out of herbs so it's like
natural and earthy but it also is magic
so it's supernatural and the danger
comes when we expect the other person to
be more than human or divine
that they can solve all of our problems
that they can make us complete that they
can make us happy and another person
doesn't and shouldn't and can't have
that kind of power over you unless you

[08:01]
that kind of power over you unless you
give it to them inappropriately and
that's a disaster because we have to
remember that in every classic romance
in literature and history every classic
romance ends in tragedy ends in death
like and that's because on some level
the Romantic idea is that the lovers can
be United at once only in the next life
so
it's not possible for romantic lovers to
actually live happily ever after here
the Romantic narrative The Narrative Arc
of romance is tragedy
and that's why the Romantic cause is
always the one that's the underdog the
one that doesn't really have any chance
of winning it's hard to root for the
Yankees unless you're from the Bronx
there you have no soul because they have
you know all those championships it it's
hard to root for the
the thing that works the thing that's
successful people don't like to do that
for whatever reason
