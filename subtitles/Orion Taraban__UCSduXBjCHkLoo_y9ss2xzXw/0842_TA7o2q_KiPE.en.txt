I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is not
everyone can be happy it's the truth not
everyone can and we do ourselves a
disservice like we collectively Gaslight
ourselves when we believe that happiness
is or should be within everybody's reach
but let's be clear the line between
those who can be happy and those who
can't is not an external one it's not
like happy people have a pora and
unhappy people don't or happy people are
married and unhappy people aren't or
happy people are attractive and unhappy
people aren't happiness does not have to
do with externals which means that
people can be happy under any set of
external
circumstances though to be fair some
circumstances are much more challenging

[01:00]
circumstances are much more challenging
than others rather happiness is
ultimately dependent on people's
internal states which is precisely why
not everyone can be happy not everyone's
internal state is conducive to happiness
in fact most people's internal states
are completely antithetical to happiness
it's like certain plants just can't grow
in certain soils you can plant the seeds
with care you can water them as much as
you want you can be as patient as a
saint but certain plants just aren't
going to grow in that soil and changing
everything except the soil isn't going
to make much of a difference now no one
really has an issue with this when the
topic is botany like no one thinks that
date palms should grow in Northern
tundra or that Mangrove should take root
in the desert but for some reason people
believe that everyone should be happy

[02:01]
believe that everyone should be happy
which is tantamount to believing that
happiness is somehow independent of
internal conditions and this belief is
either crazy or
ignorant here's something that I figured
out a while ago you are free to think
whatever you want like you can treat
your mind like a little laboratory or
little sandbox and in the privacy of
your own Consciousness you can test or
play with all kind
of thoughts and ideas you can think
hateful things you can think absurd
things you can think patently untrue
things you are free to think whatever
you want that is your right however you
are not free to feel however you want as
a consequence of what you choose to
think that Parts not up to you if you
choose to think that you are worthless
and incompetent

[03:00]
and incompetent
and that nothing ever goes your way you
are going to feel
depressed if you choose to think that
you are a Perpetual victim of betrayal
and Injustice you are going to feel
angry if you choose to think that other
people have good things that you could
never hope to earn or
achieve you are going to feel envious
etc etc etc and it's not possible to
feel happy if you sign simultaneously
feel depressed or angry or envious like
those two states cannot coexist at the
same time and this means that in order
to feel happy you cannot allow yourself
to feel certain emotions antithetical to
that experience and in order not to feel
those emotions you cannot allow yourself
to think in certain ways certain
thoughts certain
beliefs pollute people's minds they like
irradiate the soil making it impossible

[04:02]
irradiate the soil making it impossible
for happiness to grow if you follow my
reasoning then you inevitably come to
the conclusion that in order to be happy
you may need to change how you think not
just what you think certain thoughts
very clearly are just not your friends
and may need to be forcefully resisted
using tactics like the block and replace
Technique No changing what you think is
just the first step ultimately the goal
is to change how you think as this will
make happiness both more attainable and
more
sustainable two important ways to do
this are by changing your attention and
by changing your language both attention
and language are habits we don't usually
think of these things as habits as
tendencies that we practice and rehearse
but they are unfortunately everyone's
habits of attention and language form

[05:00]
habits of attention and language form
before they are consciously aware of
forming them some of us look out and
cultivate good habits from the get-go
but the vast majority of us do not and
our habits must be consciously and
intentionally reprogrammed in
adulthood if you're interested in taking
your understanding to the next level I
would encourage you to check out the
Captain's Quarters my membersonly

sessions hosted by yours truly and
exclusive content that you won't find
anywhere else click the link in the
description for more information hope to
see you
aboard let's start with attention
attention is the habit of what you
choose to focus on now most people tend
to focus on the negative on the problems
the threats the loss

[06:00]
the threats the loss
and there might be good reason why this
seems to be the psychological default
namely it facilitates survival it might
be better from a survival standpoint to
focus on negatives even if it leads to
false positives than to focus on
positives which could lead to false
negatives like it might be better to
mistake the shadow for a lion than to
mistake the lion for a shadow you don't
tend to get as gobbled up that way in
any case what might be good for survival
may not be conducive to flourishing to
growth to gains to
Solutions and it may be necessary to
consciously and intentionally focus on
other things on your strengths your
victories the good in other people in
order to cultivate greater happiness and
contentment this is important because in
general the Mind finds what it's looking
for even if it has to create it to find
find it like the mind is a hunter if it

[07:03]
find it like the mind is a hunter if it
hunts for problems it's going to find or
create problems and if it hunts for
Solutions it's going to find or create
Solutions this is the nature of the mind
and it's very important to
remember now this can feel weird and
unnatural and fake when you start to do
it because it's not yet an integrated
habit it's kind of like wearing someone
else's clothes
it can feel a little like play acting
but there's kind of No Way Around this
you're going to have to pass through
this period of conscious incompetence in
order to cultivate conscious competence
which can ultimately become unconscious
once more like learning a new language
or performing a new exercise it's not
always going to feel awkward or forced
but it may feel that way for a while as
you firm up the foundation of the new

[08:01]
you firm up the foundation of the new
habit it will likely also be necessary
to alter your language habits why
because words are not just words like
the semantics of a word are the most
superficial and apprehensible attributes
of a word they're like the little peaks
of a giant Iceberg piercing the surface
of the water the vast majority of the
iceberg remains invisibly submerged in
the depths words are actually very
complex cognitive structures they are an
interdependent network of Concepts and
associations and memories and
impulses and some words are connected to
Concepts and associations that are not
really conducive to our well-being the
more these Concepts and associations are
activated the more emotional states
antithetical to our happiness will flues
inside of us this idea is the Crux of
neurolinguistic programming or NLP which

[09:03]
neurolinguistic programming or NLP which
is a very interesting branch of Applied
psychology basically by systematically
changing our linguistic habits we can
alter the activation of certain
cognitive structures which can
ultimately have a profound impact on our
subjective emotional experience here's
one example try to replace the phrase I
have to with I choose to even in your
own selft talk and notice how you feel
when I use the phrase I have to I'm
basically conceptualizing myself as a
less powerful object VI a more powerful
subject and this is problematic as it's
pretty hard to feel good about being
compelled to do something I have to go
to the gym it is that really true like
no you don't you can be unfit and

[10:01]
no you don't you can be unfit and
unhealthy millions of people are there
is no one compelling your attendance and
believing otherwise is likely going to
transform that activity into a chore
over time even if that's not really what
you meant to imply with that language
it's connected to those associations
beneath the surface on the other hand by
thinking and speaking I choose to go to
the gym you're reinforcing the belief
that you are prioritizing your health
and your Fitness which is is a very
different feel you've reframed an
obligation as a free choice which will
activate a completely different set of
Concepts and associations beneath the
threshold of your
awareness again just like making an
effort to alter your attention changing
your language is going to feel weird and
unnatural for a while but that doesn't
mean it's not worth doing in order to
cultivate happiness it is necessary to
clarify the soil in which it is most
likely to grow and this will almost

[11:02]
likely to grow and this will almost
certainly require correcting your
attention and cleaning up your
language what do you think does this fit
