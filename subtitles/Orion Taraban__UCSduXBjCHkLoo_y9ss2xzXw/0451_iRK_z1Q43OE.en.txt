I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is
psychak's Better Living Through
psychology and the topic of today's
short talk is how to create more meaning
in your life
so this is something that I get asked
with some degree of frequency in my
consultations and in my private practice
paradoxically this question often comes
from very successful individuals that is
people have already made a great deal of
money achieve some measure of status or
significance and established a family
with children externally looking at
their Lifestyles they have achieved
everything that Society has told them
it's worthwhile to achieve the issue is
that on some level
they still feel unfulfilled
and this kind of makes sense once all of
a person's material conditions have been
taken care of the issue of life's
meaning becomes much more Salient For
Better or Worse it's much more difficult
to focus on these concerns when you're
just struggling to get by when people
are living month to month they are more
concerned about survival and escaping

[01:01]
concerned about survival and escaping
misery than say about questions of
existential meaning these are questions
that are Universal to humanity but that
are also somewhat privileged and that's
why they often come up in the context of
folks who have more successful lives
today I'm going to share with you my
recipe for creating meaning in life
there's this question that many
self-help gurus ask their clients the
question is what would you do if you
knew you couldn't fail
and it's a good question because it
allows people to see the extent to which
fear is holding them back from pursuing
the life they really want to live
because most people are afraid of pain
and failure this question helps to
clarify for the clients their true
desires untainted by self-limiting
beliefs so it's a useful question
however there is another really
important complementary question to ask
that as far as I know none of these

[02:02]
that as far as I know none of these
gurus do but it's a question that I
routinely ask my patients
and the question is
what would you do if you knew you
couldn't succeed
now on the surface this sounds like a
ridiculous question you might respond
Orion if I knew I couldn't succeed like
if there was a zero percent chance of
achieving the desired outcome
why would I bother trying
and that is an understandable response a
lot of things if you knew that you could
not get what you were striving for would
you and should you give up their Pursuit
absolutely
but here's the thing
there are things in life worth doing
even if we don't wholly succeed in
attaining them
in the world some mountains are worth
dying on
even if you don't reach the summit
and this is actually wonderful news as
the highest goals to which Humanity can

[03:02]
the highest goals to which Humanity can
aim probably won't be achieved in your
or my lifetime
if we couldn't climb a little higher and
have that effort matter if all Hills had
to be summited in our little lifetimes
then everything would be reduced to the
level of Personal Achievement which is
exactly where a lot of successful people
find themselves
the answer to the question what would
you do what would you still do if you
knew you couldn't succeed will reveal to
you the most significant opportunities
to develop meaning in your life
if you think about it it's actually hard
to transform an achievement into
something more meaningful that's because
achievement is an external reward like
money or sex or status or fame
these things are compensations for
successful effort and because they exist
there is no reason for your mind to

[04:00]
there is no reason for your mind to
produce internal compensations it's like
how are you going to focus if you're
popping Adderall all the time
but if we remove all of those external
compensations if we take away all the
money and the sex and the status and the
fame if we even take away the
self-satisfaction of virtue or the
possibility of transcendent Glory
then the mind will begin to generate a
compensation for itself
and that compensation is meaning

you've received from this message
because it's your donations that make
all of this happen couldn't do it
without you and I really appreciate your
support
now meaning is a way for the mind to

[05:00]
now meaning is a way for the mind to
resolve cognitive dissonance your mind
will think why the hell are we doing
this we're not getting anything out of
it but we're doing it anyway or what the
heck it looks like someone else is
benefiting from our efforts what's in it
for us
and one of the ways that the mind will
Comfort itself is by deciding oh
this must be a meaningful important
thing to do that's why we're doing it do
you understand now there is a trap here
and the trap is thinking that all effort
devoid of compensation is inherently
meaningful it isn't
so not getting any obvious reward does
not necessarily mean that you're helping
others or pursuing meaningful action
however your mind in its efforts to
reduce its dissonance might make you
think that you are
your mind will like naturally produce
this justification in the absence of
external compensation so you will have
to watch out for that and you can avoid
this trap by considering well
is anyone else benefiting from this

[06:00]
is anyone else benefiting from this
effort
action that is neither rewarded nor
benefits others is wasteful at best and
miserable at worst
and this is why a lot of the activity
that folks find meaningful has to do
with serving others in some capacity
whether it's their own children
or the people in their Community or
Humanity as a whole
however it's probably fair to say that
irrespective of the intended beneficiary
the more that you personally benefit
from your action the less meaningful
that action becomes and that's because
those personal rewards like weeds kind
of Choke out the space in which
meaningfulness which is a more slow
growing tree would otherwise Sprout do
you get what I'm saying
some fights are worth fighting
even if we personally can't win
and that's because some fights are
really Wars that must be fought over

[07:01]
really Wars that must be fought over
Generations perhaps even eternally the
victory may not be for us to enjoy
however we can choose to you know move
the standard a little further down the
field
and Unite with a movement that as
something larger than us is transcendent
by Nature
fighting for a victory that you won't be
able to enjoy negates the egoic
contribution to the effort and creates
the opportunity for something to matter
more than your little Personal
Achievement
this is how meaning is born
in short you will increase the
likelihood of cultivating meaning in
your life to the extent that you succeed
in finding things that are worth doing
even without the compensations of
success
that's where you need to look
and that shouldn't be too tall of an
order a especially for those successful
folks out there don't you already have
enough success why not sacrifice the

[08:01]
enough success why not sacrifice the
possibility of Superfluous reward in
order to achieve something that to you
in particular is far more valuable
this of course is the last place that
many successful people think to look
since they've trained themselves to look
for opportunities for achievement
and that's of course why it's precisely
here where it is to be found
