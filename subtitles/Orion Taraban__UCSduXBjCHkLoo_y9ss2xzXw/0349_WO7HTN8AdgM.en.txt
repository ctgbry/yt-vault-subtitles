the stoic philosophers believe that
within our domain of control we have the
capacity to Ascent to agree and to
dissent to disagree but they didn't
believe that we always have to use those
capacities there's a third option which
is neither a hunting nor dissenting
which basically means that I don't have
an opinion one way or the other and the
stoics believe that most Things fall
into this category that we should use
ascent and descent very consciously and
intentionally why is that because to
actually create a correct opinion about
something requires not only the
integration of your own experience but
analysis of objective data and evidence
it's a time consuming process it
requires critical thought it's actually
very difficult to do and the stoics
correctly understood that most people
are not going to take the time to do
that and that actually creates a lot of
problems for the individual and also in
society you don't have to have an
opinion
