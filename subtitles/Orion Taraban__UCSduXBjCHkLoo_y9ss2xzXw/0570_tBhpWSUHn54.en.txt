a woman's best strategy with respect to
these social movements is to encourage
as many other women as possible to
withdraw from the sexual Marketplace
either by means of the listrada protocol
or by making themselves less appealing
to men while continuing to remain
clandestinely in the sexual Marketplace
themselves sneaky sneaky right and I
think that's why a lot of the women who
openly support and encourage and
celebrate women who say cut off and dye
their hair or get tattoos and piercings
or denounce the patriarchy and vilify
men don't do so themselves H the more
women who withdraw from the marketplace
in ideological grounds and the more
women who make themselves less
attractive for ideological reasons the
better able the remaining women will be
to compete successfully for the
dwindling pool of desirable men keep in
mind that these motivations don't have
to be conscious in order to exert their
influence
