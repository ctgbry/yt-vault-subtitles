winning is associated with a good deal
of pressure and responsibility and
accountability few people hold losers
accountable we kind of think that
they've suffered enough as if
accountability is somehow throwing salt
in their wounds spoiler alert it's not
and losers who avoid accountability are
often maintained in their difficulties
longer than necessary as a consequence
of these good intentioned sympathizers
those who have not yet attained success
can also more easily delude themselves
into thinking that they could handle the
pressures and responsibilities of
success better than those who actually
won the world is full of armchair
quarterbacks who know exactly how they
would handle being in the pocket which
is doubtful at best finally winning can
completely destabilize your life this is
often why people self-sabotage when they
are on the verge of success the prospect
of attaining that reality becomes too
vertiginous and disruptive
