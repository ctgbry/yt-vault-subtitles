I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the most
effective marriage intervention so today
I'm going to talk about the one thing
that has single-handedly saved more
marriages than any other intervention in
the history of
relationships it's not couples's therapy
it's not effective communication it's
not a safe place to be vulnerable with
each other in a non-defensive
non-judgmental I see you seeing me
seeing you kind of a way and it's not
anything else that your culture
generally tells you is supposed to work
to solve marital dysfunction you're not
initially going to believe me when I
tell you what it is so I'm going to ask
for your consideration and openm
mindedness as I build my case over the
next several minutes here it is the most
effective marriage intervention
is an office

[01:01]
is an office
an office having an office has saved
more marriages than any other single
intervention in the history of the world
let's discuss why this might be the case
the fact of the matter is that men and
women were never designed to spend that
much time with each other this is not
how our closest primate ancestors behave
and it is not how human beings have
lived for hundreds of thousands of years
a good deal of our py psychology
including our emotional well-being our
sense of self and our interpersonal
relationships has been molded by our
evolutionary origins as this psychology
has been associated with success and
survival in generation after
generation throughout most of our
history humans have lived in small
communities and in these small
communities men and women weren't really
hanging out with each other the men were
hanging out with other men and the women
were hanging out out with other women

[02:01]
were hanging out out with other women
nor did this change with the Advent of
children children weren't raised by a
couple they were raised by an entire
community and primarily by a
multigenerational cohort of women the
concept of the nuclear family of the
expectation of 50/50 child care is an
extremely recent development it's very
new in evolutionary terms and it's
probably not a context in which either
men or women have evolved to thrive
in today's day and age because we no
longer live in small communities because
we no longer have access to Extended kin
networks we've created a situation in
which we expect our partners to be an
entire Village that's a lot of pressure
and expectation and as I've argued
previously that just might be too heavy
for a marriage to
support and this situation has been
exacerbated even further by the global
shutdowns in recent years people don't

[03:01]
shutdowns in recent years people don't
have to go into an office as often as
they used to and things might not ever
go back to the way they were and now
suddenly millions of people are spending
an inordinate amount of time day after
day every single day with one single
individual of the opposite sex like
millions of people started to live some
kind of weird cabin fever experiment
something that NASA might conduct to see
if their astronauts were mentally
resilient enough to withstand the
Journey to Mars without killing each
other like that's how unnatural this
situation is it's science
fiction there they are there they always
are it's like they're inescapable you
can't get out from under them and to
make matters worse this other person is
a man or a woman woman and why is that

[04:01]
a man or a woman woman and why is that
worse because this person the person
with whom you will now be spending all
day every day won't ever really be able
to understand you like I don't care how
enlightened and inciteful and empathic
you are a man can't ever really
understand what it's like to be a woman
and a woman can't ever really understand
what it's like to be a man in fact Mis
understanding between the Sexes seems
more the default than the alternative
and that's the person that you're stuck
with having an office that is having a
place to go and something to do there
has been the bulwark keeping marriages
together since the collapse of nuclear
families we eliminate this at our own
substantial
risk if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book book the value of others over the

[05:02]
book book the value of others over the
course of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description people should probably only
be spending a little bit of time every
day with their romantic Partners at most
at least if they want to keep any kind
of Desire or interest or attraction
alive in their relationships and trust
me this is very
important sometimes people think that
I'm sex crazed talking so much about the

[06:00]
I'm sex crazed talking so much about the
importance of sex and attraction to
long-term relationships however this is
a very myopic perspective sex is about
way more than just sex desire is a
leidal libidinal libidinal drive that
permeates so many other ostensibly
nonsexual components of a relationship I
guarantee that people try harder for
longer with people they are attracted to
kill that desire and you cut the engine
that motivates a lot of that effort this
is not a Bueno idea the greater the
attraction the stronger the willingness
to continue to enthusiastically
participate in the
relationship constant inescapable
contact murders attraction it's like a
zoo The Continuous surveillance might
prevent the animals from escaping but by

[07:02]
prevent the animals from escaping but by
that point they're so lifeless and
dispirited that they hardly constitute a
Flight Risk the vast majority of couples
do not suffer from too much distance but
too much closeness this closeness
creates a whole Suite of problems that
our culture then suggests should be
solved by moving even closer be more
present more vulnerable more transparent
more more communicative that's like
trying to dig yourself out of a hole it
doesn't work we collectively need to
move in the opposite direction we need
to reintroduce space and distance and
Novelty and freedom into our
relationships and the expectation that
all couples marry cohabitate and
otherwise spend all of their non-working
hours together needs to be challenged
however many couples will continue to
walk down this traditional path pathway

[08:00]
walk down this traditional path pathway
if this is you then you absolutely need
to leave the house you have to get away
from your partner men and women are
spending way too much time with each
other these days and it's driving them
crazy women expect their husbands to be
their girlfriends and want to talk to
them about everything and Men expect
their wives to be their buddies and they
want to hang out with them in general
it's much better for women to have other
women to talk to and it's much better
for men to have other men to hang out
with create space if you don't have an
office rent one like get a membership at
one of those co-working spaces or
something and get out of the house for a
substantial part of your day while
you're there do not remain in constant
contact with your spouse they do not
need to know what you are doing all the
time you're a grown adult cultivate some
unknown so that you actually have a

[09:00]
unknown so that you actually have a
reason to reconnect at the end of the
day offices save marriages having a
place to go and something to do there
has saved more marriages than couples
