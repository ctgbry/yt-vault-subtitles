I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why men
get jealous of their women's past
so this is something that comes up
fairly frequently in my sessions with
folks both in my private practice and in
my consultations and it's very troubling
for some guys it really eats them up
inside they learn a few details of their
woman's sexual history they extrapolate
mental fantasies based on those details
and these fantasies more or less come to
torture these individuals and if they're
not careful they can act out of that
pain and punish their women for what
they did before they even met them
obviously not a constructive behavior in
a relationship
however it is a real thing it can really
bother men and I'm here to explain why
this is the case this is important
because where understanding is anger is
not
to let go of the bitterness men must
first understand what is happening

[01:00]
first understand what is happening
inside of them so here we go first of
all you have to understand that men
don't feel this way about all women's
sexual history guys think about it if
you were just to hook up with a woman if
you had a brief fling or a Friends with
Benefits situation I doubt that you
would be emotionally bothered by her
sexual past if anything her sexual past
was kind of an asset to you because it
allowed ease of access to a sexual
relationship with her if she had never
had a casual sexual relationship before
it would have been more difficult for
you to engage her in one for the first
time so on some level her sexual history
made it easier for you to enjoy a sexual
relationship with her and I doubt that
you would be bothered by that so this
phenomenon in men only occurs in certain
relationships and what relationships are
those
it occurs when a man has become
emotionally bonded with a particular

[02:00]
emotionally bonded with a particular
woman
and why does this occur it can't be the
mate guarding behavior that evolutionary
psychologists like to talk about in this
case there's no one to guide her from
let's assume that she hasn't done
anything unto ward in the relationship
and that in fact she as as loyal as she
can be so why does the jealousy flare up
about her past
the answer is that when a man becomes
emotionally bonded with a woman
he begins to do things that he wouldn't
do with other women women with whom he
was only sleeping
he begins to make commitments and
sacrifices maybe he moves her in maybe
he proposes or gets married time energy
money and opportunity are all sacrificed
on the altar of that relationship
and this is not something he ordinarily
does this is not usual Behavior so his
mind observing this behavior isn't a bit
of a quandary it's like

[03:01]
of a quandary it's like
this isn't like you man what's going on
with you
this is the state of cognitive
dissonance and it's not a very pleasant
place to be so people generally try to
resolve that dissonance one way or
another usually unconsciously in order
to avoid the negative emotionality of
that state and the way that most men
unconsciously resolve the dissonance in
this situation is believing some variant
of
I'm making this huge investment in this
inordinate commitment to this particular
woman things that I have never done
before for any other woman
because this woman is special
she's not like the other women
she's different
and her difference is the legitimate
basis for my different Behavior yeah it
makes sense that I would treat a special
person specially
and what makes her special among other
things is that she doesn't do the kinds

[04:01]
things is that she doesn't do the kinds
of things that other women like the
women I've casually slept with do
therefore I feel good about the
commitment and sacrifice I'm making it's
warranted in this particular case

now resolving dissonance in this way
is how men really themselves up
because almost none of that is true
think about it
at a certain point you reach an age when
some of the women that you've just
casually slept with they get involved
with other guys they get married to
these men and start families and you're
probably not thinking wow what a lucky

[05:01]
probably not thinking wow what a lucky
guy I wish I could change places with
that dude
more likely you think something like wow
I can't believe a guy put a ring on that
finger
no jealousy at all but here's the thing
other guys
that your woman may have hooked up with
in the past are probably thinking the
same thing about you
that's not a great feeling no guy wants
to think that his special little lady
was some other guy's for the night
guys the truth is and and this can be a
bitter pill to swallow your woman isn't
special
she's just special to you
that specialness may only exist in your
own mind to other men she may just be a
willing warm body
men really get themselves in a pickle
when they attempt to resolve their
dissonance by believing that their women
are different
and that they would never do things that
other women would do

[06:00]
other women would do
a woman is a woman man and a woman will
do what a woman will do and expecting
that your particular sweetheart or wife
or fiance is going to be the exception
is probably not grounded in reality
and the pain that results from coming
into contact with that truth is not her
fault
that's something that you're potentially
doing to yourself through your beliefs
and expectations and you need to find a
way to get around that now if the scales
fall from your eyes and you begin to see
your woman as Just Another Woman
maybe you won't marry her or make big
uncharacteristic commitments or
sacrifices and maybe that's for the best
but even if you do decide to take that
step you can do so with your eyes open
and without Illusions you're not
marrying some chaste little princess
she's a woman like any other woman and
that means she comes with some kind of
sexual history one way or another

[07:01]
sexual history one way or another
in my truth about romance series I made
an episode on how romance is for men
here's another illustration of that fact
Romance the idealization of love the
pedestalization of woman is a tool that
men use to justify to themselves the
inordinate expense and commitment
they're making to one particular woman
because without that veneer of
specialness if a man saw his woman like
any other woman as just a woman it would
be very very hard for that man to make
an extraordinary commitment to an
ordinary person
romance is one way guys rationalize
their behavior relative to a specific
woman and knowledge of their woman's
past jeopardizes that rationalization
which is what provokes the jealousy you
got it

[08:01]
got it
so what's the upshot it's basically this
your woman is not different
this may provoke some anger or
resentment in some of you but you can
work through that you can work through
that and arrive at the point where you
can see her as just another human being
no better no worse and only then can you
really decide whether there is enough
left to justify your commitment
and until that time you're just
bullshitting yourself
