I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
Mastery of Life the Mastery of Life
boils down to one thing the ability to
be in the world but not of the world
this is very simple to say and
extraordinarily difficult to do it can
take a lifetime or depending on your
spiritual beliefs several lifetimes to
attain to this degree of Mastery I'm not
yet there myself though I do hope that
I'm making progress in that direction
but before I explain what I mean by that

so what does this mean to be in life but
not of life
it means that Mastery of the art of Life
arrives with the ability to fully
participate in the world while remaining
completely unattached to the world
on the one hand it means to be involved

[01:01]
on the one hand it means to be involved
in the goings-on of the times to make
the best use of one's capacities and
potentials to experience pleasure and
create meaning and nurture relationships
and to be engaged in the business of
life in all of its Dimensions as fully
as possible
on the other hand it means to remain
identified unidentified with unattached
to and independent from all those things
I just mentioned
now as hard as this is it's actually
easier to do when your life isn't that
good if your life is poor miserable and
painful it's much more difficult to
cling to life although people still do
prefer poverty and misery and pain to
death and potentially for good reason
that's because while there is life
There's Hope and circumstances can
change
that said The more good things you have
in your life the more wealth and
prosperity and friendship and health and
meaning and purpose the easier it is to
become identified with attached to and

[02:01]
become identified with attached to and
dependent on these things
and this exposes us to suffering as the
existential fact is that everything you
have been given will eventually be taken
back
all the good things in life all the
valued relationships and material
possessions and personal talents are
just on loan and the lender has the
right to demand them back of us whenever
he sees fit
the ability to cultivate goodness and
surrender It On Demand is the mark of a
spiritual Master something to Aspire to
some people shrink from attachment and
never become fully involved in life
because they understand that they will
one day have to surrender those good
things in life
other people cultivate the good things
in life but claim so desperately to
their possession that they demean
themselves and corrupt the good that
they have amassed
neither is ideal for obvious reasons
however the ability to create and
surrender to act without attachment to

[03:02]
surrender to act without attachment to
be in the world but not of the world
that is a high thing indeed
hopefully that makes sense did you
