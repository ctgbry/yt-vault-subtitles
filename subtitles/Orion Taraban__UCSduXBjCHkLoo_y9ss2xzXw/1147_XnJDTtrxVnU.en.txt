No one, man or woman, no one should
undermine the basis of their own
attraction. Like, men complain online
about their wives slowly and
systematically taking away the things
that made them attractive to begin with,
which if successful, not only makes the
men unhappy, but increases the
likelihood that the women in question
will lose interest in that relationship
as well. Not a good idea. Well, that
works both ways, guys. Don't take away
the things that attracted you to a
woman. If you're attracted to ho, then
like be honest with yourself. Don't try
to clothe your attraction in some
high-minded rationalization that you're
trying to take her away from all that.
Bro, there are plenty of women who stay
the hell away from that entire lifestyle
that could have saved you the trouble.
But you're not looking there, are you?
So be real with yourself. If you like
hoes, then own it and don't try to make
her into something she's not. People
undermine the foundation of attraction
in their own relationships at their own

in their own relationships at their own
risk.
