i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is rule out the confounds rule out the
confounds
so this is something that is extremely
useful to do
before seeking out professional help
and yet i see folks not doing this all
the time
in my clinical practice basically it
means
have you already attempted to exclude
all
other plausible contributors to your
current problem
before seeking the assistance of a
professional
it sounds simple but you'd be surprised
how often folks
don't go through this process before
engaging my services
so for example a person might come to me
complaining of high levels of anxiety or
even a history of panic attacks
and in the course of treatment it comes
out that he's drinking
six or seven units of alcohol on a
nightly basis now
if you don't know this alcohol is a
neurodepressant it inhibits
the sympathetic nervous system and in

[01:02]
the sympathetic nervous system and in
its attempts to restore homeostasis
this stimulates the sympathetic nervous
system to work more intensely
to counteract the effects of the
substance so that when the alcohol
intoxication eventually wears off the
sympathetic nervous system no longer has
an inhibitor to push against and it now
feels like it's kicked into overdrive
and in many respects
the felt experience of the elevated
sympathetic response
is functionally indistinguishable from
anxiety
and so now the question is complicated
is this person legitimately dealing with
an anxiety disorder or is he
experiencing
the withdrawal syndrome of acute alcohol
withdrawal and until the individual
makes an attempt to abstain from alcohol
for a while there's really no way to
resolve the ambiguity satisfactorily
and it's hard to create an effective
intervention or treatment plan
if the actual problem hasn't yet been
reliably identified
and this is something that a person in

[02:01]
and this is something that a person in
most cases
could have done on his own before
contracting with a therapist
as hard as it is let's try to go two
weeks without drinking and observe its
effect
on anxiety best case scenario hey
i'm not getting as anxious maybe i need
to focus on restricting my alcohol
intake
as opposed to seeking help for panic
attacks and on the other hand
if that person were to stop drinking for
two weeks only to find no
change in his anxiety levels then that
would be useful information for the
therapist he may
subsequently choose to engage to treat
the anxiety i mean
any decent therapist will conduct a drug
and alcohol history
fairly early in the course of treatment
especially if someone presents with
symptoms of an anxiety disorder or
a mood disorder in general then the
individual can say to the professional
hey
i tried this this and this didn't
actually solve the problem
what else you got this will help make
that session
way more useful effectively giving you
more bang for your buck

[03:01]
more bang for your buck
and increasing the likelihood that
you're both on the right track
so if possible rule out your confounds
before
seeking out professional help so that's
what i've got to say
