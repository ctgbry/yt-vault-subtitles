I remember in my 20s I I wasn't doing so
good in my relationships and I called up
my dad and I was complaining about it
and I was I was had fallen into
self-pity and I was like, "Dad, I just I
think maybe I'm just not lovable. I just
I don't know if it's ever going to
happen for me." I was like 23. He's
like, "Oh, Ryan, how many women have you
dated?" Like it happens every time, Dad.
Happens every Yeah, but how many times?
It happened three times. He's like, "It
happened three times." Like that's
nothing. I mean, three was a lot for me
because that was my entire relationship
history at that time. But he was
absolutely right. Three is nothing. You
can't collect samples from three
participants and run a statistical
analysis and get any kind of good power
out of that. You wouldn't get any kind
of results that you could have
confidence in, right? And that's sort of
the trap. So if you need diverse,
varied, large sampling in order to get
an accurate view of the population
you're dealing with, but at the same
time you're punished and judged for
having multitudinous diverse
relationship partners or experience.

relationship partners or experience.
Well, that seems like a double bind. So
either you have to be willing to deal
with the judgments of having a large
sample size and maybe you actually get
an accurate idea of what men or women
want or you forgo that but you run the
risk of making decisions based on your
small sample size. I don't think there's
a way around
