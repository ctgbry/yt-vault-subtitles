i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
masculinity and femininity
these are words that demand a definition
it's not very empirical but the way i
look at masculinity in femininity is
that these are attributes of the soul
and that they are related to but not
coincident with biological sex that is
maleness and femaleness
in fact both men and women males and
females have masculine and feminine
energies but before i really get into it

now what are the essential
characteristics of these two energies
well in line with several ancient social
and spiritual traditions we can describe
masculinity as penetrating dominating
creative eros which is a type of love

[01:02]
creative eros which is a type of love
and femininity as yielding submitting
receptive agape which is a different
kind of love
one is not better than the other though
they are different from each other and
the men and women have both of each
interestingly these two are not
opposites the opposite of masculinity is
not femininity and the opposite of
femininity is not masculinity if they
were they couldn't really exist in the
same person at the same time
they are more compliments than opposites
and research indicates that these
attributes are orthogonal which means
that it's possible for someone to be
high in both attributes like for example
mick jagger
and for someone to be low in both
attributes like pat in the old saturday
night live sketch
these would be examples of androgyny
now
all men have both masculine and feminine
attributes and all women have both
masculine and feminine attributes so we

[02:00]
masculine and feminine attributes so we
know that they are not completely
coincident with biological sex
however we do know that they are
correlated
on the whole the average man is more
masculine than the average woman
and the average woman is more feminine
than the average man
furthermore the most masculine men are
all more masculine than the most
masculine women and the most feminine
women are all more feminine than most
feminine men
and this is true across culture and
history so it doesn't really seem
plausible to assert that they can be
completely independent of biological sex
either
like many things that have to do with
people who are extremely complex
it's probably for the best not to reduce
them too much in either direction
as i discussed in my series on the
concept of the game
too much structure and rigidity leads to
totalitarian control
and too little leads to chaotic
dissolution
life happens in the middle ground
hopefully that makes sense

hopefully that makes sense
