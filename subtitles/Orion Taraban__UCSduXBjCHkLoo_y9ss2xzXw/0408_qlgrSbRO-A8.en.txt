I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is
psychak's Better Living Through
psychology and the topic of today's
short talk is most men are wallpaper
what does this mean it means that most
men like wallpaper are functionally
invisible both to other men and more to
the point to women and this is
interesting because it's in stark
contrast to what we typically see in
nature in nature it's the females who
are drab and camouflaged and the males
who are spectacularly arrayed and this
kind of makes sense if the females are
precious because they are the limiting
factor of reproduction for the species
it makes sense that they should be as
inconspicuous as possible there is
safety in inconspicuousness in a world
full of predation
on the other hand the male's
conspicuousness also makes sense as it
is used as a proxy for health and

[01:01]
is used as a proxy for health and
Superior genetics in the females sexual
selection the most obvious example of
this is that peacocks Cox
are the fabulous males whereas P hens
hens are cryptic by comparison however
the natural world is full of
observations that uh back up this
particular point
however in modern humans there has been
an incredible reversal in this
phenomenon in intersectional Dynamics
just look at the Oscars or any Gala
celebration the men all dress alike in
the same black and white tuxedo whereas
each woman is an individual Extravaganza
a unique spectacle of color form and
Design
in many respects the men just seem to
exist as foils to highlight the woman's
Beauty like a simple setting for a
dazzling Jewel

[02:00]
dazzling Jewel
how did this happen
you know I'm not really sure but I'm
here to tell you that continuing in this
vein of inconspicuousness is very very
dangerous for men
listen closely
the biggest risk a man can take in his
life is not taking a risk
if a man does not take a risk the world
passes him by and that will be the end
of him if a man has not put himself out
there no one is going to come by to make
sure he's okay
no one is going to give him money no one
is going to give him sex or love he will
get nothing from no one gentlemen you
have to risk it for the biscuit
and this is just not the case with women
is this equal no is this Fair no is that
the way it is yeah
work with it and if possible make it
work for you take a risk and one way to
do that is to stand out from your

[03:01]
do that is to stand out from your
immediate environment I was having a
talk with Logan Yuri recently and she
told me that she often receives the same
complaint from women she's advising in a
dating context in the Bay Area namely
that all the men are the same
which in the Bay Area apparently means
that they all work in Tech and do rock
climbing as a hobby
now in a different city or a different
part of the world a man who worked in
Tech and did rock climbing as a hobby
would be an interesting anomaly in San
Francisco however it's apparently par
for the course so in San Francisco
working in Tech and doing rock climbing
as a hobby
is wallpaper wallpaper is not inherent
it is contingent upon your immediate
environment and your immediate
competition if you are functionally
indistinguishable from your immediate
environment and your immediate
competition then you lose the game of
mating and dating men have to stand out
this means that you have to create a
contrast between yourself and your

[04:01]
contrast between yourself and your
immediate environment and competition in
order to even be visually recognizable
as an individual Man without this you
are simply field not focused and the
world will pass you by
now before I go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this episode to someone
who might benefit from its message it's
Word of Mouth referrals like this that
really help to make the channel grow and
you can also hit the super thanks button
which is those three little dots in the
lower right hand corner beneath the
video and tip me in proportion to the
value you feel you derive from this
episode I really do appreciate your
support
so how does a man do this how does he
separate himself from his field what I'd
like you to consider is that the way men
present themselves especially with
respect to how they dress is like
branding
it helps to think of dating in a sense
like marketing you want to create a

[05:02]
like marketing you want to create a
brand to give a certain impression to
your potential customers which should
motivate them to look more carefully at
what you have to offer you might have
the best product or service in the world
however if you cannot capture attention
through marketing you might not survive
as a business and just like marketing
it's all right for The Branding to let's
say be a selective or exaggerated
version of what you potentially have on
offer it shouldn't be completely
disjointed from what's on the menu and
as that will simply create problems
further down the sales funnel but it
certainly doesn't have to be isomorphic
with the menu
now what does this mean in practice
basically a woman should be able to look
at you at your branding and Come Away
with a decent idea of what might be in
store for her on a date and just like
branding amazingly enough this can be

[06:01]
branding amazingly enough this can be
accomplished through careful attention
to your appearance
I'm going to walk you through what that
might look like using an example from an
unlikely place so
I've never played this game personally I
don't even remember how I learned about
this game but there is a text based
dating simulator out there called dream
daddy
in which you play the teenage daughter
of a gay man who is trying to match her
father up with another dream daddy I've
put a link to the image I'm going to
discuss in the pinned comment below I'd
like you to click on it so you can
follow along it's one of the best ways I
know to explain to men this idea of
dating as marketing this is going to be
fun again I've never played this game so
I have no idea if what I'm about to say
is accurate to the world of the game but
that's not actually relevant to our
intents and purposes here
did you click on the link

[07:00]
did you click on the link
okay you can see that there are seven
dream daddies and they all have a very
specific look to them don't they from
just a sliver of their appearances we
can make some plausible guesses as to
what might be in store for us if we were
to date that particular daddy let's
begin on the left and work our way to
the right now this first guy oh he's
obviously bad boy daddy we'd probably
meet him at a dive bar play some pool
and drive off on the back of his
motorcycle without wearing a helmet so
dangerous next up is Vamp daddy he's a
sensual romantic into Fine Wines
classical Beauty I'm imagining a
Sumptuous dinner stargazing and foreplay
by the fire
in the third spot is Professor daddy if
you're a sapiosexual he's your man he
likes to have intellectual conversations
and he'll probably invite you to soires
on campus where you can match wits with
the Literati
coming in at number four is Country Club

[08:00]
coming in at number four is Country Club
daddy he's obviously Rich probably from
old money he likes Polo and yachting and
Tennis he knows all the right people and
vacations somewhere fabulous next up is
Fitness daddy you'll likely hit the gym
with him do a yoga class make some
protein smoothies and give each other
massages you know to loosen up the
fascia
next up is creative daddy he's maybe a
musician or a designer or a photographer
he's too school for cool and he knows
all the best live music venues and
underground bars
finally you have big bear daddy he's
just down to have a good time maybe a
barbecue next to his backyard pool
nothing pretentious crispy canned beers
low-key fun and good vibes
okay so does this actually happen in the
game I have no clue but that's
not really the point the point is that
we can extrapolate a reasonable fantasy
of what we have in store by associating

[09:01]
of what we have in store by associating
from these appearances they all make a
statement none of them are wallpaper we
can even consider these seven to be male
dating archetypes they communicate an
emotionally compelling idea which means
they are marketable
they are there are definitely others
than these seven but this is a good
place to start
now man I want you to look at yourselves
if we dropped you in an unfamiliar place
and people could only see what you
looked like
could they get a plausible sense of who
you are and what you're about
if not then your wallpaper
spending just a little time and money on
differentiating yourself is time and
money well spent
women are really sensitive to these
kinds of things having a Vibe and a
coherent look to your appearance will
differentiate you from your immediate
environment and competition
it's a risk to stand out but it might be
more of a risk not to

[10:01]
more of a risk not to
