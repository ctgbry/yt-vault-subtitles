Knowing yourself and what you're into
and what you're interested in is a
prerequisite to attracting the opposite
sex.
&gt;&gt; I think it's really powerful especially
for men because this is the second part
of the two women problem that I was
describing earlier. The first part is
people assume that the boss just
want to be dominant in the bedroom and
as we've been discussing that's not
always or even often the case. Uh the
second side of it is a lot of men look
at women like the average woman and they
just think that she has very vanilla
desires and they think that all she
wants to do is be in a committed
relationship. Women just want
commitment. They want to get married.
They want to have a family. They're not
into any kind of that crazy. She's a
good girl. Especially if you like the
woman for that type of relationship.
It's part of the Madonna thing. You
don't want her to be a You want
her to be a good girl, a nice girl. And
so she, oh, she's not into that kind of
stuff or she would never be go into
that. It's like, that's not true. Women
can have all kinds of perverse desires.
And they do have all kinds of perverse
desires. This is the the flip side of it
is that women are generally more open

is that women are generally more open
and interested in sexual exploration
than most men give them credit for. But
that takes a certain level of boldness
to be able to suggest that or to move
the woman in that direction in an actual
sexual encounter.
