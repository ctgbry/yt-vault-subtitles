hello this is Orion taraban and this is
cycax Better Living Through psychology
and I'm very excited to have on the
podcast today Mr Ken Curry Ken has been
a personal friend of mine for several
years he is like me a therapist who
specializes in men's mental health he's
based out of the state of Colorado
and uh we got in touch with each other
several years ago when
I was trying to build a directory of
therapists who specialized in men's
mental health and because there are few
and far between I don't know if there's
anyone else in the state of California
that I'm personally aware of who does
what we do and I was interested in
finding a professional Network because I
was getting interest from men all over
the country who wanted to work with me
but unfortunately due to licensing
restrictions I couldn't do Psychotherapy
with people who lived outside of the
state so I was trying to find other
folks that I could refer these
interested men to as well as just build

[01:01]
interested men to as well as just build
a professional Network
um
you know just to swap stories and and
professional and personal support and
and Ken's been great with respect to
that he's he's been a good friend
and I'm very happy to have you on the
podcast today Ken thanks for being here
thank you Orion much appreciated thanks
for the invitation for sure of course
well um I think it might be since I
began the conversation by talking about
our work in the context of men's mental
health I think you have a is it right to
call a program it's called the solid man
and you've written a number of books and
you you guide men through it like a
process is that is that what to say yeah
that's it about this sure sure let me
say a couple things about
um my let's see my license in Colorado
is lmft licensed marriage and family
therapist and I really took that and
started working with men years ago that

[02:00]
started working with men years ago that
became something that was a passion of
mine mostly because of my own internal
work and the things that I was working
on for myself and so as I started to
develop my groups for men I started to
develop a curriculum to help guys walk
through life and really building
um a really solid sense of self of
identity the strength confidence really
helping men to have a much more
significant presence in their life and
so that was some what I started building
was the my curriculum to develop and
help men to become
um I call it I Empower men and some
people don't like the idea of empowering
men but that's what I do and so the
solid man process definitely is designed
to help men move from point A to point B
from a point where I'm not really strong
I don't really know who I am
I don't really have a lot of confidence
I might be embroiled in a number of
different
um addictions maybe porn alcohol other

[03:01]
um addictions maybe porn alcohol other
things that guys just get stuck in and
so really helping men kind of build a
life that is strong and really building
their relationships so so that's what
I've developed and let's see I have my
website is called solidman.com and
um and yeah you're right I have a few
books
um a little bit later in the episode but
okay what I heard right now is that you
your system sort of evolved organically
over the years of working with hundreds
or thousands of guys and you kind of
codified it into
um a system to guide people from feeling
lost or unsure of themselves to having a
strong sense of self-purpose and
confidence is that a good summary there
yeah that's a great summary yep and
you've been doing this for a while
yeah I'm over a decade about 15 years
all right now that's interesting have
you noticed that the presentation of the

[04:01]
you noticed that the presentation of the
men that you've worked with has changed
over that time and if so what do you
think might be some of the
the the most
prevalent issues facing men today
that's a okay that's a really good
question so the um let's see one of the
most profound uh guys that I've been
working with is Dr Robert Glover and his
No More Mr Nice Guy work and so he
really outlines what I think is a really
significant part of the problem and that
is the whole idea of a man being nice
and so it's really interesting his book
is like 20 years old and it's only
getting more steam so it's like you you
see the the problem of men being nice
guys
um and it feels like that it's been
something that's been culturally
programmed into men to be more
submissive to be more
um wanting to make their women happy you
know the whole happy wife happy life
thing that that's kind of been the thing
that has been told men if you do these

[05:02]
that has been told men if you do these
things and
um then life is going to be good for you
it's going to work and the problem is
that most guys have been finding out
that that is not the case it is like the
opposite
um where it's like it creates more
problems than they could ever imagine
being this nice submissive man and and
making other people happy being a
pleaser or an appeaser living for
approval that type of thing
and so that's been what I've been seeing
as a really significant problem
um for me I kind of take Glover's stuff
a little bit further and I Define it as
the problem is is the externally
referenced life that a man living in uh
externally where I live to please I want
people to be happy with me I live to
what everybody's else's expectations are
and when I live like that I'm living
always thinking about what does
everybody else think what does everybody
else want and and I'm living to make

[06:02]
else want and and I'm living to make
those things happen and to get the
validation that I need instead of what I
think is where I take guys is building
an internally referenced life where I'm
I'm living to please myself I'm living
to make me happy which initially for
most guys sounds really horribly selfish
and it's a really tough thing to get
over to be able to think about you know
oh my gosh that's selfish I'm living to
please myself because it's the opposite
of what I've been conditioned to do to
make everybody else happy and so that's
been a really really big shift I help
guys to make that shift and when you
become more internally referenced you're
finding out who you really are find out
what's valuable to you what are your
values where does your value and
self-worth actually come from as an
individual as a person and really being
able to identify what are my internal
resources telling me about how to move
through life and those internal
resources like my body my intuition my

[07:03]
resources like my body my intuition my
mind the things I see as as wise what's
important to me what are my values my
emotions which really tell you what I
want and need in life and all the stuff
inside of me guiding me and it actually
creates a really really significant life
when you start to live from an internal
Place rather than external does that all
make sense yeah there's a lot there so I
I read Glover's book a while ago and I
think that's an excellent text for a lot
of guys to read Because from my
experience it put something that I was
sort of dimly or partially aware of into
a very concrete and explicit you know
framework that was easy to understand it
just sort of sharpened a lot of things I
kind of knew into a Starker Focus yeah
um so I could see them better and I
think that the nice guy syndrome as I
understand it is summarized by like the

[08:00]
understand it is summarized by like the
Cobra contract which says that I can
earn love and respect sex and
relationship but I do it indirectly by
performing acts of service that may not
even be wanted or required right in the
hopes that I could potentially further
down the road get what I want
um or indirectly
and uh yeah I think that it's important
for guys to be able to be selfish to say
this is who I am and this is what I want
in the beginning it is extremely
difficult for them to do that and I do
think that in the beginning that
selfishness can take a more
let's say childish or hedonistic tone
where it's like you know I feel like
having a steak I'm just gonna have a
steak where I feel like playing video
games I'm just gonna do it I I'm it's
almost like a regression back to the
last time when they were assertive about
their wants which is generally children
generally or children are very assertive
about what they want and what they don't
want but what I found is that most

[09:00]
want but what I found is that most
people can't stay at that level for very
long like if there's only so many beers
you can drink there's only so many video
games that you can play and then you you
start to think well selfishly I want to
do something more meaningful or I want
to challenge myself and I think in the
process of that you create greater value
for yourself and and your life and then
you get to a point where well selfishly
I want to share this with other people
because my joy will be increased if I
can share my goodness with other people
and then invite people into your life
who want to be there as opposed to
trying to drag them in you can kind of
just who I am this is what I what I'm
all about would you like to join me and
then you can be surrounded by women and
friends and colleagues and things like
that and but that's still kind of with
on some level from a place of
selfishness it's that I've decided that
out of
for my own pleasure I am going to give
as opposed to I'm giving from
in the hopes that I can barter for

[10:00]
in the hopes that I can barter for
something that I don't yet have does
that make sense no you see in the border
that you don't yet have that would be
the covert contract exactly yeah yeah I
don't yet have that sense of
love or respect in my life so I'm going
to trade it for money attention service
but I feel like I have abundance in my
life I don't really have to trade
abundance for more abundance you know I
can I can just right give it because
it's my pleasure to do so
okay I think the um the initial thing
you're talking about the childish
um selfishness really I think initially
it comes out where you're now testing
your ability to say what do I want
because most guys because they've been
so externally referenced they don't know
what they want they have never exercised
that muscle what do I really want and
that's what it comes down to what do I
really want because initially they might
pursue some things okay now I have
permission to pursue what I want and
they're pursuing things that aren't

[11:01]
they're pursuing things that aren't
necessarily the most healthiest things
and so I'll get i'll I want to play
video games or I want to do this you
know and you start exercising it but
you're pursuing things that aren't
necessarily the the like I said the
healthiest things they might be
counterfeits sure what what really is
going to bring that that level of
purpose or fulfillment
go ahead no go ahead well the way that I
think about that is that we're always in
a process of becoming we don't ever
really know who we are right now we know
who we have been in the past and unless
we check in with ourselves on a regular
basis the gap between who we are now and
who we
think we are it might be years or even
decades and if somebody has spent his
most of his adult life
um chasing external validation the last
time he might have been sure of what he
wanted was childhood and so he's running
like an outdated OS and he goes back to

[12:03]
like an outdated OS and he goes back to
the sources of pleasure and satisfaction
when he was last most certain of them
um and what's interesting is they
probably don't provide the joint
satisfaction they once did and then the
man can sometimes feel like he's
depressed that he's lost that even the
things that once provided him Joy no
longer do so but that could be
appropriate the things that bring us joy
and satisfaction when we're 12 shouldn't
be the things that bring us joy and
satisfaction when we're
22 let alone 42. so sometimes if it's
been a while because of the busyness of
life or because of one's attitudes
towards others I think it's important to
enter into a period of like open-minded
experimentation where you go out into
the life go out into life and say well I
actually don't know what I like I
actually don't know what I want
let's try things
and not have any contempt prior to
investigation so that I can see how
these different experiences actually

[13:01]
these different experiences actually
feel for me how they resonate and I can
learn from that emotional response who I
am now what I like now what I want now a
lot of the guys that I work with when we
start working they don't know what they
want
but generally people know what they
don't want it's it's generally easier to
know what you don't want so if you don't
yet know what you want
um listeners it's sometimes better to
start with what you don't and walk in
the opposite direction for a while
um because I I definitely like what
you're saying Orion you're bringing up
the to two big questions and in Family
Therapy it's the uh differentiation
questions and differentiation being the
fancy word for being able to be my own
self in my own life or in a relationship
where I don't lose my sense of self or
I'm not on my my person is not absorbed
or lost in the relationship and that's
the differentiation and the those the
questions are who am I what do I want

[14:01]
questions are who am I what do I want
and most guys they don't know the answer
to those two questions like we're saying
and so being able to ask who am I and
what do I want like you said it's a
journey I'm gonna find out who I am what
I want and that puts me in a position
once I start even asking those questions
where I can like be I can start to
actually become myself finally in my own
life because I've I have allowed myself
to be a absorbed or lost in the
relationship and that is a really
powerful thing just to be able to start
asking those two questions and because
the who am I questioned the identity
question who am I what's my character
what's my value what's my worth most
people are just drenched in shame shame
being that thing says something's wrong
with me or I'm defective I'm not good
enough and when you start to develop
that where I am okay I'm not perfect but
I'm okay
then I can start to trust what's going

[15:01]
then I can start to trust what's going
on inside of me and trust my um the
things that I want and I love what
you're saying because it is a process of
learning what is it that I really want
and as I started you kind of pro you
kind of outlined that where finally I'm
starting to I want people in my life to
thrive I want my family to be loved I
want you know those things are things
that I want that are incredible for
everybody who's involved and that that's
what I find with most guys you know we
we hear all the toxic masculinity stuff
and everything that that if a man was
empowered he would be oppressive and
that narrative is just so wrong and so
off base because every guy I run into
when they start to actually be
themselves and live according to what
they want they're actually wanting
everybody else in their life their
family their wives their girlfriends
their friends everybody to thrive I want
everybody to be doing well

[16:00]
everybody to be doing well
I think that's very common and maybe
what we can uh postulate here is that
the the more like say elevated the self
the more that
selfishness includes the well-being of
those around him that kind of makes
sense it's like if I were living with a
woman I would want her
um to be doing really well because I
would have to be in her space a lot of
the time so even if it was just out of a
selfish desire for peace and Harmony I
would want her to be thriving
and the more
abundant and the more secure I am in my
sense of self the more that
I can see that I'm
part of an expanding web of
relationships that stretch out into my
family into my co-workers into my
community and potentially even to
humanity as a whole and selfishly I mean

[17:02]
humanity as a whole and selfishly I mean
no man is an island right so the highest
the highest Perfection of self requires
the elevation of actually the rest of
humanity in order
um
perfected and sustained so I think
that's the that's like selfishness
at its highest level and not everybody
is there yet and that's totally fine
maybe we're all stumbling in that
direction no but it's so interesting
it's so interesting that everybody
pretty much across the board when they
hear the word selfish it's like it's
it's a totally negative connotation I
can't be selfish so I kind of I'll joke
and use the word self-ness okay if
selfish isn't right yes let's go
self-ness you know but the but it's the
the idea that what you're talking about
is there is something about a a noble
aspect of selfishness and that that
sounds unheard of that's not something
people talk about I I I'm a big fan of

[18:02]
people talk about I I I'm a big fan of
selfishness especially in relationships
one of the things I counsel men to do is
is to find someone with compatible
selfishnesses because the alternative is
like a lifetime of compromise which is
often two people not getting what they
want and often keeping score of
like goods for went or debts incurred
so it's like if I'm the kind of guy who
needs a lot of space for my own kind of
peace of mind or well-being then it kind
of makes sense for me to find somebody
who also needs somebody who is more
independent because that selfishly works
for her and so we have compatible
selfishnesses you see I do and the other
category that I that I that I enjoy
selfishness or coach guys to engage in
selfishness is the category that I said
earlier that usually

[19:00]
earlier that usually
um most men and this isn't men women do
it as well the whole idea of losing
myself being absorbed into the
relationship and and having a sense of
self and selfishness actually is me
being me in the relationship it feels
like the most absurd statement that I
have is when I when I ask guys I tell
guys you need to be you in your own in
your own life and it's like
um because they have haven't been
themselves in their own life I am
somebody who I'm supposed to be or I'm
playing a role that other people want
you to be rather than being myself or
who I am at my core and moving forward
into my life with my own identity when
with what I want and need in my life
so yeah well we talked what was the word
you used from family therapy it was
differentiation differentiation okay so
this is something that seems to be a
pretty ubiquitous issue especially in
long-term relationships or marriage it

[20:01]
long-term relationships or marriage it
used to be that a man's house was his
castle now at best it seems like he has
a man cave or a garage and the house has
been sort of taken over by the women uh
the decorations are all what the women
uh decide throw pillows everywhere sure
and we've heard the phrase like
betatization by 10 000 concessions uh it
didn't seem to be this way you know two
generations ago I wasn't there but it
doesn't seem that way from looking at my
grandparents lives and the media from
that time men would just say up I'm
going out for war or I'm a traveling
salesman I'll be back in six months
um
they certainly
didn't seem to feel like they were the
doilies everywhere
um in the house what what's going on
like is it because I also made this
video recently about how feminine love
is different from masculine love and and
kind of a a woman in love it's more

[21:02]
kind of a a woman in love it's more
consumptive like if it if it could it
would want all of your love and all of
your attention and know all of your
thoughts and and how do you
um how do you have that differentiation
over 40 years when there's this like
maybe a relentless
Force like a tide that's just sort of
slowly
always kind of wanting a little bit more
do you understand what I'm saying yeah I
do I do you use the word consumptive
I'll use the word absorptive that it's
absorption
um that's the the concept that I use
it's the same exact thing where where
I'm being consumed I'm being absorbed
into her world
and the whole thing of the the house
being
um it's so interesting that you're
saying this Orion because I you know
that I recently done have done a massive
my front room kitchen area remodel right
and so the whole thing of how how we've
gone through the process of being able

[22:01]
gone through the process of being able
to pick and choose what we're doing and
and all this and how how some things
I've had a voice some things I've been
like nah you just choose what you what
you want
um and so it's been but I I'm really
really happy with our front room and our
kitchen area and everything I'm way
happy with how it is because it's mine
because mostly I built it I didn't build
the cabinets but I put them in and put
the flooring in it did all the did
everything
um not everything almost pretty much at
all but the whole thing of what you're
talking about more than
the decorations is do I lose myself and
in a way and we uh you know a lot of the
conversation is the whole idea of the
eye of frame my frame as a man and when
I walk into my house do I lose my frame
do I turn into a little submissive boy
and mom can tell me everything about
what's going on in the house and there's
a lot of guys that have that as a

[23:01]
a lot of guys that have that as a
component that at work they have framed
they they've hire and fire and they
build things and they do things but when
they get home they have a completely
different posture that's certainly true
some guys can be very submissive
relative to their women in in the most
of the relationships that I personally
see the woman is the more powerful party
in the relationship
um but I also see I mean what do you
think about the idea of more egalitarian
relationships can a man maintain frame
within that kind of belief structure or
is that sort of a slippery slope down
towards concessions help me um tell me
what you believe the egalitarian to be
sure I think that the egalitarian model
of relationships is that we're partners
and we're go we're making like we have
equal decision making power we share the
child care we share the chores we split
the bills and
um no one person is the boss of the

[24:01]
um no one person is the boss of the
other person no one person has more
power than the other
and is it possible to maintain frame in
that situation that's a great question
um I'm just thinking about the the
my answer I'm gosh this is really hard
because I don't have a problem with each
person having a lot of power in the
relationship
um I think being a power couple is
actually what you want to seek where
both people are really significantly
strong individuals where they're
standing on their own two feet where
they're they're developing their own
purposes where they're creating a
relationship where everybody in the
relationship is empowered
um the whole idea of power couple is
something that my wife and I have been
seeking and and so
um so being able to make sure
everybody's powerful but that doesn't
necessarily fit the egalitarian model
because when it comes down to it

[25:01]
because when it comes down to it
um
gosh this is this is really hard for me
because I don't know why it's really
tough for me right now even talking
about it because it's like what I have
going on I have a really strong frame I
know who I am I know what I want and I
have a really strong presence in my
relationship but that strong presence
that I've had in the relationship has
also empowered my wife to be really
strong as well and for her to be able to
develop her career she's developed since
the kids have been out of the house
since we're empty nests she has created
a really really significant career it's
been awesome to see and so I that but
when it comes to your question I'm
trying to think of what is it that that
you're asking okay let me try again yeah
I think you brought up an interesting
point which is that power isn't
necessarily a zero-sum game it's not you
just because one person is more powerful

[26:00]
just because one person is more powerful
doesn't mean the other person is
necessarily weakened and that both a man
and a woman in a relationship can be
powerful
in that relationship
the egalitarian model is
um I think based on
it's not how do I put it how do I
experience it there can I can I jump in
Orion because I think when you said Zero
Sum I think that's the that's the game
because the zero sum is is that one
let's see plus one minus one equals zero
and so what it is is the plus one is the
person with the power the minus one is a
person without the power and it's the
Zero Sum right and so I think that's the
game that most egalitarians play the
whole idea of one person has the power
the other doesn't even though you've
said the whole thing of you know we're
both equal in this but I think when it
really comes down to it most people in
that world play a zero-sum power game or

[27:02]
that world play a zero-sum power game or
they're it's like they're all fighting
for fifty percent and am I going to get
51 or am I at 49 and what I'm describing
is what I call Abundant power where it's
not a zero sum there's not fifty percent
that you're fighting over there's
massive amounts of power that everybody
has at their disposal and so as a man I
am a powerful man and that's why I want
to empower men but it's not to have
power over anybody it's I want my power
for I want Power like I was saying I've
empowered my wife my power as a man has
empowered her to become the strongest
person that she can become and her
becoming powerful doesn't diminish my
power at all as a matter of fact it
empowers me even more to be able to do
this so both of our the power couple
there's no Zero Sum it's like we're both
becoming more powerful and more powerful
as the years go by
does that all make sense yeah I think so

[28:01]
does that all make sense yeah I think so
I I do think that a lot of the
Tendencies towards egalitarianism in
relationships grow out of a discomfort
with power and the idea here is that if
it's perfectly matched 50 50 we can sort
of eliminate the influence of power in
our relationships because the idea of
power and
uh makes me uncomfortable so I'd rather
balance it out so that we can pretend
that it doesn't exist
but as we've just been describing I
don't we it sounds like we agree that
power isn't necessarily a zero-sum game
another dimension of the egalitarian
relationships that I see is like the
need to discuss everything it's like
um there is there's less of a no we're
gonna we're gonna put this flooring in
on the kitchen or even I'm gonna take
Tuesday off to go fishing it's more like
what do you let's talk about the floors
let's talk about the Tuesday night what
are we gonna do for dinner and it's
always arriving at a consensus

[29:01]
always arriving at a consensus
I think that's a also another feature of
a lot of egalitarian models is that we
we do everything together and we make
decisions jointly in as many different
domains as possible
and is that like a seating of frame to
behave in that way
such a great question so I think the
category of like you were saying I'm
going to go fishing on Tuesday I'm not
going to ask permission but since I'm in
a relationship I might ask you know does
that does that uh did we have anything
else planned on Tuesday you know or was
there something else I might ask is
there something going on because there's
three entities here that we're talking
about there's me my wife and the
relationship the marriage it's a it's an
entity we've created something a being
that actually exists and it's something
that we take care of and that we grow
and that we develop and so so some
things are all about me I'm gonna go
fishing on Tuesday some things are all

[30:01]
fishing on Tuesday some things are all
about her she's gonna go do this and
that and do whatever she needs to do but
then there are a significant amount of
things that we do as a couple and and
that when you when you you're kind of
bringing up the whole idea of conceding
and the answer is yes there are some
times when I would concede what I want
or when I want it to be able to do
something as a couple
um
I don't know if that's answering your
question
I think I think so I think you're saying
that yeah sometimes it's
uh well to enter into that
Mutual deliberation is a seating a frame
but what's more it sounds like you're
saying that sometimes that is
appropriate to do yeah it is so so the
seeding of frame would be or let's say
making a personal sacrifice
I'm making a personal sacrifice to not
go fishing on Tuesday because we had
something else planned or there were
there was

[31:00]
there was
um who knows what else I have nothing's
coming to mind of what if it's not
something else planned but she just
doesn't want you to go she thought maybe
you know she's going to be sad being all
alone or that she'd rather just cuddle
on the couch with you
oh well that that I would not submit to
because she'll get enough cuddling and
the thing is most most people most women
understand if they have that thing where
they feel like oh my gosh he's not
spending time with me most women will
will they'll say if my husband goes out
and spends a day fishing he comes back a
much more energized loving individual
he's coming back more
um yeah energized or or his tank is now
full because if he stayed home and just
watched some chick flick or The Bachelor
on TV while he's snuggling on the couch
he's losing his soul his soul is
shriveling and just dying but if he's
out fishing or doing something he loves

[32:00]
out fishing or doing something he loves
to do he's going to come back a much
more energetic man and that's what she
wants I want you to be present with me
and so that's not something you can
concede and so to be present
women might need to appreciate that men
need to be absent for a while absolutely
man this is the you know Esther perel's
thing that's the she's saying in order
for passion to happen you need space the
whole she uses the the fire triangle
illustration the if you smother all the
boards together and try to build build a
fire there's no fire
but if you put it a TP and it has space
in it and has all the space for the air
to flow through it grows a beautiful
fire and so it's primarily the man's
responsibility to maintain that space in
the relationship especially in light of
what we are describing as women's
tendency towards absorptive or
consumptive love
I think so

[33:00]
I think so
um it all depends
um my wife does a great job with with
her own time with me being off because
we have really good times when we're
together but the thing is I think to the
point that we're making because we have
a significant amount of space where
we're doing our own thing that that we
have
um
that the times when we are together are
really quality times and so I think the
but you're kind of talking about that
um potentially the woman's gatekeeper or
the relationship the man's kind of the
gatekeeper of the space or something
like that maybe
it's it's always fallen to me to
maintain that space and what it seems to
me is that the longer I'm in a
relationship the more the woman wants to
get closer and closer and and decrease
the intervals in that absence and to
um you know join more and more together
and that's the tendency in the woman and

[34:02]
and that's the tendency in the woman and
I have to kind of consciously and
intentionally put the brakes on create
some space and distance I'm a huge fan
of less frequent but higher quality
interactions and I had that conversation
recently
um I think that is
preferable for me to have that kind of
low quality constant togetherness that
isn't that's just sort of like
existing in the same room a long time
ago I cohabitated with a woman and after
six months I felt like I was Furniture
to her like she would just walk right
past me without looking at me and she'd
be sitting next to me on her phone
and I just felt schmuckey in that
situation to be honest so I prefer
when I'm with somebody to give them my
full undivided attention I kind of
expect that from them as well
and if we can't do that for whatever
reason because we're not interested or
we're preoccupied or we're busy to just

[35:02]
we're preoccupied or we're busy to just
table that until such times when that is
possible
um but the the pushback from that is
generally like well I kind of like the
coziness I like being around even if
we're not interacting even if it's not
that level of relating I still like to
be around I still like to be with you
I've seen that more from the women in my
life
does that make sense Ken it does it
totally makes sense
um it
I'm just not sure there there may be
reasons why that is I'm not sure exactly
why
um but the kind of one of the concepts
that I that I
um that I think is really at play here
um we hear a ton about attachment theory
Sure and attachment Theory I think has
really come from a more of a feminine
side of therapy where it comes from
mothers and their children literally
much right that's that's the research
that's the it's based on right right and

[36:00]
that's the it's based on right right and
so what we're talking about and I think
we could probably go forward with
writing a whole book and a whole nother
Theory and from a masculine side of it
is Detachment Theory
right but that's what we're talking
about Orion how do I walk through life
as a as a man who stands on his own two
feet this is something that I've said
from the beginning of our conversation
the whole idea of being an empowered man
who knows who he is and knows what he
wants
and I'm standing on my own two feet I
don't need you in my life now see the
whole thing of the the you complete me
BS and chick flicks and all that it's
all romantic and everything and it
sounds good but it's ridiculous
relationship Concepts where if I need
you in my life to complete me and make
me feel better about myself then the
relationship is going to falter horribly
and so the whole thing of if I am
detached from you and I am a whole and
complete human being where I'm okay by

[37:00]
complete human being where I'm okay by
myself the whole differential
differentiation piece I'm okay by myself
I don't need you now I can actually say
I want you in my life and I invite you
into my life not as something to fill
the void in my Identity or make me feel
whole and complete but I'm inviting you
you in my life as somebody who is a
compliment to my life or somebody who is
a partner in my life
but I'm not inviting you in to resolve
my internal conflicts oh certainly I
love the Detachment Theory idea because
I'm thinking about all the philosophies
throughout my life that have really
resonated with me like um Mystic
Christianity to be in the world but not
of the world or Buddhism the path of
renunciation or stoicism where you're
practicing a difference towards
externals and it seems like that from
many different sources of wisdom
is the path that has been prescribed for
human beings to walk in order to achieve

[38:00]
human beings to walk in order to achieve
Liberation from suffering and to arrive
at the highest forms of existence on
this planet
is Detachment not attachment but
Detachment isn't that interesting it's
very fascinating I don't think I've made
that connection I love Detachment Theory
hopefully you can elaborate that
well think about think about it with
relationship so if I back to the
absorbed consumptive if I allow myself
to be absorbed into the relationship and
trust me this is what most men do who
have a really problem with a strong
problem with relationship I'm absorbing
myself I'm allowing myself to be lost in
the relationship because you are the one
that's going to make me feel better
you're going to give me that external
validation so I'm going to lose my
identity lose my wants and needs and I'm
going to pursue you to be able to Grant
on me or confer on to me my value and
worth that's what's called a reflected
sense of self and so that's what we
usually do that is a really I mean
that's that's a really unhealthy

[39:00]
that's that's a really unhealthy
attachment but it's seeking the
attachment for being able to resolve
like I said my internal conflicts of not
feeling good about myself or not being
feeling whole or complete and so the
whole idea of being detached and a
separate human being standing on my own
feet is actually a powerful relational
construct it's huge it's really really
big because then that allows me now to
have a really healthy relationship okay
so let's take a slightly different Tech
because I'm I'm okay this conversation
through the yeah
I can see it working in there some of my
audience so
we talked a little bit ago about
um some of the modern challenges that
you see facing men and we talked about
the nice guy syndrome and this idea to
to people please women to to forego our
own values or needs in the indirect
expectation of getting sex a
relationship

[40:01]
relationship
um I think that definitely exists what
I'm seeing more and more of in recent
years especially online is
I'm not even going to go to a
relationship
uh it's more like the black pill stuff
which is yes what's the point you've
talked a lot about bringing women in to
create this sort of relationship you
told me right before this conversation
you recently celebrated your 39th
wedding anniversary yep so I think a lot
of guys are gonna some guys are gonna
hear this and think yeah that sounds
good Ken but the risks are really high
associated with that they certainly
while there might be some benefits they
don't seem to outweigh the costs or the
liabilities of that kind of relationship
um and it just doesn't seem worth it
because I might be able to get those
things elsewhere at lower cost and for
Less risk do you have any response to
something like that I totally agree

[41:01]
something like that I totally agree
yeah
our day and age
I'm telling you like the whole thing of
like you know what 75 of divorces are
initiated by women the every single week
I am I personally am wrestling with
processing things with guys who are
going through the a really really
horrible court system that we have it is
wretched it is so distorted that I it
pisses me off every week just how
horribly men are treated in our court
system so the answer is yes it is high
risk it is horror it and yes I so here I
am I I love the idea of marriage I think
marriage I've I've given my life to it
my studies to it
um everything I I think it's an amazing
thing but I totally agree with the guys
that feel like this is a high too high
of a risk it is and a really significant
risk oh absolutely because like you said

[42:00]
risk oh absolutely because like you said
the majority of divorce initiated by
women if there's children involved they
the family the courts almost always
favor the women men can be financially
castrated oh it's horrible divorce
um oftentimes men have spent the last 20
years of their lives spending half of
their waking lives working their jobs
and the other half of their waking lives
attending to their wife and children so
any friends have long since Fallen by
the wayside if they do have any kind of
social activity it's generally through
the woman who orchestrates that so when
that falls apart the man is often left
feeling alone and isolated because he
hasn't been attending to his own
personal relationships and male
friendships and that's also what causes
really
negative outcomes for men in the wake of
divorce but we're also talking about so
that all that is true yes so but here's
here's the other thing which is

[43:01]
here's the other thing which is
the statistics look bad but you don't
get involved you don't marry a statistic
any given woman on a long enough time
frame actually has a zero or 100 chance
that it will end in a divorce it's just
like in the aggregate the population
level that we say it's like you know 55
of marriage is one in divorce or
something like that
it's it's not just the um
it's not just the risks on the
statistical level for me it's more like
I've yet to see a relationship
I've yet to see a marriage
especially looking at the man in that
marriage where I think wow I want what
he's having his life is better than my
life he gets to do things that I don't
get to do
his happiness is greater than mine and I
think that is
in conjunction with the known risks is
part of like well what's kind of what's
the point here you know what I'm saying

[44:00]
the point here you know what I'm saying
I do I do I'm just missing something and
because relationships feel very
different on the inside than looking at
them from the outside for sure so let's
yeah let's because the question you
posted was more um and what the way I
answered agreeing with you yes it's a
high risk right but think about how many
people do get married and um I think the
the the amount of marriages that end in
divorce if you don't count the second
and third and fourth divorces it's like
44 it's lower something like that that's
still pretty high it is it is it's way
high but then if you think about it then
if it's 44 that means 56 percent die or
end in death
right and so and that and one more thing
to interject here which is that just
just because
56 of first marriages done in divorce
doesn't mean that they're happy
successful thriving relationships either
so that that's really the question that
you're asking yeah right so if you do
find yourself or you do choose to be

[45:00]
find yourself or you do choose to be
married how do you do this well and that
and that's kind of goes back to our
question of the Detachment or the whole
idea of frame
and for a man to be able to build frame
frame is that idea like we're saying the
most powerful part of your frame you
think about it frame like a frame of a
house you got the foundation that's
built on the rocks that and then on top
of the foundation you got your base
plate and your your studs in the top
plate and you got your your headers and
you got your joists and you got the
whole all the wood and stuff that goes
into the house that creates a frame that
now this house is sturdy this house is
not going to fall apart this house has
structural Integrity it's not going to
break that's what you want to be able to
develop within yourself and one of the
most powerful components of that frame
in a man is my identity my sense of
self-worth my sense of value internally
that this is who I know that I am this
is where my value and worth rest within
me and it's that sense of confidence I

[46:01]
me and it's that sense of confidence I
know who I am I know what I'm capable of
and I'm able to hold that fast and firm
within me and the other parts of me my
Integrity my sense of my values my moral
compass you know the um the categories
of you know just let's see
um even creating a vision for my life
and what I have for here's where I'm
going in my life this is my frame this
is what I'm holding together and so the
thing is if I bring that into the
marriage and I have it this is actually
the thing that is very that confidence
that I know who I am and I'm not going
to move I'm not going to break I'm not
going to be shaken and fall apart
um that is the thing that's attractive
to a woman and so maintaining that
throughout your marriage is a really
significant part of being able to do
that relationship well and so that whole
idea of maintaining that frame
and not like we're saying not kind of

[47:00]
and not like we're saying not kind of
submitting to this the how many what do
you call it um a Thousand Cuts of uh by
get like giving in yeah concessions
that's what it was where I'm I concede
here and there sure we can do this or do
that that's part of being in a
relationship you know today she chooses
what you know we go to Mexican food
great tomorrow I'm gonna say we're going
to Italian or whatever that's kind of
how give and take in a relationship but
I can't I can't concede myself I can't
let myself my wants my desires my vision
um my moral compass to be allowed to
disintegrate in the relationship that's
where the relationship is lost because
if I'm lost the relationship's lost sure
um I hear that and I agree with a lot of
what you're saying Ken I'm just going to
try to summarize what I think would be
the um the argument from this portion
which is

[48:01]
which is
I I hear you can and I believe you so I
believe that it might be possible to
have a successful marriage what that
means is like creating a very strong
foundation and I like solidifying your
identity and developing some kind of
framework to invite the women into and
learning how to maintain frame and
overcome the testing that necessarily
occurs courtship and throughout the
relationship and having some sense of
game to keep the passion and interest
alive
um and being able to potentially have
the resources to provide for a family
and and and and and and and and and if
you do all of those things then you
might be able to have a successful
marriage do you and I think that the
argument would be like how about we just
do something that has a higher chance of
success that is much easier to

[49:00]
success that is much easier to
accomplish than going through these 10
things that could take decades to
develop to minimize the risk of
something that may not even work after
all because you're not in control of the
situation once you get married you you
see a lot of your power
um because you yeah and we in Iran
you're not even talking about one of the
most important parts of this and that is
vetting a really good woman exactly
because that's another thing it's like a
lot of the response that to that is like
no if you you just you chose the wrong
woman well that could be true yeah no
one gets married think they're going to
get divorced except maybe predatory
women but
um yeah it's like yeah learn how to vet
a woman learn how to it's all the above
that you're saying it's like there's so
many things and then maybe if things
don't go sideways you might be able to
have a happy relationship it's like how
about we just go straight to I want to
be happy with fewer steps
so it's like why go through all of this
trouble just to have a marriage

[50:01]
trouble just to have a marriage
do you have a response to that
well part of what I'm saying is
um this is how you would have a great
life anyway
okay I hear that I mean you cannot have
a good life if you're a single man
without frame absolutely
and so it doesn't matter what you choose
as your life having a strong sense of
self a strong a differentiated person
that doesn't absorb into all these other
things is what you want anyway so that
work is work you're gonna need to do no
matter what anyway I made a video about
this that hypergamy actually only
indirectly benefits women be and it
directly benefits men like to become a a
stronger more solid higher net worth
more successful man how does that not
benefit the man in question and it can
only indirectly benefit the woman if the
man chooses to share it with her so I'm
with you on that which is that these

[51:00]
with you on that which is that these
things that make for a successful
relationship with a woman more directly
and primarily benefit the men involved
and so maybe Orion you know the whole
idea of talking to the guys that maybe
they're mgtow guys and somebody who's
just I'm not going to get married anyway
they know that that's the case and I'm
fine with that make your choices do what
you want to do maybe more of what we're
doing is we're talking to Men Who find
themselves in a marriage that isn't
where they want them to be it's not as
happy it's not as connected you know
they're they're maybe on the verge of
divorce and that type of thing and so
being able to consider you know what
changes can I make in my life and rather
than working to say or having all the
energy I need to save my marriage to be
able to say no I need to save my soul
first I need to become the man that I
really want to be I need to get out of
the nice guy syndrome I need to become
more internally referenced and stop
being externally referenced you know

[52:01]
being externally referenced you know
doing the happy wife happy life thing
which by the way if you turn that around
it actually works the whole happy life
happy wife if a man has a happy life and
he has that frame and he's really Living
Well actually the women are really happy
with that in general I think people also
are about as happy as they choose to be
and they're saying that choose not to be
happy I'm I'm just saying though if you
flip it oh yeah I think that was clever
I I appreciate that I think it's true
it's true but then the whole thing of uh
one thing that Sean has told us is the
whole thing of if you're responsible for
her happiness you're also responsible
for her unhappiness
and that's a really tough Pitfall but
that that's just I'm using that as an
illustration that living just changing
the mode the role that you have in your
marriage that I'm not living to make her
happy I'm not living to submit to her
and to make everything work in her life
to change and shift what's going on and

[53:01]
to change and shift what's going on and
change them and moving into what we were
calling selfishness earlier where I'm
going to be who I am I'm going to build
my frame I'm gonna build those things I
talked about that our frame and see
where this goes okay so you you've
mentioned in this conversation that yes
our relationship does require some
concessions from time to time yep it
does require some sacrifices it can be
expensive
um in terms of just resources broadly
defined of yep here you are 39 years
into your marriage like
foreign
what have you gotten from Marriage that
you feel you might not have gotten any
other way even if you had done
everything to consolidate your identity
create frame for yourself pursue your
purpose but you just never entered into
that kind of relationship with a woman
what what does marriage uniquely give
you 39 years into that situation man
Iran I got to tell you I am one of I

[54:00]
Iran I got to tell you I am one of I
feel incredibly fulfilled in my life
it has been I have had a an amazing life
I have a family who loves me I have
three adult children I have two
grandsons one's on the way in in October
you know the whole um I have a wife that
just loves me I love her we are great
companions we do a lot of fun things
together we enjoy each other's company
um there's just a ton of love going
around in my life for in a number of
different ways with my kids with my um
in my marriage I just feel incredibly
fulfilled it I just feel really really
good in my life
well one of the things that I have
argued that fundamentally marriage is a
institution to raise children absolutely
and that's really where you went is that
um when I asked that question the answer
that I heard was like well it has
allowed me to be surrounded by an ex you

[55:01]
allowed me to be surrounded by an ex you
know in multi-generational family
that is loving and warm and fulfilling
supportive yes everything yeah would it
would it be possible to have that
without getting married or is married in
your mind a requisite for that
well to be able to raise kids like I
think kids need to be raised they need
Mom and Dad
so if you're going to have kids
um there are people my my daughter's
actually
um to your point the whole thing of can
I have a group of people around me just
loving and caring my daughter is not
married and um she has created a really
significant network of community around
her she's done a great job she has so
many friends and she is surrounded by a
lot of really lovely beautiful people
and
um so she's done that I think it would
be possible to have a community around
you
um but as far as family you know I don't
know it might be more difficult to

[56:02]
know it might be more difficult to
logistically to navigate the
co-parenting yeah is that kind of what
you're saying definitely with
co-parenting for sure I yeah definitely
to raise kids I think the ultimate is
Mom and Dad together for sure
that said I'm a child of divorce who is
a child of divorce himself and I often
kind of shudder when I hear men say that
they're just staying in
really unhappy relationships for the
kids
um maybe you can speak to that my my
personal and professional opinion on
this is that yes it's better to have an
intact family to raise children
but if that intact family is chaotic
dysfunctional and abusive it's better
for everyone involved to end that and
sometimes divorce can be a step in the
right direction you know what in some

[57:00]
right direction you know what in some
cases absolutely
for sure I I'm with you on that
um but it but the whole thing of um
staying together for the kids what do
you think about that staying together
for the kids if it's not abusive and
chaotic like you're saying if it's
something that we kind of have a cold
burn or whatever and you're able to get
it done
um
man I I just don't know why people don't
fight for the marriage don't fight for
the relationship and just don't don't
um you know and that's part of the whole
thing of if I'm just if I've conceded so
much that I just now have no voice and I
can't set a boundary and I can't say
what I want or I don't have a vision or
I can't lead to where I want it to go
then I'm not in the relationship well
this is interesting so why why wouldn't
somebody fight for the relationship I'm
sure there's many many reasons for that
but since we know that the vast majority
of divorces are initiated by women maybe
one of the reasons why I wouldn't fight

[58:00]
one of the reasons why I wouldn't fight
from the relationship is that I feel
that I might be able to maintain my
standard of living in my lifestyle
by separating and I wouldn't have to
deal with this person anymore maybe I'm
also hearing friends or going on social
media and I have this fear of missing
out maybe I feel like
um this is this is boring I could get
more exciting relationships elsewhere
and
um
in some kind of no skin off my back I
can walk away with a fat paycheck maybe
that's why some people wouldn't fight
for a relationship I imagine
I I don't I don't know the the direction
where we're going with this
um
I'm not sure exactly what the question
is Iran or how you want to well you're
really getting that well you said just a
few minutes ago that you didn't know why
people didn't fight for their

[59:01]
people didn't fight for their
relationships yes yes and I took that as
a non-ratorical question uh and I
suggested one reason why some people
might not fight for their relationships
okay the reasons why someone wouldn't
fight for their relationships well just
the one that I gave that they've
conceded so much that they no longer
have a voice or think that they do have
a voice and I think that to me that's
what most a lot of the guys that I that
I work with that's kind of where they're
at and so then my work is how do you
when I talk about empowering men one of
the significant things is giving a man a
voice you know and it starts with what
you want and then how do you communicate
what you want
um with your partner
and and to be able to to have that as
now this is on the front burner I'm
saying what I want and then she can say
what she wants as well but now actually
we're starting to say something we're
starting to start the conversation but
if you're sitting back and the whole
thing like you said earlier with the
covert contract I am seeking what I want
but I'm only doing it covertly with the

[1:00:00]
but I'm only doing it covertly with the
kind of a passive way of trying to get
what I want without communicating it
that's not going to get you anywhere and
that's what most guys do but starting to
say this is what I want you know this is
how I want to be treated this is where I
want the relationship to go most guys
don't even get to that spot where
they're actually talking about I don't
think women do either women just live by
these expectations if I feel you know
whatever you know the whole thing that
you know the line that women have the
the I love you but I'm not in love with
you so we're going to get a divorce it's
like yeah that's all about expectation
and the the way to be able to Define
that statement you know oxyto ghost in
you but I don't dopamine you
you know it's like I'm bonded to you I
love you but I don't have this thrill
anymore
and and it's and it's like what is the
expectation that you have this thrill
your entire marriage all the time and
that's what some TV shows and everything
portray it's kind of the mythology of

[1:01:01]
portray it's kind of the mythology of
relationship and it's like and that if
that's what you're seeking It's Gonna
Fall Apart
[Music]
um
that's a tough sell especially I think
for young people who want to do the fomo
and go out and have all of the
experiences and the feelings uh that
kind of more temperate companionate love
is
I don't think very interesting for
20-somethings
no because you know what when it really
comes down to it it's kind of boring
true true love is boring is that weird
to say that
it's peaceful it's content it doesn't
every once in a while you get the
dopamine hit but it's not constant
it's a it's kind of it's more relaxed
it's yeah
yeah Alexander said more or less the
same thing and I do think that that is a
sign of a healthy successful

[1:02:01]
sign of a healthy successful
relationship is some degree of
peacefulness and harmony
yeah
but that's a tough one because it does
feel like you have to put a part of
yourself to bed
actually I'm not sure yes maybe you do
but in um
but I think what you're doing is you're
maybe part of you is going to bed and it
might be that more immature part of you
in a more mature part of you actually
you find that the peace and content and
and Harmony actually is way more
valuable
than feeling the dopamine hit every once
in a while all constantly you might be
right I mean we're an interesting social
moment as you know the average age of
first marriage continues to creep up and
up and up right now it's around 30 in
the United States and I think a
generation ago it was probably like 25
and maybe two generations ago it was
closer to 22 means yeah right so

[1:03:03]
closer to 22 means yeah right so
um and there is this Trope of like
midlife crises
and I've thought about this phenomenon
and I think that is a result of let's
say taking on premature maturity and
potentially entering into a this type of
relationship or
social obligation too soon without any
kind of you know sowing of the Wild Oats
or development of the sense of self and
so the person gets to be middle-aged has
the first brush of mortality realizes
he's never lived for himself his entire
life and you know stereotypically has an
affair with the secretary and buys a
sports car or something like that now we
kind of have the the opposite problem
which is people are spending their
entire 20s and sometimes their entire
30s looking for themselves
um
potentially that means that when they're
finally ready to settle down they might

[1:04:00]
finally ready to settle down they might
actually be able to do so for the long
term but it comes with other problems
because of the mate selection process uh
in the reproductive Windows as well but
that's that's an interesting idea do you
feel like people kind of need to get
that out of this their system
uh before they can really settle down in
the way that you're described
that's a great question
um I don't think it's necessary it all
the the thing is it becomes a high value
you you said fomo you know am I missing
out yeah um what is it that I really
value do I value going off and doing all
these things that I can do as a single
person or do I really value I want to
build a family and I want to I want to
build a legacy and I want to build
something or the other category that I
didn't bring up you know we were talking
about how marriage or relationship
marriage in particular builds is is
designed for building a family raising
kids right
um the other thing the other two things
that I think it it is designed for is

[1:05:00]
that I think it it is designed for is
it's going to grow us up toward maturity
you cannot do relationship without
becoming more mature it's going to force
you to learn something about yourself
and to become a more mature individual
and then the third thing is all about
well-being the relationship creates more
well-being it creates more support
connectedness
um uh security things like that that's
what a relationship those that's what
relationship does but the whole idea of
the the building you up to become more
mature is something that people don't
understand that they enter into a
relationship because nobody tells us
this that it's designed to grow you up
toward maturity and so I think that's
where everybody in a relationship
whether you're kicking and screaming or
whether you actually engage in the
process you're gonna grow up you're
gonna and that's gonna happen and so but
the whole what we're talking about is is
a single person if they go all the way
to 35 and then they realize you know
what it's time they haven't they've
experienced a lot but they really
haven't grown up

[1:06:00]
haven't grown up
and and and relationship grows you up
big time and it's and it is something
gosh I don't know what what answer I'm
giving you I don't know what question
I'm answering I think you answer the
question what I heard is that
um it's not you don't believe that it's
necessary to kind of sell your Wild Oats
before I don't admit to that um
I don't know because it was back to the
whole idea of values do I value sowing
your Wild Oats I'm going if if I value
going and have sex with multiple people
is that a value is do I value going
partying until the sun comes up is that
a value is do I value you know traveling
all over the world maybe that's a value
seeing new things and meeting new people
um or like I said do I value raising a
family
as a contrary position I'm reminded of
uh a line from the data chain that I
really like which is
to make something contract you must
first allow it to expand and that has

[1:07:02]
first allow it to expand and that has
been true in my own life that it's much
easier for me to let go of certain
things and to grow when I feel like I've
exhausted them
that's just me personally
um and I've
I think that might be true for some
other people as well uh that if they
don't do the thing that they really want
to the extent that they want to do it
and they might have a regret
and it might
inappropriately Cloud their present
moment because they're they're thinking
about the life that they
weren't quite ready to give up but did
for some other reasons or Ryan could we
could we come to this conclusion that
Uncle like you and I have two totally
different trajectories in our lives
right I got married when I was 23
um had just had my 39th anniversary of
grandkids you know it's like
um and your your life's moving in a
different direction so you're kind of

[1:08:00]
different direction so you're kind of
giving the what do you call it um uh
you're saying you're kind of given
here's what I think that the benefit of
that
um lifestyle would have been or is and
and I want to be able to just respect
both and to be able to go both of those
trajectories are just fine what somebody
chooses for their life
um does that make sense oh yeah that
makes sense to me certainly one of the
things that I
uh that that might be difficult about
the institution of marriage is that it
is kind of a one-size-fits-all thing I
read a book recently
about I think
uh it was a it was a West African
society that had like 13 different legal
and social forms of marriage and I
thought that was a fascinating idea that
we can have different arrangements to
accommodate the different needs of the
pop of the community as opposed to this

[1:09:01]
pop of the community as opposed to this
is the way it has to be for everybody
and it and it either
works or
fails often spectacularly and it's
failing a lot even at 44 so
um I think that it's Different Strokes
for different folks and that we should
potentially consider keeping a more open
mind about the nature and structure of
relationships I I made an episode about
this a while back I think it's one thing
that Straits can learn from gays
and that population who have never
really had traditional models of the way
that their relationships are supposed to
look like and so they're more or less
forced to
um communicate exhaustively about the
nature and structure of the relationship
and ideally to Custom Tailor it to the
individuals in question
um and that it's really nobody else's
business what they do besides their own
yeah so okay yes and I think the way
marriages or straight relationships are

[1:10:01]
marriages or straight relationships are
like this is how they are it is this is
how it is this is and that's what I'm
saying this is the expectation of it
this is how it starts this is how you do
it you know all the the projection of
dating and engagement and marriage I
have a wedding and your wedding goes
like this and then you live happily ever
after all the expectation and it's the
someone it's how it's uh how it's
marketed and you think about how the
diamond industry is marketed you know oh
you have the diamond and you're going to
be somebody and here's where it goes and
and all this and then you get you get
have the wedding and you're the princess
and all this stuff happens and it's all
it's all the same stuff with this
expectation of this is what the marriage
is going to provide and that's the the
whole thing of the mythology I think
mythology of the marriage where this is
not what it's going to provide and and I
think you've said this in your in your
um in some of your podcasts the whole
thing of how marriage has transitioned I
mean a hundred years ago it was
predominantly for survival

[1:11:01]
predominantly for survival
it was still about survival it's about
you connect with a person you have a
family and it's about this is how we
survive this is how we make things
happen and
um I mean it was just you couldn't do it
alone you couldn't and and so it's the
and so now in 100 years is not very long
and it's not even been that it's
probably more like 50 years that it's
really shifted from that because you
think about coming out of the Korean War
the depression the World War II Korean
War it was all life was still really
rough and and so just in within 50 years
here we we find ourselves in this
abundant place where you know life is
really good and so we can afford to feel
like I want to have this in the
relationship or we don't need the other
person as much I think that across time
and across culture it's like average
number of children or birth rates are
pretty strongly correlated to like GDP
and average annual incomes and the

[1:12:02]
and average annual incomes and the
better the more prosperous the society
the lower the birth rate like period
yeah we still see cultures today that
are having uh you know on average
certainly more than two children
but their economies aren't nearly as
good so that's that's interesting maybe
we come together more out of necessity
than we would like to admit
but it's to your point of the thinking
about how would you have other
categories
of a relationship of a marriage you know
because it's not made for Survival
anymore and some marriages aren't about
raising children and some mer you know
and I just yeah I don't know that's kind
of got my head spinning and what would
that mean and everything but I think
what it would look like go ahead yeah I
don't know I don't either but just
thinking about
um at least being able to have it to
where people understand this is what
marriage is
and um because I I don't think people go
into it knowing what it really is ah so

[1:13:01]
into it knowing what it really is ah so
that you're right they just to use your
language they just understand the
mythology what it's supposed to be or
what they think it's going to be because
all they see is the weddings and the
bridal gowns and the diamond rings and
the proposals and the gender reveals and
all that stuff but we don't really have
good access to the everyday workings of
uh even us any relationship any marriage
that a lot of successful marriage and so
people don't often know what they're
getting into and maybe that's part of
the reason why there's such a high
divorce rate and I think why women are
the ones that are initiating because
they're the ones that have been taught
that this is what the marriage is and
now they're in the marriage and the
honeymoon's over and we have kids and
all of a sudden it's not as peachy as it
was once once was and it's not what
they've told me it was going to be
because it's a lot harder than I
imagined and and so then all of a sudden
I'm not happy and so therefore I'm going
to go ahead and file or whatever that
makes sense you know
and and so

[1:14:01]
and and so
um is there a way to solve that problem
okay
I wish there was a way I mean
there has to be something that can be
done uh hmm
I don't know if you can like legislate
this but maybe one possible solution is
uh
is spending more time with your
with like the older generation maybe
people who have been married for at
least 10 years if not longer
um to kind of get a more accurate
understanding of what's in store to
actually have relationships beyond your
age or generational cohort who can kind
of tell you this is what you might be in
for this is what you might have to look
forward to
no it's not what you might have to this
is what you're gonna the honeymoon will
be over because it isn't there has been

[1:15:00]
be over because it isn't there has been
a decline in um and certainly the
extended family and I think connected to
that is intergenerational friendships is
that most people's friends are within
like a couple years of them and that's
what they know
I think it's actually really useful to
have friends who are in an older
generation absolutely younger men yep
yep absolutely
that's a whole nother conversation Orion
sure yeah we've already talked for a
while so maybe we can do that another
time so um if people want to know more
about you Ken how could they get in
touch with you sure so my website is
solidman.com and so
um so Ken at solidman.com would be my
email and then uh and there's other ways
to link into uh on the email on the
website as well and you can just see a
little bit what I'm all about you can
purchase my books online on Amazon just
go to Ken Curry lmft and uh I've got
four books on there which was my
curriculum for my men's groups just

[1:16:00]
curriculum for my men's groups just
turned into books so if you want to work
through that
um that's definitely an option there and
I do have men's groups um that uh that I
that I have that are online so that
would be an option if any of you guys
are looking for men's groups uh I know
that there are men out there who are so
I I don't know if you have a lot of
space in your men's groups currently so
let's manage expectations do you have a
wait list uh yeah
um I have three groups and two groups
are full and so there's wait lists for
those and and it uh it takes a bit for
an opening to come up but if you want to
be on the wait list you can the one
group that's open is Wednesday morning
at 6 30 a.m to 8 A.M
um that's mountain time and so it's
pretty early if you're on the west coast
but
there's definitely space in the morning
group so yeah right on uh well thank you
so much for chatting with me today Ken I
think that you brought a

[1:17:00]
think that you brought a
A New Perspective to relationships and
marriage in particular that's one of the
more
reasonable critiques against my channel
is that uh as an unmarried guy what do I
have uh to be speaking about marriage in
particularly so uh I think it was a
valuable perspective Ken so thanks again
for coming on the show you're welcome it
was fun thanks to Ryan all right man
bye-bye bye
