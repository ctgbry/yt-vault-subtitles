the main reason why most marriages don't
last is because we collectively want
that relationship to be too many things
marriage is fundamentally a very humble
institution and we burden that structure
with expectations and desires that it
was never designed to support it is
simple and unpretentious it is for lack
of a better word boring and this is
especially true if people are used to
experiencing like big bright intense
emotions and Sensations a good
relationship is going to seem very
dreary and dull by comparison but that's
just because these individuals weren't
really looking with their eyes and
hearing with their ears they just kind
of looked and heard enough to give them
the confidence that what they see and
here is known and understood and
therefore that there's nothing new or
interesting about it which in turn
causes them to dismissively turn away
from it but when they start to really
look and really listen they begin to see
all this subtle variation and delightful
nuance and tasteful diversity in the
experience they once rejected
