so one of the absolute worst questions
you can ask yourself in the morning is
what do I feel like doing today and the
reason why this is a terrible question
is because if you're like most people
what you feel like doing will cause you
to gravitate towards activities that are
comfortable convenient and pleasurable
and these activities are not generally
conducive to personal growth long-term
satisfaction or meaning making which are
the real like high level uh
self-realized stuff of life so my
suggestion is to plan at least tomorrow
today you should know what you have on
the docket when you wake up in the
morning I like doing this because it's
almost like I have a personal manager or
like a tour guide who every morning
hands me the itinerary and tells me you
don't really have to make any decisions
right now you just have to show up in
this curated day that we've planned for
you and we know you very well because of
course it was you that made the
itinerary so we know that you're going
to absolutely love what we have in store
for you today try it out
