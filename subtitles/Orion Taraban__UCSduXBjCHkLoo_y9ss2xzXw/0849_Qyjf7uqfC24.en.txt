the concept of attachment style
originated in research conducted by
psychologist Mary answorth in the 197s
her most notable experiment was the
strange situation in which she observed
how infant children reacted when their
mothers left the room after attending to
them for a while and how the children
reacted when the mothers returned a few
minutes later what answorth discovered
was that the children in her study could
be reliably sorted into three different
categories which she called secure
insecure ambivalent resistant and
insecure avoidant now there has been a
lot of research on attachment in the 50
years since ainsworth's strange
situation and the evidence based for
this framework is pretty robust like
attachment styles are real however since
this framework entered the general
Consciousness through popular psychology
about a decade ago its validity has been
weakened through misapplication and
overgeneralization and in my opinion

overgeneralization and in my opinion
this occurs when folks consider
attachment style to be a kind of Destiny
rigid inflexible unchanging that if
you're insecurely attached you'll always
be insecurely attached and there's
really nothing you can do about it and I
don't believe that that's true
