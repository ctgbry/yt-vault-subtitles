i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the concept of love food
love food is a term that i coined to
represent something that is really
important to the emotional health of
human beings and is absolutely essential
to the emotional health of children so
what is it
broadly defined love food is being held
emotionally by another person and in the
context of children it's being held
emotionally by a parent
this could mean attention affection love
admiration praise acknowledgement
consideration appreciation etc
all of these are forms of love food so
what's the significance of this concept
well what i'd like you to consider is
that a family is like a little ecosystem
kind of like a little rainforest
and just like there is a limited amount
of food within the rainforest there is a
limited amount of love food within the

[01:01]
limited amount of love food within the
family
this isn't necessarily because the
parents are cold and withholding though
that can certainly be the case this is
because the parents are human
and they only have so much time and
energy and attention and they're not
going to allocate those resources
equally across multiple children all the
time it's just not possible so there is
a limited amount of love food in the
ecosystem of any family and each child
only has access to a portion of it
and what happens in the context of a
family is that children over time come
to cultivate roles they come to occupy
niches within the family ecosystem that
will maximize their access to parental
love food and typically this is all done
unconsciously through reinforcement
processes
the parents generally don't know that
they're encouraging this process and the
children generally don't know how
they're being molded by their
environment
these reinforcement contingencies are
unconscious processes that drive

[02:01]
unconscious processes that drive
specialization just like in the rain
forest the rain frog doesn't consciously
evolve sticky pads on its toes so that
it can cling to trees and evade
predators it just kind of happens
because the frogs that had stickier toes
tended to survive and the frogs that
didn't tended to get gobbled so the
process of specialization within the
family ecosystem typically occurs
completely unconsciously it's not
anyone's fault
it just happens
and this is especially important in the
context of siblings because in the vast
majority of cases the oldest sibling
already has a substantial advantage over
any younger siblings because older
siblings know the ecosystem better
and they've already kind of spent time
specializing in a given direction
consequently the route to specialization
that is occupied by the eldest sibling
is effectively closed off to the younger
siblings who then have to find other

[03:01]
siblings who then have to find other
ways to compete for the limited supply
of love food in the ecosystem
in the vast majority of cases younger
siblings just can't successfully compete
in the same domains with their bigger
stronger more knowledgeable more
experienced older siblings so they have
to find other routes to specialization
to survive in that ecosystem and that's
how siblings tend to occupy different
roles within the family over time
and the last thing i want to point out
is you can take the person out of the
family
but you can't always take the family out
of the person
which is to say if we don't acknowledge
and process the specializations that we
adopted in childhood to secure love food
within the family ecosystem
then these specializations can actually
follow us for our entire lives for
better or for worse
if you ever want to understand why
people are the way that they are
you have to imagine them in the
circumstances that created them

[04:01]
circumstances that created them
it's like if you go to a zoo and you see
a jaguar you might think why does that
jaguar have spots that doesn't make any
sense
but if you then saw that jaguar in the
jungle and the light was filtering down
through the through the leaves and
leaving this dappled pattern of shadow
on the ground you're going to say oh
i understand why jaguars have spots it
makes sense now now humans are a little
different from jaguars in that they have
the capacity to overcome their
circumstances
but it's not easy to do and we do have
to make a concerted effort to try
