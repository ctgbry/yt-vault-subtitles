And that mimicking authenticity is is
that manipulation?
&gt;&gt; I mean probably. Yeah. I mean
manipulation as I discussed in the book
is a word that has a lot of baggage
related to it. The literal definition is
something that you can kind of move with
your hand. Like manu is like manual
labor.
&gt;&gt; So to manipulate means that you can kind
of have a grasp on something. We often
go to people and experiences to be
manipulated. Like when we go to a movie,
we want to be manipulated into thinking
that we're in the scene of the action.
No one wants to pay the ticket and sit
there and say, "I'm just looking at
reflected light on a screen." Um,
they're not going to feel anything.
They're going to think the whole
experience was overblown and expensive.
Right? So, people go to certain places
and experiences in order to be
emotionally manipulated. And I think
that relationships, especially romantic
relationships, are one of those places,
though we don't like to admit that. You
see some of that come out in especially
young people's dissatisfaction with not

young people's dissatisfaction with not
having the feels. A lot of people date
for the spark. They want to have a
feeling. They want to be able to feel
excited. They want to feel alive. They
want to feel. And um unfortunately a lot
of the things that stimulate feeling are
dramatic. I mean that's what movie
makers and entertainers have figured out
a long time ago. It's not really
grounded in that which is sustainable
and mature. That in fact can be very
boring. Mature relationships tend to be
fairly boring actually. So on the one
hand, people might complain when their
dates aren't very exciting and they
don't feel anything for them, but if
that ever falls through, they complain
that they were lovebombed and
manipulated by Makavelian narcissists.
So, it's like those two expectations are
kind of two sides of the same coin.
