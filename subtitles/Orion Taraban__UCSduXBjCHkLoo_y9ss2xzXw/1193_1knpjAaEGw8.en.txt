I wish this weren't true, guys. But the
fundamental issue is that feeling love
and getting what you want are not the
same thing. In fact, they might be
diametrically opposed to each other.
Love is self-sacrifice in the service of
the other. This is why Jesus said you
could love your enemies. It has nothing
to do with personal desire or need
satisfaction or emotional experience.
Love is about giving so that other
people might benefit. Which means at
least in that moment you are not getting
what you want. Unless of course what you
want is to sacrifice yourself in the
service of others which suffice it to
say is a very very rare desire. You're
up for canonization if that happens to
be you. The reality is that most people
don't want that irrespective of what
they might say. Just look at their
behavior. Loving is not a pathway to
getting what you want. It never has been
and it never will be. And that means

[01:01]
and it never will be. And that means
bitter truth number two that if you want
sex and affection and relationships from
women, the way to get those things is
not by being loving. Again, I wish this
weren't the case, but if you want those
things from women, you have to get
better at attraction, seduction, and the
value proposition that underlies sexual
relationships.
The the guys who are
successful with women, have figured this
out. You don't get what you want from
women by loving them. I wish you could,
but I was not consulted in the design
phase.
