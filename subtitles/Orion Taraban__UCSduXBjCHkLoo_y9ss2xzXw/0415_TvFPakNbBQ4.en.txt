I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is where do
players come from
so the myth of the natural is just that
it's a myth there are very very few men
who are naturally confident with women
very very few men effortlessly attract
women how do I know this because in
every other domain of life nothing
requires more effort than seeming
effortless
so why would success with women be any
different the fact of the matter is that
enjoying optionality with women requires
a significant amount of skill and while
some men's natural talents will dovetail
nicely with this particular skill set
which will help to explain the variants
and outcomes we observe a skill set
remains at the end of the day a suite of
behaviors that can be learned so if men
who enjoy significant success with women

[01:01]
who enjoy significant success with women
are not born but made the question
becomes how does this occur
what are the circumstances that motivate
men to invest the time energy and money
necessary to acquire this skill set
in general
players are nice guys who got hurt one
too many times and decided to do
something about it
players are almost always former nice
guys and often former Romantics which as
I've discussed many times on this
channel is an attitude toward life that
always ends in tragedy and it's only the
intense pain associated with these
experiences that serves as sufficient
motivation to master a skill set that
almost by definition demands the learner
undergo a substantial amount of personal
rejection
it's after a significant heartbreak
sometimes one sometimes several that
these guys due to their patently poor
outcomes finally get around to examining

[02:02]
outcomes finally get around to examining
their cherished beliefs about women and
relationships and submit themselves to
that study of effectiveness rigorously
the concept of Effectiveness is key as
these guys are tired of not getting what
they want and what works therefore has
to Trump what they want to work or what
they think should work when it comes to
women it's actually a fairly scientific
mindset and we can think of players as
applied behavioral scientists who study
the mating and dating behavior of women
and like science it is best practiced
with a kind of value neutrality because
both players and scientists understand
that reality has no obligation to
conform to our beliefs about how reality
should operate
one of my all-time favorite movies is
the best cinematic example I know of
this phenomenon if people know the Hong
Kong film director Juan Kar y they are

[03:01]
Kong film director Juan Kar y they are
probably familiar with what is generally
considered his Masterpiece In the Mood
for Love It is currently ranked fifth on
the Sight and Sound critics poll the
greatest movies of all time people love
this movie and to be fair it is a really
excellent film
however even fans of this movie
Sometimes don't know that Wong made a
sequel to this film called 2046 which in
my opinion is even better
like its title suggests in the mood for
love is like a case study of a mood a
particular moment of life it's brilliant
but it's also kind of simple
2046 on the other hand is much more
complex and to my mind more honest if In
the Mood for Love is a still life then
2046 is a symbolic allegory highly
recommended
now before I go any further to explain
what this has to do with where players
come from if you're liking what you're

hit the super thanks button it's in the
lower right hand corner beneath the
video those three little dots and tip me
in proportion to the value you feel
you've received from this episode
your support goes a long way and I
really appreciate it
in any case I feel comfortable
discussing the main plot points of these
movies because the Artistry of the films
is such that even if you know exactly
what happens they are still worth
watching
in In the Mood for Love Tony lung plays
a man named Chao who is married to a
woman to whom he is faithful and devoted
however about a third of the way through
the movie he learns that his wife is
having an affair with his next door
neighbor's husband
two of them Chao and his female neighbor
Su Lee Chen kind of figure this out at
the same time and this creates an
opportunity for the two to commiserate
with each other as they find themselves
in the strange situation of knowing that

[05:01]
in the strange situation of knowing that
their spouses are cheating on them with
each other
over time Chao ends up falling in love
with Suli Chen and this doesn't work out
well for him either because we learn
that she decides that she would rather
remain faithful to her faithless husband
than start a new life with ciao this is
a real kick in the teeth for chow as he
is functionally cucked twice by the same
man whom we never see on camera
that is the same man successfully wooed
Chow's wife and successfully retained
his own wife's affections both Chow's
wife and his neighbor prefer the
cheating husband to him
so ciao has his heart broken twice over
the course of the movie and this
presumably causes him to question both
his life choices and his fundamental
attitudes toward women and relationships
and that's where In the Mood for Love
ends
the sequel 2046 picks up the story of

[06:03]
the sequel 2046 picks up the story of
Ciao's life a few years later and he's
almost a completely different man he's
grown this little like Clark Gable
mustache he dresses really slick and he
as he confesses in the opening voice
over narration he has a lot of one-night
stands but hey nothing lasts forever
anyway
and this of course is the attitude of a
man who has been significantly betrayed
by women he thought he could trust his
wife's commitment in marriage he
couldn't he thought he could trust a
woman's receptivity to his sincere love
and affection he couldn't so rather than
have his heart broken again he Embraces
a world of temporary relationships and
superficial interactions because hey at
least you can get some pleasure here for
a while and maybe that's the best we can
really hope for in life
you see this attitude most clearly in
Chow's relationship with bailing played
by the beautiful Zhang ziyi who

[07:00]
by the beautiful Zhang ziyi who
incidentally was Jen in Crouching Tiger
Hidden Dragon you know how much I love
that movie
in one scene he discusses his pragmatic
views of relationships with her namely
that people just tend to borrow each
other for a while and that makes sense
he used to believe in marriage turns out
his wife was just borrowing him for a
while he used to believe in love turns
out his neighbor was just borrowing him
for a while we can get mad we can get
sad or we can accept that this is how it
is
we just sort of use each other until we
don't and that is correct that is the
nature of things and it's this
indifference to the ephemerality of
relationships that tends to characterize
most players and that helps ciao pass
through a series of gorgeous lovers
that said at the end of the day this is
a reactive position it's a defensive
posture that more or less protects the
individual from falling back into the
fallacies that leave him vulnerable to
pain and betrayal

[08:00]
pain and betrayal
and we know this is a defensive posture
for child because we see occasional
cracks in the facade for instance he
plays it so cool with the fiery by Ling
that she ends up falling in love with
him and offers him a committed
relationship
now I believe that ciao fell in love
with Bai too at least to a certain
extent but his player code his defensive
posture clearly forbade him from going
down that path and in that scene he is
like shaking with self-restraint like it
takes every ounce of his strength to go
against his emotions and tell by to get
lost
he knows that he will lose by by doing
so but he also knows that he will lose
himself if he doesn't
one of the many meanings of 2046 in the
film is that it is the title of a
science fiction story that Chao is
writing about a man who tries to escape
from a city where time stands still
by analogy we can consider chao's

[09:00]
by analogy we can consider chao's
various adventures with women as a
collective attempt to escape to move on
from the standstill the trauma of his
heart breaks
do check out both of these films as they
are both excellent movies in their own
right and faithful portrayals of men's
reactions to romantic failure and
betrayal
