I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the game
does not run on gratitude
remember a game is anything with rules
and a goal so this statement is just as
true in business as it is in Romance the
game does not run on gratitude what does
this mean listen very carefully listen
twice if you need to as soon as you are
no longer in a position to either
benefit or harm someone else
you become irrelevant
if you cannot help or hurt someone you
are an NPC in that other person's life
you are wallpaper and your thoughts
feelings and goals no longer matter
even if you have a long history together
as soon as you remove those
contingencies the potential for future
harm and the potential for future
benefits you can no longer expect to

[01:01]
benefits you can no longer expect to
influence another person's Behavior
you can be upset about this you can
lament the state of humanity you can go
on angry tirades about men and women and
the way that things should be but this
is the way it is the game does not run
on gratitude and why not
because you've already been paid
this is something that's going to be
very hard for some of you to understand
so I will walk you through it
the idea that you're owed something for
past action especially something that
has not been explicitly and mutually
negotiated is rooted in an idea of
fairness that frankly may only exist in
your mind
articulated beliefs along these lines
typically begin with the words after
everything I've done
after everything I've done for you after
everything I've done for this company
this is how you repay me
if you recognize this belief in yourself
let's take a look at this

[02:00]
let's take a look at this
more closely shall we
let's start with how this belief
operates in career in business in this
case it should be fairly clear that the
entire time that you were sacrificing
yourself for the company you received a
paycheck every two weeks and made use of
the perks and privileges associated with
the position as long as you are
providing a service
your responsibilities and compensation
were what you explicitly and mutually
negotiated with your employer and if you
stopped receiving that compensation to
which you were entitled for discharging
your responsibilities you would have
stopped working
anything that you may have expected
beyond your mutually negotiated
compensation existed only in your mind
and you were given what you agreed to
for everything that you've done
if you remain spiteful
uh
even in light of these facts it likely
means that you agreed to something that
you didn't really want to do out of the
hope that some future benefit might
accrue to you even if that benefit was

[03:01]
accrue to you even if that benefit was
just continued loyalty
my friends loyalty is extraordinarily
rare the vast majority of human
relationships are not governed by
loyalty or fairness or gratitude or
kindness or any other virtue or ideal
they are governed by power
which is the ability to either give
people what they want or don't want or
withhold from people what they want or
don't want
it's the ability to implement benefit
and harm
when you can no longer benefit or harm
someone else you have no power in the
relationship and so you surrender your
only real chance of ever getting what
you want
but before I go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing please

you can also hit the super thanks button
it's those three little dots in the
lower right hand corner beneath the

[04:01]
lower right hand corner beneath the
screen and tip me in proportion to the
value you feel you've received from this
episode that helps make this all happen
and I really appreciate your support
now all of this remains true in Romance
after everything I've done for you is
the rallying Cry of frustrated and
resentful men and women the world over
however just like in business this
belief is irrational because you've
already been paid for everything that
you've done
just like no one is so selflessly
devoted to a company that they will keep
showing up for work if the paychecks
stop there are very few people who will
remain loyal to a relationship in which
the transmission of benefit has long
since ceased and we generally pity those
who choose to remain so
and what did you get out of that
relationship for everything that you did
well it's different for every
relationship but it generally includes
some combination of things like dates

[05:02]
some combination of things like dates
companionship sex attention excitement
commiseration support emotional energy
distraction remedy from loneliness Etc
and more than all of these you were
there
you were present in a person's life and
were able to accompany them through time
for a while
you were paid with some or all of these
things adopting a hurt or martyring
attitude because you will not receive
further benefit is ungrateful
as soon as a benefit has been received
it is dead
it is in the past and it cannot
influence future action think about it
the concept of debt irrespective of
whether it's monetary debt or emotional
debt really only has power to influence
people because of the possibility of
future harm associated with non-payment
this can mean lowering your credit score
or it can mean wanting to spend less

[06:01]
or it can mean wanting to spend less
time with you in the vast majority of
cases people discharge their debts not
because they are grateful for the favor
rendered but because they are averse to
the harm they could experience in the
future if the debt were not repaid
again what really motivates people is
power
the carrot and the stick however it's
shall we say poor form to make these
contingencies too obvious so what we
tend to do is mystify power behind a
veneer of ideality like a sugar coating
on a bitter medicine this veneer makes
power easier to swallow and allows
people to save face when responding to
its influences
by mystifying power we give ideals
plausible deniability which allows Peak
power to remain hidden in plain sight
here's an extreme example of this
what force makes soldiers hold an

[07:02]
what force makes soldiers hold an
indefensible position in Wartime
do you think it's love of country
or a commitment to duty
no
it's because if a soldier deserts
especially during wartime he will be
court-martialed and executed
so if he's dead irrespective of whether
he holds the line or runs away but
holding the line redown's honor to his
name and family and can in some small
measure reduce the likelihood that harm
might befall those he cares about as a
consequence of his sacrifice
then holding the line becomes a better
option for him
only because of the calculus of harms
and benefits in effect
this might anger some folks because the
ideals of patriotism and Duty like all
cherished ideals make life more livable
by bringing us into further remove from
the Relentless and unfeeling application
of power
but if this weren't the case if soldiers

[08:00]
but if this weren't the case if soldiers
would hold the line simply out of
patriotism or Duty
then such a severe punishment surely
shouldn't be necessary
however my hunch is that if we were to
keep the patriotism and dispense with
the court-martial
we would have a lot more desertion when
all hell broke loose and on the other
hand if we were to keep the court
martial and dispense with the patriotism
things would look largely as they do
today albeit with much lower recruitment
weight rates
in any case my friends the game any game
does not run on gratitude the vast
majority of people will not retain a
relationship on the grounds of past
benefit
but they might if they stand to benefit
in the future
