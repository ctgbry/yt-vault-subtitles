I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is
do you only want sex
so this is a question that men often
hear earlier in the courtship process it
usually occurs after the two have
initiated a sexual relationship and the
man expresses interest and enthusiasm in
having sex with a woman again and let's
be clear this isn't really an honest
question it generally has a shaming tone
to it as if wanting sex is somehow
superficial or disgusting or insulting
to the woman in question
it also implies that it's somehow
inappropriate to be focused on sex which
is not at all sex positive and we at
psych hacks are sex positive that said
for some women it can feel as though
straight men's interest in sex is some
kind of annoying distraction or a
degrading objectification
now to be fair this attitude can be a

[01:03]
now to be fair this attitude can be a
reaction to let us say men's
heavy-handedness with respect to their
intention and I think I understand the
woman's experience here and feel free to
correct me if I'm wrong in the comments
below but the experience is something
like as a woman
I want to feel like there's more to me
than just the warm hole I can provide
which literally every woman can offer if
a man only wants sex well he can get sex
from any woman and I don't want to be
any woman so participating
enthusiastically in an activity that is
this impersonal and generalizable would
somehow diminish me as a person I want
to be seen and related to as something
more than a sexual object therefore
consciously or not I will punish men's
enthusiastic sexual interest in me so
that I can have the benefits I hope to
accrue from the relationship either
increasingly on my terms or more cheaply

[02:03]
increasingly on my terms or more cheaply
now
to the extent that I got that right
there's nothing bad or wrong with that
sentiment inherently however there are a
few ideas there that are a bit misguided
and my goal here is to help women
understand this so that they can have
more satisfying relationships with the
men of their choosing
leaving aside the belief that men can
get sex from any woman they can't and
the belief that sex is somehow
impersonal it's not the real issue with
this line of thinking is a lack of
appreciation for the real essence of
sexual relationships
as you know sex is extremely important
to men and sexual relationships are the
one socially acceptable place where men
can get it
so it's actually entirely appropriate
that men bring explicit enthusiastic
interest in sex

[03:00]
interest in sex
to their sexual relationships
because where else are they supposed to
bring that interest
you have to understand that sexual
relationships have kind of a monopoly on
sex and if people can't get something
they want at the Monopoly they typically
don't surrender the necessity or the
desire they go find it on the black
market which is the shadow of the
Monopoly

value you feel you derived from this
episode I appreciate your support
now to be completely real with you
ladies almost all the things that a
woman can potentially provide a man
he can get elsewhere except for sex and
motherhood
but we're going to focus on sex for

[04:00]
but we're going to focus on sex for
today sex is the thing that is unique to
the sexual relationship and so it kind
of makes sense that sex is going to be
of high priority with respect to that
relationship
women complaining that the men they're
seeing might only be interested in sex
is sort of like the chef at Tony Roma's
complaining that the people there only
seem to order ribs
the chef might be like well I I make
salads too I put a lot of love and care
into my salads why doesn't anyone order
my salads because it's Tony [ __ ]
Roma's it's the place for ribs
well why can't it be the place for ribs
and salads
well because that's terrible branding
and if Tony Roma's had the poor judgment
to actually pursue that marketing
strategy it would not work out well for
them people go to Tony Roma's because
they want ribs that's what the place is

[05:00]
they want ribs that's what the place is
known for and that's where they know
they can get them they can get salads
anywhere and in this metaphor a salad is
anything that I can get from a sexual
relationship that I could also get
elsewhere say from my friends or family
or colleagues or myself
men go to their sexual relationships for
sex for the same reason people go to
Tony Roma's for ribs what's on the menu
is in the [ __ ] name
and embracing this reality helps both
women and Tony Roma's prosper
so it doesn't quite make sense to me
that a woman might feel put off by a
man's sexual interest in her especially
if she's already in a sexual
relationship with him
can you imagine the waiter at Tony
Roma's condescendingly asking so you
only want ribs
it's not wise to shame your customers

[06:00]
it's not wise to shame your customers
if those patrons weren't interested in
ribs they wouldn't have come through
your door
and you can't get anything from a
customer who won't walk through your
door now can you
on the one hand advertising your
availability as a sexual partner and
upholding strict social mores about the
sexual Monopoly of sexual relationships
well on the other hand shaming and
degrading men who appropriately bring
their sexual interest where it is
advertised and socially approved
is an enormous double bind
it is unlikely to prove a successful
mating strategy for women and it will
likely degrade the quality of the
relationship
for any man unfortunate enough to stay
in one
this might be a bitter pill for some
women to swallow but I gotta keep it
real for you
if you want to be seen as more than just
a sexual object you need to provide more
than sexual value
if you were to go out with me

[07:01]
if you were to go out with me
what would generally happen on the first
few dates well
I kind of set everything up I take the
initiative and ask you out so I'm
disproportionately assuming the risk and
the responsibility for both of us I
established the time the date the place
and I'm going to pay for everything on
the date I'm funny making you laugh
Charming making you feel engaged I'm
intelligent making you think and I'm
interested making you feel special
in this common dating scenario you just
basically have to show up
and without sex what exactly am I
getting out of this interaction where do
I get what I want
do you see so if you the woman want to
be seen as more than just a sexual
partner then be smarter than me and
teach me something I don't already know
or be funnier than me and make me laugh
or be more Charming than me and make me
feel something or be kinder than me and
offer me emotional support or if that's

[08:01]
offer me emotional support or if that's
too much to ask buy me a drink or take
some initiative so that I don't have to
be responsible for every last detail of
the interaction I already have plenty to
do and my time and resources are not
Limitless unpopular opinion but it's
your responsibility to demonstrate that
you have more to offer than simply sex
but if you're not funny
and you're not that smart
and you're not treating me to anything
and you're not taking initiative or
responsibility
and you're not particularly kind or
supportive well
what else is on the menu
that is a real honest question and you
need to think about that
and you have to understand that the
value proposition here is relative you
may think that you're funny and smart
and sugar and spice and everything nice
but are you funny and smart and what
have you relative to me

[09:00]
have you relative to me
let's be honest the higher the value of
the ma'am you happen to be dating the
harder it will be for you to provide
positive relative value for instance if
I make significantly more than you it's
going to be harder for you to foot the
bill at the places I like to go
if I'm very intelligent it's going to be
increasingly difficult for you to tell
me something I don't already know
and if you're not that Charming I will
probably have to do the entertaining for
both of us
so what's the upshot that it's actually
easier for women to be perceived as more
than just a sexual partner with lower
status men
but those aren't the men they generally
want to sleep with
so women are kind of on the horns of a
dilemma either she has to really develop
her skills and virtues relative to the
men she would prefer to mate and date
or she has to kind of make peace with
the fact that when people go to Tony
Roma's they want to eat ribs

[10:02]
Roma's they want to eat ribs
personally I think it makes a lot of
sense to play to your unique strengths
in fact I could teach women to get
pretty much any man that they want
but one of the ways that women really
shoot themselves in the collective foot
is not accepting men's sexual interest
and appetite
ladies you gotta think it about it in
terms of marketing
if you want ribs where do you think
about going
and if a particular man wants sex which
he will
where do you want him to think about
going
