in my recent episode the fear of
commitment dorogaya Moya asks what
traits are considered as a significant
Improvement to a man's life well that's
very hard to answer in the general
because men differ from Individual to
individual however I will say that the
traits that are most important
for a specific man are complementary
traits
a man isn't looking to be reflected in
what he already has to offer he's
interested in Shoring up
weaknesses or liabilities with the woman
that he brings into his life
for example if a man is already making
in the high six figures he's probably
not going to sort for a woman who's also
making six figures it's like how much
money do they really need so that's not
adding much significant additional value
to a man in that state that man will
probably be filtering for more
complementary assets and traits
