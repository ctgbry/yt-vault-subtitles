if you've ever read your contract with
your employer or your landlord you'll
likely find somewhere near the bottom a
clause called severability this
basically stipulates that in the event a
party violates a part of the agreement
the rest of the agreement still stands
the clause in question is severable or
separable from the rest of the contract
the violation is a violation and it
affects the relevant Clause but the rest
of the contract remains in force and
that's kind of how I think about sexlist
marriages the monogamy Clause has been
violated a sexless spouse is no longer
in a monogamous relationship and so
shouldn't be held accountable for acting
non- monogamously given that the other
partner has already unilaterally decided
this for the other party but all the
other Clauses of the relationship remain
in force now I don't think this should
be done hastily in long-term
relationships interest in sex can e and
flow so if this is your primary
relationship it's a good idea to have
some grace and patience with your
partner but there are limits to this as
well and infinite patience and an
absence of accountability may not be
great for sexual relationships
