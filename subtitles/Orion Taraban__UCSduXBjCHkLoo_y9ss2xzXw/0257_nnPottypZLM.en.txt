and don't be the last guy to leave the
party yt asks did you ever have to take
a leap from the standard paths
uh i'm laughing because i feel like my
whole life has been a leap from one
standard path or another
for example i understood from a very
young age that i could never work a 9 to
5 in an office where all the days were
the same and i was looking forward to
friday and dreading mondays i would
rather shoot my face off
the way i think about life
is sort of like buying clothes
if you buy your clothes off the rack the
best you can hope for is an 80 85
fit and that's because those clothes are
not actually made for you
if you want clothes to actually fit your
specific body you need to get them
custom tailored that's going to be
expensive that's going to be time
consuming but it's the only way to get a
perfect fit between you and your clothes
same is true about life
no one is going to give you the lie
