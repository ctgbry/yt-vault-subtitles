precede commitment it's changed in the
last 60 years and the main instigator of
the change was birth control the reason
why commitment had to precede sex for so
long is because the threat of pregnancy
always loomed large and in that day it
was extremely difficult if not
impossible for a woman to earn her own
money and to survive in society without
the pro protection or provision of a man
or a governmental program that served as
its surrogate and all of those things
have changed the reason why commit
commitment was required before sex was
because the stakes of a woman becoming
pregnant outside of marriage were
extremely high and it was upheld
socially because if that man couldn't be
persuaded or coerced to commit then that
single unwed mother and her children
would have become society's problem
