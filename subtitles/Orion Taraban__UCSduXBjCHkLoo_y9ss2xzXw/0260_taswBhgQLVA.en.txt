i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to improve your luck
luck is not necessarily this random
chaotic element of chance that permeates
the universe that's only one way to
conceptualize the idea
another way to conceptualize luck is as
a factor that we have some measure of
control or at least some influence over
and i like this alternative approach
because it supports human agency and
self-efficacy
but before i discuss just what this
alternative conceptualization is please
remember to like this video and
subscribe to the channel it takes less
than a second costs you nothing and it's
how you can support me in my mission to
deliver high quality content to the
world thanks for your help
so just what is this alternative
explanation
i think it was nicely summarized by the
roman philosopher seneca who said luck
is what happens

[01:00]
is what happens
when preparation meets opportunity luck
is what happens when preparation meets
opportunity
i love this quote because it basically
provides a recipe for improving your
luck apparently you have to do two
things you have to prepare and you have
to create opportunities
what might that look like
well let's say you're looking for better
luck in the dating scene you're seeking
a compatible long-term relationship or
an attractive lover but you've been
coming up short what do you do well you
first need to create opportunities for
yourself
that means you have to get out there you
have to get on the apps you have to go
to social events you have to put
yourself in front of more people i mean
the person that you're looking for isn't
going to just drop out of the heavens
you need to be mixing with the right
people at the right frequency in order
to create more opportunities for
yourself to get lucky
however seneca reminds us that
opportunity is not enough
if you're stirring up opportunity but
you don't know how to make good on the

[02:01]
you don't know how to make good on the
opportunities that you do create you're
only going to end up frustrated and
resentful for your efforts
so you also need to prepare
in the context of the dating scene this
would mean
going out on dates
the best way to get better at anything
is to do that something
which means that the best way to get
better at dating is dating
going out on dates will help you get
better at the game of seduction and all
that comes with it so you can improve
your dating skills however you can also
improve yourself generally by increasing
your standardized sexual marketplace
value by developing in yourself the
traits that are typically selected for
by the sex to whom you are retracted
the higher your standardized value and
the more polished your dating skills the
luckier
the luckier you'll be with respect to
converting the opportunities that come
your way makes sense
