i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
if you're in the park you must have a
ticket
this talk will be a continuation of a
previous episode entitled life is like
disneyland in that episode i use
disneyland as a metaphor for life
remember you can't do disneyland wrong
if you want to ride all the rides once
that's the right way to do disneyland
for you
if you want to ride space mountain 50
times in a row that's the right way to
do disneyland for you
if you just want to watch other people
ride the rides that's the right way to
do disneyland for you you can't screw up
disneyland and in a certain sense you
can't screw up your life you just get to
choose which rides you go on i.e which
experiences you choose to have
so
hopefully this metaphor helps to relieve
some of the pressure associated with
quote living correctly
that said sometimes i talk with folks

[01:01]
that said sometimes i talk with folks
and they suffer from what you might call
existential uncertainty
they're not sure why they're here
or even if they should be here
and they feel as if they have to do
something in order to justify their
existence
this could be getting married having
children becoming rich
successful being loved and respected
making their mark on history and or
achieving something great and impressive
i call these self-justification projects
and they're all doomed to failure
because you cannot solve an internal
problem with an external solution
what i'd like you to consider is that
your life
is already justified
why
because you're already here
you're already in the park
at disneyland there are hundreds of
workers who are constantly employed in
letting in those who should be in the
park and keeping out those who shouldn't
there are fences and gates security and

[02:01]
there are fences and gates security and
guards that exist to fulfill this
purpose
therefore we can reasonably assume that
anyone inside the park is there because
they had a ticket
perhaps they're not really aware of
their ticket because who really worries
about their ticket after it's been used
to secure entry
but that doesn't mean that they aren't
supposed to be there
if you're inside the park you must have
a ticket
and if it's that hard to sneak into
disneyland how much harder do you think
it must be to sneak into existence
without the knowledge or approval of
whatever higher power or universal force
is responsible for the gateway into
being
you are not an exceptional oversight
you did not break and enter your way
into life
and you are not the result of spiritual
negligence
if you're here it's because you should
be
now you might not remember buying a
ticket
and that's because most likely the
ticket was gifted to you

[03:00]
ticket was gifted to you
you certainly didn't earn the ticket as
you might not have existed previously
and there's no need to repay the ticket
as it was given as a gift of grace
and this is a relief because what could
you possibly do in your life to repay
the debt associated with the opportunity
to exist
all the accomplishments and achievements
in the world would not be sufficient
it's a debt that
it's not a debt that could be repaid
which is why it's not a debt that must
be repaid
you can't get blood from a stone
i'd like you to consider that the ticket
was a gift of grace
freely given
that needn't be earned or repaid
and that you must have been gifted one
by virtue of your own existence
since only people with tickets are
allowed inside the park
so this whole headache about proving
that you deserve to exist is totally
unnecessary
imagine spending the day at disneyland
trying to justify that you deserve to be

[04:01]
trying to justify that you deserve to be
spending the day there i mean what would
that even look like
if you're already in the park there's
nothing more that you need to do
though there might be plenty that you
want to experience
