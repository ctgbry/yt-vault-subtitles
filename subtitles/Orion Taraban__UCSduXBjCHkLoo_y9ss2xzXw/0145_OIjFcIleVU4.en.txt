i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the position
of the adorer
so this is a continuation of my previous
episode on the balance of attraction
remember no two people can like each
other exactly the same amount
so in any relationship one person likes
the other more and one person likes the
other less
in this episode i'll be talking about
the person who likes the other more i.e
the person who occupies the position of
the adorer
now there are pros and cons to this
position basically if you're more
romantically inclined
or you prefer to live in your emotions
then this is the position for you
think about the lovey-dovey stereotype
of infatuated couples where each one is
arguing with the other i love you more
no no i love you more no no silly pants
i love you more

[01:00]
i love you more
etc
neither partner wants to be the adored
because occupying that position would
prevent them from being the adorer now
this stereotype is comic hyperbole but
some vestiges of it remain in even more
mature relationships
make no mistake such individuals want to
be the adorer and why might that be
because adorers get to be with the one
they love
and they get to experience all of the
emotional consequences associated with
that opportunity
they look forward to seeing the adored
with positive anticipation
they feel elated when things are going
well and devastated when things are
going poorly
they may feel worried or insecure or
confident and reassured adorers whether
they're conscious in it or not
enter into relationships to feel

[02:00]
enter into relationships to feel
both the dizzying highs and the
terrifying lows to be sure they may
complain about the lows however for many
people relationships that stimulate
negative emotions are preferable to
relations that elicit no emotion at all
this isn't an unpleasant truth but a
truth nonetheless
and the frequency and intensity of the
emotional experience is always greater
when they occupy the position of the
adorer
and the intensity of that experience is
directly related to the size of the gap
in the balance of attraction
bigger gaps like between a movie star
and a devoted fan
bigger emotions for the adorer
smaller gaps like between two peers
smaller emotions for the adorer but
always
more emotions for the adorer than the
adored and this can be either a pro or a
con like i mentioned previously the two
positions are actually value neutral it

[03:00]
positions are actually value neutral it
really depends on your preference for
emotional experience the feeling of
loving the feeling of being in love
indeed those who prefer to live in their
emotions can become bored or
uncomfortable if they're placed in the
position of the adored for an extended
period of time or to a significant
degree
they may even create unnecessary
conflict in an attempt to redistribute
the balance of attraction to preferred
levels
