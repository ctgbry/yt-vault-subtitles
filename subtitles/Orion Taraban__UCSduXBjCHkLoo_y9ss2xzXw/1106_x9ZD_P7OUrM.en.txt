Why do you think so many marriages fail?
I mean, are we in some essence not
talking about monogamy? Is that the root
cause of you of a lot of these marriages
failing? Or do you think we're just bad
choosers? Meaning, we haven't gone
through the filtering process and we
perhaps led with intuition rather than
logic to be in a relationship or
marriage with partners that we probably
should not have been in the first place.
The more I think about it, the more I
think that being married is almost an
impossible thing to do. And the fact
that it seemed like our grandparents and
our great great grandparents were able
to stay together, I think largely has to
do with a severe lack of optionality,
enormous social pressure to conform, a
lot of shame related to uh separation
and divorce andor the impossibility
legally of getting a divorce. So I think
that when you take away those things
which are not very comfortable to live
under that certainly will feel
oppressive to a lot of people men and
women you take away the protective

women you take away the protective
factors that keep people in a
relationship long term because it it's
very it's very tough to stay together
every every 7 to 10 years you're going
to become a different person. You're
going to become a a different version of
yourself and your partner's going to
become a different version of herself.
And even if you were perfectly matched
10 years ago, what who's to say that
you're now going to be perfectly
matched? Like sometimes relationships
just have they run their course. They
have they exist for a season or to
accomplish a specific goal. Should we
really try to fit the square peg in the
round hole if it seems like we've
accomplished what we set out to do and
we're no longer that compatible? Like
maybe that's the mature thing to do and
we need to collectively reexamine our
attitude that if a relationship doesn't
last until death that it's somehow a
failure. I think that's a big part of
