Men and women go to relationships to
feel, but I do think it's a more
important component for women. If they
feel nothing, they're more likely to not
give that guy a second date. The guy
might think, "Yeah, it was an okay date,
but maybe we just need some time to get
to know each other, and we might have
some commonalities. We could probably
make it work. No, I didn't feel a spark.
There was no chemistry. I'm not going to
waste any time." And I think it's an
important component for women to remain
in their relationships. It's more often
the case.
&gt;&gt; Yes. I I think that it's more likely
that a woman is going to say, "I fell
out of love and therefore this
relationship is no longer valuable to
me." Than the other way around. Yeah,
men can fall out of love, too, but I
think they might be more willing to stay
out of a sense of duty or
responsibility, but when the emotions
aren't present or they leave, most women
are looking for the door.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Due to your obligation is generally not
enough to keep them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. two two stats that that kind of
paint what you're talking about is the
study where they go over, you brought
this up before, men who cheat and men

[01:00]
this up before, men who cheat and men
who don't cheat show the same level of
marital satisfaction. When women cheat,
it's about 83% of the time they show a
lack of satisfaction um in the marriage
or they're less satisfied in the
marriage, which also means 17% of the
time women are just having sex to have
sex.
&gt;&gt; It's true. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. That combined with the fact that
80% of divorces are initiated by women
kind of paints the picture of what
you're
