i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to get less angry
now the key to getting less angry is
understanding the intimate relationship
between should
and anger
generally behind most angry emotions is
a thought that contains the concept of
should
something like
i shouldn't have to deal with this or
this person should know better
and these thoughts can be very dangerous
it's not really possible to think these
thoughts
and believe them to be true
and not feel angry so i'd like you to
consider that thoughts like these are
really anger pathogens
the issue
is that when people use the concept of
should in this way
they're really using it incorrectly
and that incorrect usage is what
contributes to emotional suffering
the incorrect use of the word should is
anything that suggests that reality has

[01:01]
anything that suggests that reality has
a moral or ethical obligation to be
anything other than how it actually is
that reality has a moral or ethical
obligation to be aligned with they
believe reality should be
thinking in this manner is just asking
to be outraged
there's also really no basis for these
beliefs like where is it written that
reality must align with our own hopes
and desires however virtuous and noble
those hopes and desires might be
that's not really how things work on
this planet
alternatively
a better use of the word should
is as a kind of shorthand for
given the confluence of factors that are
exerting themselves on a given situation
the most likely outcome is that was a
bit of a mouthful so i'll say it again
a better use of the word should is as a
kind of shorthand for
given the confluence of factors exerting
themselves on this situation the most

[02:02]
themselves on this situation the most
likely outcome is
for example if i were to go to the roof
of my house and i were to drop a glass
bottle from that height
it should break when it hits the ground
that is due to the force generated by
the rapid deceleration when the bottle
comes into contact with the ground and
the structural integrity of the bonds
between the molecules comprising the
glass and several other factors etc etc
the most likely outcome
is that the bottle breaks as a result of
that collision
if it breaks it should have broken
if for some reason it doesn't break it
shouldn't have broken because apparently
the forces exerted on that bottle were
not sufficient to cause that to happen
everything is as it should
be
so
you'll notice instead of starting with
our ideals and trying to impose them on
reality
and getting angry when there's a lack of
alignment between how things are and how

[03:00]
alignment between how things are and how
we want them to be
we start with reality
and allow reality to dictate our models
of and beliefs about the way things
should be
this attitude is actually very
scientific
rather than attempting to force reality
into a pre-existing framework we can
functionally go to reality and say teach
me
help me understand the reason why this
happened
the way that it did through an
examination of the forces that conspired
to create this outcome
as surprising or personally distasteful
this outcome happens to be for me teach
me
and if i were to continue to stubbornly
insist that this shouldn't have happened
where people should behave in a certain
way
then i'm willfully turning a blind eye
to the reasons why reality is the way
that it is
which actually robs me of the
opportunity to grow into greater
alignment with these forces for my own
betterment
the more i listen to reality the more i

[04:01]
the more i listen to reality the more i
can build accurate representations of
reality with my words and beliefs which
in turn will help me stay safe
and get what i want moving forward
