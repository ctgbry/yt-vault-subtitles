zen's vlog asks
what drove you to start your channel
well to be honest i had a pretty
idealistic aim when starting this
channel
i work with a lot of people individually
and i feel very fulfilled and
rewarded by my work as a clinical
psychologist
but it also means that i really only
work with
20 to 30 people at a time and i had this
conviction
that the things that were helping these
20 or 30 folks
if they had a wider platform would have
the potential of helping
hundreds thousands maybe even millions
of other people because people are not
all that different from one another when
we get down to it and so the goal of
this channel is to reduce the amount of
unnecessary suffering in this world
by taking the lessons and the teachings
and the healings that i have cultivated
and delivered through individual
psychotherapy to a wider platform
hope it helps
