I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
improve your self-esteem
so I've already done a similar episode
on how to improve your self-confidence
and now I'm turning my attention to
self-esteem self-confidence and
self-esteem are related but they're
actually separate issues
self-confidence is related to efficacy
it's the belief that all other things
being equal
you can do something that you will be
successful in the attempt on the other
hand self-esteem is more like all other
things being equal I feel good about who
I am as a person as a human being
unfortunately there are a lot of folks
out there who struggle with self-esteem
issues
they may even be very successful and
self-confident but they have low
self-esteem nonetheless these folks
don't think very highly of themselves
and don't really feel good inside of
their own skin fortunately there is a

[01:02]
their own skin fortunately there is a
simple and effective way to improve your
self-esteem but before I get into what
that is please remember to like this
episode And subscribe to this channel it
takes less than a second costs you
nothing and it's definitely an estimable
action so do the thing
so improving your self-esteem isn't that
complicated the formula has two parts
first you need to do difficult or
steamable things and that kind of makes
sense it's pretty hard to feel like
you're a good person if you're not doing
anything that you yourself would
consider difficult or esteemable so pick
a goal and go after it do something hard
do something that you can be proud of
having done
people don't get genuine self-esteem
from sitting on the couch and scrolling
on social media they need to do

[02:00]
on social media they need to do
difficult or steamable things and
frankly you probably already knew this
but here's the thing the first part is
not enough you need to also do the
second part and this is the part that's
really neglected in today's day and age
in order to develop self-esteem not only
do you have to do difficult and
esteemable things
but you have to do difficult and
esteemable things
and not tell anyone about them
that's the hard part in the age of
social media so why is this important
this is important because if you do
something difficult or esteemable and
then you share it with others then you
substitute self-validation for external
validation in fact you rob yourself of
the opportunity for self-validation
which is the basis of self-esteem you
exchange your own internal satisfaction
for praise views and likes and when you

[03:03]
for praise views and likes and when you
do that you're basically training your
mind to understand that the reward for
difficult or stingable action is the
praise or validation of others
and the longer you do that the more you
will rely on external validation for
your own self-regulation and the more
you will need to prop up your own
self-esteem with the praise of others
taken to it is Extreme people are
subject to becoming like validation
junkies and this can be as addictive as
any substance Addiction in fact we would
call it a process addiction like
gambling and it can lead to some very
dark places
so the idea here is to do difficult or
esteemable things and not tell anyone
about them
this will give you the opportunity to
validate and esteem yourself which is
how you get self
esteem
and how do you do that well you kind of

[04:01]
and how do you do that well you kind of
have to talk to yourself in a supportive
and encouraging way like
I'm proud of what I did today or I was
scared but I did it anyway or I wanted
to quit but I kept going good job Orion
I know it sounds kind of cheesy but
that's the kind of self-validation that
facilitates the cultivation of healthy
self-esteem
then over time you'll find that you
won't need as much external validation
in fact you'll eventually become
indifferent to both praise and sexual
and this is an a supremely good thing
why because if you're still emotionally
influenced by whether people agree or
disagree with you or like or don't like
you or praise or censure you then you're
still more or less a Slave
and not just a slave but a slave with a

[05:00]
and not just a slave but a slave with a
million Masters
by learning to validate ourselves
sufficiently we can experience a kind of
emotional manumission whereby we can
emancipate ourselves from the slavery of
external validation
