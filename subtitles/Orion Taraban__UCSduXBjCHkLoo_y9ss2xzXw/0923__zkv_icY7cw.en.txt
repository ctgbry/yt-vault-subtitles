Men are incredibly loyal to the marriage
itself. Uh even if their behavior is not
emotionally that whatever it is, they
want to make it work. And it might be
because of the family, might be kids,
whatever it is, but they want to stick
at it. Whereas for women, the moment she
shows interest in another man, her love
for you just goes. It just literally
goes. The moment she's disloyal, she
will continue to be disloyal. It's a
one-way street for women. And one of the
way things I always say that gets me in
a lot of trouble is if if a woman's
cheated on you and you accept it, you
are just her free accommodation. until
she finds someone she wants to leave
with. Because there is no way we can
genuinely two things. We can't genuinely
love you and be attracted to you and
sleep with other men if she's healthy.
And secondly, what's worse than that,
even if let's say she can cheat on you
and still love you, she cannot respect
you when you forgive her. And the
respect is more important. There's
nothing that usually pushes a man
further away than when a woman is
unfaithful biologically. So when you
show that you accept that behavior, she
can't respect you because we like alpha
and alpha men would say, "You had your

chance. I wish you the absolute best.
Off you go." But men don't do that.
That's borne out by the research. Like
there doesn't seem to be any
statistically significant difference in
relationship satisfaction in men between
men who cheat and men who don't. There's
an enormous relationship satisfaction
differential between women who cheat and
women who don't. So men cheat because
they can on some level because there's
an attractive enough sexual opportunity
that they want to take advantage of.
Maybe for novelty, maybe just because
it's sex, who knows? Women cheat because
they're emotionally dissatisfied.
They've and the dissatisfaction precedes
the attraction, the looking outward and
the acting on
