someone once asked
me about a woman I was dating who I I
really liked and they said well what do
you what about that girl what do you
think about her and I said you know what
she's
inoffensive and that was like the
highest praise I could give that woman I
have dated many different women in my
life and the ones that I've had the
longest relationships with we're not the
hottest we're not the smartest we're not
the um the most
Savvy with respect to relationships they
were not the most like domesticated
whatever that means it was the women who
were the most inoffensive they were so
easy to get along with they didn't cause
any problems they didn't create any
disrespect they actually cared and even
better worked and made an effort to make
my life better and to further the goals
that I was working towards both for
myself and for the relationship
