I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is women are
a roll of the dice okay men this episode
is for you as I've previously discussed
dating is an extended hiring process in
which you the man are the employer
because you the man are in a position to
extend an offer to the woman and not the
other way around this means that dating
is really an opportunity to
surreptitiously vet a woman for the
relationship position of your
choosing however For Better or For Worse
Your Capacity to do this will be
compromised by the fact that you will
likely be attracted to the woman you are
vetting and attraction does all kinds of
things to your perception the more you
are attracted the more distorted your
perception becomes this is why I
generally recommend that men do not make
any kind of long-term life-changing
commitments to a woman for at least 12

[01:01]
commitments to a woman for at least 12
months this gives the couple time to
pass through the crisis of
disillusionment in which the weight of
reality shatters the projected Fantasy
on which the attraction to this point
was fundamentally based so there is a
12-month minimum due diligence process
within the overall hiring process that
is courtship in which men vet women for
long-term relationships got it that said
even if you do all this even if you
follow all this advice and you quote do
everything right relationships
ultimately remain a roll of the dice you
absolutely don't know and you can't know
what you're going to get in the long
term a woman who was great for the first
12 months of dating might be very
different 12 years down the road in fact
the most likely outcome is that you both
will be very different your lives will
be very different what you prioritize

[02:01]
be very different what you prioritize
will be very different and what you want
within those priorities will be very
different on some level it's quite
strange that we expect the same person
to meet these evolving needs and wants
and priorities even decades later but
that's apparently still how we operate
as a culture the upshot is that no
matter how well you vet a woman no
matter how much due diligence you
perform you will ultimately be rolling
the dice with respect to that particular
relationship there's no way around it so
what you have to understand is that all
relationships with women are a form of
gambling you can learn the rules and do
your research but you still have to roll
the dice and this means that on some
level you should approach women like you
approach gambling and the first
unbreakable rule of gambling is that you
never ever ever

[03:00]
never ever ever
under any circumstances
ever gamble with more than you can
afford to
lose this is the fundamental rule of
gambling all professional gamblers have
their Kitty the money they play with and
they have the money they need to live
and support their Lifestyles the two
must remain separate and distinct when a
gambler starts to play with the money he
needs to live
is precisely the moment he crosses over
into a gambling addiction and that
doesn't lead anywhere good professional
gamblers can continue to play precisely
because they keep their Kitty separate
from the money they need to live that
way they can stay afloat even if they
get completely cleaned out at the tables
this is really important to remember
because whether we like it or not all
relationships

[04:00]
relationships
end however in our culture relationships
don't really end
equally many years ago a mentor of mine
was consoling me after a heartbreak he
he told me Orion a woman is like a
tsunami when she leaves she takes
everything with her I can't remember if
I laughed or not because uh it might
still have been a little too close to
home but the man had a point women are
generally the ones to leave they
disproportionately initiate breakups and
divorces and when they leave they can
take a lot with them and this means like
a responsible Gambler you can't ever
give them more than you can afford to
lose now before I go any further if

links to everything in the description
below okay let's get back to it
now I don't just mean this from the
perspective of resources though that is
certainly important if you're concerned
about your resources then just don't
sign the marriage contract and if you
absolutely must for some reason then
make sure you get a strong negotiated
prup before you do no
exceptions but I also mean this from the
perspective of your emotional investment
it's important to protect your heart if
you go all in emotionally then you're

[06:01]
you go all in emotionally then you're
going to be completely devastated when
that relationship ends and trust me you
don't have unlimited emotional resources
it's very difficult if not functionally
impossible to go all in emotionally more
than a few times in your life so the
first rule of gambling makes sense never
play with more than you can afford to
lose that said some people love to Res
resist this advice they bulk oh
ory what's the point of love if you hold
back love is all about going all in
otherwise why even bother it's just not
worth it and I wouldn't settle for
anything less anyway this is the most
common rebuttal I hear to this
fundamental Rule and in my experience
the reason behind this rebuttal differs
depending on the gender of the reeba te
allow me to explain

[07:00]
allow me to explain
now if I hear this objection from a
woman that she wants all in or nothing
well I just sort of chuckle to myself
because that's kind of like the casino
insisting that I raise my bet and it's
like no the casino would want me to
do that after all The House Always Wins
doesn't it now casinos can set like
minimum standard bets at their tables
however if a casino were to insist that
players gamble with with their entire
holding in order to play well they
probably wouldn't have a lot of
customers and those they did receive in
all likelihood wouldn't be very happy
customers for very long this objection
serves The house's best interests not
its customers so just smile and move on
however sometimes this objection comes
from men when the objection comes from a
man that he wants all in or nothing it's
somewhat more puzzling but I'll explain
where it's coming from

[08:00]
where it's coming from
these men are really in to the emotional
component of their relationships like
I've said most people men and women most
people want to be the adorer in their
relationships because it's the adorer
who gets to feel the feelings and the
best feeling that adorers get to feel is
the feeling of being with the one they
love which when everything is going well
is one of the best feelings in the
entire world
relationships are like gambling in the
sense that the higher the stakes the
more you're going to feel you can play
it safe and just bet with nickels but
you probably won't feel anything one way
or the other you might not ever lose
your shirt but you also won't ever
really get ahead so why bother playing
The Men Who insist on going all in don't
do so because they hope to win big they
might
temporarily but this is the less likely
outcome and the house always wins in the

[09:01]
outcome and the house always wins in the
end anyway they insist on going all in
because they are chasing an emotional
experience they want to feel something
and just like a gambling addict they
might not be able to feel something
unless the stakes are very very high so
you should be cautious with respect to
following these people's advice to
summarize since women are a form of
gambling never invest more in a woman
materially or emotionally than you can
afford to lose and understand that any
objections to this advice are typically
in the service of the casino and not its
customers what do you think does this
