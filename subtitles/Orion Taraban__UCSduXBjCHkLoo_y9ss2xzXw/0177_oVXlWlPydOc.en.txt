i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
ideas divide emotions unite so
if you look around the vast majority of
human conflict on this planet originates
in ideological differences left versus
right east versus west believers versus
non-believers it's the belief that
others beliefs are a threat to one's own
belief system
and that one is therefore justified in
doing what is necessary to make the
world safe for one's own beliefs
that is directly related to the vast
majority of strife on this planet
throughout history check out my episode
called the nature of evil in games for
more on this subject ideas divide people
on the other hand
emotions
unite people
why
because i don't care who you are there
are no two people on this planet who are
so dissimilar that they don't share some
facets of the human experience and those

[01:00]
facets of the human experience and those
facets are generally emotional as they
arise from our shared evolutionary
history we're all under the same sun we
all know what joy feels like we all know
what pain feels like we all know what
fear feels like all of us want to be
loved and respected and to live in peace
none of us wants to be disrespected or
abused or to live in conflict we may
have ideological differences with
respect to the best way to go about
achieving these ends
but those are the things that we all
want
the upshot of this is that by
prioritizing the importance of our
beliefs we often unintentionally create
the very world that we would prefer not
to inhabit
if you want to bring people together
whether this is in the context of your
marriage or global geopolitics
you need to focus on emotions
the shared human experience that you
have in common with other human beings
now this isn't enough to end all

[02:00]
now this isn't enough to end all
conflict but there's no way you can end
all conflict outside of mutually assured
destruction without including this as a
strategy
and we can all do this in our own lives
by putting common humanity ahead of
divisive ideology
