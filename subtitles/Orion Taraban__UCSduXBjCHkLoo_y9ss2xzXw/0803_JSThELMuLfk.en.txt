the really difficult thing about
personality disorders is that within the
subjective experience of the person with
a disorder there is no problem with
themselves that's because the
personality is disordered it's like the
perception that's looking out into the
world is so fundamentally warped that
there's not enough Clarity and insight
to wrap that back around to see that
wait a minute I actually am the ComEd
denominator here some people do get to
that eventually where it's like they
can't keep a relationship they've been
fired by every job they have conflictual
relationships with their family members
their friends have turned their backs on
them it's like at at some point
sometimes people say you know I actually
am the common denominator all these
relationships maybe there's something
that I'm contributing to these
relationships but until then it's that
my ex was a narcissist and my father was
an emotionally abusive withholder and my
friends are actually just envious of my
beauty and success etc etc so that's one
of the clearest red flags for cluster B
personality disorders is what we call
externalizing
