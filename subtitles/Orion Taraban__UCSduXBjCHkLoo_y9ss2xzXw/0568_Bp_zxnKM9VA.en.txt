[00:00]
hello everyone thank you for joining me
today I'm Dr Orion taban and I am very
pleased to be able to sit down today
with Dr Robert Glover the author of No
More Mr Nice Guy I have my own copy
right here hey man that's a nice looking
book you got there yeah man I actually
this is one of the first books I read
maybe 10 years ago when I started on my
journey of self-awareness to uh to level
up in both my romantic and social life
so uh thank you for your work it's meant
a lot to me personally I know it's
helped a lot of guys uh all over the
world so I'm I'm personally excited to
have you on and I think it's a great fit
for the channel so welcome well thanks
for the invitation it's good to be here
and uh let's have fun let's do it now I
assume that a lot of my audience is
going to be familiar with your work but
just so that we get all on the same page
tell me what is a nice guy and what's so
bad about it I was so bad about it all
right a nice guys basically is a guy who
doesn't believe he's just okay as he is

[01:01]
doesn't believe he's just okay as he is
and this is an an emotionally
internalized belief usually dating back
to Early Childhood where he believes he
has to become what he thinks other
people want him to be to be liked and
loved and get his needs met and hide
anything about himself that might cause
anybody to have a negative
reaction I see okay that's interesting
because one of the episodes I made a
while back is called most men are
Romantics and I talk about how the most
prevalent male romantic belief is I
should be loved just for who I am and
that might sound like it runs a little
counter to what you just described and
do you do you have a comment about that
we could I could go a couple directions
with that I should be loved just as I am
here's the
deal we'll start something off here we
can run with this uh ways I'm sure I
don't believe Love's ever found

[02:01]
don't believe Love's ever found
externally that's part of the problem is
that we believe if I want to be loved I
got to go find it somewhere else and and
you know culturally you know women are
taught you go get it from a guy and guys
are taught you go get that from a woman
you know and and you know unless unless
we're not heterosexual and then just you
know shift it to whatever our opposite
sex
is but I think it is probably one of the
greatest causes of human suffering that
we go looking for love outside of oursel
because I don't know about you in my
experience I've never been consistently
loved by even the people who claim to
love me and you know I I can piss them
off they can fall out of love with me
and
so anytime we go searching for love
outside
ourself we're asking for difficulty and
problem I think that's why so many
relationships don't work we go into them
with this illusion oh this person likes
me and wants to be with me I Finally
Found Love they're going to love me

[03:00]
Found Love they're going to love me
forever and everything's going to be
great now here's another problem if we
don't already internally feel
particularly lovable here's a couple of
problems we won't let anybody love us
more than we already love oursel
whatever if we put that on a scale of
one to 10 I love myself as six well
that's as much as we ever let anybody
love us is it it is six because we won't
believe anybody could love us more than
what we love ourselves most of us
probably don't love ourselves at a six
the second problem is we can't love
anybody else more than we love ourselves
it's it's just impossible to be more
loving to others than you are to you now
we may give more to other people we may
you know create a codependent
relationship with other people but
that's not love that's that's that's
borrow functioning that's giving to get
that's manipulation that's I'll give to
you so that you'll love me it's the it's
the covert contracts I talk about and No
More Mr Nice Guy so there's I think that

[04:00]
More Mr Nice Guy so there's I think that
the issue that we got to start with is
how do we learn to love oursel and see
ourself as love and if we don't believe
we're lovable we're not going to let
people love us and we're not going to
let people see the real us which that's
actually how people kind of get a chance
to love us as they see the real us and
again we won't love anybody more than we
love ourselves and the people around us
will go you know how come I don't feel
all that loved by you well we only love
you
know I I used to be religious I have two
degrees in religion so without going
down that road you know it's interesting
you know we've all heard about kind of
the Golden Rule and and Jesus Sermon on
the Mount where he said love your
neighbor as yourself and we say that a
lot but I don't think we ever actually
pull that apart and say what is the
standard of love for others your
neighbors referring to anybody out there
when he said love your neighbor as
yourself he said selflove is the
standard of all love and he just said

[05:01]
standard of all love and he just said
that like everybody's going to
understand that it'll make sense but
here we're talking about well how do we
get other people to love us you don't
you love you and my experience is the
more you love you the more you tend to
attract people who act loving towards
you now I can get behind everything that
you just said in fact I made an episode
a long time ago about the Golden Rule
and suggested that another way to
interpret that is less a commandment for
moral action and more an observation on
reality with an implied subject as in
love your neighbor as you love yourself
could also be interpreted as you love
your neighbor as you love yourself
that's just the the reality of the
situation and and it could also be love
yourself it could be um so I I agree
with all of that I also had a mentor
tell me once and I think it's a good
observation is that you can't
technically feel another person's love
you can only feel your own love coming

[06:00]
you can only feel your own love coming
out of you for others and I think that
might dovetail nicely with what you just
said so I agree with everything you just
said about love I think that's wonderful
come on We're not gonna have fun if you
agree with it well I'm not so I'm gonna
push back a little bit more which is um
let's go back to I'm this idea that I
should be loved just for who I am what
if you're unattractive to women just as
you are you're going to be unattractive
to some women just as you are but it's
also what is your basis of
attraction one of the things I found
well let me come come at this with still
two ways one of one of piece about this
you know looking for love outside of
oursel um one of my uh certified coaches
wrote a book recently called uh sipping
fear pissing confidence and it's it's
written it's great great book amazing
book written from a point of dealing
with addiction for men but he covers a
lot of stuff but there's a line in there
when I was listening to the audio book
he said a man doesn't mature until he

[07:00]
he said a man doesn't mature until he
quits seeking the love of a woman and
that hit me is so true because what what
are we out there trying to find a
substitute Mommy to come love us because
we don't love oursel all that much and I
thought that really is true as long as
we're seeking love from a woman as a guy
we're we're in an immature State you
know it's love me love me think I'm
good-look enough to be attracted to you
know love me enough to want to have sex
with me and all of that is putting all
of our internal power in the hands of
some somebody else okay so so there
there there's one piece of it but let's
bring it back to that whole
attractiveness what if I'm not
attractive enough to attract women
um most men get it wrong what's
attractive to women now you know I don't
know I'm sure Studies have been done on
attractiveness I I don't know how to
even Define you know what what defines
what you're attracted to in another
person it might be some physical traits
it might be some emotional traits it

[08:01]
it might be some emotional traits it
might be some energetic traits it might
be personality might be behaviors might
be all of the above it might be based on
your relationship with your mother and
your third grade girlfriend I don't know
I honestly do not know how to figure out
why I'm attracted to what I'm attracted
to now I do know I'm highly attracted to
unhappily married women I do know that
you know has nothing to do with their
physical features I just know that my
first love object was an unhappily
married woman and you know I I I I'm
highly drawn to I can fix that I can fix
that I can make that better so I I've
learned to watch that one right I've
learned to pay attention to it but like
my wife will accuse me you were looking
at that woman what kind of woman are you
attracted are you attracted to this or
that women always ask guys what kind of
women are you attracted to and I go I
guess ones that Treat Me Nice um but you
know it's not like oh I'm attracted to
blondes or tall or short or curly hair
um I think that's just too too
simplistic and when men start trying to

[09:01]
simplistic and when men start trying to
figure out what women are attracted to
women are attracted to drug dealers to
men in prison to to short guys to porn
stars to you know pro athletes to to you
know Saints you know I don't know so
whatever a man thinks is what makes a
woman attracted to a man he's almost
always going to be wrong because I you
know I always thought well if I didn't
like have the nice square jaw full head
of hair you know if I didn't have the
proverbial Alpha you know look to me I
thought I would not be physically
attractive to women and then when women
started telling me Oh you have kind eyes
oh I love your kissable lips or I love
your hands I mean what the [ __ ] what is
it about my hands that some woman would
find attractive but women have told me
that now was it probably more than my
hands was it probably more than my kind
eyes was it I don't know now I I have
some theories that in general what women

[10:02]
some theories that in general what women
in general find attractive but again if
a man tries to figure out well if I just
be this do that that'll make women
attract me well I'm being that doing
that and they don't seem to be attracted
to me therefore I must not be attractive
again that's basing you know okay women
in general want to have sex with me or
don't want to have sex with me that's
going to determine my worth my value my
attractiveness again that's a real
fragile
um measuring stick of our worth and our
lovability okay I buy all of that and I
have a whole chapter about this in my
upcoming book on sexual Marketplace
value and I do think that I love that
chapter that's a great chapter to I do
think that we culturally have let's say
archetypes for male and female Beauty
and that the more a man or a woman
Accords with those biologically informed
and culturally influenced standards the
higher

[11:00]
higher
a person's attractiveness is but
absolutely no man is attractive to all
women no woman is attractive to all men
and ultimately what it comes down to is
perceived sexual Marketplace value
because even though all other things
being equal this person might be more
attractive to more people if his let's
say normalized sexual Marketplace value
is higher it all comes down to the point
of transaction with that person that
you're dealing with and people very wild
wildly with respect to their tastes uh
in partners in the
bedroom um attraction oh yes so about
what you said as long as men
are trying to become attractive in order
to get women in order to get laid
they're already they've already kind of
lost because they've given their power
away I can agree with that but I think
that's a tough cell I think men kind of
have to be catfished into
self-development I think in the
beginning it has to be mo because it's
the strongest motivation in the world
for a guy is to want to get laid and

[12:00]
for a guy is to want to get laid and
only as he starts to level up and maybe
take care of his lifestyle and his
fashion and his wealth and his game does
he realize oh this is inherently
rewarding and this is good for me but I
don't think he get I'm laughing because
I I because I I do agree with that in
general that you know i' I've written a
couple of books one dating Essentials
for men the other one dating Essentials
for men frequently asked questions and
um I say in the book I say this book is
a dating book I'm calling it a dating
book because you want to learn how to
date and you want to get late the truth
is is how to expand your social and
emotional intelligence book that's
really what it's going to teach you the
motivation is you want to attract women
and you want to have a girlfriend you
want to get late um but I'm going to
teach you how to do some things that are
going to increase the odds of doing that
and and it really is by teaching men how
to expand their social and emotional
intelligence that I believe makes them
more generally attractive um I I'll give

[13:02]
more generally attractive um I I'll give
you just a couple thoughts kind of a
foundation for how how I intend to
approach it I'll give you one example I
I just started reading a book last night
I got in bed got my Kindle out and I
thought all right I'm tired of reading
self-improvement books business books
marketing books I pulled up a fiction
book that I had um just on a whim
downloaded a month or so ago um it's I
think it's called The Little Liar by
Mitch Alba and it's it's written during
um uh Nazi World War II
and and the book kind of starts out with
some some people on a Nazi train being
taken to a death camp and then it then
it it Segways into a commentator in the
book is truth and truth is talking to us
and and Truth is the personification of
of you know truth and truth even says
that anybody who is
truthful is immediately more
attractive I'm probably not quot quoting
it exactly but it gave a reference to

[14:01]
it exactly but it gave a reference to
this very physically attractive young
boy but because he was truthful
everybody was attracted to him and he
said very few people truth say very few
people are actually truthful so I you
know I could take that that I think
there
are energetic and emotional
dynamics that create far more powerful
attraction than the shape of your nose
size of your jaw the Venus of your body
that your perceived market value do
those things help yeah they help in
terms of triggering uh H A chemical
reaction in a woman's brain that you
know Evolution put in there you know
that guy's fit he's strong he can take
care of me of course that stuff is there
it doesn't
hurt but what what is it about those
people that don't have those features
but yet even as men were drawn to them
we like their energy we like how we feel
around them we like listening to them we

[15:01]
around them we like listening to them we
we feel comfortable engaging with them
what are those features and those
features work with women and you know
one of the things that I say and and um
uh whenever I say this to like a woman
coach like if I'm if I'm being
interviewed by a woman and I and I say
you know I found that the feminine and
I'll speak of the feminine as an
energetic State um so whether it's women
you know dogs cats babies Adventure
money opportunity the feminine is highly
attracted we just lost something we did
what happened oh on my end my screen
went all right must have been a zoom
thing or a screen looks like we're still
recording we're good okay we're good
I'll back
up feminine take a breath the feminine
so I say the feminine is highly attract
now feminine I mean women dogs cats
babies money Adventure opportunity is
highly attractive to a man who is

[16:01]
highly attractive to a man who is
comfortable in his own
skin knows where he's going and he looks
like he's having a good time going there
I'll say that to women coaches and you I
got the chuckle out of you and the women
go they they sigh ah yeah yeah and
because you know they're used to you
know working with men usually these
women coaches are usually coaching men
and the men come in because I watch
enough [ __ ] on the internet from all the
pickup guys and all the dating gurus
that basically says you need this line
you need these physical features you
need this Alpha Behavior you need this
thing you need that thing and and all
these guys none of them actually get
comfortable in their own skin kind of
going back to that self-love thing you
know I like me I I like my life I like
how I live it I'm comfortable living it
on my terms you know using a
psychological term I'm differentiated
you know I I I I show up live my life I
have internal locus of control another
psychological term that in general is

[17:00]
psychological term that in general is
highly attractive to Outsiders men and
women and I think if men can go to work
on those pieces and quit worrying about
judging themselves of are they do they
have sixpack abs do they have enough
hair are they young enough do they have
you know the the V features of their B I
think when a guy quits worrying about
that [ __ ] and goes about living his life
on his terms all of a sudden he notices
all these really good things start com
to me I don't have to make it happen I
agree with all that at the end but I
don't know if I can sign off on people
find the truth attractive I think if
people really found the truth attractive
the world would look very different than
it does today well I I I I agree with
that but tell you what test
this go look go go go out in public and
watch a couple that's obviously been
together for a while in public husband
and wife and the the ones who look the
most bored the most distracted the most

[18:01]
most bored the most distracted the most
on their phones the most disinterested I
promise you that's a couple that quit
telling each other the truth a long time
ago I have an episode coming out on this
next week the truth is never boring it's
never boring truth is never boring and I
tell you what women are not attracted to
boring men and as soon as a man starts
repressing his truth who am I what do I
think what do I feel what do I want
where am I going and trying to do
whatever it is he thinks is going to
attract a woman he's repressed his own
inner truth and now all of a sudden he's
going to be inherently
boring so again does truth make people
inherently attractive how about I that
was just a quote from the book but is is
is more along the lines of is I think
our energetic states that make us the
most attractive so if you do not
withhold your truth because like for
example in in dating Essentials for
you know and and when I talk with guys

[19:00]
you know and and when I talk with guys
I'll say listen the thing that will make
you most interesting and attractive to
women is be yourself and guys go well
that doesn't seem to be working out so
well so far you know being who I am
doesn't seem to be turning many very
many women on and I'll go how many women
how many people do you even let you see
the real you how many people know how
much you look at pornography how how how
how many people know you know how how
much you dislike yourself or how
insecure you are or how many people do
you let actually see your those things
about you and the truth is nobody we
don't let anybody see that [ __ ] and you
know what I found for me when I started
dating in my late 40s and early
50s I had what I considered
unprecedented success women were coming
on to me they were getting naked on
first dates they were propositioning me
majority of them were significantly
younger than me and I wasn't trying I
wasn't chasing them I've since my second

[20:00]
wasn't chasing them I've since my second
marriage I've never tried to get a woman
to have sex and and I never had a
shortage of sex and I thought what
planet have I landed on I wasn't getting
better looking you know I I didn't have
more money I filed bankruptcy after my
my second marriage I you know so I was
broke but the thing that I think turned
women on and men as well was I was
authentic I was real I didn't hold
anything back I was playful I was fun I
didn't give a [ __ ] and and so I took
risk and vulnerable that seemed to be
really attractive to people and all of a
sudden you know I'm going man I'm
getting a lot of dates guys are say tell
us what to do you know I don't really
know what I'm doing I'm just kind of
being out there being myself I think the
indifference is key Robert because the
vulnerability is often a double-edged
sword I was told that women wanted men
who were vulnerable and emotionally
intelligent and whatnot and in my teens
and early 20s I often would share a lot
of my deep dark yeah uh insecurities and

[21:02]
of my deep dark yeah uh insecurities and
uh let me tell you did not have the
intended effect but maybe that is
because I was still doing so out of a a
covert contract in the sense of like if
I do this then I will be rewarded with
sex and a relationship and that's
certainly not true and because you were
still doing what you thought was going
to make women attracted to you yeah
exactly right you were still following a
scheme because you you someone told you
oh this will make you attractive to
women oh I will do more of that and uh
all you found out is that you know women
kind of saw you as needy and insecure
yeah pretty much vulnerability doesn't
mean you turn every woman into your
therapist your emotional tampon I mean
that's not what we're talking about I I
give you an example a today
example you mentioned you're getting
over a flu a cold and and I mentioned
yeah this week I I had something just
knocked me out I don't know what felt
like allergies but like I just slept all
last month Monday and today's Thursday
so I'm kind of getting back at it and I

[22:01]
so I'm kind of getting back at it and I
I usually am up early but I slept in so
I didn't get up with my wife and take
the dog walking so this morning we're
walking the dog and I just shared with
my wife and she's not who I go to for my
emotional work I have plenty of guy
friends in my life that I do that
emotional work with but she does need to
know in general what's up with me you
know I don't I don't withhold that from
her but so we're walking the dog and I I
said you I I think I'm a little
depressed I said I've just felt no
energy GIS which is in Spanish my wife's
Mexican no GIS no no drive and um and
she kind of got quiet I thought you know
that's when they'd say oh don't be that
vulnerable the woman will feel unsafe
and unpredicted and I even thought you
know that could make her feel a little
bit oh no you know because you know
she's a tough woman she grew up eight
out of 10 kids poverty guadara Mexico
she's been beat up beat on by everybody
in her life family neighbors and and
she's tough I mean she she goes to the
gym two hours a day she's done myi she's

[23:00]
gym two hours a day she's done myi she's
done kickboxing I don't pick fights with
her and and but you know a couple times
when I've had some serious illness and
even close to death a few years ago it
just I could tell it just devastated her
just because like oh no you know he's
going away so I I mentioned this morning
I think I'm a little depressed that's
all I said didn't go into details just
don't have a lot of energy and I even
thought that's probably about as much
information as I need to give her we get
back and um I I I I had a call I got off
the call this morning and there was uh
two plates of fruit sitting out on the
bar and she was all dressed up she was
going out to have breakfast with her
girlfriend there's a a plate of fresh
cut pineapple a plate of fresh cut uh uh
papaya and she goes I I did this for you
and I said thank you I love it that's
great I'm so appreciative and she says
you know I'm always thinking about you
and I go I know that I know how much you
love me she goes and I I'm all dressed
up because you know I always want to
look good for you and I said I know that

[24:00]
look good for you and I said I know that
I appreciate that and so she went out
and then um I I texted her after my
phone call I said I'm gonna hit the gym
we have a gym in the house so I got got
my video on did my workout because
because I haven't felt well I haven't
worked out for about a week and a half
and she always kind of gets on my case
if I don't work out much so she comes
back and I said I got my workout in I
said yeah I think I'm feeling a little
better she goes because you got in the
gym I said no because you made me fruit
and you know I I kind of put it back you
know thank you for loving on so the
point is yeah a woman does want to know
I'm struggling a little bit with this do
they want us to sit and just kind of you
know give them the whole story no they
they they they really don't again where
do you find that Tipping Point uh you
can usually watch it in their body
language when when you've gone too far
with it they actually kind of get bored
and want to withdraw so I tell guys have
good guy friends have good men in your
life and I do when I'm struggling
there's other men fact I told my best
friend last night in a voice message he

[25:02]
friend last night in a voice message he
he said I'm kind of coming out on my
monthlong funk and I go I had a
week-long funk and I said I think I'm
starting to come out of it I tell other
people other guys about that and and
then I can just give my wife kind of the
guy version
of yeah that sounds right to me I made
an episode a long time ago called the
captain can't complain so if you're
leading the relationship and you're you
know imagine you're the captain of the
ship and you're heading into a storm if
you bring the whole crew together and
say oh my God I don't know if I'm going
to get through this oh jeez I don't I'm
not really sure we're going to be able
to survive they're going to be looking
for the the next exit off that boat and
they'd be right to do it but you
obviously can't hide the fact that
there's a Squall coming so the idea is
to forth you know directly face the
issue talk about what's going to be done
to address the issue and and still hope
that we're going to get through it
together I think that's kind of the
recip for doing that beautiful
illustration and it kind of felt like
that's the way it was with my wife I
just said I'm just feeling a little bit
depressed and didn't go in a lot of

[26:00]
depressed and didn't go in a lot of
detail you know she kind of contributed
by cutting some fruit I took care of me
by getting in the gym and get a workout
in I'm getting out of the shower you
know she says are you feeling better I
said yeah you know thanks for the fruit
so you know we work together but no I
didn't dump that on her that she had to
figure out how to get her husband over
this temporary depression and you I took
responsibility for just telling her I
got to the gym I know always makes her
more attracted to me a lot of the advice
about self-improvement for men it it
kind of feels ultimately like Buddhism
at its core in the sense that like
people often go to Buddhism because they
want to escape suffering right and the
Buddha says well the root of suffering
is desire well and the desire to escape
suffering is a desire so like it's this
kind of a paradox so if you say well the
way to to get with women is to not care
to get with women so it's like okay if I
stop caring then I will get the women it
just it it doesn't quite make sense I

[27:00]
just it it doesn't quite make sense I
don't actually teach that uh I I
actually do quote the Buddha at times
but I don't teach it I I'm not I don't
teach indifference um and and and Buddha
didn't teach indiff indifference
either he he taught not attachment which
might not be the same thing u i i i i
define it differently yeah I I I talk
about being outcome agnostic so for
example you know I I I talk to this well
another way I put it is being equally
okay with every possible outcome sure so
I'm talking to a woman in public it for
me being nonattached is again I'm I'm
I'm outcome agnostic I'm gonna talk to
her I'm gonna put action into this if it
goes somewhere great if it doesn't go
anywhere great I'm equally okay with
either outcome that I don't call
indifference indifference would be I
don't give a [ __ ] I'm not gonna even
bother right I I I I'm a big fan of
taking action but taking action that's
not tied to it's got to turn out this
way or it was is a waste or because that
just you know often quote the Buddhist

[28:01]
just you know often quote the Buddhist
as the Buddhist says that the attachment
is the cause of all suffering and then I
add for guys it's also the cause of all
anxiety as soon as I get attached I want
that pretty girl to give me a phone
number your anxiety levels just gone up
and you've made her the alpha because
she's the decider and that's not going
to play very well that will not come
across as outcome indifferent or outcome
excuse me agnostic fair enough but I can
still imagine that there's at least some
guy out there who are thinking maybe not
even consciously but thinking okay so if
I'm just outcome agnostic then I will
get the girl then it will work so let's
let's address that issue not about
outcome agnostic but about guides
okay I love working with guys my my
entire business my career my life is
built around working with men I was a
marriage therapist for for 25 plus years
once nor Mr Nice Guy came out 20 plus
years ago my business has just moved
towards working with guys I love working
with guys you can take the big stick out

[29:02]
with guys you can take the big stick out
and smack guys upside the head get their
attention say what the [ __ ] were you
thinking and they'll go thank you that
help very direct I've never I've NE I've
worked I work exclusively with men in my
private practice and I can't tell you
how many guys are when they first meet
with them they're like don't sugarcoat
it tell me the ugly truth I need someone
to to knock some sense into me it's so
refreshing guys would do that yeah I
can't do that with women I I heard Terry
a pretty well-known marriage and family
therapist and a feminist say one time
you can't begin with the woman in
marriage counseling because she'll leave
the guy you can you can take the big
stick out to the guy and he goes thanks
you know nobody's ever put it that way
before I love that about
men men also drive me [ __ ] crazy
trying to trying to run a business you
know they they won't read the
instructions you know they if if they
can be confused they will be if they can
misinterpret something they will well if
if something can be turned black and

[30:00]
if something can be turned black and
white they'll make it black and white
they get no sense of context I'll have
guys say Robert I heard on one podcast
you said this but on another podcast you
said that that's a contradiction and
I'll go what was I talking about on the
first podcast well I think you were
talking to a guy that like just read
self-help books 247 I said okay stop
reading self-help books and but what was
the contact the other one oh it's a guy
that never you know like even asked
himself who am I said well okay read a
book whatever well that's just a dumb
example but but if guys can do that they
will and that is why they are a sucker
that's why men are suckers for all the
[ __ ] pushed to them on the internet
I think we passed the 15 minute Mark so
we we bring in that you know everything
for example you know these long websit
to say you know the use these six tricks
to get every you know outrageously hot
woman to take her clothes off instantly

[31:01]
woman to take her clothes off instantly
and get with you guys believe that and
we'll read the whole thing and we'll
click on the clickfunnel and then we'll
then we'll go through the upsell and I
go because we all know what the
advantage is of having a crazy hot woman
right like we just we all know what the
advantage of that is I don't know
actually explain it to me what is the
advantage of having a crazy hot woman in
your life I've had some I I I I I won't
preach the advantages of it but we all
assume want that and then just men say
give me the technique I'll do the
technique how come the technique isn't
working I must not be attractive enough
or women must all be X Y or Z because
that so I'm going to go be an incel or
Go My Own Way or join a red pill Clan or
do this because all women are that way
and and so this is the stuff we run into
with men I love working with men but
you're gonna always run into that black
and white well I heard this it must be
true and the other thing we'll do is
we're constantly searching for more
information it's not like we have enough
information to actually apply it and go
out some guy on on on my online Forum

[32:01]
out some guy on on on my online Forum
the other day said Robert basically what
he said is Robert can you reconcile what
you teach about relationship with what
John gotman teaches about relationship
with what red pill teaches about
relationship I've been reading and I go
stop stop don't do that you're gonna
make you're making yourself crazy I said
there's probably some overlap between me
John gotman and red pill and I said and
we're saying very different things for
very different reasons and if you want
me to try to come make them all work
together in your mind I'm not going to
do it don't you even try but that's what
guys will do we're always looking for
that next shiny thing that's going to be
the trick that makes everything work
because no one's ever taught us you know
you have to work at something you have
to actually you know bring your aame you
got to show up with your lunch pil you
got to go through the difficult things
you got to learn to deal with tension
with anxiety and learn to soothe
yourself and learn to ground yourself
and let go of these attachments to

[33:02]
and let go of these attachments to
outcome that are causing your suffering
because again there's s there's so many
quick easy fixes out there on the
internet that yeah let me go pay my
money let me go pay my money because you
know this guy tells me it's gonna work
and anyway there's my little rant about
how much I love guys and working with
guys because I really do I hear you um
one thing that I found in my own
experience as I went through my self uh
development process about 10 years ago
is
that some of the nice guys are right
with respect to
honesty when when nice guys are
dishonest when they're hiding their
intentions when they're executing the
covert
contracts they usually get rejected the
vast majority of time but they tend to
get rejected nicely what I found is that
when you when you start being more
authentic when you start being more
honest
about your
intentions and when you start being

[34:01]
intentions and when you start being
let's say more well I I guess it I'm not
quite yet at I wasn't quite yet at the
outcome
agnosticism but I women will reject you
not all of them some of them will accept
you but they'll reject you much more
forcefully good it's like I've I've
never I've never been so um how do I put
this the the people who have hurt me the
most in life were have been women who
realized they weren't going to get what
they wanted from
me okay how'd they hurt you oh
uh with with yelling and screaming
verbal abuse uh destroying property
false allegations spreading rumors
reputation destruction things like
that what did that have to I'm acting
confused what did that have to do you
being uh truthful and up
front um what I what I'm suggesting is

[35:03]
front um what I what I'm suggesting is
that when when you're when you're nice
you tend to not get what you want but
you often don't get
um you don't get like the vindictiveness
The Crazies kind of you know I I I I
don't know that's not been my experience
the nicer I was the crazier the women I
attracted because I put up with it I put
up with it here let me back up just a
little bit when you mentioned the
rejection
I'm a big fan of rejection um I I I
preach it in in in my materials for
dating is is if we're gonna have an
intention the in if the intention is I
want that girl to like me I want that
girl to give me a phone number that
probably is going to lead to suffering
to manipulation to you know to you being
less
indirect but if your intention is to I
call it get to rejection quickly in
business is called fail forward fail
fast that that kind of mentality just
just go for it go all in with it and see
you know see what

[36:00]
you know see what
happens I have found that yeah if I'm
just fully me don't hold anything back
you know one of the things I teach guys
and again guys want to turn everything
into a technique I I teach something I
call the three tees touch teas and till
I don't I never meant it to be a
technique but guys will always look
teach us more about how to touch teach
us more about how to tease I go no
that's just a reminder don't hold back
if you have the impulse to touch her
touch her if you have the impulse to
teach her be playful if you have the
impulse to to to tell her what to do do
it don't hold back act on impulse be you
don't hold anything about you back now
the more you're not being you and and
the more you're being you and not hold
anything back you will find out really
quickly how that
lands and that's what you want to know
if you're being nice and using covert
contracts and what I call nice guy
seduction of doing things for listening
to her for hours and then you know

[37:00]
to her for hours and then you know
paying off her carpet whatever it is you
can never find out is she into you or
not but if you actually don't hold back
by practicing what I call that getting
the rejection quickly you can let go of
your crush you can let go of whatever
unrealistic fantasy you had about her
and move the [ __ ] on and open the door
for somebody that's actually going to
come into your life and treat you well
now the women who are vindictive and
treat you badly now I've been there too
but the truth of it is that's a boundary
issue of of of a problem that when a
guy's trying to get a woman to like them
they tend to ignore those red flags
early on they see the bad behaviors
early on but my my tendency and a lot of
nice guys my superpower is talking to
woman down through and over and getting
her back to good and so unfortunately if
I do that in those early warning
signs it keeps me hanging out with a
woman that I'm going to keep seeing a
worse and worse side of her and
when a woman lashes out and acts
vindictive towards you I'm going to

[38:02]
vindictive towards you I'm going to
venture to guess there were probably
warning signs that a guy saw that he
ignored prior to that it rarely comes
completely out of the blue it's possible
and certainly if she didn't run out of
the door I showed her the door very soon
afterwards I guess my point is I'm I'm
agreeing with you in the sense that the
more you come into yourself the more you
come into your masculine the more you're
not afraid to what you want and live
your life as you see
fit I would say a a proportion of women
become much more attracted to you
and when if and when you do not give
some of those women what they want Hell
hath no fury like a woman's scorn they
don't really seem to care when the men
that they're not attracted to don't give
them what they want that's why I think
the nice guys get rejected more softly
you understand I I I I I get that point
um
and I I still don't I still don't think

[39:00]
and I I still don't I still don't think
I'd want to do it any other way um I I I
heard a quote uh I I was at a conference
years ago with David data he wrote the
book way the superior man probably you
know a lot of men have heard of that he
made a comment that I had to ponder for
a little bit and then it just really
landed but he said choose a woman who
chooses you absolutely and what happens
you pring guys go out well I'm I'm
choosing that woman because she's hot
and and but she hasn't chosen us and now
we're doing all these things jumping
through hoops trying to get her to like
us buying her stuff whatever whatever
our typical way of Seduction is to try
to get her to choose us I see married
men do this I did it in in a previous
marriage guys will say uh Dr Glover you
know we've been married for over 15
years my wife hadn't hasn't wanted to
have sex since our kid was born 12 years
ago how can I you know turn her on and
make her want to have sex I go I think
your wife quit choosing you a long time
ago and and you're still trying to get
her to choose you you know I've tried
everything

[40:00]
everything
so if we choose a woman who chooses us
now a lot of guys again going back to
that nice guy thing or just the guy
thing guys will say well but I want the
hot ones and only the women the only
women seem to choose me are kind of the
fat older ones that I don't really want
and and I go okay I I get it I'm not
gonna argue that point but that's not
been my experience my experience is if
I've been out there being me I'll keep
coming back to that being me living my
life on my terms not chasing any woman
not trying to get any woman to like me
and especially not trying to get any
woman to have sex with me that's a point
where a lot of guys run into trouble is
we're hiding our sexual agenda while
pushing the a sexual agenda all at the
same time and and I I tell guys if you
got your foot on the gas and her foot's
still on the break the more you put your
foot on the gas the more her foot's
going on the break so trying to get any
woman to have sex is usually what how
guys you know end up a hashtag me too
casualty is we're trying to push an
agenda rather than when the woman has

[41:01]
agenda rather than when the woman has
chosen us she will let us know without a
doubt she's ready she's open take me
right so I I I want that kind of woman
now is that kind of woman maybe going to
be disappointed in me if I don't choose
her
back yeah there's that possibility but I
also
found that only seemed to happen if I
was may be in some way either leading
her on or didn't end something when it
needed to be ended CU like when I first
started dating because I hadn't had a
lot of sex in my second marriage and I
had I wasn't particularly experienced
before
marriage I said I'm going to say yes to
every sexual opportunity and I did and I
went to what I call my my integrated
Manor stage and I I was just consciously
saying yes and consciously letting women
know I was not exclusive now you can
tell a woman that and they can know it
intellectually but once they're you know
once they feel that attraction or once

[42:01]
once they feel that attraction or once
they're once they're hooked um is kind
of like they forget that you know the
chemistry takes over the chemicals take
over and I found that if I kept those
going on just because well you know I'm
getting laid you know regular but I knew
I did not want what I had a growing
sense she wanted I learned after a few
kind of rough experiences end that
rather sooner rather than later to where
it did not keep going on because it was
convenient and enjoyable for me but yet
I realized she was getting a deeper
connection than I was um so I just took
that on me it it it it it it saved me a
lot of messes further down the road I
hear what you're saying you might be
right I do think that potentially means
that you're taking you know agency away
from the woman in the sense that if
she's not getting what she wants why
wouldn't her be her responsibility to
take herself out of that Arrangement but

[43:02]
take herself out of that Arrangement but
but they they don't they don't count on
that yeah I I say this in one of my
episodes people don't want what they
want oh so people want what they want
not what wants them and so you can't get
someone to like you by liking them more
and one of the worst things that you can
do is to start doing things for someone
to try to increase their desire for you
in fact the research suggests that if
you actually want someone to like you
more you should ask them to do things
for you what's the term for that there's
there's a psychological term based on
like a present is not the coolage effect
but there's another where somebody you
know there's a term for it I can't
remember the the the term given to that
yeah psychologically if somebody if you
ask somebody they do something for you
they have to justify in their mind
exactly that if I'm doing this for this
person
I I I I must value them yeah I don't do
things for any old Joker I don't usually

[44:01]
things for any old Joker I don't usually
go out of my way for people so why am I
doing it for Orion oh I must think he's
an interesting guy I must have some and
and we'll talk ourselves into it you
know and whether or not that lasts very
long I don't know but yeah you you hit
the nail on it I tell nice guys this the
more you do for a woman all that's
probably going to do is create more
expectation that you're going to do
stuff for it doesn't create a deep
like or attraction on her part yeah
let's talk about this Robert because um
I I teach that the most common male
sexual strategy is to be a taxi cab in
the sense that they show up they roll up
to the woman and say hey sweetheart
where do you want to go I'll take you
wherever you want to go come on you want
to go to Dubai you want to go to Miami
you want to go to Vegas you want
diamonds you want meals you want drinks
I'm here to make it happen and a lot of
women will get in that cab yeah and the
guys will drive around for a while maybe
for years and then one day they might

[45:00]
for years and then one day they might
turn around and say Hey you know we've
been going to where you wanted to go for
quite some time do you think maybe you
could get up here and drive me somewhere
and that woman's gonna get the [ __ ] out
of that cab because that's not how cabs
work can you imagine if a cab driver
actually did that in real life just say
trip pull over here let me off at this
corner that's good so when you do start
off when when your primary relationship
strategy is I'm here to serve you right
well that's what she's signing up for
and it would be kind of a a breach of
contract almost if you were to change
that further down the road or mid trip
like I can understand why why women
would bounce at that point well it is
because you know I've worked with nice
guys for 30 years and so for example if
a guy who's been being that nice guy in
a longterm relationship you know doing
everything she wanted sacrificing his
wants and needs giving up all all his
guy friends always being there beck and
call and now all of a sudden you know he

[46:01]
call and now all of a sudden you know he
reads my book or he comes to therapy
with me or whatever and he starts
realizing I need to say no I need to
have boundaries I need to make my needs
a priority I I need to fill my own
bucket I need to ask for what I want and
he starts doing that oh it's gonna be
hard you know when when before I I'm I'm
going on memory here this doesn't have
to be accurate but before I wrote No
More Mr nice guy would say that you know
that when that happens I give it about a
5050 chance of the relationship making
it when the guy starts actually
asserting himself about 5050 Chance some
women are going to say finally you you
showed up where have you been I've want
because women love my book they love No
More Mr Nice Guy I mean there's been no
at all negative blowback from women they
want them hand to show up most do right
so then as I I was writing No More Mr
nice guy I think in the book I might
have said I think maybe it's about more
like 6040 now that 60% of the

[47:01]
like 6040 now that 60% of the
relationships won't make it I think by
the time that I finish writing No More
Mr Nice Guy 7030 let's go about 8020 now
that if the guy changes the fundamental
contract of the
relationship maybe 20% of the time the
woman's going to go you know this may be
a challenge it's going to be a struggle
I'm in though because I think you're
amazing and I want to be with you but a
lot are going to fall away just because
they got comfortable with how they
thought things were supposed to be even
if it wasn't what they wanted cuz I
don't think most of the women actually
want to get into the back seat of a taxi
driver and have the guy do things for
them constantly but a lot of times the
woman's not going to say no everything
the guy wants to do but then after a
while it starts to feel like the norm
and the wait you're G to take that away
from me now yeah that's when you get the
reaction easiest way to make a baby cry
is give a lollipop and then take it away
and so even though they might not even
even if they might not have wanted a
lollipop I don't think lollipops are

[48:00]
lollipop I don't think lollipops are
that great for babies right um they've
gotten used to it it's sweet and now
you've given a taste for something that
they're going to not be experiencing for
a while and that's really the guy's
fault because he's trained the woman to
expect that kind of behavior and
treatment over those years and I say it
always gets worse before it gets better
because you have to deal with the
extinction bursts that come when you try
to modify behavior and a pre-existing
Dynamic 8020 I think is probably
generous we could keep evolving the
numbers almost always easier to just do
the right thing from the beginning and
to try to fix something I I I I agree
but how many of us know to do that you
know I I I joke that no I don't joke I
tell the truth I had a PhD in marriage
and family therapy at 29 years old and I
bumbled my way through my three
marriages and you know what I think most
of us are gonna we're gonna Bumble our
way through life uh I I think that's
what happens now hopefully we we can get
some good guides some good mentors some

[49:00]
some good guides some good mentors some
good initiation some good instruction um
but again kind of going back to you know
there's so much unhelpful stuff out
there available now is that men often
don't know what to pick like it's it you
know can H H how how do I make you know
Dr Glover John gotman and red pill all
fit together and and you know guys are
trying to do that so they don't know
what's the good information and and
usually the most prominent information
is the one that uh applies to appeals to
their most base easy how's what's the
easiest way to make this happen
nature I hear that and I I believe that
all those click baity programs that you
mentioned earlier exist because they
work people are buying them not
necessarily because they work but
because people are buying them they work
they work because they sell product
that's what I mean they work I see okay
for me personally I've never I've never
used one of those I've never gone down
that funnel but I think for me what was
the source of the greatest
misunderstanding about women when I was
younger was just the mass media and the

[50:01]
younger was just the mass media and the
culture uh movies pop songs of
literature there's this great play I
don't know if you read a lot of drama
but it's called boy gets Girl by Rebecca
Gilman she's a very talented playwright
have you heard of this Robert I'm not um
it's an interesting kind of a thriller
because what happens is that there's a
guy who is trying to court woman and he
be he basically starts to act like the
men in romantic comedies do and he like
buys Billboards to declare his love and
shows up with the speaker underneath
them and like people don't know what to
do with him it eventually turns he
starts to like follow her around and and
stalk her a little bit and so it starts
to go into a dark place but the the core
premise of the book is he's doing what
Society is telling him men are supposed
to do to get the woman right and let me
tell you that [ __ ] does not
work why do we keep telling

[51:00]
work why do we keep telling
men well to do that [ __ ] you know
because it sells it sells you know the
women buy the romantic comedies you know
they do do do they really want the guy
standing out under the window with the
speaker blasting your eyes but you know
well how does that work how do they they
buy the fantasy but they don't want it
in reality that's
interesting how much have you hung
around
women fair enough yeah you know when
they're watching all those daytime
dramas and they're watching all the
nighttime dramas you know and they're
written you know they're W watching um
um gry's Anatomy that's just the dumbest
ass show I've ever seen in my life you
know Kardashians just the dumbest ass
show and and women flock to that they're
not seeking out reality but even think
about it when we watch Adventure flicks
you know whether it's you know Tom Cruz
or Sly or you know Ben diesel are we
looking for reality no we're looking for
for entertainment and Escape But but so
when we start mistaking entertainment

[52:01]
when we start mistaking entertainment
and Escape for reality that's when we're
going to start having problems well what
do you think about this I I made an
episode a long time ago called the part
that women always leave out because if
you ask a woman what she's looking for
in a man you'll hear things like oh I
want somebody who's kind or I want
somebody who is uh you know great with
kids I want somebody who respects me and
a lot of guys are thinking oh okay well
I can I can do those things why am I not
having the success that I would like
with women and I think it's because the
part that women always leave out is they
want those things but they want them
from the men they're already attracted
to yeah and so that's the key it's not
like being those things make a woman
attracted to you she just wants those
traits in the men that she's attracted
to and so that's the part that men need
hear well you you've probably even seen
the studies that say you know women will
be married to that guy that's stable and
you know increase a household and then
when they're ovulating they're attracted
to something totally different oh yeah

[53:00]
to something totally different oh yeah
and I I I I I can't I can't bring this
up as an accurate statistic but I re I
recall reading before that
statistically
30% of children in monogamous intact
marriages 30% of the kids are not
biologically the husband of the woman I
heard 10% 30% is really high but okay
well
split the split the difference right it
and and and what's that saying is that
yeah again I said earlier you know women
can be attracted to drug dealers to guys
in prison the they what the women don't
tell well let's even back this further
up some some really cool research that
that uh I I came across a while ago is a
university of uh is in Canada it's a
Canadian study where they studied a lot
of people around sexual arousal and they
hooked up men and women you know of of
all sexual orientations hooked the man
the man up to measure engorgement in his

[54:01]
the man up to measure engorgement in his
genitals and the women as well and and
they gave them a button and then they
showed them videos okay and the the the
men were really believe it or not very
whitebred uh and very predictable and
what but what they both physiologically
responded to and and what they pushed
the button basically heterosexual guys
were attracted to heterosexual sex with
some threesoms thrown in they were
conscious of their arousal that's kind
of your point they they were conscious
of their arousal had gay men were
attracted you know gay sex what what
what got reported in all the media was
the part of the study that that had
women had surprisingly this really wide
variety uh response to sexual fantasy or
you know whether it was you know men of
the opposite sex female sex sex with
gorillas you know there it it was at all
the extremes that the women were having
a response to and that's what the media

[55:00]
a response to and that's what the media
reported on I went and found the
original study because I'm that kind of
person I want to say well really what
was
here there was another
significantly um statistically
significant finding that none of the
popular media reported and there was a
significantly St statistical significant
difference between what the woman's body
was responding to and what her finger
pushed yeah with men there wasn't we
we're we're pretty predictable with the
women their body was turned on by one
thing but they didn't push the button or
they pushed the button in said they're
turned on by their but but their body
wasn't and in that I tell men don't
listen to what women tell you of what
they want and what they're attracted to
so when they say I want a nice guy part
of the Month part of them really does
believe that another part of the month
is oh I just got to get [ __ ] by you
know it's it's and I'm making maybe an
exaggeration but maybe not that far okay
so don't buy into what your sister tells

[56:00]
so don't buy into what your sister tells
you they want what your mother says
women want what even you know the nice
girls that you're seeking the approval
from don't buy into what they tell you
that they want watch what they do watch
and and unfortunately that's when men go
to that point of well they're just
attracted to like the alpha males and
the bad boys because again we just get
that Funnel Vision they like bad boys
though that's I'm not but when the when
the men go well they're only attracted
no that's not true and I could tell guys
you can actually be a decent guy a
decent human being and still create Bad
Boy energy attraction in women and and
it can be pretty simple you know not be
too available right not giving them
gifts asking them to do something for
you they're just little tricks that
create that same kind of energy that the
Bad Boys create without you having to be
an [ __ ] okay that's interesting
because I've shared similar tips on my
channel and often the push it's
generally well received but probably the

[57:01]
generally well received but probably the
most common push back is something on
the lines of oh Orion you know
you've you've made it this is
manipulative shouldn't I just be myself
like why do I have to play these games
in order to keep a woman interested in
me what would you say to that I'm saying
what that guy is really saying is he
doesn't want to put any work into
getting what he says he wants he's just
as deceitful as the woman who says I
want a nice guy he says I want a woman
but don't ask me to really work on
myself or actually work at doing things
that actually makes me attractive to
women I really just want to play video
games and surf the Internet and jack off
to porn please don't ask me to actually
work on
myself that's what I would say to that
again guys say they want a lot of stuff
just like women women say they want a
lot of stuff wanting is free it costs
nothing to want here you

[58:00]
nothing to want here you
go so you know and and then guys you
know then I'll get the other thing from
guys they'll say okay Robert here's a
contradiction you say you know work on
these things in you and they will make
you attractive then they'll go that's a
contradiction because now it sounds like
you're trying to do things to get women
to be attracted to you and okay let's
take a breath here there are side
effects of working on you positive side
effects if you work on you because you
want to live your best life you want to
get out of your comfort zone you want to
live at your Edge you want to level up
to the best version of you you want your
best life you want Adventure you want
opportunity you want fun if you do the
things that that that that require focus
and effort and discipline and
consistency to do those things I found
there's this side effect over here that
that all of a sudden you notice a lot of
women are checking you out a lot of
women are sending you those indicators

[59:00]
women are sending you those indicators
of interest that all the gurus out there
get so wrong oh she's twirling her hair
that's no it's not that's an indicator
of a stupid woman stupid women twirl
their hair that's not an indicator of oh
she crossed her ankles oh give me a
break come on no when when they lean
over and give you a cleavage shot
there's an indicator of interest and
they walk in front of you three times
for no reason that's an indicator of
interest when they touch your arm when
they laugh at your dumb chokes those are
indicators of interest when they my wife
taught me this one when they jut a hip
that's primate Behavior primates jut
their hips to show they're ready they're
receptive for for for sexual intercourse
we're [ __ ] primates but but but we
think that oh you know whatever we think
that women are or aren't we ignore their
actual indicators of interest because
either we think they want they're not
sending that to me or I'm not I'm not
Alpha enough for them to want me but
they are that and that's what when when
I got really successful at getting with

[1:00:02]
I got really successful at getting with
women is because I started actually
understanding their indicators of
interest and it isn't what all the
pickup dudes teach you I'm not watching
are their eyes constricting or dilating
or not that's too much work but when I
actually worked at me getting out of my
house being a social animal overcoming
you know my social anxieties and disc
Comfort talking to people being bold
being brave being funny not holding back
you know living life on my terms saying
come on let's go do this when I started
being that all of a sudden a lot of
women were choosing me and I thought wow
this is this is really pretty
interesting I didn't have to do anything
to try to get them to like me I was just
out having a good time on my own and all
of a sudden they're paying
attention do you
think well you wrote noer Mr Nice Guy 20
years ago you said yeah long before I
knew any of the stuff you and I are
talking about what was the trajectory

[1:01:01]
talking about what was the trajectory
there
like did you experience some that was
even before not before the entire
internet but before the internet kind of
as we know it did you experience some
Fame as a consequence of that
book um not not early on I I I I maybe
just coming into my fame perhaps well
deserved you know you think you think
that has something to do with it with
what the the effortlessness with which
you attract women these days when in
when I was dating well yeah noways um I
I I don't know all my my my wife points
out all the women who I seem to be
attracting nowadays um I I I actually am
not interested in and not paying all
that much attention till you know she
gets mad at me and says that woman was
flirting with you and I go that's my
fault how you have a man that women want
you know you're not complaining about
that are you
um I don't actually respond exactly like
that but that's the you know bottom line
no when I like say when I was in my late

[1:02:00]
no when I like say when I was in my late
40s and 50s and started having this kind
of success um I'd gotten out of a a a
long bad marriage I I hadn't been sexual
for very long uh very much for very long
I was actually coming off
anti-depressants that it kind of killed
sex drive inter erections I I I went
through a
bankruptcy um I was driving a subar only
it's only gonna get up from there
get better and in spite of all of that
you know I was out in public I was
having a good time I was going to listen
to live jazz I was eating in happy hour
hours at at at restaurant bars I was
talking to the people around me I still
know bartenders that I met 20 years ago
and got to know them by name and you
know even getting to know bartenders you
know good stuff happens they bring you
drinks and stuff they pour that you know
the person didn't want bartenders is fun
too I I I was gonna say I've never dated
a bartender but oh they're dangerous I I

[1:03:01]
a bartender but oh they're dangerous I I
think I have oh yeah there a reason
there's bartenders um but that kind of
you know I'm not so much engaged in that
kind of behavior anymore you know I'm
kind of more of a homebody I'm home you
know working on my stuff working with
guys um taking the dog for a walk stuff
like that but when I was going when I
was having that Heyday of my integrated
Manor
phase I did not you know I was even I'd
even gotten kind of I was you know a
little bit overweight
and there was nothing out of the
ordinary special about me and I was
still having women you know hit on me
proposition me get naked on first dates
and you know I I I tell the story I told
this one in a while I had sex with four
different women in one weekend all of
them knew I wasn't exclusively having
sex with where were you when when this
happened in the
world where was like what what state did
I live in or yeah or what country uh I
was in uh Belleview Washington actually
no kidding wow Washington can you can

[1:04:00]
no kidding wow Washington can you can
you please define this term for me that
you've used a couple times the
integrated Manor phase can can you tell
me a little bit about that you know what
is it's quite simply I've already given
you the core components is that I made
the decision to say yes to every sexual
opportunity that presented itself even
if she wasn't a 10 even if she was you
know I [ __ ] a few fatties uh I quickly
that's the wh part so what's the
integrated Manor part is that I was very
conscious about it um practice safe sex
I let the women know this was not the
beginning of a relationship I see the
women know that you know if if you meet
them somewhere and they go home with you
they know that's not the beginning of a
good Rel they know they want to get
[ __ ] and you do too so I was very
conscious and integrated very truthful I
mentioned earlier I also learned to end
those relationships in a timely way and
not let them go on to where they became
uh disruptive or ugly uh because the

[1:05:02]
uh disruptive or ugly uh because the
woman was starting to want something
that I didn't uh so I was very conscious
about it so integrated mean I was
telling the truth I was paying attention
I was acting very lovingly and
openhearted to the women one of the
those one of the things I know the women
liked is that when they were with me I
treated them like you know they were the
only woman on the planet you know I
treated them like like they were they
were a prince and a porn star all at the
same time and
and a quick story I when I met my wife
down here in Mexico like I said she she
asked me if I wanted a massage and we
started dating for our first year of
dating she just came to my apartment
every Saturday night and we had sex and
and you know that's it worked for both
of us that's all we really wanted I
remember one time fairly early on we're
having sex and it was just wild and
crazy good stuff and you know again not
holding back I I told her in Spanish
Twitter muta meana you're my Mexican
[ __ ] as soon as the words came out of

[1:06:02]
[ __ ] as soon as the words came out of
my mouth I thought this could go really
wrong this could go very s very sore um
and she got more excited more turned on
I thought you know here's this
patriarchal white dude in Mexico [ __ ]
this poor Mexican woman and saying
you're my Mexican [ __ ] and she told me
later I don't remember if it was like
that night or soon after you know cuz we
we'd already kind of we I I like
nicknames I like giving women nicknames
and a lot of women seem to like you know
that playful nickname stuff she told me
that's my favorite nickname if when you
call me T meana she she to this day you
know if I tell her oh you're looking
really paa today you know you know she
that's her greatest compliment you if I
say you look really nice you know it's
kind of like oh I'm boring oh baby nowas
means ass
fans they made us man yeah you're
looking really really hor I I love it

[1:07:00]
looking really really hor I I love it
that's amazing for her for her that's a
turn on now guys don't go do that with
every woman you meet thinking it worked
for Dr Glover and his Mexican wife um
don't don't be black and white thinking
just plug that in but but kind of going
back to the point it was just me not
holding anything back and like the whole
time that my then girlfriend you know
were're seeing each other she just knew
the whole situation we're seeing each
other once a month for having SE or once
a week for having sex there was no more
you know oh is is this not that you know
there wasn't anything more to it it was
just real clear very conscious very
integrated well I think that's because
everything that you say and do gets
filtered through a woman's attraction so
if she likes you and her attraction is
very high you could say something
completely nonsensical and she'd think
you're just being silly and that's one
of your best qualities and if she's not
she's going to think that you had an
aneurysm and you need to go to hospital
so you know what really matters is how
she feels about you and she's kind of
already made a decision about how she
feels about you in advance of really

[1:08:02]
feels about you in advance of really
much of anything usually you know I
think we've seen those statistics too
that probably what they say in the first
three seconds a woman knows if there's a
possibility she might sleep with you and
then while we guys are spending three
months you know doing the nice guy
seduction they decided in the first
three seconds they're not getting naked
with us right again the mistakes that
that that men made so I tell guys and
again guys could probably Mis misspend
this one as well if a woman is into you
you almost can't [ __ ] that up and if
she's not into you there's almost
nothing you can do to to to switch that
around either that's just reality and
like you say you know I call her Mexican
whor like that that was a plus right
there's that wasn't going to [ __ ] it up
because she was IND me yeah a woman
who's 10 out of 10 attracted to a guy
will do scary things she will hide the
body she will lie to the C you're
talking about my wife you're talking
about my wife she she she's she's scary
fun that's great Robert we're coming up

[1:09:01]
fun that's great Robert we're coming up
on time I'd like to know a little bit
more about
your is it fair to say
community community that's what we call
it I I jokingly playfully call it the
Glover Hood um yeah integration nation
is is am men's program that I launched
in July of
20123 um I I'm just a big believer men
need Community we need tribe my most
significant growth processes have
happened when I was in community once
kind of early on in my 30s about five
six years in a men's group and then even
just recently about a year into my
marriage with my wife I realized I
needed Community I needed men sure down
in Mexico having to speak Spanish um and
so I I went looking and I found a men's
program that been in for the last six
years I'm now surrounded with men I've
got calls I have every week with guys
that I know and so I'm a big believer in
community and so you know somebody
mentioned to me you know uh a couple
years ago Robert you should start you
know a men's membership program and you

[1:10:02]
know a men's membership program and you
know make your your product available
all your content and so that's what
we've been working on we're still work
in process we still a way to go but in
July 23 we launched the community part
of integration nation and um you know we
have up to nine um virtual calls a week
that guys can jump on every Thursday
including today in about two hours uh no
less than an hour and a half I'll be on
a community call for integration Nation
I'll teach a lesson today tonight's
lesson will be about how to get your
needs met how how to get your needs met
without being needy right um nine calls
a week that's a lot I I I'm doing one of
them uh and I've certified coaches that
that lead seven others and we have a
couple you know webinars we do a couple
months so up to nine calls a week uh we
have a timeline for guys can communicate
with each other we have some other
challenges that we'll offer we're about
to start uh inperson meetups around the

[1:11:00]
to start uh inperson meetups around the
world just casual get togethers for guys
uh we're about to start some peer-led
support groups as part of the program
and this is just the basic part we're
going to launch more uh later this year
um so you know I'm just a big fan you
know
guys you know wherever we're struggling
in life I tend to say is probably due to
a lack of good men and I think almost
anything that's not working well in our
life if we go get connected well with
men those things will start changing uh
how they look how they working I can
certainly Echo what you said about how
men need male community and tribe I
presented at a Men's Conference a few
weekends ago it was in a big room I
think there was about a hundred people
in it and I and they were all men and I
could not remember the last time I had
been in a room that size without a
single woman in it it was shocking um
and it felt so like safe and relaxing

[1:12:03]
and it felt so like safe and relaxing
it's not like when there were no women
around we were just saying ah these
women blah blah blah blah but it was we
could talk directly I don't think
anybody was afraid that our we were
going to be misinterpreted right it it
was wonderful and I I didn't know how
much that meant to me until I was in
that I didn't know it's like missing the
sound of water when you've lived in the
desert your whole life what a great way
to put it wow we we need it and you know
our ancestors had it
and you don't know how bad you need it
to like you know I'll do a weekend
Workshop here you know in my home and
you know I have eight guys here and you
know they're all strangers when they
start out on Friday Night by Sunday
they're like they've been frat brothers
you know for 20 years they care about
each other they're they're getting on on
Zoom with each other ongoing and and we
just need it and again I love how you
put it you we don't know how bad we need

[1:13:01]
put it you we don't know how bad we need
it till we discover it and that was true
for me you know most nice guys I work
with most men say I'm more comfortable
around around women well because we get
validation from them um but again I I'll
say I think the masculine is a source of
love if you want to really feel love you
connect with your masculine self and you
connect with men and then we can be love
we can overflow love into the world so
yeah I'm a I'm a big fan of that so
integration Nation if you you guys want
to check it out integration nation.net
um just go sign up we'll send you an
invitation and you know come check out
the community we're building I said it's
still a work in process okay so we have
the community we have the book No More
Mr Nice Guy there's a couple of other
books that you've written as well I'm
sure they can all be found at Amazon be
Amazon the most recent one I co-wrote
called the big stick
uh Tony endelman one of my certified Co
this is that's a it's a big book and you
know he ended up calling it the big

[1:14:00]
know he ended up calling it the big
stick because I do say that a lot
because you know with guys you can take
out the big stick it's uh what's the
right word not condensation but it's
it's it's a he's taken everything I've
taught in my courses my podcast
distillation maybe there distillation
great word I'll have to write that one
down and use it again it's it covers you
know pretty much the the the whole
of what I've been teaching for about 30
years so oh nice all in one place all in
one place I'll have to check that out
any last words Robert oh thank you this
was fun I I I I liked a little bit of
push and pull between the two of you you
know lot of times in interviews you know
the interviewer would just tee up a lot
of softballs um I I could always tell
when you're going I agree but I kind of
don't and I I I enjoyed that thank you
people want to see you shine so it makes
sense but yeah I think we have more
interesting discussion if we can find
points of contrast that we can work
towards some sort of synthesis well and
even some things maybe we don't agree on

[1:15:00]
even some things maybe we don't agree on
then we might kind of actually we we
both might you know I never looked at it
that way I I love learning me too Robert
this was great man thanks so much for
accepting my invitation it was good to
meet you I hope we can stay in touch
socially and uh we'll call that a wrap I
would welcome it thank
you
