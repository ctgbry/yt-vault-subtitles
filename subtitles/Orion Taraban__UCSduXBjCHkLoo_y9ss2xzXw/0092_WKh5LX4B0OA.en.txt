i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
holiday safety planning
the holidays are upon us my friends
for many this is a restful and enjoyable
time when we can spend precious moments
with loved ones and family
for others it's a landmine of conflict
and despair
this episode is for those in the second
category
in the years i spent in outpatient
addiction i learned the importance of
holiday safety planning and that's
exactly what we're going to do here
today
there's a number of things that you can
do to keep yourself emotionally safe
when you're in the belly of the beast
first and foremost it's important to
remember that you can absolutely choose
not to spend the holidays with your
family
yes this might ruffle some feathers but
might those feathers be ruffled
regardless
yes they might not understand but how
often do they understand you anyway

[01:01]
often do they understand you anyway
so if you feel like it's just not worth
it if you feel like you might not be
able to keep your cool
or if you feel like you just have better
things to do than suffer undue criticism
and abuse
do everyone a favor and make other plans
give them the gift of missing you for
christmas and maybe things will be
different in the future
you have
no obligation to spend time with people
who devalue
or disrespect you
even if or especially if they are family
super important to keep in mind
now
if you do choose to spend time with your
family the very best thing you can do
for yourself is to secure your own
transportation
rent a car
or at least have money for cab fare i
understand this is an additional expense
but not having to rely on someone else
to take you out of a nasty situation if
things go sideways is well worth the

[02:00]
things go sideways is well worth the
cost it gives you freedom and an
emergency exit
you might also consider getting your own
place to stay
this might feel strange to some folks
but then again
so might feeling like you're trapped for
a week in your childhood bedroom
let's be honest
that's not really a place for adults
if you're an adult you can secure adult
accommodations for yourself
this will also give you some place to go
if things get heated again have an exit
strategy
at minimum this means a place to go and
a way to get there
yes this can be expensive but so are
emergency therapy sessions
next you might consider reducing the
duration of your trip
just because you have a week off doesn't
mean you have to spend all that time
with mom and uncle jeff
that's a vacation you might need a
vacation from
spending a couple days with family is
perfectly acceptable you could even just
show up for christmas dinner and leave
after dessert after all it's your
holiday too

[03:01]
holiday too
there's no need to surrender all your
time to appease guilt-tripping relatives
and finally
i would strongly encourage you to
lay off the booze
alcohol is almost always involved in big
family blowups
i understand that folks can reach for
the bottle in order to make spending
time with family more tolerable
but it's a risky strategy if things get
bad they're more likely to get real bad
if alcohol is involved remember
no one's ever proud that they drain too
much
so to recap get your own transportation
secure your own lodgings reduce the
duration of your trip and lay off the
booze
good luck out there
