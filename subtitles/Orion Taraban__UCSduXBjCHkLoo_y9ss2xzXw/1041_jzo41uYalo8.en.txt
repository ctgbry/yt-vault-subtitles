Guys, if you really want to go in the
direction of the ring, I'm not going to
stop you. But I am going to ask you to
consider that the ring is really a
symbol. Namely, it's a symbol of a
relationship that actually works. A ring
is circular, that is, it's whole and
intact. And a ring is gold, that is,
it's enduringly valuable. A ring does
not make a relationship whole or intact
or enduringly valuable. It's just a
piece of jewelry. But a ring can be an
acknowledgment of a relationship that is
already whole and intact and enduringly
valuable. And if you give a ring to a
woman if and only if your relationship
satisfies those conditions, then it will
be much less likely that you will find
yourself in a position to have your gift
returned further down the road. It's the
relationship that makes the ring secure.
It's not the other way
