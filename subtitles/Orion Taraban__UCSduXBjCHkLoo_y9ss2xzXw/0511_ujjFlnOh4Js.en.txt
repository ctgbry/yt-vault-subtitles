I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is I don't
play
games so this is a statement that I've
heard many many times over the course of
my dating history and it's my
understanding that it almost always
comes from the woman because it almost
always precedes some kind of request it
usually goes like this hey I know what I
want and I don't play games I'm looking
for committed relation ship if you are
not prepared to give me what I want then
please do not waste my time I've got no
time for games sound
familiar now I can appreciate where this
is coming from the women who do this
generally believe that by doing so they
are dating intentionally and just for
the record there is no problem with
dating intentionally it's a good
strategy for a lot of women the problem
is going about dating intentionally so
stupidly and inelegantly that it's

[01:00]
stupidly and inelegantly that it's
functionally impossible to generate the
desired result women telling a man that
you want a relationship and you don't
want to play games works just as well as
a man telling you that he just wants to
[ __ ] you casually and he doesn't want to
play games like those two statements are
gendered equivalents of each other
though to be fair the man's desire is
much less expensive to satisfy than the
woman's is men learn from a very young
age that that doesn't work which is why
men lie to you enough of you didn't give
them what they wanted when they told you
the truth by the same token men
especially men that you have no
emotional buyin with are not just going
to give you what you want if you ask for
it like that and this is not only
because you're asking for something
extremely valuable we're not inclined to
give this to you because on some level

[02:01]
give this to you because on some level
we know that I don't play games is
[ __ ] to demonstrate why this is
[ __ ] allow me to tell you how I
would normally handle this situation
when a woman would tell me hey I'm
looking for a serious relationship and I
don't want to play games my general
response was something like thank God I
am so glad you said that personally I am
done with dating I am ready to go down
to the courthouse tonight for the right
woman so tell me what's your
offer and without fail this question
would always be met with complete and
utter
incomprehension what do you mean what's
my
offer and I would
explain Oh I thought you just wanted to
get down to it I get that you want a
serious relationship you were very
explicit message received so what I want
to know is what do I get in

[03:02]
to know is what do I get in
return like what would I specifically
get for giving you what you specifically
want and I have to say I find it really
hot that you're willing to dispense with
all the foreplay and pretense and just
tell me what I have to gain from this
transaction like I am tired of the games
too
so and I'm sure you can all guess how
well that went over not once not once
have I ever received answer to that
question not a single woman told me well
I cook I clean I'm rich and I'm willing
to share I'm super sexual I'm kind and
supportive I'm a great conversationalist
I'm laidback and open to unconventional
relationships I'll raise your children I
have 20 goats and 16 heads of cattle
nothing nada I have never received an
honest straightforward answer to an
honest straightforward question the only
response I've ever received is angry
indignation how rude rude is that what

[04:01]
indignation how rude rude is that what
you think of women good luck to you
buddy and of course there is no great
loss to me when that happens now before

you've received from this message it's

happen I don't do corporate sponsorships
or product placements so this helps to
keep the lights on I really appreciate
it
women what you have to understand is
that dating is sort of like buying a car
when you walk into a dealership and you
say hey I want to buy a car what is the
very next thing the salesman is going to
say I bet you a nickel the very next
thing that that salesman is going to say
is great what's your
budget and that's because what's your
budget is the polite way of asking how
much are you willing to give me and he

[05:03]
much are you willing to give me and he
wants to know that as soon as possible
because the answer to that question is
going to significantly influence what's
on offer you're not going to be showing
the Lamborghini if you have a Honda
budget and becoming indignant at the
salesman because he's wondering what
he's going to get out of the transaction
certainly isn't going to help you drive
off in a car but you know what will help
you though showing up with
money you show up with enough money
and you can buy a car in 30 seconds no
games necessary hello I want this car
can you pay the listed
price yes please sign here boom you now
have a car if you're clear and explicit
about the value proposition there is no
need to play games however if you are
not clear and explicit about the value
proposition or if you can't afford the
listed price the only way way you can

[06:00]
listed price the only way way you can
get what you want is by playing games so
ladies if you're going to take the brass
tax approach to dating I would recommend
giving some very serious thought to how
you would answer my question what would
the guy get in return and then ask
yourself if that's a fair trade if not I
would encourage you to go back to
playing games you'll probably have more
luck that way the fact of the matter is
that anyone who says that they don't
play games is lying to you I don't play
G games doesn't mean I don't play games
it means hurry up and give me what I
want see for yourself anyone who
actually doesn't play games would be
thrilled to demonstrate the value they
could provide they'd be proud to tell
you the guy who walks into a dealership
with a suitcase full of cash is proud to
be carrying a suitcase full of cash a
person who says I don't play games is
hoping that somehow you'd be foolish
enough to believe that at face value and

[07:01]
enough to believe that at face value and
not play games with them it's a strategy
designed to divest you of your
strategies which is part of the game
however in the absence of game there is
only explicit negotiation and let me
tell you explicit negotiation isn't free
of games either it's just a different
kind of game people don't get what they
deserve they get what they negotiate
right so even
negotiation has game playing and in the
absence of explicit negotiation it's
nothing but game playing this is going
to sound
depressing but the only way people
really get what they want in romantic
relationships is by playing games I mean
they literally call Men's ability to get
sex from women
game and as I discussed in a recent
episode women need game too and they
need game to get a committed
relationship if you were to strip away
all of the games all that would remain
would be the negotiation of an explicit

[08:01]
would be the negotiation of an explicit
value proposition which is precisely
what happens in arranged marriages it
would feel like a business deal which is
probably not inaccurate most people
especially most women don't want their
relationships to feel that way they want
them to feel organic and emotional and
non-transactional people want to feel
like their partners are giving them what
they want because they want to do it not
because of what they're getting in
return right I want you to want me
right so make the proposition too
explicit and it not only breaks the
magic spell it might also highlight a
pretty large value discrepancy between
the two parties again I don't play games
is a lie and you should be very cautious
about moving forward with anybody who
has the audacity to claim that they
don't what do you think does this fit
