The problem with dating in relationship
is that for a while there is this really
bad hobson's choice. So for example,
this hypothetical woman who's attracted
to these manipulative men, she might
feel that desire for a particular
individual and say, "No, I'm in healing.
I'm in recovery. I'm going to resist
that emotional impulse. I'm going to
date that good, loving, nice guy over
there." And she's going to say that, you
know, he's a great man on paper. He
treats me really well, but I feel
nothing for him. And so for a while
she's going to believe that the choice
is between let's say a dysfunctional
exploitative relationship that she
actually feels something for. She feels
alive. She feels that love and
attraction or somebody who's very good
on paper that she's just bored and
disinterested by. And until the
programming is sufficiently healed um
that's going to be the experience. I do
think that it's possible to change
authentic desire to an extent, but that
it can take years. And it generally does
require kind of dating the boring person
for a while, resisting the impulse to
get involved with the wrong person, and

get involved with the wrong person, and
to continue to like understand where
some of these emotions are coming Trump.
