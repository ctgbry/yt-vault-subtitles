on my episode ladies find your Dark
Horse Shania simsil comments bad advice
every man has potential but not every
man reaches his potential well you're
half right
um you're wrong about it being bad
advice but you are right about the fact
that every man has potential my dad used
to tell me that potential is like sand
it's extremely common element and that
you shouldn't make decisions about
entering into long-term relationships or
marriage based on the perception of
another person's potential absolutely
because in the vast majority of cases
that potential goes unrealized however
what I did say in the video is that it's
not enough to have potential a dark
horse has a plan and is actively working
to achieve that plan so it's not just
somebody who has a dream it's somebody
who has the skills and the effort and
the will to put it into practice so if
you're gonna make a comment you actually
have to watch the entire video that
you're commenting on okay
