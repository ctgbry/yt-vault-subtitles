I believe that love is a spiritual Force
therefore to gain greater insight into
what love might be I try to observe the
relationship that I can perceive between
God and the created Universe this is
because assuming that God is
omnibenevolent that is all good then and
all loving then we can see attributes of
that love in the relationship between
God and the created universe
and when I look at the universe from
that perspective I see that love
seems very different than our everyday
casual understanding of the term it's
not so warm and fuzzy it's not so
insipid and
um affectionate
and so I was inspired to create a new
series called neglected kinds of Love on
