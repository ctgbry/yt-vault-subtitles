I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why women
pick fights so this can be an
exasperating phenomenon for a lot of the
men out there especially those in
relationships why is it that your woman
seems to create unnecessary difficulties
why does she pick fights over small and
insignificant things well I'm here to
explain to you why that might be the
case the key to understanding this
phenomen on is appreciating that emotion
is
reinforcing I didn't say positive
emotion was reinforcing I said emotion
was reinforcing emotion of all kinds is
reinforcing to women you see this kind
of response in children as well for
example most children would rather
experience negative attention than no
attention at all and this is what in
part creates class clowns in grade
school or rebellious teenagers and

[01:00]
school or rebellious teenagers and
Adolescence they would rather experience
a parents annoyance or judgment or anger
or even rejection than being
functionally invisible to them so
emotion is reinforcing that is it's
rewarding with that in mind we can also
appreciate the truth of the converse if
all emotion is reinforcing then it's not
negative emotion that is punishing it's
the absence of emotion that is punishing
indeed one of the most difficult things
for a woman to tolerate in a
relationship is the absence of
emotion the absence of emotion is
experienced by most women as punitive as
punishing this is why if you ever want a
certain Behavior to disappear it's
better to respond with a neutral
non-reinforcing reaction than to respond
with anger or frustration the more
unemotional the response the less likely
the eliciting behavior will be repeated

[02:00]
the eliciting behavior will be repeated
in the future and this is because the
absence of emotion is punishing and this
is where a lot of guys get into trouble
because men in part due to their
temperament and in part due to
socialization are generally not very
emotionally expressive what's more a man
isn't always prepared to engage with a
woman more or less on demand sometimes
he's tired sometimes he's preoccupied
sometimes he just wants to be left alone
in fact there seem to be some important
gender differences in how men and women
tend to respond to emotional stressors
whereas women generally prefer to talk
things out in order to feel better men
often prefer to like withdraw into the
Batcave to solve the problem men like to
go inside to isolate to incubate and to
resolve the problem internally before
emerging with a solution or at least a
plan of action of course it would be
very helpful for women to understand

[03:00]
very helpful for women to understand
that when men are disinterested in
interacting with them it doesn't
necessarily mean that they have a
problem with them they just have a
problem it's occupying their attention
and they don't want to cope with the
problem in the same way that women do
and indeed it is probably in everyone's
best interests if the man and the woman
can gently avoid each other for a while
while the man goes through his process
unfortunately many women push harder for
connection at these times mostly because
they are treating their men the way that
they would like to be treated if they
were in the same situation and this
typically creates an escalating crisis
because when a woman attempts to
interact with a man in this state she is
met with a relative absence of emotion
as the man has begun to withdraw within
himself and this withdraw will typically
be experienced by the woman as punishing
especially if she tends to be more
anxious or

[04:01]
anxious or
insecure she might begin to worry that
something is wrong and now the man has a
new problem on his hands that he didn't
have

you now when people are insecure or
anxious they tend to seek reassurance
that everything is okay and one of the
ways that women can seek reassurance in
relationships is by picking
fights I understand that from a
masculine perspective this sounds
ridiculous but there is actually some
validity to this perspective namely an

[05:02]
validity to this perspective namely an
angry response reassures that you still
care allow me to explain back in the day
I got into a lot of trouble when I was a
kid sometimes when I came home after
getting up to no good my dad would yell
and scream and send me to my room and
take away my privileges and so on and
it's like that sucked and my dad wasn't
my favorite person in those moments
however once or twice I came home and
told him what I got up to and brace
myself from the
worst and nothing
happened he just kind of sat there quiet
and
exhausted and I asked him well aren't
she going to punish me and he just said
no and turned
away and let me tell you that's when I
got really nervous like I got scared
that I had crossed the line once in for
all and I was going to be put up for

[06:00]
all and I was going to be put up for
adoption do you understand my father's
anger wasn't nearly as distressing as
his lack of anger because when people
can no longer be bothered to get angry
you can be fairly certain that the
relationship is on its last legs so if
you're concerned that someone might be
pulling away or someone might be looking
for the door one way to potentially seek
reassurance of their continued
commitment is to provoke their anger
because in a way you demonstrate that
the other is still invested enough to
respond emotionally on the other hand if
you were to respond to these
provocations with boredom or
indifference then her anxiety is likely
going to go through the
roof and this explains the otherwise
puzzling phenomenon that when a woman is
out of sorts picks a fight with you and
actually succeeds in making you
angry she feels
better I know every man out there has

[07:00]
better I know every man out there has
experienced this she feels better as
soon as your woman succeeds in making
you angry it's like all of her own
anxiety and uncertainty just evaporates
allowing her to go on her Merry way and
since it generally takes men longer to
return to emotional Baseline than women
this leads to the psychotic experience
of dealing with someone who just an hour
ago was spiteful and aggressive and who
is now sweet and playful and acting like
nothing happened this happens because
your anger reassured her which allowed
her to move past her anxiety and
insecurity now do women do this
consciously and intentionally I'm sure
that some of them do however I'm also
sure that most of them don't and that's
because most people are not conscious
and intentional so if it's true of
people it's going to be true of women
that might not make the phenomenon any
easier to navigate though it could
potentially help you men respond

[08:00]
potentially help you men respond
effectively if you believe that your
woman isn't acting out of any particular
malice though of course there are
malicious women in the world but it's
better to start by giving her the
benefit of the doubt and escalating
appropriately than to proceed in the
opposite direction in a future episode
I'll discuss how to never fight with a
woman however this is enough for today
