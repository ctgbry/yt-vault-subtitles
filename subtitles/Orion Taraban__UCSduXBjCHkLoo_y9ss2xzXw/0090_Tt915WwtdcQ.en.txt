i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
offense is taken
not given
the true statement is actually supported
by our idiom concerning offense namely i
take offense at that sir
it's not so much that the other person
is giving it as it is that we choose to
take it in that way
and here's how we know this is true
if you've ever had the displeasure of
actually having an enemy that is someone
who is openly and unapologetically
antagonistic toward you someone who is
often trying to provoke you with their
language
you know that you have some measure of
control over whether or not they are
successful
for example if you can't avoid
interacting with such a person you may
choose to give yourself a pep talk
beforehand reminding yourself to not
take their provocations personally you
don't want to give them the pleasure
such individuals may be unabashedly

[01:00]
such individuals may be unabashedly
trying to give offense
but if you enter into such an
interaction mindfully you can guard
yourself against taking it
and if you succeed in not taking it you
don't get offended
it's actually not possible for those who
intend offense to give offense
without the complicit ascent of the
offended party
and in point of fact i found that the
vast majority of offense taking occurs
not with those who intend to give it
our enemies but with those who don't
in most cases people aren't actively
trying to provoke us to give offense
however it can be taken nonetheless
this is important because if we can
understand that taking offense requires
our complicity then we enjoy some
measure of control over it
offensiveness is a judgment that we
conflate with certain verbal behavior
and that judgment not the behavior and
certainly not the intention behind the

[02:00]
certainly not the intention behind the
behavior
is primarily responsible for our taking
offense
if we remove the judgment of
offensiveness then no offense can be
taken it's just a non-starter
and this helps us remain equilibrated
and the guardians of our own emotional
states
something to consider
