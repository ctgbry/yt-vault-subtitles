some of these creators especially the
men who do this are making a metric bit
ton of money off these women by telling
them exactly the they want to hear and
the ones who do this the best are
actually very attractive they dress nice
talk sweet and this of course is an
important component of the production so
how do you spot these creators these men
will say something like you know why
you're single right you're single
because as a beautiful intelligent High
achieving woman you're just too
intimidating any man who isn't
interested in you is just too insecure
in his selfhood or fragile in his
masculinity to be the partner you
deserve or the reason why your
relationship failed is because you love
too much you lost yourself in your
loving and this vulnerability
unfortunately was exploited by a selfish
and opportunistic man but don't worry
one day you'll find someone a man who
isn't afraid of his emotions a man who
isn't afraid to communicate etc etc etc
these men tell women exactly what they
want to hear and these women eat it up
