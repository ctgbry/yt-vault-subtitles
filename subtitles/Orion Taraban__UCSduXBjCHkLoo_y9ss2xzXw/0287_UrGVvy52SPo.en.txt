I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why men
like younger women
so in some respects the answer to this
question is fairly obvious men are
primarily visual creatures so they sort
for good Optics and Beauty from the
perspective of evolutionary psychology
is a indicator of reproductive capacity
that is it generally correlates with
youth infertility so to the extent that
men have a biological imperative to
reproduce successfully it makes sense
that men would be attracted to younger
women you don't need to listen to this
episode to know that you already know
that today I'm going to discuss another
powerful and often neglected reason why
this is true but before I do please

so there's another really important
reason why men like younger women it's
staring us all in the face but it almost
never gets said here it is
the reason why men like younger women
is that women like
older men
if women did not like older men it would
actually be very very difficult for men
to like younger women I suppose they
still could like them but it would just
be a recipe for frustration a kind of
torture and we actually don't see that
in reality
I don't believe that there is a culture
on this planet where the average age of
a woman exceeds the average age of a man
for a first marriage so in all places in
every culture around the world
throughout history women select older
men to partner with and why might that
be well what are some of women's

[02:01]
be well what are some of women's
selection criteria for partners
they'd like someone who is confident and
competent who has wealth who has status
who has an emotionally compelling
lifestyle who knows how to communicate
who is emotionally stable and who is
generally an all-around successful guy
okay so who is more likely to have all
of those things a 25 year old man or a
45 year old man obviously the 45 year
old man is going to have significantly
higher levels of all of those things the
25 year old might be fun and sexy but
those aren't the primary criteria upon
which women sort for their Partners okay
so the flip side of this is the
understanding that a successful 45 year
old man is sort of analogous to a fairly
attractive 25 year old woman
most men will never even begin to
approach the optionality enjoyed by a

[03:01]
approach the optionality enjoyed by a
beautiful 25 year old woman but if they
play their cards right they might get
the kind of optionality enjoyed by a
fairly attractive 25 year old woman
and it makes sense that when he's at his
Peak when he has the greatest
optionality he will ever have he will
move toward the women that all of the
things being equal he's most attracted
to
because that's what the attractive 25
year old women are doing they're at
their Peak and they're moving toward the
men that all of the things being equal
they're most attracted to
in our culture when we see a big age Gap
in a romantic relationship we tend to
think that it's a skeezy old guy who has
somehow manipulated an innocent young
woman into a relationship
but it would probably be just as true to
say that it's a skevial little girl who
is creeping on some established
successful man
it's the other side of the same coin so
we either need to think of this as
creepy in both directions or even better

[04:02]
creepy in both directions or even better
stop being so judgmental
seeing what people go after when they
have the most options is our truest
glimpse into what they really want
it is what it is
