I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is you get
what you pay
for this is the third part of my
three-part series on why successful men
use escorts so be sure to check out the
first two episodes before proceeding all
right if you're still with me after all
this time thank you thank you for
keeping your reactive Judgment at Bay
long enough to entertain a different
perspective at this point however let's
shift away from explaining why
successful men might use escorts to
responding to the most common objections
to this explanation Far and Away the
most common push back I received to this
argument is something along the lines of
yeah but Orion how gross and
transactional is that relationship an
escort isn't going to love you she may
not even like you in fact it's entirely
possible that may even loath and despise

[01:02]
possible that may even loath and despise
you and that she only masks her true
feelings for you because she's being
paid in light of this how can you
possibly Advocate men pursue this
option so how would I respond to this
rebuttal well first and foremost by
reminding the objector that I'm not
advocating this option I'm explaining it
which is value neutral remember I've
never done this myself I'm just
explaining why successful men hire
escorts when they choose to do so
next I would agree with the Crux of this
objection absolutely there is certainly
no guarantee that an escort will love or
even like her client but here's the rub
there's no guarantee of that in a
relationship
either I know countless men who are
married to women who dislike them if not
outright hate them a non-transactional
relationship whatever that is does not

[02:00]
relationship whatever that is does not
guarantee let's say authentic positive
regard men who date traditionally can
and do end up in Loveless sexless
marriages and this contrary to popular
belief isn't always due to the fact that
these men are screwing up in some
capacity like by doing too many of the
wrong things or too few of the right
things for example among other things
it's much more likely for a woman to
disrespect a safe good man than a
dangerous bad boy mostly because the
good man would never even think to
implement aversive contingencies against
her
behavior but there's another more
important reason why this objection is
inadequate namely a transactional
relationship in no way invalidates the
possibility of authentic positive regard
obviously this doesn't always happen but
it certainly doesn't never happen in
fact some of the most satisfying
relationships in people's lives are

[03:01]
relationships in people's lives are
relationships with those they pay the
head of their Jiu-Jitsu Dojo their
stylist or Barber their local Bartender
the owner of their favorite hle in the
Wall Restaurant their
therapist just because money changes
hands doesn't mean that the emotional
dimension of the relationship is
invalidated or rendered moot like as a
therapist I can tell you that I
authentically care about my clients and
that caring is a big part of what heals
it also factored into my decision to
enter into this profession as opposed to
some other line of work so there's
professional goodness of
fit that said I'm not a charity I do
this for a living and because I provide
a service of value to others it's
reasonable that I should be compensated
for that service otherwise my ability to
provide that service indefinitely would
be compromised even nonprofits need
fundraisers if people didn't pay we
wouldn't continue to work together

[04:01]
wouldn't continue to work together
however the fact that there is a
financial transaction at the heart of
our relationship does not nullify the
authenticity of the feelings we share in
the connection we form obviously therapy
just wouldn't work otherwise it's the
connection that heals in fact in one
study I read on therapeutic outcomes the
single greatest factor associated with
patient Improvement was their perception
that their therapist liked them so on
some level it's my job to like my
patients and let me tell you if I
secretly hated my patients I probably
would have needed to find another line
of work a long time ago so I don't buy
the idea that people can't have
authentic caring relationships with
professionals and I don't buy the idea
that you effortlessly or inevitably
receive authentic care in
nonprofessional relationships
professional relationships can be good
and professional relationships can be
bad non-professional relationships can
be good and non professional

[05:00]
be good and non professional
relationships can be bad but it's
actually less likely for professional
relationships to be bad for the simple
reason that if they were consistently
bad they would likely have gone out of
business by now here's another way to
look at it let's say that you and I go
out to eat for dinner and when we open
the door and walk in the hostess gives
us this big smile the moment she sees us
and says hey welcome in we're so happy
to have you and you respond oh please
you know we both know you're not
actually happy to see us you're just a
paid professional doing your job so you
can cut the
well first of all guess who's
never going to be taken out to a
restaurant again it's like no the
hostess is only there because she's
getting paid but maybe she went into the
hospitality industry instead of
Metallurgy or venture capital or
Endocrinology because it's a good fit
for her personality she might actually
enjoy being warm and nice so she found a

[06:00]
enjoy being warm and nice so she found a
job where she could get paid for doing
just that and second it's nice to be
greeted with a smile when you walk
through a door like that's part of the
experience you pay for when you go out
to eat at a restaurant contrast that
with how most men are received when they
walk through other doors maybe even the
doors of their own homes are they
greeted with attention and warmth and
consideration and service
in general not getting what they want
does not cause people's desires to
disappear it just motivates them to seek
out the satisfaction of those Desires in
other
ways now before I go any further if

it's how you can support me in my
mission on this channel all right let's
get back to
it so while it's certainly possible for
explicitly transactional relationships
to be soulless and deceptive this is far
from the inherent nature of such
relationships just like people can and
do feel authentic care and interest for
those with whom they broker explicitly
transactional relationships they can and
do feel indifference and disinterest for
those with whom they have romantic

[08:00]
those with whom they have romantic
relationships and while it may be true
that you can't enter into the highest
relationship Potentials in explicitly
transacted
relationships in such relationships the
relationship downsides are mitigated
considerably what does that mean well
let's say a man hires an ex an escort
and has a bad experience with her he
never has to call that woman again he's
out an hour and a th bucks contrast that
with the risks and expenses associated
with a Loveless sexless marriage getting
out of that situation could cost that
man millions of dollars and years of
emotional hardship it's far far more
expensive I recently did a consultation
with a man who told me that he added up
the divorce settlement and 10 years of
alimony and divided that total which did
not include the maintenance costs
throughout the relationship by the
approximate number of sexual encounters
he enjoyed with his wife over the course

[09:00]
he enjoyed with his wife over the course
of their marriage when he did this he
realized that he functionally paid his
ex
$50,000 per sexual encounter and I think
we can all agree that's a ludicrous
amount of money to pay for
sex explicitly transactional
relationships may not be the highest to
which people can attain but they are far
from the lowest and the mitigation of
risk may be a much more important
consideration to highly successful men
in these relationships a slightly lower
ceiling is more than offset by a much
higher
flower and this is precisely because
when we deal with professionals we
reasonably expect some degree of
professionalism on their part it doesn't
matter if they're having a bad day or
they're stressed out or they have other
things on their minds that's not ex an
excuse for rude disrespectful

[10:00]
excuse for rude disrespectful
incompetent or negligent behavior in a
professional environment and in general
the more we pay the higher the
expectations for the quality of service
we receive let me tell you the waiters
at French Laundry treat their diners
extremely well they are not rude or
disrespectful or aggressive and they
certainly treat their customers with
much more attentiveness Grace and
competence than do the waiters at a
local Diner and if if you aren't treated
as well when you pay less think about
how well you are treated when you appear
to pay
nothing just consider how many women
behave in their traditional romantic
relationships some of these women treat
a stranger in the supermarket with more
respect and consideration than their own
husbands and they often feel justified
in doing so as I've said before one of
the most dangerous relationship beliefs
is the belief that in your Rel
relationship you're finally free to be

[11:02]
relationship you're finally free to be
yourself warts and all in point of fact
a relationship like a job is a privilege
and one you have to constantly earn a
new by providing sufficient value it is
a privilege to be a husband and a
privilege to be a wife it is a privilege
to be a boyfriend and a privilege to be
a girlfriend relationships are roles and
we don't ever get to stop playing
it's also important to remember that
people don't just go out to eat because
they don't know how to cook a lot of the
time people go out to eat because they
don't want to go shopping and then cook
and then clean up afterwards they want
to delegate those chores and secure a
desirable Solution on demand and you
know what it's nice to be taken care of
like it feels good which is why people
pay for experiences that make them feel
good every day

[12:00]
good every day
women how often do you come over to your
man's place on demand service him
sexually and then
leave probably not that often in fact
many of you might consider such an
interaction exploitative or beneath your
dignity to perform it's like fair
enough but that doesn't stop men from
Desiring that experience like just
because your man won't cook for you
doesn't mean you stop wanting to be
cooked for you just go outside the
relationship to satisfy that desire and
you pay for the privilege of doing so so
let's recap across these past few
episodes I've attempted to explain why
successful men that is men who shouldn't
have difficulty accessing traditional
dating opportunities with enthusiastic
women use escorts they do so because
traditional dating has become far too
expensive for them by virtue of their
success and optionality from the
perspective of these men three dates
could cost

[13:00]
could cost
$115,000 or more with absolutely no
guarantee of mutual interest or a sexual
encounter the time and energy that men
spend in attracting and maintaining
women could be expended in more
profitable ways when men isue
traditional dating including devoting
more time and energy to any not
explicitly transactional relationships
in their lives that may be more pleasant
and rewarding men who use escorts often
secure sexual encounters with more
attract attractive women more cheaply or
at least they can pursue sexual
experiences with the women of their
choosing what's more they are generally
assured of a professional relationship
that mitigates their risk and limits
their downside finally they enjoy more
power and control over nearly every
aspect of the relationship in short
successful men use escorts because it
makes more economic sense than
traditional dating and it solves a
number of problems that become
increasingly Salient as a function of
their
success now many women if they've gotten

[14:02]
success now many women if they've gotten
this far are just going to respond well
if these men like their prostitutes so
much then they can just go off with them
for all I care and let me be I wouldn't
want one of those disgusting losers
anyway and that of course is their right
but I'm here to tell you that not all
men who use prostitutes are disgusting
losers and they're probably not going to
change their behavior as a consequence
of your judgment anyway
think of the foregoing as market
research I'm here to tell you that many
of your Target customers are buying a
different
product why might that be get curious
denigrating your customers as stupid or
tasteless isn't going to bring back your
market share however if you can
understand as non-defensively as
possible why these customers might be
passing up your opportunity in favor of
another you might be able to

[15:01]
another you might be able to
appropriately adapt your strategy to
recapture their attention in any case I
hope I've provided you with some food
for thought what do you think does this
fit with your own experience let me know
in the comments below as always I
appreciate your support and thank you
for listening
