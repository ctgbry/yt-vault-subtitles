based on the evolutionary history that
we have of of growing up like our
ancestors did not eat the way we eat
today. They did not have the modern
nutrition and diet. This is not the way
we're supposed to be eating. Do you
think the same thing could be said about
relationships and dating today? how
modern technology or modern ways we're
dating is not necessarily the way
evolution would have wanted us to find
love or date. Maybe evolution is pretty
sneaky and creative. So like when we
look at our nearest primate ancestors
like chimps or bonobos, we see all kinds
of deceptive tactics that are used by
lower status males to secure sexual
opportunities with uh with females. Some
of them might mean impersonating other
females. So, it's like in some uh
primate species that have like really
hierarchical structures where there's

hierarchical structures where there's
like one or two alphas that control the
vast majority of the females. One of the
strategies is for one a lower status
male to imitate being a female so they
can kind of get indoctrinated into the
herum and then like the other females
when the alpha is asleep. So, it's like
this is something that evolved as a
strategy over millions and millions of
years. So, there's all kinds of
deceptiveness and uh trickery and
minesis and cops and robbers when it
comes to sex. It's like all is fair and
love and war on some level because
they're both related to the same outcome
which is survival.
