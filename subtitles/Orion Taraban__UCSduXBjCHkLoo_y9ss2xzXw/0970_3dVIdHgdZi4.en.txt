The main argument in support of
dismissing my perspective is that I, as
a man, cannot possibly know what it
really feels like to be a woman. And I
agree with that predicate. I don't know
what it really feels like to be a woman.
That's true. But we can also extend that
statement to literally everyone. I can't
feel anybody else's feelings. I can't
experience anybody else's life. And that
means that I do not know, cannot know
what it really feels like to be anyone
else. And it's certainly not true that
men simply understand each other due to
the fact that they share a gendered
experience of reality. Because whatever
that gendered experience is, it's not
the same gendered experience for all
men. Similarly, women typically don't
get together and sing kumbaya over their
shared womanhood. In fact, in the
diversity of human experience, there are
probably some men who are more different
from me than some women are. The point
is that experience doesn't neatly

is that experience doesn't neatly
organize itself around the identity
categories that people create. But none
of this matters with respect to the
point under consideration. And why
doesn't it matter? Because I don't need
to know how a woman feels in order to
know what she wants. I will say that one
more time. I don't need to know how a
woman feels in order to know what she
wants. And why is that? Because the
truest indication of what people in
general, men and women, what people want
is not their feelings, it's not their
intentions, and it's absolutely not
their words, it's their behavior.
Observing how people behave, especially
with respect to scarce resources like
time or money, is the most accurate and
reliable indication of what people truly
house.
