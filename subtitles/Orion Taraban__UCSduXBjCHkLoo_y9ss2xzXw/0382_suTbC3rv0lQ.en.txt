I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is weed is
more dangerous than you think
so I've worked with a lot of guys who
use cannabis in some form or another and
I also live in the San Francisco Bay
area which is sort of like Ground Zero
with respect to recreational cannabis
use and I've noticed that there is a
general attitude that weed is a harmless
drug that requires deeper examination
now there are certainly some truth to
this for example folks can't overdose on
marijuana like they could on heroin or
meth so in this sense cannabis is not
dangerous with respect to its toxicity
profile and it also generally doesn't
generate much in the way of
physiological dependence physiological
dependence is when your body adapts to
expect a certain amount of substance
from your daily use for instance when
folks develop physiological dependence

[01:00]
folks develop physiological dependence
to alcohol which is a neurodepresent
their sympathetic nervous system ramps
up in expectation of the booze this is
why if they don't drink heavy users can
break out in sweats have terrible
headaches and suffer a host of other
problems in fact alcohol if you didn't
know is one of the few drugs the
withdrawal from which can actually prove
fatal their sympathetic nervous system
goes nuts and they go into cardiac
arrest which is why heavy users might
need to detox under medical supervision
you don't see those kinds of things with
weed
we might argue that it's psychologically
addictive but it's not really
physiologically addictive like a lot of
other drugs out there
so these are kind of the arguments for
why weed is harmless but I'm here to
argue that it's this patina of
harmlessness that makes weed a trojan
horse it looks harmless but it actually
carries within it a really dangerous

[02:02]
carries within it a really dangerous
liability and the main liability
associated with weed use is that weed
makes you think that you are using your
time well
it's as simple as that
people are high they could watch paint
dry and think it's fascinating when
people are high they think they are more
creative more intelligent and more
productive than they actually are if you
don't believe me try re-reading some of
the things that you wrote while you were
high When You're Sober
what might have made sense to you in
that state of consciousness doesn't
quite make sense anymore

now why do so many young people use weed
well besides the opportunity for
socializing which is a huge draw for
that drug a lot of young guys get into
weed because well
their lives aren't that great
let's be real it's actually very very
hard to be a young man and our culture
doesn't really recognize that whatsoever
you're kind of useless to other men
because you have no skills or experience
and women don't want you because you're
generally poor and irresponsible the
lifestyle of many young men sucks so a
lot of young guys because they don't
have a lot going on in their lives they
kind of use weed to emotionally cope
with their circumstances and on some
level this makes sense like if your
circumstances are miserable and you can
do nothing about them it makes sense to
try to accommodate yourself to that

[04:00]
try to accommodate yourself to that
reality emotionally I don't begrudge
anyone that use of the drug however the
real question is
is it actually true that there's nothing
you can do to affect your shitty
situation
for some people for a certain amount of
time it may be true that there's little
to nothing they can do to make their
situation instrumentally better in the
near future
however for the vast majority of people
that's there are things that
they can do to make their situation
better
they won't necessarily move the needle
right away but as a Young Man time
is on your side yes it is
Jagger was not singing about the ladies
in that song so efforts accumulate and
over time you can really change your
lifestyle so that you're not in such a
shitty situation anymore and once you
succeed in doing that the appeal of

[05:00]
succeed in doing that the appeal of
getting high will lessen this is because
being high is generally a way of
accommodating to the harsh and
unpleasant aspects of reality however if
your situation is Pleasant meaningful
rewarding and fulfilling
you actually won't want to avoid reality
you'll want to be present for your life
as much as possible for as long as
possible so it's actually possible to
Raw Dog reality if you have a fairly
decent life and that's something that
folks can affect Maybe not immediately
but generally over time
weed however saps people's motivation to
make that change the real danger with
weed is not that it's acutely dangerous
but that it kind of makes the users
shitty situation more tolerable
which allows it to continue much longer
Through Time
and in this way weed keeps folks gently

[06:02]
and in this way weed keeps folks gently
trapped
for years in circumstances that they
might long ago have been able to change
now when folks stop using and they come
into increased emotional contact with
how unpleasant their situation is things
get harder things get worse however
that's actually kind of a good thing
that's because miserable situations are
unsustainable
weed makes a potentially miserable
situation tolerable which keeps users in
that situation longer
if on the other hand you remove that
tolerance and you feel the reality of
your situation you're not just gonna
throw your hands up in the air and say
help I guess it's a lifetime of pain and
misery for me
you will do things to escape that pain I
guarantee it even suicidally depressed
people run out of burning buildings
you may have previously been using weed

[07:01]
you may have previously been using weed
to escape that pain
but if that root is now blocked by your
will you will find other ways to get out
you gotta trust yourself on that not
here to shame or blame anyone for using
