i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is the captain can't complain
so this is something to keep in mind
whenever you find yourself in a position
of leadership you can only complain
up so on a ship the sailors are
complaining to the deck officers
and the deck officers are complaining to
the first mate and the first meme is
complaining to the captain
and that's where the buck stops the
captain can't complain
it's one of the duties that accompany
the privilege
of occupying a position of power because
imagine what happens if this obligation
were violated
let's say the first mate comes into the
captain's quarters one night and asks
hey cap how you doing
and the captain responds oh man i don't
know i'm not so good
i'm really anxious i can see that we're
about to enter into a
dangerous section of the ocean i mean

[01:00]
dangerous section of the ocean i mean
lots of shoals just beneath the surface
and and there's definitely could be some
that don't even appear on the map
and if that's not bad enough i'm getting
some attitude from the sailors and
and i'm not sure if they're going to
follow my orders when necessary i mean
some of them
even complain about me behind their back
and that doesn't really
matter since we could all just end up
drowning in our sleep anyway
so thanks for asking have a good night
the first mate is going to leave
and think holy [ __ ] we're completely
[ __ ]
we've either got to stage a mutiny or
find a way to get off this boat while we
still have our lives
the reason why the captain can't
complain
is that there are others who are
dependent upon him within a given
hierarchy of power
and when you perturb those who are
dependent upon you
you shake the very foundation of their
contingent positions
dependency naturally creates awareness
of vulnerability
and this vulnerability must be respected
by those in positions of power
on some level we need our leaders
to exhibit confidence in their ability

[02:02]
to exhibit confidence in their ability
and firmness
in their direction in order to willingly
follow them through the dangerous shoals
of life
now does this mean that captains can
never be perturbed
they can never be afraid they can never
be uncertain
of course not just talk to other
captains about it
get a captain support group buddy or if
you're back on land
go and complain to your admiral but
without exception
if you're occupying a position of power
you cannot complain downward this is
true at work
in your romantic relationships in your
family whoever has more power
also has the responsibility to protect
those with less
from unnecessary anxiety so that's what
i have to say for today
