the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw
very famously wrote that the single
biggest problem with communication is
the illusion that it has taken place
and I find this to be particularly
relevant when it comes to relationships
two people say hey let's be committed
and both people believe that they both
know what commitment means that the idea
of commitment in one person's head is
the same idea of commitment in the other
person's head and in my experience that
would only happen by chance so I call
these things assumptive Frameworks and
they tend to really trip people Up For
Better or For Worse the gay community
hasn't had these assumptive Frameworks
and so looking at their relationships
might be educative
so check out my recent episode on what
Straits can learn from gays for more
