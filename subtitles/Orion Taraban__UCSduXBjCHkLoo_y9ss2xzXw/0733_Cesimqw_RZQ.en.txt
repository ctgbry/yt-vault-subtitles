cynicism creates problems notably it
cuts people off from experiencing
certain positive emotions like Joy or
sincerity but these problems might be
less problematic than the problems that
would emerge were the cynicism to be
removed the experience of disappointment
heartbreak embarrassment mockery and so
on simply suggesting that a cynical
individual should say go to therapy and
heal the root causes of his jadedness
while potentially coming from a desire
to be helpful typically lacks
appropriate context for instance therapy
can be expensive will the stress
associated with incurring the additional
expense of therapy be more painful than
the problem he would be using therapy to
solve therapy can also be stressful
things typically get worse before they
get better does the individual have the
time and emotional bandwidth to take on
this project at the present time and of
course even assuming the therapy is
successful which of course is always
doubtful is the resolution of this
problem a net positive
