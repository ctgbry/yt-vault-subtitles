I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why
beautiful women are nuts so this is a
compliment to the episode that I
recently released entitled why
successful men are jerks from both
gender perspectives it can often appear
that the most attractive potential
partners are unfortunately fundamentally
flawed in other ways however what's
interesting is that how they appear
flawed seems to be predictably gendered
like you don't often hear men
complaining that beautiful women are
[ __ ] do you and today I'm here to
explain why that might be the case I've
already talked about the men now it's
time for women to get theirs the reason
why beautiful women are nuts is actually
pretty simple here it is beautiful women
are nuts because no one ever tells them
the
truth that's it there are some women out

[01:00]
truth that's it there are some women out
there who have never been told the truth
in their entire [ __ ] lives like can
you imagine you've been alive 20 30
years and you've never been told the
truth can you imagine how distorted a
model of reality you would have like you
kind of have to feel sympathy for these
women now because they can be so out of
touch with the way things actually work
they can often be the engineers of their
own dissatisfaction this is because
while these women might not ever be at a
loss for potential Partners eventually
these guys are going to get so sick of
their nuttiness that they're going to
walk pretty is not sufficient
compensation for crazy most guys have to
learn that the hard way and these women
end up snatching defeat from the jaws of
success when they operate under bad
models so how does that happen a lot of
these women are precociously attractive
they hit puberty and they realize that
everything changes men of all ages start

[02:01]
everything changes men of all ages start
looking at them differently treating
them differently they start to stare not
just the boys in their class but the
boys dads as well and that can be
terrifying and scary and exciting and
confusing for young women to navigate
they've just come into a great deal of
power that they did nothing to earn and
don't yet know what to do with and why
would they they're chronologically just
teenagers and they may be even younger
than that emotionally this isn't exactly
a recipe for success and from that
moment forward these women will never
hear the truth from a man again this is
because all these men want to [ __ ] her
and the truth does not get you laid if
being honest got men laid the world
would become such a nicer place to live
like overnight it would become so much
better however women only reward the
truth when it happens to coincide with

[03:00]
truth when it happens to coincide with
what they want to hear and in this case
they're still rewarding it because it's
what they want to hear it just happens
to also be the truth which is something
of a fortunate accident they're like
Elementary School teachers who ask an
apparently open-ended question to the
entire class but are actually fishing
for a very specific answer the entire
time this is the only answer that will
receive
credit honesty does not get you laid
unless the honesty is ex exactly aligned
with the responses women have already
decided get the credit and the
likelihood of this happening especially
over an appreciable timeline is
vanishingly small only men who have an
inordinate commitment to Integrity those
who are able to put an abstract
principle ahead of their own
self-interest or I don't know men on the
autistic Spectrum are going to prefer
honesty with all its social consequences
to the prospect of a sexual relationship
with a beautiful woman this is why why

[04:00]
with a beautiful woman this is why why
men lie when you punish the truth you're
asking to be lied
to if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description women of course don't like
hearing this however I'm going to offer
an analogy to help them understand why
this likely isn't changing anytime soon
imagine you work for a company it's a

[05:00]
imagine you work for a company it's a
desirable position and it pays very well
you like your job however the only issue
is that you have to deal with a really
difficult manager he might be
overcompensating for something maybe he
has a fragile ego maybe he's a
narcissist who knows all you know is
that he
really doesn't like being
challenged like it doesn't matter if
he's wrong it doesn't matter if there is
an objectively more efficient or more
effective or better way of doing things
disagreement is construed as an attack
and he responds to attacks with
aggression you've seen it happen more
than once some well-meaning employee
thinks she's making a helpful suggestion
to improve outcomes and boom she's
looking for a new job by the end of the
day given that you're dealing with a
person like this what are you going to
do the next time he brings you an idea
that you think isn't going to work are
you really really going to put your

[06:00]
you really really going to put your
livelihood on the line and try to
correct him you know he's only going to
fire you because he'll perceive this as
an attack and he's not going to change
his mind anyway speaking your mind is
not going to work and it's only going to
harm your goals it would be pointless
and masochistic to insist on the
rightness of your
perspective so if you're like most
people what are you going to say you
know boss that's a fantastic idea
absolutely you know I can see how that
could work to be honest it's probably
too advanced for our design department
so it might have to be finessed a bit
but it's a genius idea must be while
you're in charge sir and then you're
going to walk away and try to do the
best with the ridiculous [ __ ] you've
just been given do you
understand most people are not going to
unnecessarily expose themselves to risk
and loss where there is no hope of a
potential upside and that's exactly the
situation most guys find themselves in
when they tell the truth to women like

[07:01]
when they tell the truth to women like
the manager in my analogy most women are
not going to change their minds when
they hear the truth they've already
decided what they want and consequently
what they want to hear and they may
already have a general model of reality
that's been reinforced by years or
Decades of being lied to this is not
something that typically can be
disabused with words only with the
accumulated consequences of many poor
decisions like can you imagine the
manager in my hypothetical scenario
hearing a dissenting Viewpoint even one
that was presented respectfully and
saying thank you thank you for being
honest with me I realize now that you're
the only person who tells me the truth
and that all of these Toadies and
sycophants have just been telling me
what I wanted to hear all these years
for your courage and
integrity I immediately promote you to
the position of my most trusted adviser
of course this comes with a substantial

[08:01]
of course this comes with a substantial
raise and a host of other benefits so I
hope that you'll accept like can you
imagine when women are told the truth
they are much more likely to get upset
to feel offended and to terminate the
relationship than they are to reward men
with sex and privileges men figure this
out pretty quickly like the employee in
my scenario they figure well telling the
truth isn't going to change this woman's
mind and it certainly hasn't helped me
get laid so I'm going to say whatever
the [ __ ] I have to say to make this work
and then I'm going to walk away and try
to do my best with the ridiculous
[ __ ] I've been
given to get what they want men learn to
cater to women's models of reality and
this is especially problematic when it
comes to very attractive women because
these models are much more likely to be
founded on lies that other men who have
also been trying to sleep with them have
told them over the years for better or
worse less attractive women don't seem

[09:01]
worse less attractive women don't seem
to have this issue this is not because
they don't become upset or offended at
the truth they often do but because men
will actually occasionally tell them the
truth because they don't really care if
they don't get what they want from them
I don't make the news I just report it
so that's why beautiful women are nuts
no one tells them the truth the only
possible exception occurs when these
beautiful women had very strong men in
their households growing up they had a
strong father or strong Brothers this is
because these men might be the only men
in the world who aren't trying to [ __ ]
them and because of that they may
potentially be able to apply appropriate
consequences to the Tantrums and
emotional Fallout that can occur when
you tell women the truth these men are
these women's best chance of remaining
in touch with reality
unfortunately even though these fathers
and brothers probably love and care for

[10:01]
and brothers probably love and care for
these women more than any other man does
some of them still won't respond well to
this accountability and they fall
further and further down the rabbit hole
into Wonderland so there you go men want
to [ __ ] beautiful women and telling
women the truth doesn't get them laid so
that's why beautiful women are nuts what
