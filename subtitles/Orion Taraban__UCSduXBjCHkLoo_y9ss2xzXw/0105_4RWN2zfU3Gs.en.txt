i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is
say you're lying
so this is a tactic that i use when i
need to have a difficult conversation
and i'm feeling a lot of dread or
anxiety about it
oftentimes when i think about having
such a conversation i'm subject to
becoming overwhelmed with imagining all
these fabricated scenarios
i consider the impact slight changes in
wording or tone would have on the
outcome and i try to anticipate all of
the possible emotional reactions of the
other party and unsurprisingly that
generally just exacerbates my dread and
anxiety not a useful approach to the
problem
so sometimes
when there's something that i need to
say though i don't particularly want to
say it
i try to consider the situation like an
actor who has to say is lying at a
specific point in the action
to advance the plot forward
that's it

[01:00]
that's it
i just have to say my line on cue
it doesn't have to be a tony
award-winning performance it doesn't
have to be witty or compassionate or
charming it just has to be said
sometimes you just need to say your line
so that the plot can advance
as an actor your job is to speak the
words so that the play can continue
this is a tactic that i would recommend
if you're feeling a lot of anxiety about
say asking someone out or breaking up
with someone
you can even memorize your line if you
need to
that way when the appropriate time comes
you can simply speak the words no need
to worry about anything else
you just need to move your mouth and
float the words into the air
if you've done this then you've done
your part and the play can continue
you can then respond organically
depending on how the other person
chooses to react to what you had to say
don't overthink it when it comes time to
talk

[02:00]
talk
just say you're lying that's it
