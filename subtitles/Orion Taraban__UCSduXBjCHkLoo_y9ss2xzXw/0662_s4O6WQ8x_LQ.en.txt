I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is choosing
between two women so this is a subject
that actually comes up fairly frequently
in my consultations with men either the
man is choosing between two women he's
been dating for a monogamous commitment
or it's a man choosing between his wife
and his mistress since I see the same
patterns of thought arise in all of
these discussions I thought I'd make an
EP episode to address this issue
proactively unfortunately by the time
the guy calls me he's usually fairly
distraught and Confused this is because
he's in a state of vacillation in the
sense that he's going back and forth in
his mind between option A and option b
typically he's comparing the two women
with each other sometimes even going so
far as to create lists of relative pros
and cons and this is a problem for a
number of reasons first and foremost the

[01:00]
number of reasons first and foremost the
man's intelligence creativity and
problem solving skills are being
constrained by these two options in his
mind it's either option A or option b
that's all he can see however in reality
there's option A and option b but also
option C and D and E F G H I J K L MN
you get the idea there's actually a
whole bunch of options but because his
thought process is restricted
he can't see them and this limits his
freedom of action which is generally to
his
detriment when a man has the good
problem of having multiple women in his
life he should never ever under any
circumstances ever make the mistake of
comparing them with each other besides
being the thief of Joy comparison
generally leads to suboptimal outcomes
why well let's say that in your mind
option A is slightly better than option

[02:00]
option A is slightly better than option
b that is you compared the two options
to each other and found option A to be
superior well once you make the decision
option b evaporates as a basis of
comparison and you'll have to deal with
option A on its own merits and at that
point it may not be all that helpful
that the option you chose was slightly
better than the option you didn't what's
important is whether the option you
chose is sufficient with respect to
whatever your goals happen to be moving
forward so never compare option A with
option b in these situations the
question is not do I go with a or b the
question is do I go with a or not a and
independently do I go with b or not B
like each relationship should be
examined on its own merits and relative
to your own self relevant
goals this will increase the likely Ood

[03:00]
goals this will increase the likely Ood
that your choice will make sense past
the point of decision for some months or
years afterwards here's another
important thing to understand the women
in question might not like this but
sometimes the resolution to this problem
is not an either or
solution sometimes it's a both and
solution and sometimes it's a neither
nor
solution as I've said before roads only
go where they go roads are static they
go only from point A to point B along
their given route so if option A is a
road going north and option b is a road
going west which road are you going to
take well that depends on where you want
to go doesn't it this is why it's
essential that you not compare the
options against each other but against
your own goals which is your
destination so if you want to go
Southeast then you should take neither

[04:00]
Southeast then you should take neither
Road this is because either Road will
actually take you farther and farther
from where you want to go just because
the road is at your feet doesn't mean it
will take you where you want to end up
in some cases you may even need to
backtrack a bit because you've gotten so
lost or turned around but men who have
become too constrained in their thought
processes are subject to forgetting this
Common Sense this is why I ask these men
to consider what they would choose for
themselves if they weren't aware of what
either one of these women
wanted this is because as long as the
man is vacillating between these two
options he actually exists in the frames
of these two women

gander that's how you can support this
Channel and its Mission okay let's get
back to
it so what does this mean that a man
exists in the frames of two women
simultaneously well let's say that the
man is uh let's say that the wife is
demanding the man leave his mistress and
stay with her and that the mistress is
demanding the man leave his wife and
stay with her not only does this insist

[06:00]
stay with her not only does this insist
on a mutually exclusive decision that
may not necessarily be required but in
his mindset the man's entire range of
optionality is either to give woman a
what she wants or woman B what she wants
like what about what the man wants the
choice is not between wife or mistress
this is a product of the women
controlling the discussion the choice is
actually between the wife or no wife
like will the wife helped the man go
where he wants to go and between the
mistress and no mistress that is will
the mistress help the man go where he
wants to go and this can be hard for men
because many of them haven't thought
about what they want in quite some time
this is because they have gotten so in
the habit of serving their women and
they have gotten so comfortable existing
in their women's frames I did a
consultation with a man the other day
who had been married for 30 years and he
couldn't tell me what he wanted
apparently no had asked or cared to ask

[07:01]
apparently no had asked or cared to ask
for decades he was just so used to being
married and Catering to the demands and
interests and preferences of his wife
that he kind of no longer existed as an
independent person capable of
self-directed thought and while the
women out there might not see any
problem with this I imagine my male
audience might think very differently so
if option A goes north and option b goes
west then neither option is particularly
useful if you want to go Southeast on
the other hand if you want to go
Northwest well you can make use of both
roads can't you head West and north and
west and north and west or you can seek
out a third option that heads Northwest
in a straightforward manner turns out
there are actually plenty of Roads so
it's important not to be constrained by
a false dichotomy and to make your
decision in the context of your
overarching goals at the end of the day
choosing between two women is a good
good problem to have that's because it's

[08:02]
good problem to have that's because it's
a problem of abundance and optionality
as opposed to a problem of scarcity and
limitation so nice work however what
makes this problem so difficult for the
majority of men is that they're not used
to having this problem they're not used
to having abundance and optionality with
women so they still approach the
decision with a scarcity mentality and
scarcity mentality is always more
focused on minimizing loss than it is on
maximizing gain which can lead to all
kinds of suboptimal outcomes hopefully
this helped disabuse some of you of that
scarcity mentality what do you think
does this fit with your own experience
