I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
have effortless relationships with women
people often say that relationships take
work so many will find this hard to
believe but it is actually possible to
have an effortless relationship and let
me tell you once you have one you will
never want to go back to the old model
consider that it takes no effort for
water to flow downhill
seeking the lowest point is what water
does naturally you can make water flow
uphill but it will require continuous
energy and effort to do so and this is
what happens when you try to have the
relationship you want with anyone this
is tantamount to taking on a second
unpaid job
on the other hand if you really
understand yourself and if you know how
to vet a woman appropriately then you

[01:00]
to vet a woman appropriately then you
can have an effortless relationship in
which love affection and sex flow as
naturally as water flows downhill
that said while selection is a big part
of this outcome it's not the whole story
fortunately assuming that selection
isn't an issue there's really only one
thing you need to understand to have an
effortless relationship with a woman and
that's what I'm here to talk about today

[02:01]
effortless relationship with a woman
at this point it may be useful if you
haven't done so already to check out my
episode women treat men the way men
treat jobs because it's within this
framework that I will be discussing this
understanding
as I said there's only one thing you
need to understand to have an effortless
relationship with a woman and here it is
all you need to do is to be her
perceived best option
that's it
if it sounds simple
it's because it is however that doesn't
necessarily mean that it's easy since as
we've previously discussed on this
channel women want it all now why does
this work okay
women treat men the way men treat jobs
right so men think about all the
professional experiences that you've had
in your life you've probably had several
different jobs which is generally enough
experience to know that it's hard to get
a good job if you've worked for several
years you've probably encountered
insufferable bosses incompetent

[03:02]
insufferable bosses incompetent
colleagues demanding work schedules
useless obligations frustrating
bureaucracy low compensation feeling
unappreciated feeling disrespected
feeling burnt out feeling like you're
giving more than you're getting
these are all fairly common experiences
as you make your way through the
professional Arena especially at the
beginning because you tend to have the
worst jobs when you're first starting
out
so let's say that you've had these kinds
of experiences over the past five or ten
years and that you may even have begun
to despair of the possibility of ever
finding a job that you don't hate let
alone a job that you love
and you finally land this fantastic job
it pays three times as much as you've
ever been paid before it gives you a
flexible schedule with unlimited paid
time off it allows you freedom and
control over your various projects and
responsibilities it provides excellent
benefits and you feel appreciated and

[04:00]
benefits and you feel appreciated and
respected by your colleagues and
supervisors
now if you land this job
are you going to do anything whatsoever
to jeopardize this position
absolutely not you are going to be on
your very best behavior and why are you
going to be on your very best behavior
because you know what else is out there
you understand that all other things
being equal If this job doesn't work out
it's going to be a step down for you it
won't be as good as you've got them
you'll be paid less for more work you
might have to relocate and at the very
least you'll have to go through the
whole interview process again which is a
real pain in the ass I've never met
anyone
who says he likes interviewing for jobs
and that's kind of what dating feels
like to women in many respects
so if you've previously had challenging
or unfulfilling experiences in the

[05:00]
or unfulfilling experiences in the
professional Arena
once you find an interesting meaningful
high-paying job with great benefits you
are going to be Employee of the Month
the same is true in relationships even a
woman with limited dating experience has
a pretty decent idea of what is out
there
dating a narcissist or a stoner with no
ambition or an angry controlling guy is
kind of like working one of those
jobs in your past
and if she's lucky enough to land a
relationship with you if you have an
emotionally compelling lifestyle if you
know how to maintain high levels of
Attraction if you're interesting and fun
and fit and can provide her with high
value experiences that she may not be
able to find anywhere else
trust me she is not going to do anything
to rock the boat and why is that because
she knows what else is out there man she
understands that all other things being
equal If this relationship doesn't work

[06:02]
equal If this relationship doesn't work
out it's gonna be a step down for her
one of the things that I tell my clients
is that other guys make me look good
I have nothing to fear from other guys
because I've seen the competition and if
you can't yet authentically endorse that
belief yourself
then you've got some work to do
your work is to level up your life by
investing in yourself to the point that
you can legitimately be perceived as the
best option by the caliber of women to
whom you are attracted
and this really shouldn't be that tough
of a cell as most of this work directly
benefits you anyway
and once you succeed in doing so you'll
have other work to do because the work
never stops however let's just take this
one step at a time
also if you're a woman's perceived best
option then most of the tricks of
control and manipulation that guys are
subject to using to secure love

[07:00]
subject to using to secure love
affection and sex become increasingly
irrelevant
you don't need them you don't need to
try to control your partner or convince
her that she should be there or mess
with her emotions you can be like an
employer at a fantastic company that's
in high demand we'd love to have you but
we're not going to force you to stay and
you're free to leave at any time there's
the door
if you are a woman's best option she is
going to be sweet as pie she is going to
be putting an effort she is going to be
sexually available she's going to be
gentle and patient and easy going
this is the type of relationship that a
lot of guys are looking for and it does
not require work
on the other hand if she is difficult or
distant or inconsistent or impatient or
demanding or whatever
it's almost always because she believes
that she could do better
maybe she had a better option in the

[08:00]
maybe she had a better option in the
past who may not have wanted the kind of
relationship that she did maybe she is
comparing herself to her friends or
social media or maybe she's just
delusional about her value and
expectations the reason doesn't really
matter the upshot is that you're not
going to have a good time and you'll be
putting in more and more effort for
smaller and smaller returns
the smart move is to select women who
understand that they're lucky to be
there anything less is a job
what do you think have you experienced
this yourself let me know in the
