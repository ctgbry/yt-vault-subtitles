hi everyone I hope you're doing well I
don't often do these direct audience
updates but I felt like it was
appropriate to do so in this
circumstance so I wanted to share with
you very briefly some changes that will
be coming to the psyx channel very soon
so after much internal hemming and ha I
have decided to move forward with
changing the Cadence of my uploads from
twice a week
down to once a
week starting next week I will only be
releasing a new episode of psyx every
Monday morning at 800 a.m Pacific and
this was a difficult decision for me
because I'm very much a creature of
habit in many respects and since I
started this channel in
2021 I have not missed a single upload
I've uploaded hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of fulllength episodes and I'm
very proud of the work that I've done

[01:00]
very proud of the work that I've done
this far that said I do think that the
strategy of grinding out content might
be more appropriate to an early stage
Channel and For Better or For Worse
pycha is evolving and it's coming into
its own I think that in 2025 I want to
prioritize a couple of things I want to
prioritize impact over effort I want to
make sure that the episodes are as
impactful as possible as opposed to as
numerous as possible I'm also wanting to
prioritize my social network and growing
the channel in through uh relationship
means this might mean traveling more for
media appearances or doing other uh
collaborations which have been difficult
to schedule with my production Cadence
and my private practice
Etc finally I'd also like to write
another book this year I I was really
happy with the way the value of others
turned out many people have received a
great deal of value out of that content
and I'm full of ideas like the reason

[02:01]
and I'm full of ideas like the reason
why I don't I want to go down to once a
week is not because I'm I'm finding it
difficult to run out of uh to come up
with new ideas I'm I'm full I'm bursting
with things I want to talk about but I
wonder if the YouTube format is the
absolute best uh medium for many of
these ideas I think some of them might
be better suited for a long form textual
medium but that requires time and effort
to accomplish so my hope is that by
writing less for YouTube I'll be able to
carve out some time for myself to write
more in the long form and I hope to have
another book out for you uh gez I'd love
it to say by the end of the year you
know you never know how these things go
so uh I just want to let you know that
uh I'd like to see how this goes as an
experiment hopefully I can have your
support and I'm excited to invest more
into more impactful content and in other
value projects moving forward thanks for

[03:00]
value projects moving forward thanks for
your support and uh all the best to you
