Women don't want to marry socioeconomic
equals and certainly not men who earn
less than them. They are more
enthusiastic about marrying
hypergamously. Men who are higher status
and higher earning. So we also know that
in situations where the woman outearns
the man that there's a host of poor
marital outcomes. Men are like three
times more likely to be on erectile
dysfunction medication for instance. And
we already know that women initiate 70
to 80% of divorces. But when the woman
outearns the man, it's it's
significantly more common for them to
initiate divorce than it already is. So
while modern women have careers and are
often very high earning and are socially
accomplished and they might say that
because of this material conditions
aren't really that important to me. The
behavior on a population level belies
that claim is that it does seem to be
important maybe more as a psychological
or an emotional cue than as a material
resource. But it does seem to be
important. Otherwise, why would there be
so much more unhappiness and conflict

so much more unhappiness and conflict
and dissolution under those
arrangements?
