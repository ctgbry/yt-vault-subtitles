i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychx
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is you can't
not communicate
this is one of the fundamental truths of
human existence every action and many
inactions
something with respect to the internal
state of the actor at the moment of
action
it's unavoidable you can't not
communicate
and before i really get into this please
remember to like this video and
subscribe to this channel it takes less
than a second costs you nothing and it's
how you can support me in my mission to
deliver free high quality content to the
world so thank you for your help with
this
no matter what we do
we are communicating something whether
we are conscious of it or not
in my acting conservatory we played a
game in which one player would stand
outside the room and knock on the door
with a certain intention
and the other player would stay inside
the room and try to guess the intention
behind the knock
that was a playful knock

[01:02]
that was a playful knock
that was a terrified knock
that was a defeated knock
if even a knock
can convey the internal state of the
actor then imagine the wealth of
information that your posture and
gestures and semantics and tone and
clothing and expression and movement and
attention and status can express
now just because every action
communicates something with respect to
the internal state of the actor it
doesn't necessarily follow that whoever
is observing that action can
consistently and accurately identify
that state there's always some noise in
the transfer information from actor to
observer by the same token it can also
happen that an observer can correctly
identify the internal state of an actor
of which the actor himself is not even
conscious
therefore
it follows that neither the actor nor
the observer is the absolute arbiter of

[02:01]
the observer is the absolute arbiter of
the communication which requires both
positions to exist at all
there's an interesting example from
history that nicely illustrates these
principles it comes from world war ii
when allied intelligence was
intercepting morse code transmissions
from nazi agents
morse code as you know is an electric
language in which words are spelled out
through combinations of dots and dashes
which are created when an operator
either presses or holds a button
it's a very mechanical process
however the allies who were
eavesdropping on these nazi agents over
time came to recognize very small
idiosyncratic differences in the way
that dots and dashes were created
and they came to associate those
differences with individual operators
they called these subtle variations in
the creation of the dots and dashes of
morse code
fist
and through this recognition they could
track the movements of individual nazi

[03:01]
track the movements of individual nazi
agents across europe and this in turn
gave the allies some insight into the
maneuvers of the axis powers
these agents could not help but impart
something of their personality into
something as mechanical and impersonal
as pressing a button
and they themselves were completely
unaware of their tendency to do so
interesting huh
so what's the upshot
you can't not communicate
every action even the smallest behavior
in some measure bears the likeness of
the internal state of the actor
and it's not necessary for the actor to
be aware of his internal state for this
transmission to occur
