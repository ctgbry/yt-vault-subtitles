i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
the nature of identity
so identity is a word that gets thrown
around a lot today's day and age and it
can also if misapplied cause a great
deal of suffering
because if we identify with something
that isn't actually ourselves we treat
that something as an extension of our
essential being which leaves us far more
vulnerable to envy frustration
disappointment and a whole host of other
negative emotions
it's very important to carefully define
where you end and the rest of the world
begins
to draw a boundary between your identity
who you are
and everything else that happens to
occupy a place in your life for a time
so the thought experiment that i usually
ask my clients to perform when examining
where exactly to draw that line is this
identity is what is left when everything

[01:02]
identity is what is left when everything
that can be taken from you is taken from
you
identity is what is left when everything
that can be taken from you is taken from
you anything that can be taken from you
is not you
it's something that you have it's not
something that you are
if you can exist without it it's not you
so that means that you are not your job
your job can be taken from you you are
not your bank account your money can be
taken from you you are not your
relationships relationships end every
day
you are not your children unfortunately
you can't guarantee their health forever
the fact of the matter is that
everything that can be taken from you
will be taken from you
eventually
it's only a matter of time
so everything that you have is basically
on loan on loan from a good friend i
hope so you're likely to take good care
of it
but when it's time to give it back you
can say thanks for letting me borrow it

[02:00]
can say thanks for letting me borrow it
and can let it go without strong
attachment with a spirit of gratitude
now if you carry this thought experiment
to its logical conclusion that is you
identify what is left when everything
that can be taken from you is taken from
you
what remains
in my understanding there's really only
two possibilities and they roughly
correspond to the teachings of eastern
and western spiritual traditions
on the one hand which is more common in
eastern traditions
what is left is
nothing
there's nothing left when everything
that can be taken from you is taken from
you this is the essence of buddhist
teaching which is sort of like the ego
the self
is basically an illusion that arises out
of the aggregation of sense impressions
and memory
and on some level the work of that
practice is to systematically obliterate
that illusion
which creates an attachment to a sense
of self that doesn't actually exist so
that's one possibility
on the other hand which is more common
in western traditions
what is left is some essential

[03:02]
what is left is some essential
indestructible essence like a soul or a
spirit
this essence will outlive the death of
the body and therefore isn't simply a
consequence of physiological processes
or brain activation and this essence is
ultimately who you are
now i don't know which one is right but
it seems to me that both possibilities
kind of arrive at the same destination
by different pathways namely the
invulnerability of the self
because obviously if there is no self it
can't be hurt since there's no one to
hurt
and if you're an indestructible entity
that survives death
then what could possibly harm you even
death can't touch you
in both cases the individual can be
considered impervious to suffering which
is one of the refuges offered by
religion
try it out for yourself
who are you when everything that can be
taken from you is taken from you that is
your identity and that is where you want
to draw the line
