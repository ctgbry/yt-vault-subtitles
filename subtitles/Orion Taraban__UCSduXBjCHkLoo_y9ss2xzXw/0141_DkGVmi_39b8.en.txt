i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is it will
never be easier
than it is today
so basically as a psychologist i'm a
person who facilitates change in others
people come to me because they want to
do certain things or they want to stop
doing certain other things
unfortunately by the time they come to
me those behavior patterns are already
fairly entrenched from years of
repetition the image i like to use is
that of walking the same path through a
field for 20 years
eventually you will wear down the grass
and there will be a clear trail through
that meadow
it's often the case that when clients
first really consider the possibility of
changing
it can feel demoralizing
they think about the sheer amount of
time they will need to carve a new path
through the field and there's certainly
some truth to that i mean if you've cut

some truth to that i mean if you've cut
a trail through the wilderness it will
take some time to a develop a new path
forward and b
allowed the old path to return to nature
that said if it's going to take a while
you might as well get started
the fact of the matter is
that it will never be easier than it is
today
and why is that
because every day
that you continue to walk the same path
both
a
makes that pathway a little bit more
permanent and established
and b delays the creation of a new way
through the field
the project gets longer and harder with
each passing day
so you might as well get started
it will never be easier than it is today
