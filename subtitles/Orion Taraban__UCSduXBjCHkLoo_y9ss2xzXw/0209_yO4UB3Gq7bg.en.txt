i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
bottom
is when you stop digging
this is a phrase from aaa and other
12-step programs
people really begin to change when
they've hit bottom
the issue is that everybody's bottom is
a different depth
some people they have a little too much
to drink they wake up with a hangover
and they think you know what that's not
for me and they never touch another drop
for the rest of their lives
and so a hangover is a bottom for some
people
other people might have seven duis
serious liver damage and a strange
relationships with all their family
members and they still might be drinking
now you might look at this person and
think what more has to happen to this
guy
what new suffering does he have to
undergo before he's finally ready to
stop digging the hole that he finds
himself in
and the answer to that question is a
mystery
there's no way to answer it with any
degree of certainty

[01:01]
degree of certainty
what i've discovered from working with
addicts over the years is that you
really can't anticipate the depth of
another person's bottom
ultimately it's for each person to
decide for himself or herself when it's
actually time to stop digging
and this is extremely important to
understand if you find yourself in a
relationship with an addict bottom is
when they decide to stop digging not you
this is heartbreaking this is
infuriating
and this is the truth
however there's another side to this
okay
if bottom is when you stop digging
then there's literally nothing stopping
you from deciding to stop digging right
now
nobody's making you dig any deeper
you don't have to or need to keep
digging if the decision is yours and
we've already established it's yours and
no one else's then digging or not
digging is entirely within your control
you don't have to keep digging just

[02:01]
you don't have to keep digging just
because that's what you've been doing in
the past
you can throw that shovel away my friend
start figuring a way out of that hole
the choice really is yours
