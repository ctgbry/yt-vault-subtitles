I'm very very happy to announce to you
all that a couple of weeks ago I
finished writing my next book Starry
Night. This one is a bit different from
my first book, The Value of Others. In
fact, Starry Night isn't a non-fiction
work at all. It's a piece of historical
fiction based on the last two months of
the life of painter Vincent Van Gogh.
Many people know that Van Go shot
himself. However, what many people don't
know is that it took him 2 days to die.
Most of which time he was reportedly
lucid and rational. And I've long been
fascinated by what might have happened
to that man between the time he put the
bullet inside of himself and the time he
ultimately passed away. Van Go is a
haunting figure for so many reasons
above and beyond the circumstances of
his death. Today, he is a world-renowned
artist, firmly enshrined in the art
world's highest echelons. Millions of
people, myself included, admire his

people, myself included, admire his
paintings and resonate with his romantic
worldview. However, while he was alive,
he only sold a single painting. He died
penniless in a garrett. While women
today might swoon over his art, he never
had a single significant relationship
with a woman. By all accounts, he
bewildered and terrified them. How is it
that the same man can be ignored and
despised while he is alive and
celebrated and idolized after his death?
How does this happen?
