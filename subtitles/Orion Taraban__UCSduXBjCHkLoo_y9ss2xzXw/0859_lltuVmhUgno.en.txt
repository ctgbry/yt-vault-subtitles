If you're regularly putting in exogenous
serotonin in the form of a
anti-depressant medication, your body
will start producing less of its own
indogenous serotonin, it will even start
to form fewer terminal buttons to become
less sensitive to the circulating
serotonin in your brain. It's like how
in testosterone replacement therapy,
when you start using it, your testicles
stop producing their own testosterone.
Like that's the expected consequence of
taking TRT because the body is saying we
already have enough. I don't know where
it's coming from but we don't need to
make any more. Okay. Now what then
happens is that after some months or
some years the the brain has come to
expect a certain regular incursion of
exogenous serotonin. If that were to
suddenly or even gradually be removed,
the homeostasis would be altered again,
there would be lower productions of
indogenous serotonin and the brain would

indogenous serotonin and the brain would
be less sensitive because of those
withdrawal of the terminal buttons to
the serotonin that was circulating.
Okay? And so often what that means is
the feelings of distress come back
because we've actually messed with brain
chemistry and neuroanatomy as a
consequence of habituating to the
anti-depressant.
