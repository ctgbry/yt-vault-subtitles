I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why men
don't go to therapy now this title is a
bit of an overstatement because of
course men do go to therapy but they
significantly underutilize Mental Health
Services when compared with women
according to the statistics I've read
women are anywhere from 1 and a half to
three times more likely to seek out
mental health services within a given
12-month period when compared with men
and then basically means that anywhere
from 60 to
75% of all Psychotherapy clients are
women at any given time now why might
that be well I have a little theory
about this but before I get into it

theory why might there be such a
significant gender difference in the

[01:01]
significant gender difference in the
utilization of Mental Health Services
it's going to take a little bit for me
to explain my theory but hopefully
you'll find it interesting so I think
these gender differences can actually be
traced back to the origin of modern
Psychotherapy which as you probably know
was pioneered by Sigman Freud in the
early 20th century Freud was a medical
doctor he was a neurologist who lived in
Austria but due to the anti-Semitism
that dominated that time and place he
was was never able to really achieve
full-fledged professional status many
folks wouldn't even see him as their
professional uh as their treating
physician because he was a Jew so Freud
found himself on the outskirts of
society and on the fringes of his
profession and he initially struggled to
get a foothold in his
career now because many people were
unwilling to see Freud as a physician he
kind of had to content himself with
seeing the patients that the other
doctors wouldn't take gone patients who

[02:01]
doctors wouldn't take gone patients who
were like himself second class citizens
in that society and that meant that he
saw a lot of women or at least more
women than he likely otherwise would
have seen as an establishment physician
and it was in the context of a female
dominated practice that Freud
extrapolated his observations that
eventually became the theory of
psychoanalysis we often ascribe to Freud
this notion that Psychotherapy is the
talking cure that if people lie down on
the couch and talk about their problems
sufficiently they tend to feel better
and resolve their own neurotic illnesses
that's an oversimplification but it's
kind of the gist of it now Freud did
promulgate the idea of psychotherapy as
the talking cure but he didn't actually
invent the term that term was given to
him by one of his first female patients
whom we know through his notes as Anna o
initially Freud approached his treatment

[03:00]
initially Freud approached his treatment
of her in the traditional medical model
of top- down
paternalism Anna however had the tarity
to basically tell Freud to just shut up
and listen and because Freud kind of
needed the business he went along with
it as an experiment and lo and behold he
discovered that in this patient at least
her neurotic symptoms did improve when
he just shut up and let her talk a lot
of women in my audience are probably
rolling their eyes at this given moment
but it was kind of a revolutionary
moment in the history of Psychiatry the
foundations of modern Psychotherapy are
firmly rooted in this notion that the
very Act of talking about your thoughts
and feelings is inherently therapeutic
and cathartic and I do think that there
is some truth to that but I also think
that there are some significant gender
differences in communication Styles the
idea that talking about your feelings or
exploring your experience is helpful or

[04:01]
exploring your experience is helpful or
rewarding is kind of absurd to a lot of
guys they look at therapy and think you
mean I got to pay someone 200 bucks an
hour to sit there and listen to me
complain how does that actually solve
anything how about I keep my 200 bucks
and tell it to a brick wall
instead men tend to be more logical and
rational and they approach their
difficulties from a problemsolving
perspective whereas women tend to be
more emotional and intuitive than they
approach their difficulties from an
emotional coping perspective I'm not
saying that women can't be rational or
men can't be emotional but that on a
population
level these differences tend to emerge
statistically and on the whole the
mental health profession has a
reputation for using and actually does
use non-directive emotional coping
approaches far more often than directive
problem solving strategies and that's a
bias that tends to conform with a more

[05:00]
bias that tends to conform with a more
feminine approach to difficulties it's
not the right approach nor is it the
wrong approach but it is just one
approach albeit an approach that
currently enjoys a pretty substantial
professional market share and I think
that it's this reputation of the mental
health profession that keeps a lot of
men away men don't see talking about
problems as an end in itself and I tend
to agree with them and that's why men
tend to resonate with my Approach to
therapy which is very active challenging
rational directive and practical however
my Approach is not a common one and I
think that's kind of a problem I think
it's one of the ways and there are
several in which my profession fails men
and I think that if this were addressed
if the rational argument for
Psychotherapy were made I think we'd see
more men use Mental Health Services than
we will as a result of the General
Public public campaigns to reduce stigma

[06:02]
Public public campaigns to reduce stigma
and that would be good both for men and
the women they love that's it for today
