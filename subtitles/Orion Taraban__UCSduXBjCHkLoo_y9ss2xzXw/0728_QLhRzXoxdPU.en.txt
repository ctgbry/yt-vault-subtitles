romance is for men that is it's a sexual
strategy utilized by unsuccessful men
the idea here is that these men may not
yet have a lot of what women might be
looking for with respect to a long-term
relationship he may not yet have
stability or lifestyle or status or
career or wealth so how can such a man
possibly compete with the men who do he
can use romance he can stimulate the
woman's emotions why because he has the
time but he doesn't have the money now
romance doesn't require money it doesn't
but it absolutely does require time and
effort and thoughtfulness it's about
going that extra mile to show that you
listen that you care that you cherish
and unless our guy is extremely
attractive this might be the
unsuccessful man's best shot at
competing with the men who can offer
more tangible benefits like if you can't
put a woman in a house or fly her to
Fiji or pay her bills you better be able
to light some candles or leave a
handwritten note you know what I mean
and if you're not willing to do that and
you're not very attractive then best of
luck to you
