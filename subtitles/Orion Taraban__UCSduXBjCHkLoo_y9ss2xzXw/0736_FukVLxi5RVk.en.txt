I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the three
phases of
relationships as I discuss in my book
every relationship has three phases this
is true regardless of whether the
relationship in question lasts for an
evening or for the rest of your life
let's get to it the three phases are
attraction
negotiation and maintenance they always
happen in that order for what I assume
to be obvious reasons it's not possible
to maintain a relationship that hasn't
yet been contracted and you won't be
able to contract a relationship unless
both parties are sufficiently interested
in doing so and since relationships
always progress through this sequence
you can more effectively troubleshoot
where you seem to be getting stuck for
instance if you're not getting any dates
whatsoever you have an issue with
attraction on the other hand if you're
going out on dates but never seem to get

[01:02]
going out on dates but never seem to get
anywhere you have an issue with
negotiation and finally if you're ending
up in tempestuous short-term
relationships or unsatisfying long-term
relationships you have an issue with
maintenance each phase of relationships
has its own set of problems and requires
its own Suite of skills to navigate what
works to maintain won't work to attract
and vice versa now one one thing I
failed to mention in the book and what I
want to address in today's episode is
that though relationships always proceed
through the three phases in that order
it's wrong to think that any phase once
initiated ever terminates that is once
you're in a particular phase you remain
in it for as long as that particular
relationship lasts once it starts it
never stops what does this mean

[02:00]
never stops what does this mean
if you succeed in the attraction phase
your reward is that you now get to start
negotiating however that doesn't mean
that you get to stop attracting you
never get to stop attracting because
your relationship will fall apart
sometimes slow sometimes fast if you
stop doing so by the same token if you
succeed in the negotiation phase your
reward is that you now get to start
maintaining however that doesn't mean
you get to stop negotiating you never
get to stop negotiating because your
relationship will fall apart sometimes
slow sometimes fast if you stop doing so
in fact maintaining attraction and
satisfying terms is a big part of what
the maintenance phase is all about let's
look at each in
turn too many people men and women
mistakenly believe that once they have
captured someone's affections

[03:00]
captured someone's affections
they do not have to worry about
maintaining their partner's
attraction this is not the case however
it happens because much of courtship is
expensive and uncomfortable and
uncertain as a result many people don't
really enjoy dating and would if
possible rather just skip right to the
maintenance phase where the relationship
is more easy secure and
established the issue with this itude is
that a big part of why your partner
chose to contract with you and not with
any other person to whom they had access
was that he or she was attracted to you
and vice versa threatening the basis
upon which a relationship was initially
founded is not a very wise strategy for
maintaining said
relationship and while women can
certainly stop making an effort to
maintain their partner's attraction it
is much more problematic when men do the

[04:00]
is much more problematic when men do the
same this is because For Better or Worse
men tend to tough it out longer than
women often out of a sense of Duty or
obligation women don't tend to stick
around nearly as long so failing to
sufficiently maintain a woman's
attraction will more critically
jeopardize the
relationship as I discussed in a
previous episode everything you do as a
man in a relationship will be perceived
through a woman's lens of Attraction her
level of attraction more than anything
you actually do or don't do in that
relationship will determine her
satisfaction with the relationship and
the degree to which she will treat you
with appreciation love and
respect this means men that on some
level you can never stop gaming your
girl even if she's your wife like
especially if she's your wife you need
to stimulate her emotion keep her a

[05:00]
to stimulate her emotion keep her a
little off balance give her something to
look forward to etc etc etc and of
course you have to maintain an
attractive Presence at all times if you
neglect any of these things her
attraction is going to dip and you'll
have to start putting out lots of little
fires there could be bickering or
nagging or withdrawal or niggling
disrespect and if it drops too low full
out conflict or sexlessness or divorce I
wish this weren't the case like I wish
there was something you could do to
attract someone for well and good once
and for all but this is just how it is
accept it and Thrive resist it and
suffer if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and

[06:00]
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description now let's move on to the
next phase as stated previously once you
succeed in the negotiation phase your
reward is that you now get to start
maintaining but that doesn't mean you
get to stop negotiating too many people
men and women mistakenly believe that
once they have defined the terms of a
relationship they don't have to worry
about maintaining those terms over time
in point of fact relationships are
negotiated and
renegotiated constantly however not in
the way that most people think
the context of my economic model the

[07:01]
the context of my economic model the
term negotiation can trip people up it
can conjure images of a boardroom in
which the parties explicitly Define the
terms of the relationship and
aggressively barter for their own
self-interest and this almost never
happens most people in fact would be
very put off by that approach as one of
the unspoken rules of romantic
relationships is that the terms of the
transaction should be mystified behind a
veil of indirectness and suggestion as
much as possible the closest most people
come to explicitly negotiating is when
they have the defined the relationship
conversation in which they both pretend
to understand what the other means by
exclusive the vast majority of a
relationship is negotiated tacitly
unconsciously and more importantly
behaviorally what does this mean people
are constantly in the process of
becoming who they are which means that
people are constantly changing and this
means that they're going to be showing

[08:00]
means that they're going to be showing
up in your relationship in new and
different ways some of these new and
different ways you will like others not
so much however in either case a
relationship is
renegotiated based on how you respond
when your partner exhibits new and
different
Behavior to take a common example let's
say that a man gets involved with a
woman who at the beginning of the
relationship exhibits a very high beo
and desire for sex over the course of
their courtship they tacitly
unconsciously and behaviorally negotiate
the price of her sexual opportunity
let's say it's a date once a week Over
time however this price gets
renegotiated if the man is not careful
he might end up in a situation where he
is bankrolling her entire lifestyle in
exchange for a perun tumble once a

[09:00]
exchange for a perun tumble once a
quarter neither likely discussed this
explicitly or directly but over time the
man came to pay more for Less a
renegotiation that was enacted
insidiously and
behaviorally and this was accomplished
in large part because the man tolerated
the change he functionally stated with
his behavior that he was okay with
maintaining or even increasing his
provision in exchange for Less frequent
sexual encounters in most cases nothing
is explicitly contracted or consciously
decided but the result is the same this
is how relationships are renegotiated
over time and this is why frame
management is such an important
consideration for successful
relationships men often have more power
and control at the beginning of a
relationship but they tend to seed that
power and control to their women over
time through a number of small

[10:03]
time through a number of small
concessions if a woman tries to move the
goalposts too soon most men will bulk
and run for the hills but if she moves
them gradually and after she has
succeeded in hooking him emotionally
many men won't even notice the way the
relationship is renegotiated to be more
aligned with her interests and
objectives unfortunately the more power
and control a woman woman assumes the
more she enters into her masculine and
the more the man enters into his
feminine which can diminish the
attraction upon which the relationship
is largely based destabilizing it as
previously discussed this is why men
must remain Vigilant with respect to
these tacit bids for renegotiation which
can occur at any time once a
relationship has been contracted by
maintaining attraction and managing
frame relationships thrive

[11:00]
frame relationships thrive
and desire can even increase over time
sexlessness is not the fate of all
relationships it's the Doom of
mismanaged ones take that under
consideration what do you think does
