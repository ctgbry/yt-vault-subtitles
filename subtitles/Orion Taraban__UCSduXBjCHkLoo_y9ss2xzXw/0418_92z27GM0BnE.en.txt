I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic today short talk is how to be a
man
it's a simple question and one that 100
years ago would be ludicrous to ask
because back then everyone just sort of
knew what the answer was but here we are
in modern times characterized among
other things by an identity crisis in
men how we got here is extremely complex
but here is where we are
now some forms of masculinity such as
machismo masculinity are fairly complex
this is because they are performances of
an Unwritten etiquette with evolving
rules and standards
however this form of masculinity as much
as fem femininity is essentially
performative
neither is a natural Suite of behaviors
and each is an expression of a
particular time and place these forms of
masculinity and femininity can be

[01:00]
masculinity and femininity can be
learned and skillful execution of their
respective Suites of behaviors both
Express and confirm status in men and
women
many of the answers you'll hear on the
internet to the question of how to be a
man correspond with performative
masculinity
there are things that you can do to
signify your man's status with props
costumes and postures
these could be things like grow a beard
lift heavy stuff start a business go
fishing go hunting learn to start a fire
learn to drive a manual transmission
learn to seduce women learn to fight
learn to shoot a gun learn to grill a
ribeye steak talk knowledgeably about
sports drink beer and appreciate whiskey
Etc
now I don't have a problem with any of
those things a lot of them sound fun and
could prove beneficial to the individual
in question however I do think that all
of those responses suffer from defining
masculinity essentially as a suite of

[02:01]
masculinity essentially as a suite of
behaviors as a performance
now I have a different take on this
question as you can see
I'm not a guy who's very performatively
masculine
I work with words in a very feminized
profession I've never played football or
scaled a fish or rope to calf
however when it comes down to it I'm
extremely masculine
and this is because what it means to be
a man is very simple
and only marginally associated with what
you do or what you look like
are you ready
to be a man is very simple
you need only two things
you need a spine
and you need some balls
that's it
if you have a spine and you have some
balls then you're a man
and just so we're clear I'm not talking
literally all humans have a spine and
all males have balls what I'm talking
about is a spine and a pair figuratively
it's simple but not necessarily easy

[03:02]
it's simple but not necessarily easy
let's talk about each one individually
shall we first what does it mean to have
a spine
spine means that you are willing to
stand up
anatomically you need a spine to stand
erect figuratively you need a spine to
stand up for what you believe to be true
which is in your heart of hearts Who You
Are
in this of course presupposes that you
actually know what you believe to be
true and this ain't easy
most of the things in your head were put
there by other people and a lot of that
stuff is total garbage
for most people it takes years and years
of patient self-study to learn what they
believe to be true
so young guys get a pass here though
it's important to acknowledge that we
tend to make their jobs Harder by
filling them up with so much distracting
nonsense to begin with
however there are many older guys men

[04:00]
however there are many older guys men
who I speak with on a regular basis who
don't know what their values are
don't know what they believe to be true
and consequently don't know who the [ __ ]
they are
and how are you going to stand up for
something if you don't know what that
something is
now before I go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing then please
consider sending this episode to someone
who might benefit from its message
because it's Word of Mouth referrals
like this that really help to make the
channel grow and if you're liking what
you're hearing you can hit the super
thanks button it's those three little
dots in the lower right hand corner and
tip me in proportion to the value you
believe you've received from this
episode I really appreciate your support
now having a spine also lets you know
where you stand in relation to the
universe
this is because as soon as you stand up
you cast a shadow which situates you in
a specific Place between the heavens
literally the Sun and the Earth your
immediate surroundings
unless you are completely in line with

[05:02]
unless you are completely in line with
the light there is no way to avoid
casting a shadow on this plane
among other things this means that as
soon as you stand up that is as soon as
you make it known who you are and what
you believe in
you will attract an antithetical element
in opposition to that the shadow
people will disagree with you people
will disapprove of you some people will
despise you and the taller you stand the
more some people will threaten attack
and seek to destroy you
this is part of the risk of standing up
and having a spine and this of course is
why we rightly respect people who stand
up for what is Right despite the
personal risk of doing so
what's strange is that the alternative
to doing this that is remaining
spineless isn't all that great either
you go through life never really knowing
who you are and what you believe in

[06:01]
who you are and what you believe in
now it often happens that some people do
know who they are and do know what they
believe in
however they're never able to find their
place in the world
because they weren't willing to stand up
from their hiding places and say
this is me
this is because doing so requires the
second ingredient
a pair of balls
having a pair means that you're willing
to suffer the risk associated with being
somebody
a specific individual with values and
beliefs it means putting your money
where your mouth is it means not giving
a [ __ ] whether you agree with me or
disagree with me not giving a [ __ ]
whether you approve or disapprove of me
not giving a [ __ ] if you love or hate me
it means if necessary putting your money
your relationships your career your
status your reputation and even your

[07:00]
status your reputation and even your
life on the line in the service of what
you believe to be true
if you have a spine with no balls you
spend your life hiding hiding from your
friends hiding from your women and
ultimately hiding from yourself
well you technically can't do anything
to earn respect in the sense that you
cannot make someone respect you
especially if for whatever reason they
have a mind not to you can significantly
increase the probability that you will
Garner respect from other men and from
women in general by having a spine and
growing a pair
we respect those who are willing to hold
the line and stand up for what they
believe in regardless of the
consequences
paradoxically we like those who don't
seem to care whether we like them or not
on the other hand we typically have
neither respect nor appreciation for
those who do things so that we might
like them
let's recap if you know who you are what
you believe to be true
and if you're willing to stand up and

[08:01]
and if you're willing to stand up and
risk it all in the service of those
beliefs
in the service of your mission then
congratulations my friend you are a man
you do not need to grow a beard
you do not need to hunt or care about
football or drink everyone under the
table or plow through half the women in
town
you need a spine and some balls if you
have all the other things but you don't
have a spine and some balls then you're
not a man in my opinion and if you have
none of those other things but you do
have a spine and some balls then you're
a full-fledged man
hopefully that clears some things up
