I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is what to
do if you are bored in a relationship
now this advice applies equally to all
kinds of relationships it will work in a
platonic relationship or a familial
relationship or a romantic relationship
and it's actually very simple I
guarantee it's something that you can do
right away as you are at absolutely
no expense just like solving any other
problem if you want to stop feeling
bored in a relationship all you need to
do is change your behavior with respect
to the underlying causal issue so why
are you feeling bored what is the
underlying causal issue I guarantee that
in every relationship in which you have
ever felt bored you have felt bored
because the two of you for whatever

[01:00]
because the two of you for whatever
reason stopped telling each other the
truth so the solution to any
relationship plagued by boredom is to
start telling the truth I assure you if
you start telling the truth you won't be
bored for very long and I don't mean
tell the truth in the sense of some
objective Universal wisdom I mean tell
the truth in the sense of your personal
lived experience
if you are bored in your marriage go up
to your wife open your mouth and say I'm
bored with our marriage lately I've been
fantasizing about having an affair or
getting a divorce or just going out for
cigarettes and never coming back and
that's because the only other emotion I
can remember feeling recently besides
boredom is a vague sense of dread that
I'm going to spend the rest of what
could be the only life I'm ever going to
have suffocating in a middling lukewarm

[02:02]
have suffocating in a middling lukewarm
existence of comfort and
complacency guess what your marriage
isn't going to be boring anymore and
that's because depending on the
emotional maturity of your partner
you're either going to fight well if
that's how you feel just pack your bags
and go or you're going to feel like
larger and more present which will be a
relief because you're bringing more of
yourself to the relationship
I had no idea you felt that way or
you're going to learn that there's still
plenty that you don't know about this
other person oh I'm so glad that you
said that I thought I was the only
one however no matter the outcome your
experience of the relationship will have
shifted significantly and you may no
longer be able to rely on your old
scripts and evasions the truth is out
and must be cont ended with and while

[03:01]
and must be cont ended with and while
potentially uncomfortable this is
probably better than any other
alternative now some of you might be
thinking oh no thanks Orion I think I'd
prefer boredom to potential conflict and
it's like fair enough people need to
choose their battles maybe the boredom
wasn't all that bad and you need to
learn how to tolerate a modum of it in
your
relationships on the other hand perhaps
you tolerate boredom because it's the
emotional consequence of a c-dependent
compromise
solution many people actually don't want
to know the truth because if they knew
the truth they might have to actually do
something about it which Beyond just
requiring effort might very well be
painful and discomforting besides and
this is why people who start telling the
truth are almost universally punished by
their communities to begin with the

[04:01]
their communities to begin with the
truth creates a necessity for change
which is uncomfortable and expensive and
potentially something no one else asked
for the truth might also require giving
up certain benefits or privileges that
inhere in the status quo this often
produces a kind of implied understanding
between the people in the relationship
namely I'm not really going to show up
or ask about your truth and you're not
really going to show up or ask about my
truth and we're both going to pretend
that neither one of us knows about
either one of us knowing about this
Arrangement neither person wants to go
through the trouble of changing that the
truth would
necessitate but neither person is
willing to forgo the benefits and
security of the relationship by
jeopardizing the compromise solution it
represents now before I go any further

[05:01]
represents now before I go any further

donating to me directly through venmo I
really appreciate your support it's
donations like that that help keep all
this going thank you very
much so that that's how people end up
bored in their relationships they rely
more and more on scripts and roles and
kind of end up just going through the
motions the relationship is maintained
but there is a distinct absence of
emotional intimacy and this not only
creates boredom it creates loneliness
contrary to popular belief loneliness
isn't caused by being alone it's caused
by being around people who you cannot
connect with emotionally this is why in

[06:02]
connect with emotionally this is why in
my opinion the loneliest place in the
world is New York City no matter where
you go you're surrounded by people who
won't even look you in the eye and the
loneliest I personally have ever felt in
my life was sleeping next to a woman who
didn't see me for who I was so the idea
here is to start
telling the truth to
people with whom you're in close
personal relationship as best you can
but that doesn't mean the full
unvarnished truth the full unvarnished
truth is like looking straight at the
sun no one can really take too much of
that and here's the thing very often
telling people the unvarnished truth is
actually a different form of
hiding those who have no censor and just
speak their truth all the time irresp
perspective of other people's feelings

[07:01]
perspective of other people's feelings
might be hiding from their own
suppressed dependency and the degree to
which they need relationships for their
own Survival and well-being they hide
also from their own gentler feelings
feelings like kindness or Compassion or
benevolence and thereby live in a
falsified version of reality now this
doesn't mean we should lie to spare
someone else's feelings though to be
honest that
can be called for from time to time it
means we should strive to find ways to
tell the
truth in ways that other people can hear
without feeling
brutalized also telling the truth is
less about revealing your deep dark
secrets and more about sharing your
actual lived emotional experience which
is the ultimate substance of Our Lives
this sharing is not really a Litany of
facts first this happened to me then
this this than that but a willingness to

[08:01]
this this than that but a willingness to
communicate your internal experience and
this is because in order to be loved you
have to risk being known people can only
love to the depth of their understanding
anything beyond that is an infatuation
based on projected fantasy you will make
your connections infinitely more vital
by bringing that emotional immediacy
back into your relationships
emotions are like the weather like the
weather they're connected to the
everchanging present moment and they're
indispensible to The NeverEnding process
of growth Decay and renewal that is
isomorphic with nature a relationship
without emotions would be like a planet
without an atmosphere static and
suffocating and one of the names we give
this sense of Suffocation is boredom so
if you've been feeling this in the
context of your close relationships it

[09:02]
context of your close relationships it
might be time to bring more of your
lived experience into these Dynamics and
you can start with your experience of
feeling
