These days we hear a lot about a woman's
emotional labor in the context of their
relationships. That is all the effort
the woman pours into her relationship to
keep her man and maintain his
commitment. But what women have to
understand is that everything that a man
did before sex was emotional labor for
him. It was emotional labor for the man
to be charming when he didn't feel like
it. To plan dates around your tastes and
preferences instead of his own. to
listen to your stories when you may
actually not be very interesting. To put
in the effort to stimulate and excite
and arouse your emotions, and he might
have done all these things even when he
didn't feel like doing so. Why? Because
if he didn't, he wouldn't attain the
outcome he hoped for, and no one would
have any sympathy for him in this case.
By the same token, women should expect
to perform emotional labor to keep their
relationships. They might have to
support their boyfriends or husbands
even when they don't feel like it. They
may have to maintain their physical
appearance to keep up their boyfriends

appearance to keep up their boyfriends
or husband's attraction even when they
don't feel like it. They may have to
suppress their own needs and emotions
even when they don't feel like it. They
may have to make their boyfriends or
husbands feel useful and respected and
loved even when they don't feel like it.
Because trust me, the men did the same
thing to get you. If they weren't
willing to perform that emotional labor,
they wouldn't have gotten laid. There
would be no relationship and you
wouldn't be with them today. That's the
other side of the coin. So no
complaining.
