I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is Mother
Love versus father love a lot of the
issues that people face in their adult
lives stem from failures in their
childhood environments and in my
experience these issues tend to look a
little different depending on whether
they originated in the failure or
absence of the mother or of the father
so today I want to talk a little bit
about this idea that Mother Love might
somehow be different and distinct from
father love and vice versa let's start
with Mother Love Mother Love in its
ideal state is probably the closest
thing to unconditional love that you can
find between two human beings that child
grew and developed inside the mother's
own body and was nourished and
maintained by that mother for some time
afterwards it's really a flesh in my

[01:00]
afterwards it's really a flesh in my
Flesh Blood of My Blood kind of a thing
and I think that when a woman goes
through that process and puts all that
time and effort and Care into forming
the physical structure of a human being
and delivering it into the world and
nourishing it with her own milk and
bonding with it at such an intimate
level and over such a prolonged period
of time then she often cultivates a kind
of unconditional positive regard for
that
child this regard is similar to the
balanced positive regard that healthy
high functioning people feel about
themselves like these people might fail
they might make mistakes but that
doesn't mean that they beat themselves
up about it or talk down to themselves
as a result and I think these two things
Mother Love and healthy self-regard are
related to each other like when children
receive this unconditional positive
regard from their mothers it allows them
to feel irrespective of their status or
achievements that they are good enough

[02:01]
achievements that they are good enough
and therefore are assured of some
measure of comfort and security and
provision on the other hand when this
doesn't happen when there is no mother
in the picture or when the mother is
corrupted on some level then the child
can develop a mommy wound the essence of
a mommy wound is the deep and pervasive
feeling that one does not deserve to
exist aband
either physically or emotionally by
their mothers such people have no Safe
Haven either in the world or in their
own minds they must atone for the sin of
being unlovable by their own mothers
this is why those with Mommy wounds so
often turn into people Pleasers they are
trying to be sufficiently acceptable to
marit receiving from others what they
were never given by their mothers these
folks tend to be agreeable pushovers who

[03:01]
folks tend to be agreeable pushovers who
have a knack for choosing Partners who
do not really love them and so often end
up feeling hurt and betrayed by others
after all they did for them they don't
understand why despite all their efforts
they never seem to feel at home anywhere
not in their minds not in their bodies
and not in their
relationships but here's the thing even
in an ideal situation even if they had a
perfect mother to infuse them with that
unconditional positive regard this can
still create issues for people this is
because while it might be important for
children to feel that regard at certain
stages of their development no adult is
entitled to that and no adult receives
it expecting that kind of unconditional
positive regard as an adult is
functionally akin to moving through the
world as a narcissistic child and this

[04:00]
world as a narcissistic child and this
is where daddy comes into the
picture if you appreciate the insights
on this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook Audi book and
paperback formats the links are in the
description father love is conditional
or at any rate more conditional than the
positive regard children receive from
their mothers under ideal conditions as
men fathers are more are likely to

[05:00]
men fathers are more are likely to
understand that people are entitled to
nothing in this life life isn't always
fair at least not in the way that most
people think about fairness there is
inequality and preference and scarcity
in specifics not everybody wins not
everybody lives happily ever after a
decent adulthood requires the
willingness and ability to successfully
compete in The Game of Life
now the key to competing successfully in
life no matter the Endeavor is some
level of skillfulness or Mastery and
people vary
significantly in this regard like a
child could finger paint a mess of
primary colors and Mom would still put
it on the fridge with much ooing and
awing on the other hand dad might think
well this is some and tell the
kid there's some room to improve like
you might want to work on your form

[06:00]
you might want to work on your form
there Junior this is because father love
strategically withholds approval in
order not to Gaslight the child into the
false belief that his don't
stink when it's done well father love
kind of serves as an analog for the
larger society the world that ostensibly
the parents are preparing the child to
enter by making his praise and approval
contingent father love can not only
contribute to the development of Mastery
but also to the cultivation of
discipline raising children without
discipline is actually a form of abuse
as it functionally ensures an adulthood
of failure conflict and unhappy
relationships as children age the
consequences inside the house must
increasingly approximate the
consequences outside of it and providing
additional positive regard to young

[07:01]
additional positive regard to young
people irrespective of what they do or
don't do ill prepares them for life this
is why Mother Love is more important in
the first half of childhood and father
love is more important in the second it
must be safe to fall if children are to
learn to walk however it must be unsafe
to fail if children are to learn to
succeed by by serving as representatives
of the outside world where there are
winners and losers fathers prepare
children to compete successfully in that
outside world after they leave the house
and hopefully they don't come back like
no parent wants to welcome their adult
child back into the house after an
unsuccessful launch
right however when this doesn't happen
when there is no father in the picture
or when the father is corrupted on some
level then the child can develop a daddy

[08:02]
level then the child can develop a daddy
wound the essence of a daddy wound is
the deep and pervasive feeling that one
is a failure when corrupted father love
can be punitive sadistic or even
tyranical such children are never
praised or acknowledged despite their
efforts or even their legitimate
accomplishments this can cultivate a
profound experience of hopelessness and
despair since no matter what they do
it's apparently never good
enough this causes some folks to become
mired in various forms of self-sabotage
and others to become villainous in their
Rebellion against all kinds of authority
and Order however in most cases those
with Daddy wounds are motivated by an
unrelenting avarice for money for
success for achievement for recognition
for praise for
attention when they're famous or rich or

[09:00]
attention when they're famous or rich or
powerful they believe they will have
finally earned the father love they were
once denied ultimately it doesn't work
that way in reality however as people
can't solve internal problems with
external
solutions that said even in an ideal
situation even if they had a perfect
father who appropriately titrated his
praise and acknowledgement to
achievement this can still create issues
for people in the absence of the
conditional positive regard of mother
love children can grow up thinking that
everything must be earned and transacted
even things like love and friendship
that are impossible to earn or
transact ultimately both wounds lead to
similar outcomes high levels of anxiety
and depression which in turn can be
masked or numbed with addictions and
distractions of all kinds and of course
such folks almost always have difficult
conflictual or unsatisfying relation
ships at least while their wounds remain

[10:02]
ships at least while their wounds remain
unhealed and while it is possible to
heal these wounds it can take a good
deal of time and effort to do so however
