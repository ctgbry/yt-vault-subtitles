It seems like we're finding a a thin
line between how much you communicate
about these types of issues versus how
much you don't communicate because it
might kill some of the natural
attractiveness to the opposite sex.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's tricky and of course every
individual couple needs to work this out
for themselves. But I would at this
point make a little distinction between
talking and communication.
&gt;&gt; Okay,
&gt;&gt; talking is a form of communication, but
not all communication is talking. And I
do think talking for the most part is
overrated, especially around things
having to do in the bedroom. Talking
about sexual needs and desires requires
a great deal of emotional maturity,
self-nowledge, um, confidence,
vocabulary, even can be obstructive to
some people. So, it's not like you can't
do it, but it's kind of the advanced
course. And both parties need to be
there. One person could be the most
competent, accepting, open-minded,
effective communicator if, but if his or
her partner is not, it's going to be

her partner is not, it's going to be
very difficult to tease that out. It's
not impossible, but it's going to be
difficult. By the same token, people
kind of tell us what they want and what
they don't want, what they like and what
they don't like, but they communicate in
other ways besides their explicit words.
They communicate with their expression,
with their tone, with their proxmics,
&gt;&gt; body language. body language with the
we we need to get better at potentially
picking up on those cues as opposed to
relying on well everything needs to be
explicit verbally discussed. There's a
time and a place for that but it does
kill the vibe. Let's put it that way.
