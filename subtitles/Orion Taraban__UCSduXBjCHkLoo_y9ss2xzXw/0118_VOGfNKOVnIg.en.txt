i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
a good craftsman
has one scar
so one of my all-time favorite authors
is haruki murakami i've read everything
he's ever published
though i don't think it's his most
technically accomplished work my
personal favorite is one of his books
that doesn't get a lot of air time
it's called hard-boiled wonderland and
the end of the world
it's
very very imaginative i've never read
anything like it i really really like
this book
um and in this book is an excellent line
which is the title of this episode
namely a good craftsman has
one scar
i read this book years ago and this
phrase still stays with me today let's
break it down
why
would a good craftsman have one scar

[01:00]
would a good craftsman have one scar
well
a craftsman without any scars
has not yet learned his limits
almost certainly he is capable of more
than he has already achieved
on the other hand
a craftsman with more than one scar
has not yet learned to respect his
limits
he has yet to integrate the lessons of
his past
a craftsman with one scar
knows exactly how far he can push his
skill
and so maximizes his ability
before it becomes dangerous
and so minimizes his liability
if you don't have a scar
then most likely you still have room to
play
and if you have multiple scars
then you still haven't internalized the
boundaries of the field
it's a really simple phrase that i
believe contains a lot of wisdom and i
wanted to share that one with you today
