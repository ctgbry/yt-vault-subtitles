We're having this discussion about the
concept of gender norms. So like a
gender norm would be men go out and
work, women would stay at home with the
kids or whatever. Um, you know, a gender
norm would be men are more, you know,
more stoic and women are more expressive
of those kind of things. You know, one
of the things I I started to look at it
from like an evolutionary psychology
standpoint and I was like, is it men who
are perpetuating these gender norms? And
then I I start like looking at why is it
that men are more aggressive, more
assertive, more dominant, you know, more
ambitious? And then I was just like,
well, they're doing it in service of
women or at least historically
throughout time they have. And then I
just I look at it more and I'm like,
these gender roles are not enforced
through some patriarchal convention.
They're enforced because of women. Like
the reason why women complain about, you
know, I want men who are more sensitive.
It's because they kept sleeping with men
who weren't. Those men kept having
children, right? Women keep complaining
about men who like don't express
themselves. It's because those were the
men you had sex with for the last
200,000 years. And then Yeah. Yeah, I
don't know what you think about this,
but I I get the I get the vibe that it's
really women who enforce these gender

really women who enforce these gender
norms more so than men.
&gt;&gt; I think it does work both ways because
men do choose women. I mean, they're
stereotypically less choosy than the
women are when it comes to their sexual
partnering.
&gt;&gt; Uh, and there could be a sexual strategy
about that. But yes, it's like the
gendered characteristics to the extent
that they're biologically embedded are
due to sexual selection over hundreds of
thousands of years. Absolutely. And we
got here because this was our best
collective solution to problems of
