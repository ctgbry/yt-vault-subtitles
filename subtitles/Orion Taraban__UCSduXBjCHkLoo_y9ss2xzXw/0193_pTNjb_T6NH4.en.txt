i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
the threshold of tolerance
so it can happen that in the course of
our relationships whether they're with
family or with friends or with romantic
partners that we become the object of
other people's displeasure
disrespect and negativity
and there's this question that i think
goes through most reasonable people's
minds which is basically how much is
enough
like at what point does this behavior
become intolerable at what point should
i speak up or fight back at what point
should i leave the relationship
now there's no one-size-fits-all answer
to this question but i have a very
simple rule of thumb
to identify the threshold of tolerance
and i call it the stranger on a bus rule
it's very simple
the rule is that the people in my life

[01:00]
the rule is that the people in my life
need to treat me at least as well as
they would treat a stranger on a bus
or they lose the privilege of my company
it's that simple
if someone in my life treats someone
that they don't know in a social
capacity better than they treat me
behind closed doors that's not tolerable
that's not acceptable and is potentially
very dangerous and this is because those
close to me have the opportunity to do
significantly more damage to me than
those kept at a distance
since they have access to my
vulnerabilities in my past they can
potentially weaponize that intimacy
and if they choose to do so that would
be a fundamental betrayal of my trust
which would render the relationship
contract null and void
now i understand that i'm not perfect i
understand that people are going to
disagree with me and i understand that
people are just going to have bad days
however i still expect
that people treat me with the same
degree of courtesy and respect

[02:01]
degree of courtesy and respect
that they would exercise in dealing with
a stranger on a bus
especially the stranger who may even be
acting in a flagrantly annoying fashion
in my relationships i expect at least
that level of dignity and respect i
don't think that's that's too much to
ask
and if they're not going to provide it
for whatever reason
i'm going to take myself out of that
relationship a relationship with me is a
privilege not a right and you can think
the same way
