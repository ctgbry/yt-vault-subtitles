I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why men
pay on the first date so this is a
long-standing debate the controversy
predates the internet and there are
strong opinions on both sides of the
table many of which have some Merit for
instance many men nowadays see paying
for dates and outdated chivalric act in
an age when childless women under 30 are
out earning their male counterparts back
in the day most women just didn't have
the financial opportunity that they do
today so why should the financial burden
of dating fall on men
that perspective certainly makes
rational sense but I have a better
argument for the converse today I'm
going to explain why it's really in
men's best interests to pay on the first
date as I discussed in a recent episode
dating is really an extended hiring
process in which the man is the employer
as he is ultimately in a position to
make an offer to the woman

[01:01]
make an offer to the woman
you are the CEO of ucorp and the whole
point of the courtship process is to
give a particular woman the opportunity
to demonstrate that she has the skills
the traits and the attributes necessary
to successfully discharge the role that
you have created at ucorp
it's a chance for her to demonstrate
that she has what you're looking for
because she ain't gonna propose to you
even with all the recent upheavals in
traditional gender roles
so let's re-enter this Frame a bit
let's say that you are a company that is
hiring for a really important role like
a director or a corporate officer
for this kind of position you're likely
going to cast a very wide net to ensure
that you have a sizable pool from which
to select the most qualified applicant
and it might happen that you find a very
compelling applicant that just so
happens to live on the other side of the
country
what are you going to do
well if you're really interested in this

[02:00]
well if you're really interested in this
person you fly her out to you you put
her on a plane you put her up in a hotel
and you expense all her meals you will
go out of your way to demonstrate that
you believe that she has something of
value that she can provide for the
company and of course you do this
because you expect that should you hire
her the value that you will get out of
her productivity will be significantly
greater than the costs expended in the
hiring process like you wouldn't spend
more to get her than you hope to get out
of her right that's bad business but you
would spend some to get more that's good
business
and while whining and dining qualified
applicants is certainly a flex for the
company in question it makes the
tangible immediate impression that the
company is not only solvent but thriving
which can be extremely powerful this
isn't the real reason why companies
foot the bill during the hiring process

[03:02]
foot the bill during the hiring process
here's the real reason let's say that
somewhere in the interview process you
learn that this applicant isn't actually
what you're looking for
since the process exists entirely at
your pleasure as it were you can
terminate the process at any point
without any recourse whatsoever
that's the real reason
paying allows you to walk away without
any complications
and this is good news because when
you're in the sexual Marketplace most
women are not going to be what you're
looking for this means that if you're
doing it right you're going to be doing
a fair share of walking away
paying for a date basically communicates
that you value your time more than you
value your money and that you're in
control of the experience let me tell
you gentlemen there is absolutely no
reason to continue a date with a woman

[04:00]
reason to continue a date with a woman
that you are neither interested in nor
attracted to
I've walked out 10 minutes into a date
once I realized that I wasn't able to do
business
I just put some money on the table and
left she got her free drink and I walked
away and it was much easier for me to do
that because I felt like I didn't owe or
anything
that's what pain communicates I don't
owe you a damn thing

button it's the three buttons three
little dots in the lower right hand
corner and tip me in proportion to the
value you feel you've derived from this
episode because your support makes all
of this happen I really appreciate it
now at this point in the episode a lot
of guys are probably thinking why would
I walk away from a woman that doesn't
make sense Orion especially if the woman
is interested in me and I would respond
that the reason why this doesn't make

[05:00]
that the reason why this doesn't make
sense to you is that you don't yet have
a lot of options when it comes to women
if you can't imagine not hiring an
interested applicant that probably means
that you have only one applicant
and if you have only one applicant the
interview process is an empty formality
at best and a total sham at worst
in order to have any kind of real
evaluation
you need to have points of comparison
and to do that you need to generate
competition the greater the competition
the more likely you're going to find a
qualified applicant and this is because
competition scares away the less
qualified as they correctly believe that
they have no real chance of winning on
the other hand competition motivates
High performers as they see it as an
opportunity to demonstrate their quality
competition is a filter that operates
through self-selection if you don't
believe me just listen to what your mind
tells yourself when you decide not to
approach that nine in a bar

[06:00]
approach that nine in a bar
in any case if you don't yet have
sufficient optionality with women it
likely means that you have to spend more
time and energy resolving the first of
the three captains challenges namely you
need to work on your boat
a lack of optionality is the universe
giving you feedback that your boat is
not sufficiently constructed remember in
this metaphor a sea going vessel is an
emotionally compelling lifestyle if
you're going to invite a woman into your
life you need to have something to
invite her into
and that's your lifestyle and the more
emotionally compelling your lifestyle
the more qualified applicants you're
going to attract and if you do this it
will only be a matter of time before
you'll have to begin turning down women
simply as a practical necessity there
are only so many seats on the ship
to that end it's generally a good idea
to ensure that there is always more
demand for a position that your company
than there are available positions And
in the sexual Marketplace men do this by

[07:02]
in the sexual Marketplace men do this by
being visibly competent
if you're really good at something make
sure that you give people the
opportunity to see it
the larger the crowd the more interest
you attract creating a Perpetual
pipeline of potential applicants
eventually you won't even have to put
out a notice that you're hiring women
will send you resumes on their own

I also hope to be doing some more
podcast appearances soon and I'm
interested in
bringing more folks onto the channel as
appropriate if you think that you would
like me to talk to somebody that you
follow uh on YouTube it's a great idea
for you to reach out to them

[08:01]
for you to reach out to them
to put the idea in their head to invite
me onto their podcast especially if
you're a fan that's generally how
content creators work they listen to
their fan base
um it's hard to invite myself onto
places so a lot of you have been asking
for that this is how you can help make
that happen
in any case
um thank you for listening
