One of the things that people ask is,
"I'm thinking about going sober. How
should I design it? I want to just go
sober. I'm going to stop drinking." I
was like, "Stop drinking, but give
yourself a deadline of when your sort of
period of sobriety is completed."
Because it just allows you to feel like
you're making progress. Now, YouTube has
the timeline bar on the bottom to show
you how far through a video you are. If
the timeline bar bore no resemblance to
how long the video, if it was just this
unlimited timeline bar that just went
off the edge of your screen, you'd have
no idea how much closer you were getting
toward the goal. Whereas, if you say,
I'm going to go sober for 6 months, or
I'm going to go sober for 3 months, or
I'm going to go sober for a year. It's
like there you go. Now, you know, I'm
one month toward whatever goal it is
that I'm doing. And I hope that that it
helps to mediate motivation a lot for
me.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. I worked in addiction
medicine for about two years. I did my
first two years of internship at an
outpatient chemical dependency clinic
and the idea that I would never have a
drink for the rest of my life was one of
the biggest obstacles towards anybody

the biggest obstacles towards anybody
even entertaining the possibility of
some period of sobriety. And that's why
in AA and a lot of 12step programs they
say one day at a time. They truncate
we're just going to get through this one
day and then we'll see what happens
afterwards. I've used that myself when I
was trying to disabuse myself of certain
substances. is I said, "Okay, I'm just
not going to use today. If I still want
to use tomorrow, you know, we'll see."
Of course, I could continue to kick the
can down the road, and if I still had
the craving tomorrow, I could just say,
"I'm just not going to use today." And
that got me through the hardest periods
of of that recovery.
