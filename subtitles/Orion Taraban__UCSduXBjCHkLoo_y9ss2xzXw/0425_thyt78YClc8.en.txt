I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psychs
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why most
marriages fail so we know that the
divorce rate is extremely high in the
Western World more than half of
marriages end in divorce which should be
an absolutely terrifying statistic for
any single man in the west now the
reasons behind this exorbitant divorce
rate are widely debated and hotly
contested and there's a good deal
validity to a lot of these points
especially those that consider the
perverse incentives for women who
initiate the Lion's Share of divorces to
end their marriages however I have a
very simple explanation as to why most
marriages fail that cuts to the heart of
the issue here it is the reason why most
marriages fail is because marriage is
inherently a very humble
institution and because of its

[01:01]
institution and because of its
fundamental humility it cannot support
all the extra that people are
subject to piling on top of that
institution like a bridge that collapses
when it takes on too much weight
marriage is just not designed to support
more than what it was built to do and at
the end of the day what a marriage was
built to do is to provide a context for
people to come together and raise
children that's it
everything on top of that everything
that people are subject to piling on top
of marriage the love the romance the
exclusivity the duty the religiosity the
sacrifice the security the legal status
the social consequences the financial
incentives is heavier than what the
institution of marriage was designed to
support and of these many things it is
love in the sense of romantic love that
is heaviest to Bear the prence of the

[02:00]
is heaviest to Bear the prence of the
love marriage which is a conflation of
two very different things the love
affair and the domestic partnership is
fundamentally to blame for the situation
we find ourselves in today marriage
wasn't designed to be both a structure
for raising children and a container for
passion and fulfillment that like just
doesn't make sense Lamborghini does not
make
minivans and love is just one of many
additional things with which we are
inappropriately subject to burdening
marriage we see a similar Trend in
contemporary attitudes towards work for
instance the function of a job is to
provide people with an opportunity to
earn money in exchange for a
service that's it everything on top of
that is additional weight that the
institution of a job was not designed to
support a job was not designed to be
fulfilling it was not meant to be a
source of meaning it was not meant to
provide you with an identity and it

[03:01]
provide you with an identity and it
certainly wasn't designed to be exciting
or fun the institution of a job was
created to provide people with the
opportunity to earn money in exchange
for a service anything on top of that is
more than the institution was
fundamentally designed to support it is
not necessarily a problem when a job
that pays well is not fulfilling the
problem is expecting fulfillment from a
job that pays well do you understand now

it's your donations that make all this
happen thank you for your
support so work and marriage are humble
institutions and for a very long time
marriage was basically understood to be

[04:01]
marriage was basically understood to be
a kind of work that is it was two people
who joined together to accomplish a
specific purpose namely to raise
children you didn't have to love the
person you were doing this with hell you
didn't even have to particularly like
them much like it is unnecessary for you
to love or even like your co-workers in
order to do your job you don't get to
choose your co-workers and for a long
time people didn't get to choose their
spouses but you kind of found a way to
make it work because you know that's
your
job no one really expects to work at a
company where their co-workers are their
best friends that is both unrealistic
and unnecessary however people have no
problem believing that their spouses
should not only be their co-parents but
also their best friends and their
passionate lovers and their coaches and
their cheerleaders and their drinking

[05:01]
their cheerleaders and their drinking
buddies and their therapists and their
biggest fans and their social trophies
etc etc
etc it should go without saying but no
one person can be all those things to
anyone
else and this is why marriages fail we
want it to be more than it is and so we
expect our partners to be more than they
are one of my favorite authors Kurt Von
had an interesting take on this this is
from one of his later collections God
bless you Dr kavorkian and he writes
okay now let's have some fun let's talk
about sex let's talk about women Freud
said that he didn't know what women
wanted I know what women want they want
a whole lot of people to talk to what do
they want to talk about they want to
talk about everything what do men want
they want a lot of Pals and they wish
people weren't so mad at
them why are so many people getting
divorced today it's because most most of
us don't have extended families anymore

[06:02]
us don't have extended families anymore
it used to be that when a man and a
woman got married the bride got a lot
more people to talk to about everything
and the groom got a lot more Pals to
tell dumb jokes to but most of us if we
get married nowadays are just one more
person for the other person the groom
gets one more pal but it's a woman the
woman gets one more person to talk to
about everything but it's a man the
couple has an argument they may think
it's about money or power or sex or how
to raise the kids or whatever what
they're really saying to each other
though without realizing it is this you
are not enough
people end quote that is absolutely
correct the reason why most marriages
fail is because you are not enough
people you are not supposed to be enough
people you are never designed to be
enough people and you cannot be enough
people irrespective of who you are and
who you decide to partner with the idea

[07:00]
who you decide to partner with the idea
that one relationship should replace and
supersede so many other relationships is
a recipe for
disaster in my opinion for marriage to
be saved it needs to be returned to its
essential state which is one of
Simplicity and
humility this probably isn't going to
win me a lot of fans but we don't even
have to conflate marriage with
religion indeed the idea that marriage
isn't fundamentally a religious
institution will would be difficult for
many people to consider but that's the
fact for example did you know that
marriage didn't become a sacrament of
the Catholic church until
1563 that's 16 centuries after the birth
of Christ however this isn't necessarily
surprising if you understand that
marriage is fundamentally instrument of
social control because it creates
stability at the social level not to
have a bunch of orphaned directionless

[08:01]
have a bunch of orphaned directionless
children running around and so marriage
didn't really become important to the
church until the church itself became an
instrument of social power and
control and on a personal note I don't
put any stock in an organizational rule
that applies to the followers but not to
the leaders Jesus was not married and he
preached that there were no husbands or
wives in heaven that is it is an Earthly
institution nor are the leaders of his
church churches popes priests and the
like they're not married the Buddha was
single judaism's greatest King Solomon
had 500 wives Islam's Muhammad had
multiple wives etc etc etc in fact I
can't think of a founder or head of any
major religion who was monogamously
married but I'm sure that's just a
coincidence so marriage got conflated
with religion a few hundred years ago
then it got confl with love a couple
hundred years ago then as vaget observed
it became isolated in the nuclear unit

[09:00]
it became isolated in the nuclear unit
after the dissolution of the extended
family about 75 years ago and today
we're at the end of 50 years of upheaval
and uncertainty about culture gender and
tradition marriage today is absolutely
unrecognizable from Marriage several
hundred years ago like it's wild that we
still use the same word for it and I'm
afraid that until we collectively
isolate and clarify the many conflated
ideas that have created this Chimera of
an institution the situation will
continue to deteriorate to save marriage
we need a return to Simplicity a
pragmatic
open-mindedness or both you may disagree
with me but that's my take on it what do
