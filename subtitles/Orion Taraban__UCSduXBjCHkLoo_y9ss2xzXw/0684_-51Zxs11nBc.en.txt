I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is making
women feel right is a business so this
is a companion piece to an episode I did
a while back called making men angry is
a business the female counterpart has
been a long time coming and here it is
just to recap making men angry is the
dark side of the manosphere these
content creators present examples of
egregious female behavior in order to
encourage male rage and disgust at the
Imp parent entitlement delusion
selfishness and cruelty of these
particular individuals and they do this
for better or worse because it works
this content drives clicks and Views and
engagement because whether you agree
with it or not it's good television that
is it's emotionally compelling and
addictive it also appeals to a

[01:00]
addictive it also appeals to a
particularly modern male fantasy namely
the desire to see modern women get their
comeuppence the fact of the matter is
that women get away with all kinds of
[ __ ] in today's day and age behavior
that society would never tolerate in a
man few men stand up to women because
doing so is a kind of social suicide in
today's political climate though that
doesn't eliminate the desire to see it
happen
many men through the anonymity of the
internet can live this fantasy
vicariously through the content creators
who are brave or fool hearty enough to
do so so that's the content trap that
tends to ens snare men however the
female version is even more Insidious
it's more Insidious because as big as
the male problem is the female problem
is not only bigger it's more
invisible this trap is Big Business
evenig bigger than the business of

[02:00]
evenig bigger than the business of
making men angry for the simple reason
that women tend to spend more money than
men men might make more money but women
spend more money over 85% of consumer
purchases in the United States are made
by women which is why such a huge
proportion of advertisers tend to cater
to women's values and sensibilities
marketers have learned that tapping into
female fantasy can be insanely
profitable and the way this is done
at least among many content creators
online is by making women feel right the
creators who can make women feel right
are the gendered equivalents of the
creators who make men feel angry and
while I'm not going to name any names
there are many creators online who do
this very very well though they may not
be exhibiting a high degree of Integrity
they are clearly Savvy businessmen and
some of of these creators especially the

[03:01]
some of of these creators especially the
men who do this are making a metric [ __ ]
ton of money off these women by telling
them exactly the [ __ ] they want to hear
and the ones who do this the best are
actually very attractive like they tend
to be good-looking men they work out
they dress nice they talk sweet and this
of course is an important component of
the production after all the part that
women always leave out out is that they
want all the things they want from the
men they are attracted to without that
attraction they are much less interested
and these men are extremely good at
reflecting back to women what they
already feel and believe which is
generally what women want to hear when
they go to their friends or their
therapists or their boyfriends for
advice that is they want to hear that
they're right and that the problem lies
elsewhere
between the attractiveness and the

[04:02]
between the attractiveness and the
reflection these men are functionally
romance novel protagonists they look how
women want them to look and they say
what women want them to
say if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook Audi book and
paperback formats the links are in the
description so how do you spot these
creators

[05:00]
creators
these men will say something like you
know why you're single right you're
single because as a beautiful
intelligent High achieving woman you're
just too
intimidating any man who isn't
interested in you is just too insecure
in his selfhood or fragile in his
masculinity to be the partner you
deserve or the reason why your
relationship failed it's because you
love too much you lost yourself in your
loving
and so it's important to maintain
appropriate boundaries moving forward
and this vulnerability unfortunately was
exploited by a selfish and opportunistic
man but don't worry one day you'll find
someone who can meet you at the depth of
your feeling a man who isn't afraid of
his emotions a man who isn't afraid to
communicate a man who isn't afraid of
real intimacy and commitment a real man
etc etc etc these men tell women exactly
what they want to hear and these women
women eat it up even though they're

[06:03]
women eat it up even though they're
largely just reflecting the women's
fantasies they see this information
coming from an apparently independent
source which validates the correctness
of their subjective experience no need
to look any deeper at myself it turns
out I was right all
along I feel so much better and that's
ultimately what these women are paying
for that relief that feeling of feeling
so much better now people don't have as
much of a problem with this
trap as the Trap laid out for men
described earlier because this trap uses
ostensibly positive emotions it's
completely saturated with them in fact
love hope confidence self-respect
empowerment in order to give the
impression of emotional resonance
without really saying anything at all
and of course that all might be well and
good except for the fact that a lot of

[07:02]
good except for the fact that a lot of
this is complete and utter
[ __ ] most of it just isn't true
these men are tapping into a latent
fantasy granted a fantasy that seems
less unpleasant and destructive than the
male fantasy previously discussed but a
fantasy nonetheless and a fantasy isn't
real like by definition a fantasy is not
aligned with reality and this is a
problem because if irrespective of how
beautiful a fantasy is the more a given
model of reality is built upon fantasy
the more precarious that model becomes
even one's sense of self can become
unstable as a result this is because
when things are built upon foundations
that lack structural Integrity they tend
to fall apart at the slightest Challenge
and I think we can definitely see that
in today's day and age like are modern
women more resilient today in the face

[08:01]
women more resilient today in the face
of critical but potentially honest
feedback or less you might think that as
they become more empowered and
successful they would also become more
robust and resilient however this
development is frustrated at least in
part by objective sources that validate
women's fantasies by reflecting back to
them what they've already chosen to
believe and that's why women flocked
they flock to these sources that cater
to this fantasy like the truth is not
well-loved and being honest is generally
not the thing to be like telling the
truth just makes you honest it doesn't
make you money it doesn't get you laid
and it doesn't make you popular if you
want to get rich or get laid or get
popular then you need to learn to play
the games of money seduction and
Charisma respectively the truth isn't
sexy and it often doesn't feel good it
may be what people need but it's rarely

[09:00]
may be what people need but it's rarely
what people want and giving people what
they don't want isn't going to make you
a lot of friends most medicine is bitter
so it's generally necessary to
administer it with a spoonful of sugar
however if all you take is sugar then
don't be surprised when you end up sick
to your stomach something to
consider what do you think does this fit
