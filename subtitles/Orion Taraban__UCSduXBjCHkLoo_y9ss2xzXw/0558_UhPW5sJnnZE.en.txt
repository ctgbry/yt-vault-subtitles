the fifth way that women disrespect men
without realizing It Is by teasing
teasing should be done very selectively
if at all and it should never be done in
front of other people this is because
teasing implies that you are so
comfortable in your position that you
consider a man to be a play thing with
which you can do what you will with
complete impunity it communicates that
you have nothing to fear from toying
with a man's status because you consider
yourself well beyond the reach of any
possible consequences this is placing
yourself above a man which will be
perceived as disrespect even more so if
it's done publicly ladies you should
even be cautious about certain forms of
humor like sarcasm in my opinion sarcasm
tends to do much more harm than good in
a relationship this is because it is
often used as a passive aggressive way
to attack someone while retaining
plausible deniability that that is not
what you are doing
