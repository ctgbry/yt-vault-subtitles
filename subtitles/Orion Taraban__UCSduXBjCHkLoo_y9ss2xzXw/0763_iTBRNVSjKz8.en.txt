David gogins once said you'll never see
a hater doing better than you why is
that because the reward of success is
more work that's the Matthew principle
For unto everyone that hath shall be
given and he shall have abundance when
you start to succeed people bring you
more work more projects more
opportunities not because you're the one
who needs them the most but because you
have a track record of demonstrated
ability as you take on more your time
your attention and your energy become
increasingly constrained successful
people are taxed they're sprinting and
they're typically so concerned about
just getting through the Sprint and
achieving their goals and discharging
their various responsibilities that they
don't have time to judge and criticize
others if you ever find yourself in a
mood of complaint I would suggest that
this is your cue to increase the
difficulty level of your life stop going
easy on yourself
