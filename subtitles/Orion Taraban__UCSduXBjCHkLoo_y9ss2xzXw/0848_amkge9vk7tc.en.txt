I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is
attachment can
change so today I'm going to be talking
about something that I don't often
discuss on this channel namely
attachment Styles I'm going to offer my
perspective on the validity of this
framework and how in my opinion it can
be misapplied in the popular
imagination let's get to it first in
overview of attachment styles to bring
people up to speed the concept of
attachment style originated in research
conducted by psychologist Mary answorth
in the
1970s her most notable experiment was
the strange situation in which she
observed how infant children reacted
when their mothers left the room after
attending to them for a while and how
the children reacted when the mothers
returned a few minutes later what
answorth discovered was that the

[01:01]
answorth discovered was that the
children in her study could be reliably
sorted into three different categories
which she called
secure insecure ambivalent resistant and
insecure avoidant these are a little
different than the names you've probably
heard but that is the language that
anworth used the fourth category that
you may be familiar with disorganized
was actually articulated much later by
other researchers as a kind of catch-all
category for children who couldn't be
reliably sorted into one of ainsworth's
three buckets in any case in ainsworth's
study children were sorted depending on
their observed reactions to the strange
situation the majority of children 70%
were securely attached they were
somewhat distressed when their mothers
left and happy and relieved when their
mothers returned the other 30% were
split equally between the two remaining
C atories insecure ambivalent resistant

[02:03]
C atories insecure ambivalent resistant
children were intensely distressed when
their mothers left but were kind of
pouty and difficult when their mothers
returned finally insecure avoidant
children weren't really distressed when
their mothers left and weren't all that
interested when they came back so that's
the origin of attachment
Styles now there has been a lot of
research on attachment in the 50 years
since ainsworth's strange situation and
the evidence based for this framework is
pretty robust like attachment styles are
real however since this framework
entered the general Consciousness
through popular psychology about a
decade ago its validity has been
weakened through misapplication and
overgeneralization and in my opinion
this occurs when folks consider
attachment style to be a kind of Destiny

[03:00]
attachment style to be a kind of Destiny
rigid inflexible
unchanging that if you're insecurely
attached you'll always be insecurely
attached and there's really nothing you
can do about it and I don't believe that
that's true and I don't believe that
that's true because I know for a fact
that my own attachment style has changed
over the years let's examine this
further when it comes to
attachment it's important to keep in
mind that this is a field of research
that is fundamentally based on observing
infant Behavior now things can
definitely happen to people when they're
babies that will continue to impact them
for the rest of their lives I don't want
to minimize or discount that but by the
same token it's also true that most
people change in many significant ways
as they mature like most people are not
the same at oneyear Old than they are at
40 years old

[04:00]
40 years old
so it's important to remember that how
an infant related to a caregiver does
not dictate how that same person will
relate to an intimate partner as an
adult it's more likely to be similar the
less people make an effort to change
their style of relating and of course
they're less likely to make an effort if
they believe that style to be inflexible
and
determined but this style can and does
change with intentional effort over time
and over the course of normal
developmental
maturity that said we may need to
attenuate our
expectations in my opinion it's useful
to consider attachment as a spectrum
insecure avoidant on one end insecure
ambivalent on the other and secure in
the middle it's absolutely possible for
folks on the extremes to move toward the
center they can become more securely

[05:00]
center they can become more securely
attached but they probably won't ever be
completely secure and they certainly
won't like switch
polarities however this may very well
still be worth doing why because secure
attachment is just associated with the
best relationship outcomes they
generally have cozy uncomplicated and
enduring relationships and securely
attached people get along best with
other securely attached people it's hard
for securely attached people to tolerate
relationships with insecurely attached
people and vice versa so insecurely
attached people tend to end up with each
other which is generally not a recipe
for long-term
success if you appreciate the insights
on this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course

of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description
insecurely attached people on opposite
ends of the spectrum are initially drawn
to each other out of a kind of
recognition that each has what the other
lacks like an avoidant might find the
attention and emotionality of an
ambivalent highly attractive at the
beginning these folks can be vibrant and
solicitous and loving and they may help
avoidance come into greater contact with
their own emotions

[07:00]
their own emotions
however over time those same traits can
feel suffocating possessive and
overwhelming by the same token an
ambivalent could find The Confident
self-possession of an avoidant
irresistible in the initial courtship
these folks seem so confident and
composed and
independent however over time these
attributes begin to feel selfish cold
and
disinterested both tend to panic when
the relational space between them isn't
to their
liking this tends to create a persu
distancer relationship in which
ambivalence attempt to reduce the
relational space to get their needs met
and avoidance attempt to increase the
relational space to do the
same this often results in firecracker
relationships passionate intense
Beginnings that lead to sudden EX
explosive ends the initial attraction of

[08:02]
explosive ends the initial attraction of
each eventually becomes the source of
their Mutual
repulsion in my experience opposites do
attract they just don't tend to stay
together so in order to have stable
satisfying long-term relationships folks
may have to move closer to the middle of
the attachment Spectrum to get
them so how does that happen I can speak
from my own experience as a young man I
was very avoidant
nowadays I would say I'm on the avoidant
side of secure I've been able to shift
my attachment style closer to the middle
of the Continuum therapy has helped me
with this as did learning more about
myself and others but honestly nothing
facilitated this transition more than
intentionally putting myself in
uncomfortable situations and increasing
my capacity to tolerate the emotions
that came up inside of me I don't think
I'll ever be like fully secure but

[09:01]
I'll ever be like fully secure but
that's okay by moving in the right
direction by tolerating my own
discomfort and learning more effective
interpersonal skills I have been able to
have much more satisfying relationships
as an adult so even if attachment style
can't be changed completely it still
might be worth changing what can be
changed in many respects I think
attachment style is kind of like the
personality dimension of extroversion
and
introversion both traits are
unconsciously formed very early in life
most likely due to some kind of
interaction between biological
temperament and environmental experience
and both are unlikely to radically
change like extreme introverts rarely
become raging extroverts and vice
versa however it may be possible and
very helpful for those on the extreme
ends of the spectrum to learn skills to
help them navigate social situations
more

[10:00]
more
effectively for instance I was fairly
introverted as a boy but as a teen I was
kind of forced into performance art this
was absolutely terrifying for me but it
turned out to be an extremely positive
and growthful experience I learned how
to be comfortable and confident in front
of others I learned how to communicate
more effectively I learned how to manage
my own anxiety I learned many useful
things as an actor and I actually became
fairly skilled I was an introvert who
could behave like an extrovert as needed
and this significantly opened up the
world for
me however the issue was that it was
like always internally difficult to do
those things they didn't come naturally
even after all that practice I could
make the water flow uphill which was
absolutely useful at times but it always
required an effort ultimately I decided

[11:00]
required an effort ultimately I decided
that a very extroverted career like
acting probably wasn't the best fit for
me and moved onto my current path where
I've had much more satisfaction and
success in any case my experiences as an
actor helped me become more flexible
more outgoing and more confident all of
which have helped me immeasurably as a
person I think the same thing applies to
attachment like avoidance can get better
with closeness
they can learn skills to do certain
things and not do certain other things
and they can get better at having
enduring satisfying
relationships but this will probably
never feel entirely natural and it will
probably always entail some measure of
effort by the same token ambivalence can
get better with distance they can learn
skills to do certain things and not do
certain other things and they can get
better at having enduring satisfying
relationships but this too do will

[12:00]
relationships but this too do will
probably never feel entirely natural and
it will probably always entail some
measure of
effort however it's still probably worth
doing and the further folks are on the
extremes the more likely it's still
probably worth doing like a very
introverted person could benefit a lot
from say performing in front of others
and a very extroverted person could
benefit a lot from say learning to sit
with
themselves these aspects of ourselves
are not etched in stone they can and do
change but they may require our
intentional effort to do
