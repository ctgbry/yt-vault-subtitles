why I do what I do to answer this
question I'd like to share a brief
anecdote from my life so one Saturday
night about 15 years ago as I was
walking around I found myself on the
corner of Broadway and 14th Street just
off Union Square apparently the street
light had been taken out of commission
and the traffic was at a standstill
clear across Manhattan there were
thousands of cars flashing their lights
and honking their horns it was Madness
once it became clear after a few minutes
that no one was going to do anything
about this I thought to myself okay well
I guess I'll do it I just saw that there
was a very obvious problem that was
affecting people and no one else seemed
willing or able to do anything about it
and in the absence of an alternative I
was elected that anecdote kind of
describes how I approach life if there's
an obvious problem and no one else seems
willing or able to do anything about it
it's like I've been elected to do my
best to address that problem until such
time comes when somebody who has more
competence experience or ability can
take the job from
