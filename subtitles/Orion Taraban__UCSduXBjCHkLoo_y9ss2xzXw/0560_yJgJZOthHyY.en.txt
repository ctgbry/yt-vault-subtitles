well a lot of NOS I think are
increasingly becoming self-inflicted and
mean you mentioned incels there's that
study that I'm sure you're aware of that
I think 30% of men under 30 have not had
sex in the previous 12 months and that's
I haven't let that sink in I've heard it
but that's that's that's incredible it's
wild and that's like tripled in the last
decade it's gone up for women too but
not nearly at the same rate so I think a
lot of men are seeing the stakes are
really high the barriers to entry are
they're
really difficult to overcome I am
feeling hopeless I'm going to try to
turn a virtue out of a necessity and say
okay I'm going to focus on other things
in my life which might actually be a
really good strategy for men I
personally don't think that men should
even think about settling down until
they're in their mid-30s mhm um because
the uh the game changes at 30 to begin
to privilege men for the first time
women have a significant advantage over
men in the 20s
