So this is kind of a standard piece of
advice when it comes to dating. Every
dating coach online puts it forth as an

ladies helping women are telling the
women not to chase. So what's going on?
They can't both be right, can they? And
if everyone listened to this advice,
wouldn't it lead to a kind of stalemate
in the sexual marketplace where no one
makes the first move? Let's examine this

disadvantaged position. The one being
chased is always more powerful than the
one doing the chasing. And power has

negotiation process of any relationship.
Without exception, the more powerful
players get more of what they want and
less of what they don't, irrespective of
the type of relationship being
negotiated.
