what you have to understand is that
dating apps are like the city bus
anybody can get on and that means that
there's going to be a wide swath of
Humanity on these apps and there's going
to be people who are going to like you
and message you that you're not going to
be attracted to so if you're receiving a
lot of that attention or you're swiping
through a bunch of profiles you're not
finding anybody you like people are
subject to getting jaded and burned out
by the whole experience so let me tell
you how I handled this situation
whenever I would reject somebody either
by choosing not to respond to a message
or swiping left I would
say to myself
I hope they find what they're looking
for
and I did this not because I'm a
particularly good person but because it
blocked
the experience of more judgmental
thoughts that would lead to me feeling
contempt disgust or resentment so it was
primarily selfish and self-protective
and that actually allowed me to engage
with the apps more fruitfully
