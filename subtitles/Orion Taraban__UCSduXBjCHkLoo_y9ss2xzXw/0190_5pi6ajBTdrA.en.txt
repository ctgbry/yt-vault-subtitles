i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is three
steps to becoming more confident
so i'm going to begin by offering you my
definition of confidence which basically
contains the blueprint that i mentioned
in the title
confidence is the consistent
felt experience of success i'll say that
again confidence is the consistent
felt experience of success
let's break that down step one
you have to do it
i mean that's the success part if you
can't do it or if you haven't done it
yet
how can you possibly feel realistically
confident so the first step is getting
to the place where you can do it this
might mean learning new skills this
might mean practicing and rehearsing and
training this might mean investing time
energy and money this might mean
whatever you need to do
to get through the pain period as
quickly and reliably as possible so that
you can actually do the thing make sense

[01:03]
you can actually do the thing make sense
however
just being able to do it
is not sufficient for the felt sense of
confidence
you have to be able to do it
consistently
that's the second step you do it once
you might think oh that was just a fluke
or who i just got lucky if you failed 90
times before you did it once
can you really trust that you'll be able
to do it on demand in the future so you
have to do it over and over and over and
over again so that all things being
equal you kind of can't not do it or at
the very least that you have an
objectively better chance of doing it
than not doing it got it
but even this
is not enough for the felt sense of
confidence for instance i've worked with
some very high achieving folks who have
all kinds of impressive accomplishments
to their name and some of these folks
paradoxically enough do not feel very
confident at all despite all of their

[02:01]
confident at all despite all of their
victories
and why might that be
because these folks are so
monomaniac
perfectionistic
that even if they're getting it right 99
percent of the time
they're laser focused on the one percent
that they're getting wrong
as a consequence
that's all they see as they move through
life and so they end up feeling
unfulfilled insecure and anxious in the
midst of all of their success
this brings us to the third crucial step
toward the felt sense of confidence you
have to take it in
and how do you do that
well every once in a while you have to
stop
and you have to look back at how far
you've come
you've got to really appreciate and
acknowledge and emotionally spend time
with the victories and the growth that
you've achieved along the way
and to allow yourself to cultivate a
justified sense of pride to feel that as

[03:00]
justified sense of pride to feel that as
a consequence of your own efforts and
your own perseverance that you've
actually arrived at something worthwhile
that's the final key component to
feeling more confident so you have to do
it you have to do it consistently and
you have to allow that to impact you
emotionally
the consistent felt experience of
success
