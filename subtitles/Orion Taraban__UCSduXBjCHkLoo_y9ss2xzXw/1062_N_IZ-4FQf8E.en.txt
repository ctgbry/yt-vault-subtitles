The ability to kind of tease out another
person's inner state is not entirely
separate from the ability to tease out
your own inner state. Like you have to
be comfortable with your own feelings
and your own desires. Uh not what you
think you want, not what you think you
should want, not what you want to want,
but what you actually want. And it's
hard to honestly perceive another person
when you're not in the habit of honestly
perceiving yourself. And once you're
attuned to your own fluctuations of
feeling and sensing, it's easier for do
with other people. Otherwise, what you
get are more or less scripted
conversations between people who aren't
very self-aware or not very comfortable.
And maybe there's a place for scripted
conversations because it creates a
structure, a scaffold for people to
enter into a discussion that they would
just be terrified of doing otherwise.
But that works more or less about as
well as scripted pickup. You know, it it
it's not really embedded in the person.
