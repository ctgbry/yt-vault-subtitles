the rule governing sexual relationships
functionally dictates that sex should be
the last thing on the minds of two
people who are only talking to each
other out of their mutual interest in
exchanging sex for resources which is
actually pretty wild if you think about
it because we're not really allowed to
talk too much and too directly about the
core transaction at the heart of sexual
relationships we tend to give a lot of
attention to other things that sound
relationshipy in order to cover over the
fundamental exchange things Like Love
Languages and attachment Styles etc etc
now what can unfortunately occur as a
consequence of our Collective refusal to
say the quiet part loud is that people
can actually start to believe that the
relationshipy [ __ ] that is used to
protect the Dignity of the people
involved and of which we hear so much is
really important and that the core
exchange at the heart of the
relationship of which we hear very
little isn't or shouldn't be very
important at all
