It's pretty difficult for us all to
agree on what's good. This is because
good and bad don't exist in objective
reality. They are anthropocentric terms
and they are always related to specific
if unackagnowledged goals and value
systems. Reality on the other hand is
beyond good and bad which is what can
make confrontation with reality so
startling. It feels inhuman because,
well, it is. When the lion eats the
gazelle, is it good or bad? The closest
we can come to answering that question
is by putting ourselves in the place of
one of those actors and making a
judgment based on its presumed values
and goals. However, from the eye of
nature, it is neither good nor bad. It
just is. The upshot is that we have to
understand that the terms good and bad
always relate to a particular moral
framework which is really just a

framework which is really just a
collection of goals and values. And when
that framework isn't explicitly
acknowledged, it can lead to a lot of
pain and misunderstanding.
