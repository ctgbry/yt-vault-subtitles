i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is a
perspective on happiness
so i'm currently reading through the
philosophy of epicurus epicurus was an
ancient greek philosopher and he gave
his name to the adjective epicurean
which is usually associated with an
appreciation for the finer things in
life like luxurious food or sumptuous
settings
epicurus was a proponent of hedonism
which is essentially the belief that
humans are fundamentally motivated to
obtain pleasure and avoid pain
however i think that his philosophy is
often misunderstood as merely the
seeking after sensuous experience if you
actually read epicurus that is not at
all what he is suggesting and i think
it's worth noting because his
perspective is pretty interesting as it
pertains to the general pursuit of
happiness which i think we're all
interested in

[01:00]
interested in
one of the things that epicurus argues
is that pleasure is the absence of pain
and the absence of fear
pain being physical harm and fear being
let's say mental or psychological harm
he claims that when we are in a state of
freedom from pain and fear
we are happy
and this sort of suggests that happiness
is not obtained positively by the
addition
of comforts or pleasant experiences
but negatively by the removal of pain or
unpleasant experiences
and this definition of happiness makes
that experience far more accessible to
the general swath of humanity and i like
that
he also argues that we engage in a sort
of hedonic calculus in which we use our
reason and judgment to calculate the net
pleasure of a given experience for
instance not all pleasant things are net
positives because of the unpleasantness

[02:01]
positives because of the unpleasantness
that tends to result as a consequence of
pursuing them
and so something that is pleasurable
immediately but carries with it a lot of
unpleasant or painful consequences can't
really be properly understood as a
pleasure
and this includes many of the
experiences that are typically given the
epicurean label fine foods drugs sex
epicurus admits that these things in the
moment are pleasurable but that they
often create unpleasant consequences
especially if they are not used in
moderation
the upshot for him is that it's not
possible to live without pain or fear
if you live without temperance or
rationality
and that living nobly
justly and sensibly
is your best bet to living without pain
or fear i.e your best bet at being happy
