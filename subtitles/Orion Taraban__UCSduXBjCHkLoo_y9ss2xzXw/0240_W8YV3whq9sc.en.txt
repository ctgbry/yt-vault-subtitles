on my video be the person you can love
which actually was the very first
episode that i uploaded on this channel
jack sparrow's girlfriend asks does this
advice also apply to women absolutely
it's be the person you can love not the
man you can love or the woman you can
love
if you want to increase your self-love
or self-respect it's very important to
act in ways that you yourself find
lovable and respectable
now there are some important let's say
social gendered differences
in how men and women communicate or
express lovability and respectability
however that doesn't matter nearly as
much as one's own estimation of those
things for example if you were
completely aligned with the social
expectation of how to do that but you
were privately misaligned with what you
believed you would not be at peace with
yourself even if you were
praised and validated socially
