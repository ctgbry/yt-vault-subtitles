No matter what the age of the man is,
they'll swipe more on women around 22 to
24 years old, whereas women tend to
swipe a little bit more age
appropriately. If you look at a
50-year-old man's age filters on a
dating app, it's often from 18 to 40
years old.
&gt;&gt; And I don't think that's comparable to a
50-year-old woman.
&gt;&gt; 50-year-old women tend to date maybe 48
to 60, something like that. That would
seem to be reasonable. [music]
&gt;&gt; That sounds about right. a better recipe
for a happy relationship.
&gt;&gt; Oh, it depends on what you're looking
for. So, women are much more attracted.
They have more of what men want in their
20s. What are some of the things that
women tend to [music] look for? They
look for emotional maturity. They look
for an established lifestyle. They look
for status and wealth. They look for
strength. And most guys in their 20s
don't have those things. So, it takes a
long time for men to have the things
that most women want, and that usually

[01:01]
that most women want, and that usually
changes in the 30s. So, women in their
20s definitely have an easier time
dating than men in their 20s. It can get
harder for women starting in their 30s.
[music] Yeah, that's what I'm seeing
like with women that I coach.
