i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the price of peace
now there was a time that i was living
in san francisco
and parking my car in the street
and despite my best efforts about once a
month on average i would get a parking
ticket
i really dislike getting parking tickets
i don't know where those parking
enforcers in san francisco are hiding
but they're like ninjas you look away
for a minute there's a notice on your
car it's incredible
anyway when this would happen
i would invariably get upset and lose my
cool
besides eventually developing a system
whereby i completely eliminated the
possibility of getting another parking
ticket which i could probably talk about
in another episode
i sat down and i examined the
rationality of my anger
and when i thought about it i understood
that what my anger was communicating was

[01:00]
that what my anger was communicating was
that my peace my emotional equilibrium
was worth less to me than an 80 fine
by getting upset about a parking ticket
i was communicating that i was willing
to throw my piece away that cheaply
now i'm not a saint by any means and i
still lose my cool from time to time
but now i try to make sure that it's
worth it to lose my cool you know what
i'm saying
i've come to value my peace more
so the price of my piece has risen
to the point that something has to be
fairly expensive before i flip my lid
i don't sell my piece cheaply
here's the same idea from a different
angle
what if someone offered you 500
but in return you had to feel angry for
several days
would you take the money
if no
then you've basically decided
that any loss damage or inconvenience
that is worth less than 500

[02:01]
that is worth less than 500
isn't worth getting angry about
it's like how much would you need to be
paid in order to abide in anxiety
despair rage how much would someone need
to pay you to stay there for days weeks
or even months at a time
that's the price of your piece
and it's important to value peace highly
because it's actually a rare and
precious thing
i hope that made sense if you're
