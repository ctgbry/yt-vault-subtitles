I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is politics
and sexual withholding so I'm going to
begin this episode by briefly relating
an anecdote from my own personal dating
history I have spent the last 13 years
living in the San Francisco Bay area
which is something of the belly of the
beast when it comes to Progressive
politics and ideological feminism now
not all women here subscribe to these
belief systems but a lot of them do
and more than once I've been punished
with sexual withholding for wrong think
that misaligned with these systems it's
also something I see occurring more and
more frequently in the lives of my
clients here's the anecdote I once
briefly dated a librarian the first few
dates went well and we ended up back at
her place each time it wasn't until the
third or fourth date that she came back
to my apartment and when she came over
she saw my bookcases now I'm pretty
proud of my library which itself
represents presents just a fraction of

[01:01]
represents presents just a fraction of
the books that I've read and I figured
this would go over well with a
librarian I was wrong as she reviewed my
books she commented disparagingly that
there were more male authors than female
authors in my library she went on to
disclose that representation for female
authors in the publishing industry was a
very important social cause for her as a
librarian and she asked that I read more
books written by women
I was taken aback I mean it's true that
most of the books I read are written by
men but due to the amount that I read
it's also true that I read more books
written by women than most people read
books so I pointed that out and
explained to her that I read books based
on what interests me as opposed to say
the gender of the author and that I
didn't believe I had a social
responsibility to read books that didn't
interest me just so that certain
demographics could be more widely read I

[02:02]
demographics could be more widely read I
also noted that while I could support
her in her social cause it wasn't
something I was going to take on myself
since I have causes of my own and it
would take time energy and focus away
from the things that I personally care
about I'm not against your cause I
explained but I'm not going to actively
Champion it for you and apparently this
was an unacceptable response suddenly I
was a misogynist and a sexist and an
oppressor Etc suffice it to say we did
not see each other again
and that was no skin off my back of
course however I've encountered
comparable situations multiple times
over the course of my dating history in
the cases of these particular women
anything less than perfect alignment
with their ideology was considered to be
a personal threat to be punished and
condemned when this happens on mass men
who espouse wrong think are weeded out
of the dating scene and men who are
aligned with the dominant ideology are
afforded reproductive opportunities this
is the nature of things when sex becomes

[03:01]
is the nature of things when sex becomes
a consciously political act I call the
tactic of withholding sex for a
political end the listrada protocol for
those who aren't familiar listrada is a
very readable very funny Greek comedy
written by the playwright
Aristophanes who was a man it relates a
hypothetical retelling of the pelian war
in which the Greek women sick and tired
of how long the war was taking came
together and took a solemn oath to
completely withhold all sexual access
from their husbands until they ended the
conflict the rest of the play depicts
how this strategy unfolds ultimately
after many unsuccessful attempts to
break through the women's defenses the
men eventually give in and end the war
the moral is that women can effectively
dictate social policy by withholding
sexual access not much has changed in
2500 years now before I go any further

lights on uh and grow the channel I
really appreciate your support and thank
you for your help
now for better or worse things don't
quite work in reality like they do in a
play and why is that well in L Estrada
every single woman in Greece maintained
a consistent and unanimous front against
the men's attempts to break through
their sexual embargo and this was
possible in part because this was a
relatively small community however in
reality this is not going to be possible
some women might maintain a consistent
front

[05:00]
front
but a lot of them won't and this is
because given the intersexual
competition between women for men
especially desirable high value men in
the sexual Marketplace one woman's
withholding is another woman's
opportunity the more women remove
themselves from the market on
ideological grounds the more advantagous
it is for the women who
remain this is not only because those
who M will have fewer other women
against whom to compete but because they
will become increasingly valuable as the
available supply of women declines as
well with this in mind we can understand
that a woman's best strategy with
respect to these social movements is to
encourage as many other women as
possible to withdraw from the sexual
Marketplace either by means of the list
Estrada protocol or by making themselves
less appealing to to men while

[06:00]
less appealing to to men while
continuing to remain clandestinely in
the sexual Marketplace themselves sneaky
sneaky right and I think that's why a
lot of the women who openly support and
encourage and celebrate women who say
cut off and dye their hair or get
tattoos and piercings or denounce the
patriarchy and vilify men don't do so
themselves H the more women who withdraw
from the Marketplace in ideological
grounds and the more women who make
themselves less attractive for
ideological reasons the better able the
remaining women will be to compete
successfully for the dwindling pool of
desirable men keep in mind that these
motivations don't have to be conscious
in order to exert their
influence if women really thought it was
brave and strong and courageous to
behave in certain ways in the sexual
Marketplace then in the absence of any

[07:00]
Marketplace then in the absence of any
impediment to enacting those behaviors
themselves why don't they all behave
that way well leaving aside normal
variations in preferences and
personality it's because not all women
are that
dumb seen through the lens of
evolutionary psychology women who
withdraw from the sexual Marketplace or
make themselves less attractive on
ideological grounds are the dupes who
were deceived by the positive
reinforcement of their intersexual
competition they exchange their
reproductive success for the praise of
their
competitors in any case the lstr
protocol is an inept sexual strategy
because it won't ever be possible to
secure a unified front among all women
and this is because one woman's
withdrawal is another woman's
opportunity and this strategy is fairly
self-correcting like it won't ever
succeed in becoming the dominant
methodology in an open and diverse
sexual Marketplace for the simple reason
that women who practice this strategy

[08:01]
that women who practice this strategy
aggressively rarely succeed in the game
of mating and dating what do you think
does this fit with your own experience
