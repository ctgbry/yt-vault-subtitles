I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is can
people change
well the short answer is yes with a but
people absolutely can't change I would
either be in the wrong profession or a
Shameless huckster if I didn't believe
that to be true I'm in the business of
helping people change and I see it
happen all the time
at one level of comprehension people
can't not change and this is because
change is really the only constant in
life now that change can often occur so
gradually that we don't notice it and or
so unintentionally that we don't feel
like we control how we change but we all
change nonetheless that said this isn't
really the spirit in which this question
is asked when people generally ask
whether people can change they want to
know if radical personality
transformation is possible either for
themselves or for someone else with whom

[01:00]
themselves or for someone else with whom
they're in a relationship
and again yes radical transformation is
possible
inveterate alcoholics can change
borderlines and narcissists can change
destructive and self-destructive people
can change
but
remember the answer is yes with a but
but
they often don't
in fact the safe bet in any particular
case is that they probably won't and you
shouldn't hold your breath raining
around for them to do so
so that begs the question what
differentiates the folks who undergo a
radical personality change from those
who do not
in the vast majority of cases the folks
who undergo a radical personality change
are those who hit bottom
and hitting bottom is when the
circumstances of your life become so
unsustainable that they are that you are
functionally forced to choose between
making a radical change or death

[02:02]
making a radical change or death
in my experience nothing else is really
capable of producing such an outcome
and even when such a transformation
occurs there will be forces that will
act to frustrate its
completion
now one of the greatest works of art
that we have available to us on this
subject is Victor Hugo's Les Miserables
most people are familiar with this work
through the musical adopted from its
text which is also excellent in fact
it's my favorite musical the main plot
line which narrates the decades-long
pursuit of ex-convict Jean Valjean by
Police Inspector Javert is actually a
protracted debate over whether it's
possible for people to truly change
let's take a closer look shall we
Jean Valjean is the protagonist of the
story he served 19 years of hard labor
for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his

[03:00]
for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his
starving nephew when he has finally
released on parole he can't get work
anywhere because of his status as a next
convict he is poor and desperate and
filled with hate over the Injustice he
has suffered and he eventually resorts
to stealing once again this time from a
priest who shelters him for the night
however when Valjean is captured the
next morning with the stolen goods
rather than turn him in the priest not
only covers for Valjean but makes him an
additional gift of a pair of
candlesticks as well
this is likely the first kindness
Valjean experienced in over 20 years and
the priest's Mercy serves as an
indisputable counterfactual to his
dominant worldview namely that the law
of the universe is an eye for an eye a
cruel and implacable place
what follows is a number called
valjean's Soliloquy which is a fantastic
example of what hitting bottom looks
like I've included a link to Hugh

[04:00]
like I've included a link to Hugh
Jackman's powerful rendition in the
description below
in the beginning he reiterates his story
and it's the story of every Angry
hateful person if there's another way to
go I missed it 20 long years ago my life
was a war that could never be won they
gave me a number and they murdered
Valjean when they chained me and left me
for dead just for stealing a mouthful of
bread
all the core components of a
self-victimizing narrative are there I
had no other choice it's too late for me
anyway the world is unfair I didn't do
anything in any case what they did is
much worse my rage is Justified Etc
the crisis Point comes about two minutes
into the song When moved by the pain of
his Contrition he asks on his knees What
Spirit comes to move my life is there
another way to go
notice what happens in the score the
music becomes all tension with the
strings vibrating back and forth like

[05:00]
strings vibrating back and forth like
he's walking on a tightrope this is the
moment of danger
will his hatred and self-pity cause him
to fall into Perdition or will he make
the leap into an unknown possibility
and then listen to his decision
I'll Escape now from that world from the
world of Jean Valjean
as I've mentioned in previous episodes
it is not possible to experience
anything outside of your Consciousness
one of the consequences of this is that
the quality of yourself comes to imbue
everything that you perceive with itself
so that reality becomes a reflection of
your own being Valjean finally
understands that to escape from the
cruel and hateful world he must resolve
the cruelty and hatred inside of himself
that is the world of Jean Valjean
he goes on
Jean Valjean is nothing now another
story must begin
again excellent another story must begin

[06:01]
again excellent another story must begin
well what was the first story if you
think about it it could only be Jean
Valjean that's right who you think you
are what you think about the world these
are stories that you tell yourself they
are not who you are because it is not
possible for any story to contain the
story maker they exist on two different
ontological planes and any story that
you tell yourself can be retold by that
same self
this is the creative potential of the
Free Will which may be the spark of the
Divine that exists within all of us
and that new story must begin because if
it doesn't Valjean will die physically
spiritually or both
and with this conviction he strides out
of the chapel and rips up his parole
papers symbolizing the obliteration of
who he has been up until that point his
eyes are wild and intense because
intensity is required for to complete

[07:03]
intensity is required for to complete
the transformation this is not something
that can be undone
Valjean holds his last note through
three violent ascending horn blasts as
if to confirm the strength of his
resolve before the score explodes into
the Glorious main theme of the musical
it's like the whole universe is
celebrating valjean's decision you did
it
and we leave Valjean standing in a
graveyard next to a cross which
symbolized the death of his former self
and his resurrection as a new man
respectively it's the best shot in the
whole movie and that's hitting bottom

now
back to Les Mis at this point the action
skips ahead eight years Valjean has
assumed a new identity and has become a
respectable member of society he's the
mayor of a town and the owner of a
factory that employs hundreds of workers
however despite his transformation and
his commitment to his new self he can
never truly Escape his past
a chance encounter leads Inspector
Javert whose Duty it is to hunt down
those who have broken parole to
recognize Valjean as former convict
prisoner 24601
now let's talk about Javert
despite being the antagonist Javert is
not really a bad guy this is because as
in all great works of art the primary
tension here is not between good and

[09:00]
tension here is not between good and
evil which is very simplistic and does
not really help us navigate reality
where in any case such distinctions are
rarely if ever so obvious but between
two mutually incompatible World Views
Dostoevsky was great with this in any
case Javert represents the principle of
constant justice of Law and Order
in his view people can't change to
Javert good is good and evil is evil and
we need Law And Justice to protect the
former from the latter
or everything falls apart after all if
the righteous can fall and the
spiritually dead can be reborn then
really all conceptualizations of Good
and Evil would kind of be useless as you
could never really tell who was who
in any case Javert isn't wrong we do
need Justice in order and Valjean isn't
right people can't really run from their

[10:01]
right people can't really run from their
pasts but they absolutely represent two
mutually incompatible World Views and
the whole dramatic action of the story
is a discussion of which worldview will
ultimately win out as Javier insists in
his final song there is nothing on Earth
that we share it is either Valjean or
Javert
they are each other's shadows in the
sense that each represents the unchosen
path of the other as we learn in the
confrontation Link in the description
Javert was born in a jail but chose a
path as an officer of the law well
Valjean born in Freedom freely chose to
break that law as Javert says every man
is born in sin every man must choose his
way
finally in this scene Javert explicitly
tells Valjean men like you can never
change men like me can never change
which makes explicit the fundamental

[11:00]
which makes explicit the fundamental
tension between them if Javert is right
then Valjean is and will always be
escaped convict 24601
who has cowardly assumed a new identity
to evade Justice and if Valjean is right
then Javert is doomed because his
arrogance presumes that his continued
righteousness is assured
in fact at the very deepest level the
story of Les Mis is biblical Javier
represents the Law of the Old Testament
a retributive Justice that calls for an
eye for an eye there are laws so many
laws that must be followed there are
punishments for their violation and
rewards for their observation
on the other hand Valjean represents the
good news of the New Testament that
salvation is possible even for the most
miserable of Sinners and that through
the death of the self a new man can be
reborn through the transfigurative

[12:00]
reborn through the transfigurative
mystery of the cross
which worldview will win out it is
either Valjean or jevere
it's important to note that though
radical transformation is possible we
can't really Escape our past
in AAA when an addict undergoes a sudden
transformation and expects everyone
including all those he may have
repeatedly harmed over the years to
accept him as this new person they call
this a spiritual bypass
radical transformation does not absolve
a person from the necessity of making
amends and we see this once again in Les
Miserables while the rest of his life
could potentially be considered
valjean's attempt to make amends for the
crimes of his past he has the
opportunity to practically escape the
consequences of his action
by allowing an innocent man who had been
falsely arrested for being escaped
convict 24601 to go back to prison in

[13:00]
convict 24601 to go back to prison in
his Stead
during his years as the mayor Valjean
had done well but he was still in hiding
still running from his past still
running from Javert
Belgian confirmed the reality of his
transformation by revealing himself and
surrendering to Justice
without this step we can make no
continuity between our former and our
transformed selves which is to live as a
fabrication a man without a past
to truly transform we not only need to
hit bottom but we have to
non-defensively accept the crimes of our
past otherwise we are in continual
violation of our parole
we have all done wrong we are all
imperfect people we are all 24601.
however Not only would we prefer that
other people not know this we would
generally prefer that we ourselves were
not aware of this as well

[14:00]
not aware of this as well
and we spend a lot of energy hiding this
from others and hiding this from
ourselves but Javert is Relentless no
matter how much we change no matter how
much growth and healing and
transformation we undergo there will
always be an element inside of us that
says something like who do you think
you're fooling
I can see right through you
once an addict always an addict wants a
depressive always a depressive once a
loser always a loser
like Javert there is a pull toward
order and self-consistency even if the
self to whom we are consistent is
perverse and destructive
so we can also potentially view the
antagonism between Valjean and Javert as
the psychic conflict between the
conscious personalities striving for
disruptive change and the judging
superego seeking for ordered constancy
and that's the larger theme of the story

[15:02]
and that's the larger theme of the story
itself which takes place at the brink of
revolution of a society are we going to
disrupt
uh have a disruptive action for positive
change or are we going to repressively
seek to keep things the way they've
always been
so it's mirrored not just at this
individual level but on the social level
in the story as well
so what happens in the end well since
they are each other's shadows what
happens to Javert in the end of the
story is what happens to Valjean in the
beginning
his world view is incontestably
challenged by an act of Mercy
when Valjean spares Javier's life Javert
is unable to reconcile his
conceptualization of Valjean as a fallen
criminal with the counterfactual
evidence of Valjean as a Merciful Savior
if Javier was right and people cannot
change then Valjean should have killed
him
and if Javier was wrong and people can
change then his past self Must Die

[16:02]
change then his past self Must Die
either way javer is checkmated
he has hit bottom
however
rather than taking the leap into Faith
through the possibility of Resurrection
to escape from the world of Inspector
Javert
he takes a literal leap off a bridge
into death
to escape from the world of Jean Valjean
this Final Act makes Javert a tragic
figure a man who ultimately becomes
ensnared in his own self-consistency
and the old laws have been dissolved in
light of a new possibility of redemption
