I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the coin
of The Realm by now many of you have had
a chance to check out my book the value
of others for those of you who have
thank you for taking a chance on it as
you know the book is um
bookended by two Parables the prologue
and the epilogue since a number of
people have recently asked me about the
story in the epilogue I thought I would
discuss it with you today now I'm not
going to give everything to you on a
silver platter after all what would be
the point in using a parable if I did
that the beauty of Parables is that they
can mean many things that they possess
depths of comprehensibility that can be
true on multiple levels
simultaneously today I'm going to offer
one possible interpretation of that
Parable that might help illuminate some
of the contents of the book it's not the

[01:00]
of the contents of the book it's not the
highest interpretation but it's a useful
interpretation
nonetheless so the parable at the end of
the book is called the coin of Caesar
which describes an episode from the life
of Jesus a group of Pharisees approach
Jesus in the marketplace and they start
complaining to him about the necessity
of paying taxes isn't it unfair isn't it
unjust we shouldn't have to suffer this
indignity is it not a form of idol
worship Etc now Jesus doesn't go in for
any of this thinking and he asks the
group how do you pay your taxes and they
answer him with this coin and Jesus says
let me see the coin when they hand it to
him he asks who face is on this coin the
Pharisees answer Caesars so Jesus
replies this is Caesar's coin Render
unto Caesar what is Caesar's and unto
God what is Gods so that's the Parable

[02:01]
God what is Gods so that's the Parable
and as I mentioned there's a lot of
different ways we could interpret it
however in the context of intersexual
Dynamics I think it provides a lesson on
how men and women can have more happy
and fulfilling relationships with each
other namely Render unto Caesar what is
Caesar's there are certain things that
men want we can call those men's coins
you can even imagine that they have
pictures of men on them that's what men
want
they want to be paid in their currency
on the other hand there are certain
things that women want we can call those
women's coins you can even imagine that
they have pictures of women on them
that's what women want they want to be
paid in their currency men need to pay
women in women's currency and women need
to pay men in men's
currency and this doesn't often happen
and it often doesn't happen for a
variety of reasons most commonly it
doesn't happen because at least one

[03:00]
doesn't happen because at least one
party doesn't have what the other party
wants men don't have or don't have
enough of what women want and women
don't have or don't have enough of what
men want and you have to first have
something before you can give it to
somebody else so that's the first reason
men need to cultivate more of what women
want and vice
versa now it can happen that one party
does in fact have what the other party
wants however this can still cause
problems if this person believes that he
or she shouldn't have to
pay these people are Pharisees in the
market place and they have all kinds of
different arguments to rationalize their
stinginess I shouldn't have to pay
that's degrading and beneath me I should
be able to pay in my own way what I pay
should be enough if you really loved me
you wouldn't make me pay it's greedy and
abusive that you expect payment etc etc
etc all of these arguments are

[04:02]
etc all of these arguments are
like can you imagine if someone tried to
use those arguments in a court of law if
they were hauled in for the non-payment
of income tax your honor I shouldn't
have to pay taxes it's degrading and I
believe I should be an exception in any
case you ask too much if I did have to
pay I think I should only pay this much
and I should be able to pay in other
ways besides money wouldn't you think
that just being in my presence is enough
of a payment
if the government really cared about me
it wouldn't make me pay taxes don't be
mean and greedy and
selfish that would never work the
material world runs on Power and value
and there is nothing wrong with
circulating the currency of the material
world in your dealings with it Render
unto Caesar what is Caesars if anything
you will run into trouble if for
whatever reason you refuse to circul

[05:00]
whatever reason you refuse to circul
the currency of the material world in
your dealings with it and it is for
Caesar not you to decide when he would
like to be paid and how he would like to
be paid and how much he would like to be
paid and he gets to decide those things
not because he's better or more virtuous
or more enlightened he gets to decide
those things because he is more powerful
it is what it
is if you were appreciate the insights
on this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never

[06:00]
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description to have successful
relationships men need to give women
what women want and women need to give
men what men want let's make this more
concrete with a simple but very
commonplace example namely the texting
behaviors of men and women I actually
spoke about this a bit in my first
discussion with James ston on soft white
underbelly there are big differences in
how men and women use texts to flirt how
do men flirt over text they send women
dickpics most women do not want dickpics
so why are men sending these texts
because men want nudes from women they
think this is the coin I want so it must
be a valuable coin so will give

[07:00]
be a valuable coin so will give
something of value to get something of
value but my dudes these texts are not
women's coin they do not have pictures
of women on them that is not the
currency in which they want to be
paid on the other hand how do women
flirt they send pictures of the most
innan and irrelevant here's the
sandwich I ate for lunch here's a cloud
that looks like a peanut here's a
picture of my shoes men couldn't care l
about any of that so why are women
sending men these texts because women
want affection from men they want him to
think of her when she's not around and
to share the Little moments of his life
with her and to stay connected with her
they think this is the coin I want so it
must be a valuable coin so I will give
something a value to get something of
value but my ladies these texts are not
men's coin they do not have pictures of

[08:00]
men's coin they do not have pictures of
men on them these are not the currency
in which men want to be
paid if you want your relationship to be
smooth and satisfying pay the other
person in their currency men give your
women affection sometimes I hear men
complain that their women left them from
for some broke loser like how do you
make sense of that o is she just crazy
and irrational doesn't that mean your
economic model is
maybe or maybe I don't know he was able
to engage her emotions and cultivate a
connection with her while they were
relying on attraction proxies like money
to do that for them pay women in their
coin on the other hand women send your
men
nudes sometimes I hear women complain
that men only seem to want them for sex
isn't that toxic and unhealthy shouldn't
he want to know and care about her hopes

[09:00]
he want to know and care about her hopes
and dreams and personalities maybe or
maybe I don't know he's a man and he
wants to look at titties that seems
pretty normal and healthy to me if he's
a straight man he's going to want to
look at titties looking at titties is
probably going to be the best thing that
happens to him today and given the
unprecedented availability of titties in
the Modern Age we can also pretty much
assume that he's going to be looking at
titties today the only question ladies
is do you want them to be your titties
do you want to be the best part of his
day today or do you want some other
woman to play that role in his life the
choice is yours but I guarantee titties
are going to be on the menu one way or
the other pay men in their
coin now men often dislike offering
women that kind of affection but they'll
do it especially if you tell them that
it works however women have all kinds of

[10:01]
it works however women have all kinds of
reasons why they shouldn't have to send
nudes and they often won't do it even if
it will get them what they want so let's
briefly discuss what might be the most
reasonable objection to this piece of
advice namely this goes against my
values Orion I have a legitimate
religious or moral exception to that
kind of behavior and I would like that
to be
respected now if that's the case I would
respond absolutely that is your right
you don't have to do anything that
violates your religious or moral
sensibilities that said you also can't
reasonably expect to therefore dictate
what currency the other person should be
willing to accept as that would be
tantamount to imposing your religion or
morality on others very likely you will
need to contract your relationships in
those circumscribed locations that
accept your localized currency

[11:00]
accept your localized currency
like if you want commitment to precede
sex then you probably need to date in
your church or your mosque because that
is where that currency is accepted but
that is not the coin of the realm you
can't walk into French Laundry and try
to pay for your dinner with Disney
dollars or a hug and a smile that's not
going to work if you want to enjoy a
dinner at French Laundry you have to
give French Laundry what French Laundry
wants which is
USD complaining that they don't accept
rubles or bushels of apples or American
Express is irrelevant that's not for you
to decide it's for the other party to
decide how they want to be
paid so what happens when men and women
don't pay each other in the proper
currency at the heart of pretty much all
relationship dysfunction is a single
belief and that belief which exists in
at least at least one of the party's

[12:00]
at least at least one of the party's
Minds is that I am
overpaying I am giving and giving and
giving and I'm not getting what I want
in return and this belief gives rise to
all the different kinds of expressions
of dissatisfaction emotional withdrawal
resentfulness disparagement conflict
infidelity etc etc it's not complicated
if you want to have smooth satisfying
relationships give the other party what
they want
men should not give women what men want
to receive men need to give women what
women want to receive women should not
give men what women want to receive
women need to give men what men want to
receive this is functionally how we do
business with each other and it is good
and appropriate to do this Render unto
Caesar what is
Caesar's what do you think does this fit
