i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
would you change places with them
this is a very useful hack that i've
developed to help folks deal with
feelings of unfairness or injustice
especially in the context of sibling
relationships
it's often the case that one sibling
looks at the other and says you know
it's not fair
they've gotten everything handed to them
on a silver platter they've been bailed
out of so many circumstances and they've
never had to work for anything
not like me i've had to struggle and
strive for everything i have and it's
just
not
fair
okay
so that kind of resentment can really
corrode a person's heart and obviously
poison the relationship so it's a belief
that even if it's true isn't
particularly useful to us
so often i ask these folks okay well
maybe it isn't fair
but would you change places with them

[01:01]
but would you change places with them
like if god were to come down from the
heavens
and say i've heard your complaint and
i'm willing to make a change i can move
you into your sibling situation and your
sibling can move into yours are you
ready
most likely you'll say something like oh
geez god
i'm sorry no thank you i think i'd
prefer to stay where i am
in fact i've never had a client once in
10 years tell me that he or she would
switch places with the other person
and that's telling
if the situation is unfair
but you wouldn't switch places with the
other person
then you're in the better position
there's no other way to think about it
divide a hundred dollars between two
people and equally only the person with
less
would want to switch
places what's more when you complain
about taking the hard path on some level
you're devaluing the benefits that have

[02:00]
you're devaluing the benefits that have
accrued to you as a result of taking the
hard path these can include building
authentic self-confidence developing a
solid career learning to navigate life
successfully etc
you're basically saying yeah i took the
hard path and i got those things but
what's authentic self-confidence when i
could have just been
cashing checks that my parents sent me
it's like really
is that actually true is that what you
actually believe
i don't i don't think it is
so this is a really useful check
if you find yourself feeling resentful
or envious about other people's unfair
treatment ask yourself would you change
places with them
in a lot of cases especially in the
context of siblings the answer is no
which suggests that maybe you're
actually in a better position than you
might have previously recognized
something to consider
