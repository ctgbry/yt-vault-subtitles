I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
appreciation Gap the appreciation Gap is
responsible for the deterioration of
millions of relationships every year
it's something that I am certain you
have personally experienced and today
I'm going to teach you how to recognize
it more readily in your relationships
and to take action to counteract its
effects be sure to watch to the end
where I'll give a counter intuitive
suggestion on how women can reduce the
likelihood that their men will cheat on
them very simply the appreciation Gap is
the space between the amount of respect
gratitude and acknowledgement people
receive from their partners and the
amount of respect gratitude and
acknowledgement people feel justifiably
due from their
Partners this Gap becomes a problem when
people feel that they deserve more
appreciation than they get which I call

[01:00]
appreciation than they get which I call
a negative Gap now let's begin by
acknowledging that a negative
appreciation Gap just might be a default
setting of human nature like nearly
everyone believes that they are more
important and irreplaceable than they
truly are almost everyone believes that
their efforts and contributions and
sacrifices should be acknowledged more
than people do I've heard very few
people confess that they receive more
recognition than they deserve and and
when I have it was usually a case of
false modesty in any case it seems that
most people whether they are actively
protesting it or not believe that they
are not getting the appreciation they
deserve at work at home and in their
Intimate Relationships so what's to be
done about this well there are actually
some fairly simple solutions to this
problem that parties on both sides of
the Gap can enact to mitigate its
corrosive influence uence but rather

[02:01]
corrosive influence uence but rather
than keep it abstract let's discuss
potential strategies through the lens of
a concrete example this is one that I
hear all the time in my consultation
practice in the context of intimate
relationships sexual
exclusivity while some men might be
naturally monogamous it's pretty clear
that sexual exclusivity does not come
easily for the vast majority of men now
a lot of men don't have good ality
anyway so their exclusivity is a moot
point but some men do and when men
surrender their optionality for one
specific woman and they continually
resist the temptation or the enticement
of other women men often feel like
they've done something rather
significant Like a Warrior they have
Protected Their commitment through a
great inner battle it can be effortful
and difficult to foro desirable
opportuni ities for the sake of their

[03:01]
opportuni ities for the sake of their
commitment and men are often keenly
aware of the sacrifices their victories
entail on the other hand from the
woman's perspective when a man is
sexually
exclusive he's just doing what he's
supposed to be doing as a boyfriend or
as a husband why should he get a gold
star for being monogamous like that's
the bare minimum in a monogamous
relationship isn't it
and in any case it's what he signed up
for so he made his bed I mean I've been
exclusive and it's not that hard and you
don't see me demanding appreciation do
all men act this way how did I end up
with this lunatic that thinks he
deserves to get paid for resisting the
urge to burn down the
company now as is often the case in
relationship disagreements both
perspectives contain some truth it's not
like the man is entirely right and the
woman is entirely wrong or vice versa
however n nether party is behaving

[04:01]
however n nether party is behaving
effectively here persisting in these
perspectives is probably going to drive
our two love birds further and further
apart so what's to be
done first let's discuss the problem
from the point of view of the person
experiencing the negative appreciation
gap which in this example is the man who
felt as though his efforts to stay
monogamist were being taken for
granted the man got himself into this
position because he wasn't n honest with
himself or because he lacked the courage
to be honest with the woman in
question if you followed my work for a
while you know that I'm not big on
compromise I don't like it however I do
respect
sacrifice sometimes it's in our best
interests to make a voluntary sacrifice
of certain attachments for our own good
and the respectable thing about
sacrifice is that it's not quidd proquo
that is

[05:00]
that is
it doesn't entitle you to someone else's
sacrifice further down the road a
sacrifice is intra not
interpersonal and it comes with no
strings attached this means that people
men and women should really pause on the
brink of making a sacrifice and ask
themselves a very specific question and
that question is if I don't receive any
respect
gratitude or acknowledgement from
anybody as a consequence of this
sacrifice which is a definite
possibility do I still want to do
it that's the question and people need
to be real honest with themselves in
this
moment now some things are still worth
doing even if you don't receive any
appreciation or recognition in return
there are Hills that are worth dying on

[06:03]
there are Hills that are worth dying on
but let's be real people most Hills are
not worth dying on most Hills are just
mounds of mud in a lot of cases it's a
better idea to tactically retreat and
live to fight another day the problem
arises when people don't know their
geography and they confuse the one Hill
for the other don't pretend that you're
making a sacrifice when you aren't and
you know you're pretending when you feel
resentful bitter or envious when your
sacrifice goes un
acknowledged if for whatever reason you
feel like you couldn't honestly forgo
acknowledgement and recognition for your
sacrifice then don't do it don't do it
this is because respect and appreciation
are outside your domain of control it's
up to other people whether or not they

[07:00]
up to other people whether or not they
acknowledge you not you and most people
are not going to be able to recognize
your sacrifice as such as I said before
recognition is a very high thing people
generally need to be close to Mastery
themselves or to have passed through a
very similar experience to be able to
even see the sacrifice in question and
most people are not going to fit into
either one of those categories they're
not masterful in the same way you are
and they haven't had the same experience
as you have chances are good that any
sacrifice you make will go
unappreciated and that's kind of as it
should be because virtue has to be its
own
reward if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and

[08:01]
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available an ebook Audi book and
paperback formats the links are in the
description so be real with yourself if
you want recognition or appreciation or
respect for your good works you're not a
monster you're a
person these are emotional needs that we
have as human beings and pretending that
we're entirely liberated from these
needs is kind of like believing in your
own omnipotence that is that you're so
self-sufficient that other people aren't
necessary in this particular case the
the man could have avoided this problem

[09:01]
the man could have avoided this problem
if he were more honest with himself if
in his heart of hearts a man doesn't
want to make a sexual exclusive
commitment to a woman then he shouldn't
make one in general he does so because
he is trying to make his woman happy or
to get her to not
leave
however loyalty doesn't make women
happy I'll say that again loyal
doesn't make women
happy it doesn't trust me there are
plenty of unhappy women in the world
whose husbands are loyal to them
miserable women don't remember that
their husbands aren't sleeping with
other women which again is what they
were supposed to be doing anyway and
think well thank my lucky stars
awareness of that fact has turned my
frown right upside down in general
people are as happy as they choose to be

[10:01]
people are as happy as they choose to be
and most unhappy people are unhappy at
least in part because they have a
habitual tendency to Discount and
minimize the things in their life that
they do have going on for them your
loyalty will not be an exception
here okay now let's consider things from
the other perspective which in my
hypothetical example is that of the
woman who believes that monogamy is
simply a given
she also isn't behaving effectively here
in general it's a good idea to air on
the side of being too emotionally
generous with your partner you're much
safer assuming that their actions
reflect effort and intention even when
they don't then you are assuming that
their actions are effortless and
unintentional when in fact they aren't
it costs absolutely
nothing nothing to recogn ize your
partner's efforts and this recognition

[11:02]
partner's efforts and this recognition
when it is based on accurate description
is immensely rewarding it's the basis of
respect women with loyal Partners could
periodically recognize that fact they
don't have to give a man a
cookie but it would be better if they
did let's talk about this ladies women
from the perspective of most men there
is no reward for being loyal in a sexual
relationship but there is an enormous
penalty for stepping out and don't
quibble with me here things like not
losing a woman or preventing divorce are
not rewards those are punishments
disguised as rewards and any situation
in which there is no reward for
indefinite
Perfection and severe punishment for the
first infraction is a real shitty

[12:01]
first infraction is a real shitty
contingency
schedule ladies imagine a job where no
matter how good you were no matter how
hard you worked no matter what
sacrifices you made you never got a
Bonus let alone recognized for your
efforts like how would that make you
feel what would be your incentive to
continue to make an effort by the same
token imagine that any deviation from
your perfect track record could
invalidate
Decades of good performance and lead to
significant and immediate financial
consequences how do you think that would
affect your emotional
well-being finally if you ever brought
the situation to your boss's attention
and he replied well why would you be
entitled to more than your negotiated
compensation simply for doing the job
you were hired to
perform how do you think that would
change your perception of the

[13:01]
change your perception of the
company and yet this is how so many
women act when they take their male
Partners sexual exclusivity for
granted in this contingency schedule
there is no carrot there are only sticks
which could very well be part of the
reason why marriage tends to beat the
spirit out of men it is a relationship
that is fundamentally executed through
the threat of punishment as opposed to
the hope of reward
and this is a stupid strategy because
even when they win women lose because
what do they win a man who is there
because he fears to leave not because he
authentically wants to be there though
women might still choose to enact the
strategy because it's easier to make a
man occasionally afraid than it is to
make him consistently
desirous in any case smart women use
carrots to motivate behavior in their

[14:00]
carrots to motivate behavior in their
Partners as well they not only
acknowledge and appreciate and respect
their men's sacrifices in the service of
their sexual exclusivity they go a step
further women you hate when men cheat on
you but what reward do you offer for
being loyal to you that's just doing
your job which invalidates the man's
efforts so here's my crazy idea of how
women can reduce the likelihood that men
will cheat on them gamify the
process give him some carrots give him
something he could look forward to as a
consequence of the good action you would
like him to perform men are mostly
rational if they understand that they
will get more out of being loyal than
they would by not being loyal they are
much more likely to honor their
commitments and women are largely in
control of those
contingencies now obviously women are
going to have different Comfort levels s
with respect to the enticements they

[15:02]
with respect to the enticements they
will be willing to offer in exchange for
continued loyalty but offering some
enticement is a
no-brainer and the creamier the
enticement the more effective it's
likely to be in general it's a good idea
to reward the behaviors in your partner
that you want to see more of and this is
no
exception so there you have it the
appreciation Gap in a nutshell don't
make sacrifices unless you're honestly
willing to forgo acknowledgement and
recognition you're a human being with
emotional needs and you can choose which
Hills to die on and don't exclusively
rely on punishments to influence your
partner's Behavior give them carrots to
Chase and reward the behavior that you
want to
