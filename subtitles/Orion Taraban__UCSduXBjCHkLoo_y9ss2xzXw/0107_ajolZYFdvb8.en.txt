i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic today's short talk is
dealing with indirect requests i gotta
admit this is one of my pet peeves
i'm not a big fan of indirect
communication while i understand that
there is a time and a place for
suggestion
i'll take direct straight talk any day
of the week
and nowhere
does indirect communication seem to
cause more trouble than in our romantic
relationships here's a simple example
you're sitting in your living room and
your partner turns to you and says
oh it's cold in here
now is this simply an observation on the
ambient temperature
or is this an indirect request to turn
the heat up
and that's why i personally find
indirect communication distasteful it
protects the indirect communicator at
the expense of the other party why is
this
well in the first place if you never
make an actual request you can never be
rejected after all you're not actually

[01:00]
rejected after all you're not actually
asking for anything
so it protects the indirect communicator
from this possible outcome
and in the second place you retain
plausible deniability
so if the other party reads between the
lines assumes the implied request and
denies the implied request or wrangles
at the attempted manipulation then the
indirect communicator can argue that
there was no request and why do you
always assume i'm asking for something
it's a no lose situation for the
indirect communicator and potentially a
no-win situation for the other party so
it's kind of a selfish way to interact
with other people and it can be very
frustrating to deal with
so if this is an issue that's coming up
in your relationship
you might have to kind of retrain your
partner to be a more direct communicator
here's the best way i found to do that
if you hear a statement that you
perceive to be an indirect request
then your best move is to ask an honest
clarifying question
so for example in this case if your
partner says

[02:00]
partner says
it's cold in here
you could potentially respond by asking
are you asking me to turn the heat on
the key here is to ensure that this
remains an honest question by watching
your tone
because if you come off as sarcastic or
irritable it's probably going to provoke
defensiveness so phrase it as an honest
question are you asking me to turn the
heat on
if the tone is correct
that honest question will often prompt
the other party to rephrase the initial
statement as a direct request if that
was in fact the intention like oh yeah
would you please turn on the heat
and then of course you're free to
respond as you like
though when people make reasonable and
polite direct requests of us
we're generally much more amenable to
concession so this strategy is generally
good for both parties and the more we
set up win-win communication
opportunities with our partner the
better
give it a shot
it might take some practice however

it might take some practice however
asking honest clarifying questions in
response to perceived indirect requests
can prompt your partner to be more
mindful in asking for what he or she
really wants
which is an essential relationship skill
