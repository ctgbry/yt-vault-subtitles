I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how women
disrespect men without realizing it
bursting the bubble so this is the
second installment in a two-part episode
for the ladies I'm here to help you
understand how you might be getting in
your own way with respect to your
relationships with men in the first
episode I briefly discussed three ways
in which women inadvertently disrespect
Men by assuming inappropriate power over
their lives and they do this among other
ways through inappropriate questioning
granting permission and infantilizing
surveillance all of these behaviors
position the woman above the man which
will be perceived as disrespect and will
typically instigate conflict in the
relationship why because men For Better
or For Worse typically don't simply
allow other people to exercise
unauthorized power over them they rise
up

[01:00]
up
and it's their willingness and ability
to do so that more or less keeps things
free and safe ladies you probably
wouldn't mind if your man rose up to
challenge the bullies and tyrants who
threaten your freedom and safety by
usurping more power to themselves than
is appropriate take care that you
yourself do not assume more power than
is warranted in your own
relationships so let's now return to our
discussion on how women disrespect men
without realizing it the idea here is to
call women's attention to the ways in
which they may be inadvertently
sabotaging their
relationships they want with the men
they want to have them with as before
I'm not saying that women have a moral
or ethical responsibility to refrain
from these behaviors I'm saying that
refraining from these behaviors will
significantly increase the likelihood
that they will achieve their
relationship goals so let's get to it
the fourth way that women disrespect men

[02:01]
the fourth way that women disrespect men
without realizing It Is by demanding
explanations the request to explain
yourself is always a prerogative of the
more powerful of the less powerful it
assumes not only that the more powerful
party has a right to the requested
explanation that it is the higher
authority that must be answered to but
that it is also empowered to judge the
Merit of that explanation and to apply
punishment as appropriate ladies you are
none of these things you are not a man's
higher authority you are not his judge
and you are not his disciplinarian so do
not try to put yourself in these roles
by the same token women are subject to
disrespecting men when they demand
explanations in the face of reasonable
requests think about it if your boss
were to give you an assignment

[03:00]
were to give you an assignment
but you refused to comply with the
request until he provided sufficient
rationale for why this needs to be done
and why this is in the best interest of
the company and why you're the right
person for the job and hey did you
consider doing it this way instead I'd
rather do it this way that is if you
kept demanding explanations for why you
should do what was requested of you then
Not only would you be a very difficult
person to work with but you would come
off as insubordinate as well it is for
leaders who are appro appropriately
authorized to give orders to do their
part and it is for followers who are
appropriately authorized to execute them
to do their part when this happens there
is order and Harmony when this doesn't
happen there is disorder and chaos and
this is the result when reasonable
requests from appropriately authorized
leaders are questioned ignored or
selectively satisfied of course it is
always possible and necessary for

[04:02]
always possible and necessary for
followers to disregard or disobey
requests from their leaders when these
requests violate the orders of an even
higher
authority however these requests will
likely be few and far
between now before I go any further if

venmo uh I appreciate your support it
keeps all of this running thank you very
much and finally the fifth way that
women disrespect men without realizing
It Is by teasing teasing should be done
very selectively if at all and it should
never be done in front of of other

[05:00]
never be done in front of of other
people this is because teasing implies
that you are so comfortable in your
position that you consider a man to be a
play thing with which you can do what
you will with complete impunity it
communicates that you have nothing to
fear from toying with a man's status
because you consider yourself well
beyond the reach of any possible
consequences this is placing yourself
above a man which will be perceived as
disrespect even more so if it's done
publicly ladies you should even be
cautious about certain forms of humor
like sarcasm in my opinion sarcasm tends
to do much more harm than good in a
relationship this is because it is often
used as a passive aggressive way to
attack someone while retaining plausible
deniability that that is not what you
are doing in many cases it's not only
hurtful it's

[06:00]
hurtful it's
cowardly if you have a problem with your
man find a way to bring it to his
attention directly and respectfully
don't hide behind a poorly veiled
attempt at humor this is a form of
contempt which is just poison for
relationships remember you can say
something once that another person might
remember for the rest of his life so
think things through before you open
your
mouth all right so those are five ways
in which women are subject to
disrespecting men unintentionally all of
which involve the inappropriate
usurpation of power to some degree think
about it not only would you not do these
things to someone of higher status or
authority you wouldn't even do them to a
or an equal either ladies let's hope
that you're not demanding your
girlfriends explain themselves to you or
interrogating your co-workers these
behaviors only appear across powerful
differentials and in most case

[07:01]
differentials and in most case
significant power differentials from
high to low and just to respond to the
inevitable criticism of these episodes
I'm not arguing that men are inherently
above you and have a right to do these
things to you they don't these behaviors
are
disrespectful irrespective of whether a
woman does them to a man or a man does
them to a woman I don't do these things
to the women I've dated though I have
encountered many women who for whatever
reason believe it is their right or
their privilege to do them to
me they were not correct in this belief
in my experience men who are generally
much more comfortable navigating power
differentials in hierarchical
Arrangements typically already
understand that these behaviors are
disrespectful men understand that they
can't disrespect others with impunity

[08:00]
can't disrespect others with impunity
and they learn this because there are no
protections for men
unfortunately many women who enjoy
social and cultural protections that men
do not apparently haven't learned some
of these things yet maybe they didn't
have a strong father figure in the home
to teach them these things in any case
I'm here to help fill the Gap ladies if
you do any of these five things you are
violating the unbreakable rule
this puts your relationship on Shaky
Ground at best as a result you may need
to choose between these behaviors and a
peaceful and enduring relationship with
a man unfortunately you won't be able to
have both one of them has got to go
which one is up to
you now let's model the treatment we
wish to receive by keeping those
comments respectful what do you think
does this fit with your own experience
