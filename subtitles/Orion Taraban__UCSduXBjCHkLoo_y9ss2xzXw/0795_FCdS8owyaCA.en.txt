I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the two
paths this episode was inspired by an
excellent question that I received in my
members Community the other day the
question was functionally is it possible
for people to make positive changes in
their lives without having to learn the
hard way it's a really good question and
this episode is largely going to be the
response that I gave on that platform as
I think it would be useful for people to
hear on a larger level here we go there
are only two Paths of growth available
to human beings there is the path of
pain and there is the path of light
that's it those are the only two ways
that people learn and in my experience
99% of people learn 99% of their lessons
on the path of pain so let's start by
examining this path a bit first it's

[01:01]
examining this path a bit first it's
important to understand that despite how
it feels pain isn't bad in fact both
paths are good though certainly one is
much more pleasant than the other pain
is the gift that nobody wants but listen
to me carefully it is your most
trustworthy teacher as you navigate
through life why because pain gives you
feedback honest Fe feedback with respect
to how your behavior interacts with the
world and how your mental models align
with reality pain will never lie to you
pain will not try to protect your
feelings pain will always tell you the
truth in a way that your partner your
parents your therapist your priest no
one will be able to do as directly
consistently and forthright

[02:00]
consistently and forthright
L you experience pain when you act on
mental models that are not aligned with
reality for example if you think a stove
should be cold when it isn't and you
place your hand on the burner with that
knowledge and expectation you are going
to experience pain that is you
experience pain when your knowledge is
wrong which is a nicer way of saying
when you're
ignorant this ignorance could be about
the nature of current conditions it
could be about the rules whereby we
extrapolate current conditions into
future conditions and it could be about
assumptions with respect to what
condition should be attended to and what
ignored and the vast majority of this
knowledge is gained through experience
which in many cases is a euphemism for
pain now it's also important to
understand that pain is not the same
thing as suffering suffering is pain

[03:01]
thing as suffering suffering is pain
plus judgment the Judgment that the pain
is somehow unbearable wrong unjust
self-defining Etc and it can be useful
to remember that pain is itself a
construct pain is sensation plus
judgment the Judgment that the sensation
is somehow aversive unpleasant
uncomfortable Etc it's useful to
remember that no sensation is
universally experienced as unpleasant
like I guarantee you no matter how
painful you might consider a sensation
to be there are people in this world
right now who are seeking after that
same sensation as a source of pleasure
in any case my definition of pain is
that it's feedback from the universe
that you are somehow not in line with
reality now if you're like me you've had
to learn your lessons the hard way and
as a therapist I think that's everyone

[04:00]
as a therapist I think that's everyone
right like I'm not going to prevent
someone from walking into pain I'll
counsel them against it which is light
but I won't stop them everyone has the
right to make their own mistakes and
there might actually be something
cowardly and fragile about the person
who just takes other people's advice and
never fails on his or her own terms the
lessons that people learn through pain
are so deeply integrated into their
being that once they are fully accepted
they never unlearn them and this is why
the highest wisdom is so often ignored
by others when it comes from someone
else it's kind of held at arms length
until the truth of it that is its
ability to help someone avoid pain in
the real world of actual decisions is
tested and
integrated if you're interested in

exclusive content that you won't find
anywhere else click the link in the
description for more information hope to
see you
aboard fortunately however this is not
the only way way to learn there is
another path which is the path of light
light is knowledge wisdom and Revelation
now the real enduring benefit of light
is that it can be
communicated it's not really possible to
communicate pain like there's nothing
you can say to impart to another person
just how painful it is to break your arm
or lose a loved one for better or worse
they kind of have to go through the
experience themselves in order to have a

[06:02]
experience themselves in order to have a
sense of what that might feel like light
on the other hand can be communicated to
others even in advance of when they
might need its guidance it's
collectively Humanity's best resource
for combating ignorance and reducing
unnecessary
suffering that said it will probably
never be possible to eliminate pain
entirely because light is almost always
lessons that other people people have
learned through
pain light is like transmuted pain if
you take away one you'll eventually take
away the
other in this world pain is everywhere
it's almost
omnipresent except for this very
straight and very narrow path that is
constantly fluctuating with the current
conditions of the present moment this
straight and narrow path is the path of
light and the path of pain is on either

[07:03]
light and the path of pain is on either
side of it if you step off the path of
light that is if you're not in perfect
alignment with reality you're going to
experience pain and this pain is like a
sematic signal that you've stepped off
the path of light it's like one of those
rumble strips that lets you know that
your car is starting to drift out of its
Lane in this way there is a kind of
benevolence to pain as it can keep keep
a sensitive responsive individual from
getting too far off the straight and
narrow
path now these two paths are
complimentary in many ways for instance
the more people learn through pain the
less they learn through light and the
more they learn through light the less
they learn through pain why because when
people finally truly and fully learn the
lesson that pain has been trying to
teach them then they change their

[08:00]
teach them then they change their
behavior to be more aligned with
reality and so experience less pain
using pain to course correct should put
them a bit more on the path of light and
until that happens their life can
certainly feel dark and miserable and
why wouldn't it there is no light on the
path of pain so the more pain there is
the less light there is to be
seen fortunately the converse is also
true that is the more light there is the
less pain there is to be
felt and this gives us the truest test
of whether somebody is actually wise
they don't have a lot of pain in their
lives because they have learned their
[ __ ]
lessons they learned the lessons that
pain had been trying to teach them to
course correct onto the path of light
listen to me a person who is unhappy and
unsuccess successful is not wise a

[09:02]
unsuccess successful is not wise a
person who is anxious or depressed is
not wise a person who is arrogant or
victimizing or envious or irritable is
not wise maybe they have a little
knowledge but as they say a little
knowledge can be a dangerous thing
internal States like these are the most
reliable signs that a person is still
not in Real Alignment with reality to
some extent and you know what that's
okay I haven't learned all of my lessons
once and for all either we're all works
in progress but the trick is to get
better at learning those lessons sooner
and with fewer repetitions so that we
can all of us walk more and more on the
path of light and receive more of our
instruction from that truth and one of
the best ways to do that is to learn
from other people anybody can be a
teacher if you approach them with the

[10:00]
teacher if you approach them with the
right attitude I mean a lot of people
will teach you what not to do but that
is certainly useful instruction
especially with in the context of
experiencing less pain I would recommend
using books and media with this
intention don't consume content for
pleasure engage with media for your own
edification which is a fancy way of
saying for your own good seek out the
truth contained within it that can help
help you suffer less that can help you
get off the path of pain and onto the
path of light like if you find one
kernel of Truth in a book that helps you
tread a bit more on the path of light
that's a book well read the more you
seek out the truth the more you will
find it when you begin to actually apply
what you've learned in your own life you
won't have to hit your head against the
wall as much as you currently do and you
can learn these lessons vicariously from
others who have decided to stop hitting
their own heads against the wall and

[11:01]
their own heads against the wall and
have succeeded in communicating their
own transmuted pain as
light what do you think does this fit
