so when someone tells me H you I'm sorry
Orion I'm having trouble concentrating
because of my ADHD what I actually hear
is H I'm sorry Orion I'm having trouble
concentrating because of my trouble
concentrating the symptom is the
disorder so you can't really blame the
symptom on anything other than itself
but reification kind of creates a thing
a disorder inside of people that they
can blame in lie of assuming personal
responsibility over at least that
proportion of the variance of the issue
that resides within their domain of
control now maybe we do have this thing
inside of us that for whatever reason we
just can't see with all of our Advanced
Technologies I mean the strong nuclear
force wasn't discovered until the 1930s
and it certainly existed before then but
right now we can't but we act like we
can and it's this acting like that in my
opinion is creating a lot more problems
than it's solving and the biggest
problem that it's creating is an
inappropriate dependence on a privileged
class of Specialists who enjoy a
monopoly on the indicated treatment
