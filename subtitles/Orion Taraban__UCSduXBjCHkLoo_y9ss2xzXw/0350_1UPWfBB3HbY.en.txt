I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is what
women don't understand about chivalry
in the dating Market there are still
women in today's day and age who
apparently lament the decline of
chivalry and when I encounter this I'm
always a little perplexed like I can
understand why women might miss some of
the benefits and social niceties they
used to enjoy under chivalry having the
door held open for them say or having
everything paid for them old school
gentlemanly stuff that has all that
disappeared from today's culture I can
understand why women might miss those
things
they're nice but there's a real problem
with lamenting The Disappearance of
chivalry that speaks to something women
don't quite understand about the
institution
and before I explain what that is please
be sure to like this episode And

than a second costs you nothing and it's
how you can demonstrate some old school
manners so do the thing
now what are women missing
women don't seem to appreciate that
chivalry is a culture of manners
that provided for women in large part
because women had nothing of Their Own
and it was the fact that women had
nothing of Their Own
that provided the rationale
for chivalric provision
like in my examples from before men
opening doors for women was only a
meaningful gesture because doors were
closed to women both figuratively and
literally men paying for everything was
expected because women literally didn't
have money of Their Own
the Dark Side of chivalry is that it
more or less requires that women be
restricted and impoverished otherwise
it's completely ridiculous
as I've mentioned in previous episodes
romantic love is based on the chivalric

[02:00]
romantic love is based on the chivalric
code of knights who lived in the 11th
and 12th centuries in southern France
and what you have to understand is that
romance was a kind of an excuse to have
an adventure both for the man and for
the woman the man got to put on his
Shining Armor and go questing in the
name of his lady fair and the woman got
to have in an emotional affair with a
dashing daring hero I say emotional
affair because typically the object of
the chivalric knights affection was
actually married to another man check
out my episode on the truth about
romance on obtainability for more on
that topic
life was pretty boring in the 12th
centuries and romance helped to spice
things up a bit
however a kind of necessary component of
the heroism that permeates the Romantic
lifestyle
is the inability of anyone but the hero
to accomplish the task
and this means that the other players
must either pretend to be or actually be

[03:03]
must either pretend to be or actually be
incompetent or insufficient in order for
the hero to do his thing
to rescue the Damsel in Distress
the damsel must first be locked away
that's what creates the necessity of
chivalric action the unfreedom of women
if the Damsel in question held the key
to her cage the whole time Not only
would the whole chivalric effort be a
farce but it would almost be
psychotically manipulative to boot
in short what women don't understand
about chivalry is that chivalry only
makes sense in the context of women's
General impoverishment restriction and
incompetence
as these things provide the necessary
rationale for men's provision Liberation
and heroism
and as much as I love heroism I think
it's generally better for everyone that
women not be impoverished restricted or

[04:03]
women not be impoverished restricted or
incompetent
this is why I'm befuddled when I hear
women say that they miss chivalry what I
hear is that these women miss the days
when women couldn't do anything for
themselves
as it was not being able to do anything
for themselves that created the
meaningful rationale for men's chivalric
action
women's restriction is the necessary
precondition of the romantic adventure
for men
women's Liberation destroys the same
precondition you can have one or the
other but you can't have both
something to keep in mind
what do you think do you have any
examples from your own life about this
