i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
never talk to yourself in a way you
wouldn't speak to a close friend
so mastering your self-talk is really an
essential skill for your own mental
health and emotional well-being
and unfortunately many people's
self-talk is extremely negative it's
cruel and caustic and critical and
regardless of what your life looks like
on the outside if that's the way you
speak to yourself on the inside it will
be very
very difficult to have any measure of
quality of life
and so when i ask folks to become
increasingly mindful of their own
self-talk where i usually begin is by
asking them to consider making a
commitment to not talk to themselves in
a way they wouldn't speak to a close
friend
it's kind of that simple
you don't have to be super positive or
learn affirmations or discover your
mantra though those things can be useful
you just have to stop being so negative

[01:01]
you just have to stop being so negative
if you wouldn't call a close friend
someone you love and care about say a
worthless piece of
then why would you do it to yourself
your relationship with yourself is the
most important relationship you have
because it's the relationship you can't
get away from buddy
you can move out of your parents house
you can divorce your spouse you can
never speak to your friends again but
you and yourself are kind of permanent
roommates you are in that relationship
24 7. and so you kind of want to show up
in that relationship so that you're good
company
eventually you can potentially begin to
approach supporting yourself or
encouraging yourself or praising
yourself but mastering your self-talk
always begins by creating a commitment
to refrain from attacking shaming
criticizing yourself
if you wouldn't say it to a close friend
don't say it to yourself
it's
really that simple
