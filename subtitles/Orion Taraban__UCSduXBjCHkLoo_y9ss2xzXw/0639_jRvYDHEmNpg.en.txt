I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is mission
accomplished so what is this all about
well I'm making this episode to Mark the
threeyear
anniversary of my first published
episode on this channel like any other
project I had no idea whether this would
succeed so when I began this process I
made a commitment to myself to publish
content regularly for 3 years regardless
of the response I received before I
would even entertain the question as to
whether I would keep going and now here
we are three years later wow today I'd
like to take this opportunity to talk a
little bit about my process and how I
was able to fulfill this commitment to
myself because I think it might be of
value to people in the attainment of
their own goals first of all I have to
say that this channel has exceeded my

[01:02]
say that this channel has exceeded my
wildest
expectations I didn't set a goal for
myself in terms of views or subscribers
or watch time but I do remember thinking
that if I could get a thousand
subscribers it would be quite an
accomplishment I was already thrilled
when a 100 people would watch a new
episode because if you think about it
100 is actually a really strong turnout
like when was the last time you spoke in
front of of 100 people few people rarely
if ever get to command the attention of
an audience that size I remember back
when I was an actor in New York I once
performed in a three-hour show for two
people when I was a professor I would
teach classes of 20 25 students Max so
100 is like a packed Auditorium it's
like standing room only and when I hit
1,000 subscribers I remember feeling so
proud of what I had accomplished it

[02:02]
proud of what I had accomplished it
meant that there were 1,000 people out
there somewhere who were at least
willing to give me a chance and let me
tell you it is very very very very hard
to get people to give you a chance like
you could reveal the secrets and
Mysteries of creation you could teach
people how to turn lead into gold you
could bring someone back from the dead
but if that video only has three views
good luck getting anyone to watch even
the first 10 seconds that's just the way
it is and now here we are 3 years later
last month we crossed half a million
subscribers and the channel routinely
gets millions of views every week it's
wild it is not an overstatement to say
that the success of this channel has
changed my life and it's largely changed
my life for the better and of course
none of this would have been possible
without all of you who are listening on

[03:00]
without all of you who are listening on
the other side of the screen you
literally made this happen and I'm very
very grateful very grateful I hope that
you've benefited from the content that
I've put out there and that your lives
have also improved as a result I really
have some amazing fans but back to my
process when I first started out I
decided to give this project enough time
to succeed so that's the first takeaway
here almost everything takes more time
and effort than you might expect and
people people don't often give
themselves sufficient opportunity to
achieve their goals and what is that
opportunity well my rule of thumb is
that it is due diligence times 1.5 what
does this mean well in this case I spent
an hour to researching YouTube before I
started out and I discovered that it
could take two years for a channel to
get any kind of traction on the platform
so I decided to give myself three years
to
succeed right that's the two years
suggested by my due diligence times 1.5

[04:02]
suggested by my due diligence times 1.5
or 50% more time than what my research
suggested I figured that if I still
couldn't make it work at 1.5x then I
would have given it a solid effort but I
would probably need to reevaluate my
goals in my experience I've seen too
many people quit too soon and I didn't
want to be one of them this is kind of
like accounting for penalty time in a
soccer game you have to expect that the
game will not end at regulation if you
only pay yourself for 90 minutes you
might not be able to make something
happen when it might matter the most the
idea is to always extend yourself past
the Finish Line because the finish line
that you can see is generally not the
real Finish Line so that's the first
takeaway now before I go any further if
you're liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this episode to someone
who might benefit from its message
because it's Word of Mouth referrals
like this that really help to make the
channel grow I'm also proud to announce
that my book the value of of others is

[05:00]
that my book the value of of others is
now available for pre-sale on Amazon I'm
also writing original content for my
free newsletter every week so if you'd
like to sign up you can do so on my
website finally please fill out an
inquiry form on my website if you're
interested in booking a paid
consultation links to everything in the
description all right let's get back to
it now the second takeaway is to begin
where you're at and to build sustainably
if you watch my first episode be the
person you in love you can see that I
don't have a fancy camera or a
microphone or a lighting system or even
a script and I certainly wasn't about to
spend thousands and thousands of dollars
on these things before I even began the
idea was to get started as soon as
possible and to learn from my mistakes
through successive iteration and those
mistakes were numerous I experimented
with lots of different setups and
strategies and in the beginning I did
everything myself this often took 15 to

[06:00]
everything myself this often took 15 to
20 hours a week and I had to find that
time after finishing my other two jobs
and this wasn't easy I was often tired I
was alone and I received almost no
positive reinforcement whatsoever for my
efforts for over a year and a half
certainly no money but also no praise or
support or consideration if people left
a comment on an episode it was usually
about how bad the audio was it was hard
to keep going but I did didn't give up
because I made a commitment to myself
and this is the third takeaway I treat
my word as even if it's just to myself
or rather especially if it's just to
myself as if it is a legally bonded
contract if I say it out loud I'm going
to do it this is a discipline that I
cultivated in myself years ago and I
said this commitment out loud so I
treated this commitment like it was a
contractual agreement with a third party
subject the penalties if I didn't

[07:00]
subject the penalties if I didn't
deliver and my deliverables weren't
success or fame or money none of those
things were within my locus of control
my deliverables were consistent content
that's it all I had to do to fulfill my
word was to post regularly and in three
years I haven't missed a single date it
was my job to post the content and
whether it was ignored or celebrated or
praised or reviled was technically
outside my pay grade and therefore none
of my legitimate concern and I executed
that commitment to myself by channeling
my inner Postman neither rain nor snow
nor sleep nor hail shall keep the
postmen from their appointed rounds
because I had made it myself appointed
duty to post content regularly the
question as to whether I felt motivated
or inspired or EX exhausted or

[08:00]
or inspired or EX exhausted or
distracted or whatever was completely
irrelevant the male needed to be
delivered and it's going to be delivered
regardless of the weather which is why I
never even asked myself whether I wanted
to keep going this was something I
decided I was only permitted to ask
myself after I had given myself
sufficient opportunity to
succeed that said the period between 6
and 18 months was tough nothing happened
it is hard to keep talking to no one I
remember going to my men's group and
confessing guys I I don't know what's
going on I know that my content is good
I know that it can help people I know
that there is an audience out there that
needs and wants to hear this I don't
know what the problem is and this is the
next takeaway I was able to get through
that period without any positive
reinforcement because I really really
believed in what I was doing not not in
a narcissistic I can do anything kind of

[09:02]
a narcissistic I can do anything kind of
way but in a I've looked at this very
very carefully and my best thinking
indicates that it should work kind of a
way I stuck with it because I believed
in myself and I was the only one who
believed in me for quite some time but
that doesn't matter if you really truly
believe in yourself then it doesn't
matter if anyone else does and if you
don't believe in yourself then it
wouldn't matter if everyone else did
this is why it is necessary to believe
it to see it without that I might have
given up a long time
ago but here we are
today with this I'm proud to be able to
say that I consider my commitment to
myself
fulfilled and this of course begs the
question am I going to keep going and
the answer
is yes I'm going to keep going
I'm going to keep going as long as I can

[10:02]
I'm going to keep going as long as I can
in fact I have some pretty high
aspirations for this channel there might
be some changes in the future as I
experiment with new ways of delivering
content however I promise to continue to
