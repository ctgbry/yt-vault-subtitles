People want what they want. That's it's
their right. That's not going to change.
But if a woman basically says, I'm going
to leave you if you don't give me a
ring. What she's functionally
communicating is, I want what I want
more than I want you. More than I want
you in my life more than I want to be in
a relationship with you. I I have no
interest in that relationship. I mean,
if I'm going to marry anybody, it'd be
somebody that I felt truly and deeply
loved me. And I don't think there's an
ultimatum in that type of relationship
because love doesn't really ask for
anything in return. It's one desire is
to just remain in the presence of the
loved one and it's willing to surrender
even that if it's in the best interest
of the loved one. That's the truest sign
that somebody loves is that they're
willing to surrender their claim to
anything else and even to walk away from
the relationship if it's in the best
interest of the other person. If you
love something, set it free kind of a
thing. But that's a very high bar and
most people are not in those types of
relationships. We need to be honest.
They're in relationships where they get
what they want until they don't and then
the relationship begins to suffer. So I

the relationship begins to suffer. So I
think that men should settle down when
they want to, when it's ready for them.
And for better or for worse, women are
on shorter timelines than men,
especially if they want to have kids.
