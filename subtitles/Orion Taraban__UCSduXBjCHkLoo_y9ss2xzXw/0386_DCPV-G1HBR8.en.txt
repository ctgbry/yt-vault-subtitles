I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is produce
more than you consume this is a very
wise General principle and there's a
number of different ways that you can
apply it effectively and today I'll be
talking about three such ways two you
probably already know but they're worth
saying while the third has more of that
special psychic sauce so let's get to it
let's start with the most obvious
application if you burn more calories
than you consume you will lose weight
it's really that simple in fact there
really is no other reliable way to lose
weight except by burning more calories
than you consume if you succeed in
restricting yourself in this way you
will sidestep at least half of the most
common physical ailments that people are
subject to especially in the second half
of Life which are compounded and
exacerbated by being overweight
and obese if this is you find a way to
produce more than you consume the time

[01:02]
produce more than you consume the time
to take action is now
the second obvious application of this
principle is to earn more than you spend
live within your means
it's really that simple if you don't
have enough money for something
unnecessary for survival do not buy it
getting into credit card debt is very
very easy getting out of credit card
debt is very very very hard the interest
rates are criminal some are over 20
percent it's really difficult to get out
of credit card debt because any payments
you make are applied to the interest
first which means it takes a long time
to whittle down the principle you may
end up paying three to five times as
much in interest than the cost of the
thing you bought this means that if you
can't afford to pay off your credit card
at the end of the month you need to
multiply the price of whatever you want
to buy three to five times that's the

[02:00]
to buy three to five times that's the
true cost to you you almost certainly do
not need that thing
I don't care how much you make if your
expenses are less than your income
you're going to sidestep another
enormous Pitfall that ensnares millions
of people the laws here are stacked
against you so it's better not to get
yourself into that situation if you want
something find ways to earn more money
don't borrow money on a credit card as
you increase your means you can increase
your expenditures to improve the quality
of your life responsibly and gradually
be patient you'll actually get there
faster if you don't have to dig yourself
out of debt on the way
now before I go any further if you're

now my third application of this
principle isn't so obvious here it is
you need to create more than you absorb
there are some folks out there who are
just absorbing content Non-Stop and this
can significantly distort their minds
and skew their perception of the world
for instance some folks absorb hours of
political commentary every day
they know what all the folks working in
government are doing and they have a
very good idea of what they should be
doing instead however while their
absorption may even have made them
Experts of A Sort they do not create
anything of political value
I think there should be a rule after so
many years of absorbing political
content people should actually have to
get involved in politics otherwise they

[04:01]
get involved in politics otherwise they
get cut off
run for office you can start locally
there are lots of things that need to
get done at the town or county level I
guarantee it
these folks will learn very quickly how
the sausage is made the experience is
very different when you're acting on
stage versus muttering in the peanut
gallery and the truth is you are not
meant to spend your whole life in the
peanut gallery working as a Creator will
give you a much deeper and richer
understanding of how things actually
work which will almost certainly redound
to your beliefs and perceptions
by the same token if you're spending
hours scrolling through social media or
watching YouTube videos then at a
certain point you should actually get
involved with creating content
or get cut off
start a podcast or launch your own
social media account I guarantee this
will drastically
affect your perspective on things most

[05:02]
affect your perspective on things most
significantly it will change how you
perceive and value other people's
creations
it's not good to consume more than you
produce and this is true intellectually
as it is true physically and financially
when people consume media non-stop their
heads are actually full of other
people's ideas it gets to the point
where it's actually very hard for them
to think for themselves thinking
independently is difficult
everyone thinks they can do it not many
people can it's very hard to have an
original thought it takes time effort
reflection creativity and insight
however by consuming less and creating
more you can begin to suss out what
actually belongs to you and what
actually belongs to your parents culture
and media
this is because creating is a way of
making sense of what you've consumed if

[06:01]
making sense of what you've consumed if
you're consuming but not creating it's
like you're eating but you're not
do you understand you're just
full of intake and that's going to leave
you bloated and disgusting
creation is a process in which you
digest what you've consumed it allows
you to take what is actually healthy and
nutritious which in the intellectual
sphere is what is true and useful and to
relieve yourself of the rest this is
really important
so whatever you're consuming at a
certain point the time will come for you
to go out there and create something
with it
try something anything within your
abilities use it as an impetus to make
sense of what you've consumed you'll
cultivate agency and Independence and
real critical thought and it will
absolutely enrich your experience of
whatever you've been consuming what do
you think how do you create in your own
