I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
marry a rich attractive man so this one
is for the ladies today I'm going to
teach you how to do this because it's
apparently what a lot of you want to do
so let's get right to it first of all
let's be clear when I say rich I mean
real rich rich in the sense that you
don't have to work anymore rich in the
sense that you can do whatever you want
whether that be traveling the world and
enjoying all kinds of luxurious and
pleasurable experiences or staying at
home and raising a bunch of kids
marrying a man of considerable means
will always be a dream of many women as
through him a woman will be able to
realize her dreams without all that
pesky work by conquering one man she can
conquer the world combine this with a

[01:02]
conquer the world combine this with a
man who is also handsome and charming
and interesting and famous and you a
very attractive option indeed so it
should go without saying ladies that
this is the very hardest man to marry as
I discussed in a previous episode if a
man is rich and
attractive he's not going to be loyal so
if you're targeting this type the
Playboy for matrimony you first need to
have have a real hard look at the woman
in the mirror such men are like double
black diamonds if you are not an expert
skier you should probably stay on the
bunny slopes and deal with the fact that
that's the best that you can do punching
outside your weight class is only going
to get you
hurt that said Rich attractive men do
marry women so it is possible to capture
this query however you will need to pour

[02:00]
this query however you will need to pour
a good deal of effort and intention into
your seduction there's no way around it
but you know what that's totally fair
like if you're trying to seduce a man
whose lifestyle would enable you to
never work again guess what you'll need
to put as much effort into the process
as you would put into working a job
until you're 65 because that's probably
what you're going to end up doing if you
fail even if you end up marrying a less
wealthy man in today's economy you need
to take your seduction seriously and
pour a lot of effort and attention into
the process otherwise it's never going
to work so how do you do this well first
and foremost you need to be very
physically attractive and sexually
available if you are neither very
attractive or you have qualms about
offering sex it's probably not going to
work and you will be better off hunting
for different prey as as I've said

[03:00]
for different prey as as I've said
before you need to tempt men with the
richest creamiest milk that you can
possibly offer this is the Trojan Horse
that induces men to open the gates and
invite you into the
city however merely being physically
attractive and sexually available will
not be enough to capture a man this is
because what opens the gate is not what
conquers the city the two phases call
for two different Suites of skills and
you will fail if you don't possess both
the same is true for all kinds of
relationships like how often do you
interview for a job after you've been
hired if you don't interview well you
might not ever be hired but if you don't
work well your tenure there will likely
be very
short-lived and this of course is what
most women fear that once they begin a
sexual relationship they will simply be
discarded afterward and while this can
happen this generally doesn't occur

[04:03]
happen this generally doesn't occur
because the man is just an insatiable
rake these men exist but most men are
very far from that archetype men
typically don't throw women out after
initiating a sexual relationship because
it is typically very timec consuming
difficult and expensive to initiate a
sexual relationship with anyone woman
spending weeks to seduce a woman for a
single night of pleasure is a
significant loss so most men would
prefer to get a better return on their
investment this is an unpopular belief
but if a woman is thrown out of the city
after she's been invited in it's
probably because she did not develop the
second Suite of skills and very likely
bungled the opportunity she had created
for herself usually this is due to some
offensiveness in her behavior was she

[05:00]
offensiveness in her behavior was she
disagreeable was she demanding was she
jealous was she critical was she
judgmental was she boring was she
self-absorbed was she withholding like
these things are not going to work they
don't work on any men but men with fewer
options and less sense will put up with
them not so of our much prised Quarry if
you're targeting a rich attractive man
you cannot be any of these things remove
them
if not from your personality then at
least from your presentation when you're
in his presence like if you want to keep
your high-paying job then you have to be
professional at all times some women
seem to believe they can dispense with
professionalism as soon as they've been
hired my dear it's your first week on
the job you should be trying to figure
out who's who not rearranging the office
furniture you can come to exercise
considerable power and control over a
man however you have to cultivate this

[06:00]
man however you have to cultivate this
slowly and in the proper ways so if
you're a woman and you find it difficult
to stay in relationships with the men
you really want it's probably because
you are attractive enough to be hired
but too offensive to be
retained just telling it like it
is if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my

now here's the thing a rich attractive
man isn't going to marry a beautiful
woman just because she is
inoffensive that's not enough there is
something else she must do and to
explain what this something else is I'm
going to tell you a short story it's a
very old story but it exemplifies this
something else better than any other
story I know here it
is a long time ago there lived a rich
and powerful King and as is often the
case with Rich and powerful men this
King had a Pon for the ladies every day
his servants brought him a selection of
beautiful women he would choose the one
that tickled his fancy spend the night
with her and have her killed in the
morning one day the king's servants
brought him a young woman of uncommon
Beauty and it was of course a foregone
conclusion that the king should choose

[08:00]
conclusion that the king should choose
her for his night of pleasure however
this woman was exceedingly rare Not only
was she very beautiful but she was also
extremely clever she had heard the
stories of the king's nightly conquests
and knew the Fate that awaited her in
the morning and since necessity is the
mother of invention our heroin hatched a
plan here's what she came up with that
night one she was alone with the King
she started to tell him a story and not
just any story a story that catered
exactly to the king's tastes with her
words she was able to draw him into a
tale of high romance there was exciting
adventure and Torrid sensuality and
Noble Heroes she was so Lively and
amusing and entertaining that the King
was drawn into her story and just as she
was approaching a climax

[09:00]
was approaching a climax
she suddenly became very tired and
begged the king's permission to finish
the story
tomorrow now the King was put off by
this this wasn't how things usually went
however he found himself wanting to know
what happened and of course if he killed
the woman in the morning he would never
know so what's the harm the king thought
to himself I'll let her finish in the
morning and then just kill her the day
after that is a small price to pay to
hear how the story ends
however as you might Imagine The Story
did not end tomorrow the woman was
always one step ahead just as things
seemed to be headed to a resolution she
would introduce a new crisis or
character to keep things moving night
after night the woman delayed her
execution by one day her Heroes were so
memorable a swashbuckling sailor the
noble leader of a gang of Thieves a
street urchin who discovers a magic lamp

[10:00]
street urchin who discovers a magic lamp
that the king could not help but care
deeply about their trials and victories
and through it all there was the woman
so Charming so alluring so
intriguing night after night The Woman
cast her spell on the king who
eventually succumbed to her
enchantment finally after evading death
for 1,1 consecutive nights an
unprecedented and miraculous feat the
woman had achieved her Victory the king
had fallen in love with shaherazad
instead of killing her he made her his
queen and the two ruled together in
loving Harmony for many years after the
end
so that's the secret ladies if you want
to capture the king if you want to marry
a rich attractive man then you have to
channel your inner

[11:00]
channel your inner
shaherazad it is not enough to be
attractive shaherazad was beautiful it's
why she was chosen but if she were only
beautiful she would have been discarded
in the morning what shaherazad did what
was cental to her victory was Captivate
the king to conquer the city a woman
must captivate its
king so many women out there are dull
boring entitled and
self-centered they don't know what a
particular man wants they don't care
what a particular man wants so they
never bother to learn why make an effort
when you're the prize to be won
right good the more of those women there
are the easier it will be for you my
clever and enchanting female audience to
work your magic in fact it may never be
easy I to stand out from the mass of

[12:01]
easy I to stand out from the mass of
charmless and misguided women than it is

Rich attractive man it is imperative
that you do your homework all men are
