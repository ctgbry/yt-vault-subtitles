first question for you uh you said that
women mate and date for gain and Men try
to mate and date for acceptable loss and
I was very curious about that well sure
I mean the mate and date for gain part
is just basic hypertony which is more
the sense of I think women need to feel
like they're going to benefit from a
relationship to feel like it's worth the
opportunity cost of pursuing that
opportunity versus all the other
opportunities they may have available to
them it sort of makes sense I think guys
would also mate and date for Gam kind of
if they could but because a lot of that
takes place in the 20s where women's
sexual Marketplace value is higher than
men's I think that they are in a
privileged position to better dictate
terms for a relationship so it's simple
economics if women are mating and dating
for gain then if they're Ming a dating
with men anyway men have to sort of
resign themselves to accept loss and I
think that there is acceptable loss and
unacceptable loss and I think it's for
every man to determine for himself where
that line is
