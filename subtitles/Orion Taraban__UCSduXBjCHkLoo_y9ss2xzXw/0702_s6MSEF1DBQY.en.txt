I'm Dr Orion tabban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is don't
fight to keep people in your life this
is a very important rule for all types
of relationships it's just as applicable
to platonic familial and professional
relationships as it is to sexual
relationships the advice is actually
fairly straightforward don't fight to
keep someone in your life or to say the
same thing in another way never stand in
the way of someone
leaving if someone wants to leave let
them let them go bye-bye all the best
now I understand that this advice can be
hard to hear when someone you don't want
to leave starts to walk out of your life
it can induce a panicked urgent
desperate
sensation that's okay you can feel that
sensation and not act on it and it's
very important not to act on it for at

[01:01]
very important not to act on it for at
least two reasons in the first place you
have to appreciate that fighting to keep
someone in your life is ineffective like
it doesn't work if you try to prevent
someone who wants to leave a
relationship from leaving what's the
most likely outcome that's right they
fight harder to leave when people feel
that they're not free to leave that
they're literally or figuratively
imprisoned they typically try harder to
assert their autonomy when you fight to
keep someone you end up with more
fighting and why would you want to
increase the amount of conflict in your
life or to maintain a high conflict
relationship like anything worth
fighting for a warm and loving and
supportive relationship will be
destroyed in the fighting for it and
this means that even if you win even if
you somehow succeed in preventing
someone from leaving you have at best

[02:01]
someone from leaving you have at best
achieved a very pic Victory whereby you
likely lost more than you
gained once more succeeding in
preventing someone from leaving for the
moment typically only delays their
escape it is at best a temporary
solution it might work for a time but
the mechanism of action isn't very
flattering that is some people stay
because they're afraid of the escalating
conflict or they feel guilty for causing
you pain or they feel pity at your
awkward
humiliation but these feelings will
change soon enough and once the fear or
the guilt or the pity disappears they
will come once more into emotional
contact with whatever reasons were motiv
motivating them to leave to begin with
and they will very likely try to leave
the relationship again though they will
likely do so even more discreetly this
time my personal attitude toward my
relationship is that I am an anti-cult

[03:03]
relationship is that I am an anti-cult
think about a cult a cult is easy to get
into and hard to get out of I'm the
total opposite I am hard to get into and
very easy to get out of it's not that
the door isn't locked it's that there is
no [ __ ] door the exit is always open
and unobstructed and just like an
airline Steward is I always make sure
that people know where it is located and
I think this is useful for a number of
reasons imagine being on a high
precipice with no guard
rail what does awareness of that
situation tend to do to people they
watch their step they hone their focus
and they don't do anything foolish this
is because cognizance of potential risk
inspires caution which actually prevents
a great number of avoidable problems
it's paradoxical but feeling too safe is

[04:01]
it's paradoxical but feeling too safe is
responsible for the Lion's Share of
unnecessary accidents this is because
when people feel too safe they feel
increasingly emboldened to do all kinds
of ridiculous things since they believe
that safety will prevent them and
protect them from the consequences of
their actions and this is not always the
case on the other hand when people
believe that a misstep could lead to a
nasty fall they tend to take much more
care of where they plant at their feet
don't give those with whom you are in a
relationship the impression that they
will be insured of your continued
presence in their lives irrespective of
what they say or do remember fear is the
basis of
respect if you appreciate the insights
on this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my

[05:02]
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook Audi book and
paperback formats the links are in the
description
so if someone wants to leave if a friend
is taking a different path in life if a
woman thinks she can do better then let
them go and if you can wish them well at
least in your heart wish them well thank
them for accompanying you as long as
they did and part graciously not only
will this make it easier for you to let
go of that relationship but it will also
increase the likelihood that the ones
who leave will eventually regret the
their departures now when someone is

[06:02]
their departures now when someone is
heading for the door an Impulse might
arise in you to either justify your
value or remind the one leaving of all
the value you've provided in the past
surrendering to either of these impulses
would be a mistake this is because the
game does not run on gratitude people
are more likely to feel resentful of
your reminding them of your good works
then grateful and in any case they've
already benefited from those Works they
don't lose them by leaving the
relationship rather people only lose
what they still want but haven't yet
been given so this isn't likely to work
furthermore if you've gotten to the
point when you have to remind someone of
your value then your words aren't going
to do [ __ ] if they can't see it already
your words will not reveal it to them
when people have gotten to the point
where they are threatening to leave a
relation ship then words are likely to

[07:01]
relation ship then words are likely to
be insufficient to change their minds
it's also degrading to justify yourself
it's a form of begging and few people
are going to base an ongoing
relationship on pity don't give them the
chance and here's the last piece if
someone actually leaves like they
literally walk out then never ever
ever chase them down
if someone storms out of your house you
don't run out into the street and beg
them to return and I'm telling you this
because some women will do this to test
a relationship out of the misguided
belief that running after them or
fighting for them demonstrates the
extent to which you care for her it
doesn't rather what it demonstrates is
that the woman in question doesn't care
much about you

[08:00]
much about you
as she is apparently willing to place
her need for reassurance ahead of your
desire for peace and that she can and
will inject chaos and conflict into your
life when she feels justified in doing
so a woman who actually cared about you
would not do that so don't fall for that
line of reasoning if someone runs out on
you you can decide whether or not to
accept them back into your life however
ever if they run out the bare minimum
required effort to resume a
relationship is they have to walk back
in that is the bare [ __ ] minimum you
don't go to them they have to come to
you and if they don't they are not yet
sufficiently interested or ready to have
a relationship with you so why would you
go out of your way to accommodate them

[09:00]
go out of your way to accommodate them
and this can potentially be hard to
accept but the fact of the matter is
that two people can't have a
relationship if one person doesn't want
to and if that one person leaves then
the ball is in that person's court and
while this may be difficult just
remember that their absence can create a
space for someone who is authentically
enthusiastic about having a relationship
with you to come into your
life what do you think does this fit
with your own experience
