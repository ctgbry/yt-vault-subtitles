i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
why bad habits persist
let's get right to it
bad habits persist
because vices are a form of amnesia
amnesia is a memory disorder it's when
somebody has issues recognizing or
recollecting things that he's previously
learned and at their core all vices are
amnestic disorders
what do i mean by that
well vices generally create short-term
benefit at long-term expense for
instance advice could be
overeating in the short term overeating
creates some short-term benefits like
satiaty blood sugar rushes emotional
avoidance
at long-term expense like obesity health
complications and shame spirals
vices create pain in the long run almost
by definition and they generally create

[01:00]
by definition and they generally create
pain consistently and predictably and
the people who suffer from these vices
will typically admit as much themselves
but what happens within the subjective
experience of a person who possesses a
disposition to a certain vice when he is
confronted with the possibility of
enacting that behavior when he
experiences a craving to act in a
certain way
in that moment he doesn't remember
all the pain that has consistently
resulted from that action in the past
instead he thinks
that this time
it will be different
this time i'll be able to stop eating
when i when i feel full which has not
been the case at all in the past or this
time i'm celebrating a special occasion
and so i don't really know how i'm going
to respond in this situation which is
willful denial
vices persist through this kind of
everyday amnesia
now the alternative to amnesia is

[02:00]
now the alternative to amnesia is
remembering
interestingly remembering is one of the
definitions of the original pali word
from which we derive the term
mindfulness so the antithesis of amnesia
is
mindfulness
as sigmund freud said we can either
remember
or we can repeat
in this case it's the work of the person
with a disposition toward a certain vice
to remember the harvest he has
consistently reaped from this behavior
in the past when he suffers a craving at
a decisional choice point
or it's his fate to repeat that behavior
over and over again until he does
when confronted with the impulse to
repeat a vice
it's helpful to play the tape forward
don't just stop at the short-term
benefit the pleasure or satisfaction
that attends relenting to the craving
keep playing the tape of memory forward
to review the shame of relapse and the

[03:01]
to review the shame of relapse and the
pain of long-term consequences in the
case of overeating this could mean
remembering the cycle of
self-recrimination and compensation
or the amount of exercise or dieting
that will be needed to work off the meal
this actually produces a fuller picture
of that behavior remembering past the
point of pleasure to consider how that
pleasure consistently and predictably
transforms into pain
is one of the best ways of combating the
amnesia that keeps folks enslaved to bad
habits
