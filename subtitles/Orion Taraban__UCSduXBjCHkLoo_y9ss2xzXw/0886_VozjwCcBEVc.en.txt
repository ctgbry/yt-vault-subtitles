I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is her
narcissistic X so it seems like in
today's day and age every woman has a
narcissistic ex-boyfriend or a
ex-husband and that's amazing because
the most recent epidemiological data I
could find suggests that between 1 to 2%
of Americans have NPD or narcissistic
person it disorder and that number
includes female narcissists so it's
pretty hard to imagine that 2% of the
men have dated like 100% of the women so
what's going on here certainly part of
the issue is that the popular
imagination has significantly expanded
the definition of narcissism in recent
years it's more commonly used for its
let's say moral connotations than for
its descriptive purposes narcissist

[01:00]
its descriptive purposes narcissist
has functionally become shorthand for an
exploitative person who doesn't care
about the feelings of others that said
any woman who feels that she gave more
than she received in return could
potentially reframe that experience as
exploitative and in any relationship one
person always has to give more and one
person always has to take more like it's
impossible for the giving and the taking
taking to be perfectly and perpetually
balanced and in my conceptualization
it's the adorer who gives more and feels
more and the adored who takes more and
feels less this means that given its
widespread usage and connotation a woman
is much more likely to retroactively
believe any man who occupied the role of
the adored in a previous relationship to
be narcissist

[02:00]
be narcissist
but it would be wrong to Simply take her
description at face value and concur
that the ex in question had a
personality disorder especially because
he was only the adored by virtue of her
adoration in any case it's a pretty bad
sign when a woman complains about having
a narcissistic EX for a number of
reasons first and foremost if her name
calling is designed to give the
impression that her previous
relationship f failed simply due to the
malevolence of her ex that on some level
that woman is abating any responsibility
for the dissolution of that relationship
which is very peculiar it is very very
rare for any relationship problem to be
entirely and exclusively one partner's
fault like who chose to enter into and
remain in that
relationship most likely this narrative
is a Taste of things to come framing her

[03:02]
is a Taste of things to come framing her
past relationships in this light likely
means that she is either an external
that is someone who believes that all
her internal states are dictated by
external stimuli or a victim that is
someone who believes that she is the
innocent prey of oppressive or predatory
forces now do predatory men exist
absolutely and they are scary but they
are not nearly as common as you might
expect from list to some of these
stories in any case both possibilities
are characterized by difficulties in
assuming
responsibility Tendencies toward
categorical or black or white thinking
and poor insight and discernment not a
great
sign but here's another reason why this
kind of talk is concerning in a woman to
appreciate its significance we need to
understand the relationship between
narcissistic personalities and
borderline personalities

[04:00]
borderline personalities
According to some of the epidemiological
research I've read which has been born
out by my clinical experience
narcissistic men are significantly more
likely to have had a borderline mother
compared with non-narcissistic men and
by the same token borderline women are
significantly more likely to have had a
narcissistic father compared with non-
borderline women what does this mean it
means that to some extent the two
disorders tend to create each other
which is what has led some researchers
to postulate that the two disorders are
really just gendered expressions of the
same underlying
dysfunction in any case let's explore
why this might be the
case what would it be like to grow up
with a borderline mother borderlines are
often emotionally volatile with an
unstable sense of self they can be very
manipulative and they can transgress all
kinds of boundaries when they are
emotionally disequil

[05:00]
emotionally disequil
living with them can be chaotic
overwhelming and crazym so in order to
survive in this environment what some
children do kind of as a last ditch
attempt at
self-preservation is cut off conscious
access to their emotions so they can't
be used against them in Parental
manipulation and turn off their empathy
so they don't get sucked into the drama
that tends to circulate around these
individuals
softer hearted child might end up
consumed by the mother's emotionality
and neediness by taking certain parts of
themselves offline these children are
able to survive in a very difficult
emotional environment from which they
can't escape and to potentially launch
independent lives further down the
line by the same token let's examine
what it might be like to grow up with a
narcissistic father narcissists are
often devoid of empathy and emotional
warmth

[06:00]
warmth
among other things this would make it
very difficult to feel cared for or
loved or valued as a child the child's
feelings would often be ignored and
their talents either quashed or directed
toward the glorification of the parent
living with them can be infuriating
neglectful and invalidating so in order
to survive in this environment what some
children do kind of as a last ditch
effort at
self-preservation is significantly
simplify their emotions so they can no
longer be ignored and act out in a
number of ways so they won't be
minimized into irrelevance a better
behaved child might end up erased by the
father's grandiose neglect by making
certain parts of themselves so loud and
unavoidable these children are able to
survive in a very difficult emotional
environment from which they can't escape
and to potentially launch independent
lives further down the line

[07:01]
lives further down the line

hope to see you you
aboard basically both personality
disorders are kind of like a suite of
emotional survival strategies for
specific family
ecosystems and this is why from a
clinical perspective it's not a great
look when women complain about their
narcissistic exes when they do that
they're basically confessing that there
is an increased likelihood that they
themselves are borderlines

[08:00]
themselves are borderlines
okay this takes a little bit to Noodle
this out but let's explore this from a
couple of different
angles healthy securely attached women
do not end up in relationships with
narcissistic men this is because when
such a woman dates a narcissist she
tends to feel that something is off
maybe she struggles to make an emotional
connection with the man or she's put off
by his grandiosity or arrogance or she
understands that suddenly getting
everything she's ever dreamed of is an
act that can't possibly be true these
women might stick around for a while
especially if the man is charming and
successful but they eventually
understand that something doesn't feel
right and they bounce they don't end up
in 5-year relationships with a
narcissist they don't end up married to
the narcissist for 20 years at least not
without assuming some accountability for
the fact that they almost certainly were
not healthy or securely attached when
choosing to enter into to and remain in

[09:00]
choosing to enter into to and remain in
said relationship so a woman a woman
with narcissistic exes is much more
likely to be unhealthy or have
attachment issues like
borderlines and of course if a woman is
a borderline it would also make it much
more likely that her exes were
narcissists this is because healthy
securely attached men do not end up in
relationships with borderline women
maybe he finds himself on the other end
of one of her emotional outbursts or he
is once again harshly judged and
intentionally misunderstood or he spends
another weekend trying to piece her
together after a breakdown these men
might stick around for a while
especially if the woman is attractive
and him well but they eventually
understand that something doesn't feel
right and they bounce not my monkey not
my circus they don't end up in 5-year
relationships with the borderline they
don't end up married to the the
borderline for 20 years at least not

[10:02]
borderline for 20 years at least not
without assuming some accountability for
the fact that they almost certainly were
not healthy or securely attached when
choosing to enter into and remain in
said
relationship so a borderline woman is
much more likely to have unhealthy exes
with attachment issues like
narcissists healthy secure men do not
stay with borderline women and healthy
secure women do not stay with narcissist
istic men what's more because of the
respective family ecosystems in which
these disorders developed we can
understand borderline personality to be
a way of dealing with narcissism and
narcissistic personality to be a way of
dealing with borderline put two and two
together and you can infer that it's
more likely that a narcissistic man will
get involved with a borderline woman
compared to a non- borderline woman and
it's more likely that a borderline woman
will get involved with a narcissistic
man compared to non-narcissistic

[11:01]
man compared to non-narcissistic
men again this is because a
non-narcissistic man will run out of a
relationship with a borderline because
it would just be too chaotic and intense
however a narcissistic man who is
emotionally cut off and lacks empathy
would be able to stay in the
relationship far longer because he just
wouldn't feel the emotional Dynamic by
the same token a non borderline woman
would run out of a relationship with a
narcissist because it would just be too
invalidating and
neglectful however a borderline woman
who is emotionally supercharged and
behaviorally disregulated would be able
to stay in the relationship far longer
because she would effortfully resist the
emotional Dynamic it's like who's going
to win the immovable object The
Narcissist or the irresistible Force the
borderline and the more immovable the

[12:00]
borderline and the more immovable the
object the more irresistible the force
and vice versa this is important to
remember because these personality types
exist on a Continuum women with a few
borderline traits are more likely to
stay in relationships with men with a
few narcissistic traits and vice versa
and women with a lot of borderline
traits are more likely to stay in
relationships with men with a lot of
narcissistic traits and vice versa now
one final word it is hard to overstate
how difficult and unstable relationships
with folks with a personality disorder
can be they make soap operas look
tame and it's impossible to tell who has
a personality disorder just by looking
at them so normal secure people might
date these types once and for a short
period of time but they certainly don't
do it repeatedly over long periods of
time so it's an even bigger red flag if
the woman complains about multiple

[13:00]
the woman complains about multiple
narcissistic exes or she admits that she
stayed with a narcissistic EX for a
significant amount of time as this is a
indirect way of revealing some of her
own psychological patterns that might
make it very difficult to relate to her
