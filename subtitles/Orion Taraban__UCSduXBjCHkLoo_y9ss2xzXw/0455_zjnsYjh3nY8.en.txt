[00:00]
now you mentioned something else though
which is besides the expectation
um you didn't use this word but what I
think you were getting at is like
wounding
so
what was the word wounding like they
have emotion people have emotional
wounds like maybe they had a [ __ ]
relationship with their mother and so
now they have [ __ ] relationships with
their girlfriends like that's not an
accident
so what I've discovered and I have a
video on this that's forthcoming is in
my own experience when I was in my 20s I
had this like Sixth Sense
I could walk into a room full of woman
women and just like be able to pick out
the one that I could ride the roller
coaster with because like my emotional
wound would resonate in the presence of
a complementary emotional wound and we
would get together and we'd find
ourselves and be very passionate and
intense because we were recreating the
circumstances that led to the wounding
in a misguided attempt to heal the world
yep and we were attracted to that not

[01:00]
yep and we were attracted to that not
because it was good but because it was
familiar yep and this is tough because
this goes back to Childhood stuff and
children will accept any reality of
which they're given they don't even
really like if a child is born and
raised in chaos he will think that chaos
is normal he won't even think that it's
chaos he will just think that it's
normal
and so when he leaves the family where
chaos makes sense he goes and tries to
I'm a good boy I'm doing what you're
supposed to do in relationships which is
to be chaotic and unpredictable and
this is all I've ever seen this is all
I've ever known I thought this is what
you you do
um the fish can't see the water and so
it's particularly difficult for people
who are raised in high conflict or
broken or dysfunctional families but it
is possible to overcome that wounding to
heal that wounding and overcome that
programming and at 30 I mean hopefully
you have at least another 50 good years
of life left so even if it takes a few

[02:00]
of life left so even if it takes a few
years to do it's like that's worth doing
how is he going to spend your time if
not working on this stuff yeah I guess
you'd have to take up knitting or
something how are you doing now are you
still attracted to women based on your
wounds no because what I found is that
as I worked to heal that emotional
wounding okay so this is the other part
of it which is so I I'd have that sixth
sense to the women that I could recreate
those dramas with and then they would
get too crazy and I'd think I just can't
handle this anymore I just want a nice
stable woman and just like in the
Romantic myth I'd find that nice stable
woman and I would be bored to tears and
I would think there's this isn't I don't
feel anything and so I felt for a long
time like I had this terrible choice
between what I
but I was really attracted to but was
terrible for me this is something that I
didn't really feel anything for but I
knew was like healthy and mature
neither one of those look on your face

[03:01]
neither one of those look on your face
like oh like a good woman who treats me
well what a what a drag well yeah you
eat junk food all your life you think
that uh you know vegetables are
disgusting but you know you see how it
is so
I had to like try to squeeze up some
attraction for some of these stable
women and that didn't work or I tried to
make the unstable women more
so basically I I had to change me
because I couldn't change the women and
as I process the stuff and healed it
surprise surprise
my authentic attraction began to change
like I didn't have to try to be
attracted to different women my
authentic desire began to shift and I
started to become attracted to
emotionally stable secure women as I
became more emotionally stable and
secure and holy [ __ ] does that solve a
lot of problems
getting in you just never encounter them

[04:02]
getting in you just never encounter them
when you get into relationships with
emotionally stable secure women oh man
it's great oh so beautiful uh it's it's
just that's the story of so many men you
would you just put this so well and it's
a good reminder to me that like
like I'll admit I'm human sometimes I
get frustrated at guys who are in that
stage that you're out of like she's
great but I'm bored I'm like what like
like
you know sort of do that but I love the
fact that you actually articulated that
the desire naturally shifted once you
made that shift that's what that's what
guys should be aspiring to and it's one
of the reasons why I say
like I'm not a big fan of these guys who
are just like living the player
lifestyle like that's not my version of
masculinity is just [ __ ] a bunch of
women because I've seen too clearly the
psychological underpinnings of a man who
needs that kind of level of distraction
and Novelty I'm not a big fan of

[05:01]
and Novelty I'm not a big fan of
polyamory I'm not because to me
you can see how
based on what you just said monogamy
with a good woman is almost a test of
character only somebody who's genuinely
comfortable and at peace inside
themselves and who's done that work is
going to be able to unlock those innate
feelings of yes I actually like this I
actually enjoy this and this is a fine
line for me to walk because I'm very
sensitive to accusations that I would
shame male sexuality and I'm not doing
that I get it male brain new women
different body parts
hugely stimulating I get the
evolutionary psychology of it I'm never
going to deny that even me 13 years into
a relationship a pretty girl comes up on
the TV screen I notice I get that but
what I'm saying is that that doesn't
necessarily Trump out the stuff that Dr
Ryan was talking about that natural
affection that natural love that Springs
up when you're coming from a more
emotionally healthy Place suddenly that
drama queen party girl that used to

[06:00]
drama queen party girl that used to
excite you so much she just looks like a
hot mess you just like [ __ ] no I don't
want to touch that I don't want to get
that in my space my nice clean
psychologically pure space I don't want
it contaminated with that kind of toxic
low quality woman anymore she's no
longer interesting oh look this girl
treats me nicely she smiles she pays me
compliments she asked me how my day was
suddenly I'm like able to appreciate
that in a whole new way and I hope that
everybody aspires for that
yeah I think I watched to John
Mulvaney uh stand up routine he's a
comedian and I think he opened with I
didn't know that relationships were
supposed to feel good and everybody
laughed and he was like that's not a
joke that's just an observation uh and
this is the first time I was in a
relationship and it improved my quality
of life and that's enough that's a
life-changing experience for a lot of
guys for sure it kind of sorry to jump
in but it I I really want to make this
point it kind of
speaks to the Primacy of our

[07:02]
speaks to the Primacy of our
psychological need to heal those initial
wounds in that if you've got a girl in
front of you and you could have a
romantic connection with her but
subconsciously you're sabotaging it
you're picking fights you're provoking
behaviors what your brain is trying to
do is resolve those emotional wounds
that Dr Orion was talking about from
earlier on and that just says everything
that how a big an impact this trauma
stuff has on us in that when choosing
between should we just enjoy the present
moment and have nice feelings of love or
should we make this a hell but it's a
hell that's potentially going to heal
this deeper hell that's inside me the
brain moves towards this and so men
don't underestimate it men are way too
cocky about their mental health you've
probably seen this like I'll just go to
the gym I'll just make a whole bunch of
money I'll just [ __ ] enough women and
then that'll solve it it won't it won't
you've got to take this stuff seriously
because if you don't when the time comes

[08:00]
because if you don't when the time comes
and you're in front of a good woman if
you haven't sorted your [ __ ] out you'll
[ __ ] up the relationship you'll sabotage
it because your brain so desperately
needs to heal this stuff and I've Just
Seen sorry for getting a bit worked up
but I've seen so many requests in my hey
hero in my patreon DMs from guys who
have [ __ ] up good relationships
because they underestimated how messed
up they were inside that they didn't
take it seriously and so I really really
want men to hear that message that if
you want to have a good relationship in
the future you can't half-ass this
you've got to sort yourself out
relationships with good women are a
luxury of the men who've done the work
on themselves it's not available to
anybody else the best that you're going
to be able to have is a dysfunctional
relationship and as far as I can see
that's an absolute truth I've not seen
it work otherwise
yeah there's a lot there so the way I
usually say it is that you can't solve
internal problems with external
Solutions so if you have an inner wound
or an internal void which is often how
it's experienced you're going to try to
fill it with money with drugs with TV
and video games with food with sex and

[09:02]
and video games with food with sex and
it doesn't work
um that whole inside you is insatiable
and it cannot be filled with something
that's external to itself but it can be
filled with something it can be healed
internally
and um what you described about how
messed up guys go to relationships
and mess those up in similar ways in
Clinical Psychology we have a term for
that we call that
um a an activist or a reenactment and
this happens in the therapy office too
and there's this kind of a tragedy to
this because
the the unconscious rationalization for
this behavior is okay I was really
messed up by this experience in the past
and I can't go back and change the past
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
recreate the same emotional experience
in the present so that I can work
through it and have a different outcome
the tragedy is that most people haven't
learned the skills of being or relating
to achieve a different outcome so what

[10:02]
to achieve a different outcome so what
they they have a lot of skills in
recreating the same situation they don't
have the skills to do anything
and so they they're trying on this this
was an idea from Freud actually they're
trying unconsciously to solve these
emotional problems by recreating the
same emotional experiences but they lack
the skills and the Transcendence to
actually achieve a different outcome and
so that's why they end up hitting their
head against the wall over and over
again
