i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the truth about unconditional love
now it's possible to argue for the
existence of unconditional love from a
spiritual perspective
this perspective basically maintains
that the love we feel and express for
others
is really an attribute of the divine
being channeled through us and that as
an expression of the divine this love is
pure and unconditional and this is a
reasonable argument if you adopt that
lens
that said
even assuming that such a perspective is
true even assuming that love is
unconditional
the fact of the matter is
that
relationships are not relationships are
conditional
and it's a good thing that relationships
are conditional
because how much worse
do people behave
if they believe that there is no

[01:01]
if they believe that there is no
accountability for their actions
from a historical perspective the
greatest abuses have always originated
from institutions that were protected
from experiencing the negative
consequences of their actions like
absolute monarchies and papal states and
corporate monopolies
people
are people
and this degree of immunity
tends to corrupt their nature
all of the things being equal
i mean would you counsel a woman to stay
with a husband who beat her senseless
every day
or a man to stay with a woman who
constantly berated him in private
that's a tough sell guys
and i'm aware that i just released an
episode about commitment
which discussed how we've undermined the
nature of commitment in modern society
that said there has to be grounds to
separate there has to be grounds for
divorce
because if such grounds didn't exist

[02:01]
because if such grounds didn't exist
relationships would go to some pretty
dark places
in such cases it may be necessary to
love
from a distance
that said marsha linehan the creator of
dialectical behavior therapy said that
love
can be
unjustified
that is she held that people can
maintain positive feelings for certain
individuals that are not appropriate to
the circumstances
if someone is abusive
if someone has abandoned us if someone
has betrayed us
then according to linehan
the love that we feel for this person
may be unjustified
and she counsels bringing that emotion
into greater alignment with reality
it's important to understand this
principle because people are otherwise
subject to getting trapped in really
nasty relationships by their own beliefs
their beliefs about the unconditionality
of love

[03:00]
of love
so i think that we
in modern society have tend to break
commitments
more readily than we should
but we do need to have a mechanism by
which
reasonably abusive and disrespectful
relationships can be dissolved
