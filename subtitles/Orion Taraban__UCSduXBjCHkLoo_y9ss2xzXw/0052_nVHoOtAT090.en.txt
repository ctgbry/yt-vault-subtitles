i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychx
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is people
are disappointing people are
disappointing this is one of the
inescapable
phenomenological experiences of being a
human being
we have a other people present us both
an opportunity and a problem the fact of
the matter is that we need other people
we need other people to grow our food to
build our houses to educate
our communities to heal the sick to put
out the wildfires
to create products for our consumption
we need other people and yet other
people
create the opportunity for strife for
alienation for disagreement conflict
indifference and cruelty
other people no matter how if you look
at them closely enough will inevitably
over time
reveal parts of themselves that are dark
flawed

[01:00]
flawed
and otherwise undesirable this is and
just like you you're because it's also
important to remember that you are
mostly
not yourself
if you take a like an eagle-eyed view of
the situation you are the subject
only to yourself you are the object
to everybody else
which means from the perspective of that
objective reality you are and
mostly like 99.999 percent
an object and only point zero zero zero
zero one percent a subject you are
mostly an object just like i am
so we what we're talking ab what i'm
talking about with respect to other
people is certainly true for us
ourselves because we are other people to
everybody else
so um
if we look at anybody close enough
uh we will see their darkness their
flaws their undesirable qualities
sometimes we encounter active malice
and cruelty
but in the vast majority of cases we

[02:01]
but in the vast majority of cases we
simply encounter a difference of
preferences priorities values and
opinions
and
[Music]
not everyone is going to be able to
agree with us even the people that we
love and most want aligned with our
perspective
um they're
going to have and they are certainly
entitled to have different opinions and
values and priorities
um
so even we we could consider two
all virtuous people
will
also inevitably on some level come into
conflict with each other if
their various virtues aren't prioritized
to the exact same um degree
with each other
um and this is a real tragedy that's the
inevitable conflict in the
um
the disparity between the prioritization
of competing goods
so other people are disappointing
and i'm bringing this up not because i
want to be a you know a

[03:00]
want to be a you know a
curmudgeon or a misanthrope but to help
people understand that it might be
helpful not to really expect more of
other people than they're able to
deliver
and if you potentially begin to
like say calculate this into the the
calculus
of dealing with other people you're
you're much less likely to encounter uh
frustration
uh
if you do so it's sort of like
assuming if you're selling goods that a
certain percentage of them are going to
be stolen that's just kind of inevitable
um and then you don't have to
necessarily be up in arms when
if and when that does occur
so that's what i have for you thanks for
listening we'll talk more in future
episodes
you
