I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why I do
what I do
to answer this question I'd like to
share a brief anecdote from my life my
hope is that it will reveal a guiding
principle for much of what I do both
personally and professionally
so one Saturday night about 15 years ago
I was wandering around the East Village
in New York City checking in on my
haunts and generally looking for trouble
and as I was walking around I found
myself on the corner of Broadway and
14th Street just off Union Square and it
was there that I encountered the
following scene
apparently the street light had been
taken out of commission and the traffic
was at a standstill clear across
Manhattan like from the East River all
the way to the Hudson And as far up and
down Broadway as the eye could see I
mean this is a major intersection there
were thousands of cars flashing their
lights and honking their horns it was

[01:00]
lights and honking their horns it was
Madness and it was chaos and nobody was
doing anything about it there weren't
any cops around and the pedestrians just
shook their heads in disbelief before
carrying on their way it was nuts and I
remember looking at the situation and
thinking to myself man this is crazy
someone needs to do something about this
and once it became clear after a few
minutes that no one was going to do
anything about this I thought to myself
okay well I guess I'll do it
now it probably helped that I had a
couple of drinks in me at that point but
I walked right into the intersection of
Broadway and 14th and started directing
traffic this was not because I knew what
I was doing I had never directed traffic
in my life I just saw that there was a
very obvious problem that was affecting
people and no one else seemed willing or
able to do anything about it and in the
absence of an alternative I was elected
so I stood there in the intersection and
I started to direct traffic as best I

[02:00]
I started to direct traffic as best I
could I would hold up my hand and send
cars up and down 14th for a while and
then I would jump into the flow and give
the Broadway cars a chance some drivers
were hesitant to follow my suggestions
and I definitely got some strange looks
from others but mostly I got cheers and
high fives and thank yous it was obvious
to most people that I was trying to help
solve a problem that no one else was
doing and I did that for about an hour
and a half it took about an hour and a
half for the cops to show up and when
they did they basically told me to [ __ ]
off uh before taking over the situation
and so I did and went on with the rest
of my night
so that anecdote kind of describes how I
approach life if there's an obvious
problem and no one else seems willing or
able to do anything about it it's like
I've been elected to do my best to
address that problem until such time
comes when somebody who has more
competence experience or ability can
take the job from me that's why I do

[03:00]
take the job from me that's why I do
what I do I'm not always the smartest or
the wisest or the most capable sometimes
I'm just the guy willing to do it
on this channel I started talking about
intersexual Dynamics about a year ago
and many of those talks have been some
of the more popular episodes on this
channel
that's because I see what's going on
between men and women today to be like
the intersection of 14th and Broadway
all those years ago it's chaos and
Madness and people are either fuming in
their cars or shaking their heads as
they walk past I look around and no
commentators that I've heard are
offering solutions that I think are
acceptable and once it became clear
after a while that no one was going to
do anything about it I thought to myself
okay well I guess I'll do it I've been
elected
does this mean that I'm the very best
person for this job probably not
could other people do the job better
than I do very possibly but here's the
thing whoever those people are as far as
I can see they aren't doing it yet once

[04:01]
I can see they aren't doing it yet once
they show up they are more than welcome
to take over and I am more than happy to
go on my Merry way but until that day
y'all are kind of stuck with me
now before I go any further if you're

channel grow you may also consider
hitting the thanks button it's right
beneath the video that you're watching
right now and tip me in proportion to
the value you feel you've received from
this message because it's your support
that makes all this happen I couldn't do
it without you
um you'll notice I don't do a bunch of
in video product placements or
endorsements like other channels this
doesn't generate a lot of Revenue so I
really do depend on your donations for
support thank you very much
now the goal of this channel is to
reduce unnecessary human suffering and
in so doing make the world a better
place it's very easy to walk past the
intersection it's very easy to become
enraged at the situation or [ __ ] about

[05:01]
enraged at the situation or [ __ ] about
the infrastructure or complain it took
so long of the cops to show up or find
fault in my bumbling solution
it is much harder to direct traffic
but it's like my dudes the peanut
gallery is full there is standing room
only we don't need more people to point
out the problem we're all [ __ ] aware
of what the problem is it's loud and
obvious and in our faces what we need
are people who are willing to be part of
the solution
and that's especially true for guys men
it's not a good look spending your lives
in the peanut gallery you should be down
here in the streets with me in the
intersection directing traffic that's
where you belong and I guarantee if you
were to do that it would be of more use
to you than to me
there is no lack of problems that need
solving on this planet just look the
[ __ ] around but here's the thing every

[06:02]
[ __ ] around but here's the thing every
problem is also an opportunity for you
to step up to get involved to grow your
capacity to declare I exist
in that story the people who just walked
by didn't really exist they were NPCs in
that anecdote to be a player character
you have to find a problem and work
towards its solution do you understand
and you don't need to do this on the
world stage like if you don't yet have
sufficient experience solving smaller
problems you should not be shooting for
that kind of goal that's arrogant and
absurd but just look around there's look
at your house your relationships your
family your community your school your
town there is plenty of people who need
help there are plenty of problems that
need solving and if no one else is doing
it guess what you've just been [ __ ]
elected congrats here's your sash all
the best to you
it's like become part of the solutions

[07:00]
it's like become part of the solutions
my dudes and my ladies it's so easy to
find faults it's so easy to criticize
but the world doesn't need any more
critics my friends the world needs
people who are in the intersection
the day may come when someone more
confident shows up and says all right I
got this but until that happens keep
directing traffic it's in the street
that you discover who you are and it's
there that you find your place among men
