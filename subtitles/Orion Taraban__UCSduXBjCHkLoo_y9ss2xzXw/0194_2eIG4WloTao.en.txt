i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the truth about rejection
we're all going to experience rejection
over the course of our lives in fact
because the universe lives closed which
is to say that the default answer to any
question in life is no
we are going to experience vastly more
rejection than acceptance in any domain
of our life personal or professional
so the sooner that we can understand the
truth about rejection the faster we can
disabuse ourselves of some of the
illusions that people maintain about
this experience that really obstruct
their overall growth
so there are three illusions about
rejection that i want to dispel in
today's episode i call them the three
p's this is the belief that rejection is
painful
personal and
permanent
painful personal and permanent the three
ps let's work through each one
individually
the first illusion about rejection is

[01:00]
the first illusion about rejection is
that it's painful rejection does not
have to be painful what i'd like you to
consider is that rejection is just
information
yes is information no is information and
as i mentioned in the fundamental game
of human relationships in the game of
please know the way someone says no
contains a clue contains information
with respect to how to potentially get
them to say yes
the more that you can see no the
rejection as just a piece of binary data
a zero versus a one
and the more that you can potentially
evaluate the quality of that data to
your own advantage the more you can take
the emotional sting out of rejection
okay the second is that it's personal in
the vast majority of cases it's just not
maybe you try to pick up someone at a
bar and they turn you down or you send
out a resume to a potential employer
they never get back to you
is this really a personal rejection i
mean in the first case the person who's

[02:01]
mean in the first case the person who's
turning you down has spent all of 60
seconds in your presence it's not so
much they don't know who you are they
can't know who you are they have not had
anything close to sufficient time to do
any kind of due diligence with respect
to your suitability
so they're really ejecting rejecting
some idea of who you are
now to be fair there could be some
aspects to your appearance or your words
or your tone
that is contributing to that idea but
ultimately they aren't rejecting you
because they don't know who you are
same thing with the employer they're
rejecting a resume a piece of paper and
again maybe there are some things about
the presentation of that document that
you can improve but there's nothing
personal about rejecting a piece of
paper in the vast majority of cases the
people doing the rejecting don't know
you well enough to actually reject you
so it can't possibly be personal
all right and the third p is that it's

[03:01]
all right and the third p is that it's
permanent and this is kind of due to the
first p the painful emotional experience
can trigger a catastrophic thought
cascade and before you know it
you're thinking that you're never going
to get a job you're going to die alone
or that you're going to be a loser your
entire life and that's just not true
that's the emotional mind talking now
it's almost certainly true that you will
need to experience a great deal of
rejection before you find a quality
relationship or before you find a how a
high value job
however every rejection on some level
just brings you closer to that eventual
acceptance it's like that edison quote i
didn't fail
i just found 10 000 ways that won't work
so rejection is not painful
it's not personal and it's not permanent
and if you can dispel these three
illusions and approach rejection as a
piece of information capable of guiding
you toward your eventual acceptance you

[04:00]
you toward your eventual acceptance you
will have a much easier time in life
