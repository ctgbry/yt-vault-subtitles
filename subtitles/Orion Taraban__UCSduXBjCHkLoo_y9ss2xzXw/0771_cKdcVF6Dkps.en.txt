Clash witz began his famous Treatise on
War by functionally admitting that he
can't teach anyone how to win a battle
and this was coming from one of the most
celebrated and successful generals of
his generation and he said this because
he understood that as soon as he laid
out the strategy for victory some clever
opponent would find an effective
countermeasure to that strategy and just
like that it's no longer a strategy for
victory and people will think he's a
huster and a fraud this is why Masters
at the High level of any discipline so
often speak vaguely or at most on the
level of general principles greater
specificity suggests a concrete Pathway
to success and chances are good that the
Moving Castle has since relocated this
is why Lau begins his work by saying
that the da that can be named is not the
real da this kind of talk can be
frustrating for those looking for easy
answers or Concrete Solutions but it's
unavoidable
