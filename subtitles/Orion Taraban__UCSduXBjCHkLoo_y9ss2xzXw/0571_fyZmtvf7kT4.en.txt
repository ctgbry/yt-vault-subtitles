I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is virtue
only makes you good so today I'll be
talking about virtue what it can do and
just as important what it can't first
let me offer a definition my definition
of virtue is that it is a positive
spiritual attribute it is spiritual
because if you use it you have more of
it as opposed to material which if you
use you have less of and it's positive
because it's associated with what
sustains life as opposed to negative
which is associated with what destroys
it so that's my personal definition of
virtue a positive spiritual attribute
now a lot of people start out on the
path of virtue when they're young but
most end up diverted from that path by
the time they hit middle age they may
even grow suspicious or simp cynical of

[01:00]
even grow suspicious or simp cynical of
virtue over time potentially considering
it to be a naive Pursuit for those who
don't yet understand the way the world
really works why is this transformation
so common I think that there are a
number of factors in play in the first
place almost everyone has to learn the
hard way that things are not always what
they seem to be and that evil or sin
typically does not have a grotesque Vis
and a threatening glare rather these
things are usually obscured beneath a
cloak of light that allows them some
measure of protection to continue to
exist in the world people who never
fully recover from this deception often
come to doubt the utility if not the
very existence of goodness or
virtue however there's another possible
explanation that I want to focus on
today namely that this tendency toward
cynicism is due to a misunderstanding

[02:01]
cynicism is due to a misunderstanding
about the nature of virtue and about
what virtue can provide and I think that
if this misunderstanding were dispelled
more people might persist on the path of
virtue longer which is actually a very
good thing this is because it's one of
the few goals in life that is inherently
fulfilling and that because progress
here is associated with some very
significant positives which will explain
later in this episode so I do believe
that it is important to cultivate virtue
but here's the thing it turns out that
virtue can only make you good and you
might think well what's the problem with
that Orion well the problem is that most
people don't want to be good most people
want to be liked or to be rich or to be
successful or to be beautiful or to be

[03:00]
successful or to be beautiful or to be
funny or to be famous or to be strong
Etc and they inappropriately expect that
being good will get them these other
things just like in the fairy tale the
good guy wins so they think that being
good will help them achieve romantic
success or become rich and prosperous or
even earn them protection from adversity
through some sort of divine intervention
and For Better or For Worse none of
these things are true like good people
often don't get the girl and good
people's businesses fail and good people
get cancer like being virtuous doesn't
get you anything outside of itself which
is one of the underappreciated meanings
in the adage virtue is its own reward
it's like yeah because you don't get
anything else from it you dum dum and
eventually what happens is that people

[04:00]
eventually what happens is that people
reach some degree of awareness with
respect to the limits of virtue they
realize that doesn't pay their bills or
get them laid or keep them safe or make
them popular and they think well what
the [ __ ] good is that and the upshot is
that people frustrated by virtue's
inability to help them get what they
actually want end up giving up on virtue
in favor of other worldly Pursuits and
that's because again virtue doesn't make
you rich or earn you friends or get you
laid in fact many virtuous people tend
to be lonely and unsuccessful why
because a lot of people dislike good
people the very existence of good people
makes them feel bad about themselves
which is often why good people are
shunned and persecuted and this of
course can cause good people over time
to succumb to bitterness and resentment
over others unfair treatment of them now

[05:02]
over others unfair treatment of them now

episode I rely on your support to keep
all of this running and I really
appreciate it thank you very
much now turning to worldly Pursuits is
isn't necessarily a problem like don't
take your grocery list to the hardware
store if you want to get laid don't
learn virtue learn game if you want to
make money don't lose virtue learn a
valuable skill Etc the problem here is
not with virtue itself but in expecting
more from virtue than it can possibly
deliver that said even though virtue
can't provide the things that most
people most want it is still very useful
to cultivate virtue for two important

[06:01]
to cultivate virtue for two important
reasons in the first place virtue is
important to cultivate because even
though it can't reliably get you worldly
Goods it can help you to keep them
generals understand that there is little
point in capturing a castle they cannot
keep like why go through the risk and
expense of securing a positive if you
cannot retain it long enough to provide
you benefit the same is true of the good
things in life if you're fortunate
enough to find yourself rich in worldly
Goods loving relationships successful
businesses positive reputation then you
will need virtue to keep these worldly
Goods in your life if you don't have
some virtue already you're going to [ __ ]
it up because you won't be able to
handle your good fortune with prudence
and dignity for many people people the

[07:00]
and dignity for many people people the
absolute worst thing that could possibly
happen to them is to suddenly become
rich and famous suddenly becoming rich
and famous without virtue to temper the
experience is more dangerous than heroin
and people die from this experience all
the time their Good Fortune kills them
so unless you want to go through life
avoiding worldly goods and where's the
sense in that you need to find ways to
sustainably enjoy them and cultivating
some degree of virtue enables you to
retain the good things in life that you
have succeeded in achieving through
other
means and in the second place virtue is
important to cultivate because even
though it can't guarantee a positive
outcome it can help you overcome the
inevitable negative outcomes that you
will experience in life for example when
we have some measure of say patience we
don't have have to work so hard to avoid

[08:01]
don't have have to work so hard to avoid
being inconvenienced because we have the
means of neutralizing the negative
consequences of that inconvenience
namely patience or when we have some
measure of say compassion we don't have
to work so hard to avoid being judged
because we have the means of
neutralizing the negative consequences
of that judgment namely compassion the
great thing about cultivating virtue is
that those who have it no longer longer
need to hope and pray for an easy life
because they've since developed the
means of dealing with whatever life is
subject to throwing at them and this
might not make them rich or popular or
attractive but it might make them
indestructible from fortunes good and
bad what do you think does this fit with
