a woman can want whatever she wants and
if she's not getting what she wants then
barring some other commitment to the
contrary she has every right to leave
that relationship and move on but a
woman who acts that way men doesn't love
you more than she loves what she wants
loves highest good is simply to continue
to exist in the presence of the loved
one that's it a woman who threatens to
leave you if you don't marry her is
functionally telling you that she wants
things more than she wants to continue
to be with you she doesn't love you in
this moment she is looking to do
business so don't confuse the two the
upshot is from the perspective of both
men and women the more someone is pushy
the less you should give them what they
want like women don't have sex with guys
who are pushy about having sex with you
they're pushy to the extent that they
don't want anything else from you
because if they did want something else
and they were getting it they wouldn't
be so aggressive by the same token men
don't marry women who are pushy about
getting married
