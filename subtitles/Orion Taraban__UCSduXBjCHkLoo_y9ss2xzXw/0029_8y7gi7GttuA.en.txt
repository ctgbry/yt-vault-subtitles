i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is this is it
so this is something that often comes up
when i'm speaking to folks in their 20s
generally older populations don't
experience this issue to the same degree
basically it's the feeling that i'm
missing out
i'm wasting my time that i'm not doing
enough
or that i'm here and life is somehow
somewhere else
and though this can be a bit of a let
down
i generally ask these folks to consider
the possibility
that there might not be anything else
out there that they're missing out on
maybe this is it maybe this
is life and they have just as much life
now wherever they happen to be whatever
they happen to be doing
as they would have in some other time
and place that the fabric of life here
at an essential level
is functionally identical to the fabric

[01:00]
is functionally identical to the fabric
of life where they imagine they
need to be life just is what it is
you're not missing something the life
you're currently living
is just as full and complete in terms of
its existential attributes
as it would be in a mansion or in a
committed relationship or with a
master's degree or while touring around
the country in a sprinter van
etcetera i think this
illusion that there is something more to
life
arises out of the modern experience of
childhood and adolescence
in our society young people are put into
a really
structured linear progression from
elementary school
to middle school from middle school to
high school from high school to college
from college to first
job and those first few years in a
career are also generally characterized
by
a rapid succession of promotions and
increases
so as a result of the experiences of the
first 25 years of life
a lot of folks enter into their
adulthood proper with the expectation

[02:01]
adulthood proper with the expectation
that life is just this gradual but
inevitable upward trajectory a line
whose slope is just always up and to the
right
however at around 25 the
promotions start to arrive less
frequently and there is no clearly
defined linear track
and folks are just doing life
you're in the role functioning adult
that the linear progression prepared you
for
going to work buying groceries going to
bed at a reasonable time
trying to find time to exercise rinse
wash repeat
and what about the next milestones
getting married and having children
and beyond that retirement three steps
over 40 years so the progression really
begins to plateau around this time
and they think often erroneously that
they're doing something wrong or that
they're missing out in some capacity
because their life
isn't accelerating like it used to well
on some level
that linear growth was somehow

[03:02]
that linear growth was somehow
artificial and arbitrary
and this is well this is life
and of course life has other plans for
us life has victories and pleasures in
store
yes but it also has sickness and loss
and heartbreak and difficulty and
unkindness
that's part of the fabric of life it
doesn't always look like how we imagined
it would be
and part of growing up is kind of
accepting
the inevitable disappointments of
reality
but just as a silver lining once you
arrive at that place of acceptance
that it is what it is you're also
liberated from this self-imposed
pressure that you have to do something
that your life is already complete and
full
and on some level all of your efforts
one way or the other
wouldn't change that fact one bit
there's no need to
do you can just be

[04:00]
do you can just be
you can just live your life without the
pressure or compulsion of action
and this is actually extremely peaceful
it is an immense emancipation to arrive
at that place
but to do so you have to pass through
this gate of disappointment to get there
so those are my thoughts on the matter
hope they were helpful if you have a
topic you'd like discussed in a future
episode would like to set up a
consultation
