You talked about dissecting the human
body 600 years ago, how it was seen as a
transgression. Sure. It's like there's
obviously things we need to know about
the digestive tract and the gallbladder,
but it was gross or unappealing or
unholy for us to do that.
&gt;&gt; It was more it was sacrilege
the the sacredness of the human body.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; It wasn't just a machine. It was a
spiritual entity. And we desecrated it
by performing autopsies.
&gt;&gt; And you you conduct a moral
transgression by investigating it so
thoroughly. And then you use that
analogy also when you talk about
relationships.
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I think there's a similar crisis
just like there were health crises in
the middle ages and and today as well.
But they were stymied in their solutions
by this superstition around
investigating the human body empirically
and objectively. We had these ideas that
were preventing us from learning more
about how things really work and
therefore how can we get them back on
track when they go ary. And I think the
same thing happens in relationships.
We're not supposed to think too much
about it. There's a lot of thought

[01:01]
about it. There's a lot of thought
terminating cliches when it comes to
relationships and the troubles that
people experience. Just love each other
more. It's not that hard. Just be a good
person and love each other. It's like,
but what does that even mean? Like, what
do I actually do with my hands with that
information? What actionable steps do I
take? What does it mean to love? Do we
both
&gt;&gt; consider love to mean the same thing?
Like you just got done talking about how
love can be expressed differentially
between men and women. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, is it just learning each other's
love languages? I don't really like that
term, but it's clearly the case that
people receive and accept affection
differentially.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; But love is really about giving. It's
not about feeling anything or receiving.
Love is about self-sacrifice in the
service of others, which is why it's so
rare.
