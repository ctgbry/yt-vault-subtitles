i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
work
is an auction house
so this is a metaphor i often use with
clients with respect to their
professional trajectories
you ever been to an auction house
there's something for sale people are
bidding and the lot ultimately goes to
whoever offers the highest amount
okay
if you win a lot in an auction house
it means that you overpaid
why
because by definition
you were the only person in the room who
thought that lot was worth that much
no one else thought it was that valuable
and that's why you won
on some level overpaying is the price
you pay to secure the privilege of
winning
however in the vast majority of cases
you probably could have bought the same
lot for less money
the issue is of course that you don't

[01:01]
the issue is of course that you don't
know
how much less money you could have used
to buy that lot it could have been a
dollar less it could have been a million
dollars less
but you almost certainly could have
saved some money on that transaction
and this excessive spending isn't that
big of a deal if you're only going to
the auction house every once in a while
but if you're going there every single
day to bid on multiple lots
the extent to which you're overpaying
can create a significant liability for
you over time because we don't have
infinite resources we all have a finite
store of time energy and money and if
you're overpaying on 10 lots that might
mean that you're not going to be
competitive for the 11th
so what does this have to do with work
basically it means that if you're
winning if you're successful if things
are going smoothly
it might mean that you're over bidding
that you could potentially secure the
same results with less time and effort
and the only way to figure out the

[02:00]
and the only way to figure out the
extent to which you're over bidding
is to systematically experiment with
your time and effort investments
pull back a little bit and see what
happens
obviously you need to use your good
judgment here don't experiment on a
critical project or an essential
responsibility target less important
components of your work first
remove some of your time and effort
focus on satisficing as opposed to
optimizing
and observe the result
did anybody even notice
did this create a problem for anybody
else
huh
maybe i had this idea in my mind about a
certain standard of quality or
proficiency that was required for me to
demonstrate in order to secure a
successful result
and maybe that standard simply exists in
my own head
maybe it's not necessarily true huh
well in what other aspects of my work or
life am i overpaying in terms of time
energy or emotional investment in order
to get the same result

[03:01]
to get the same result
and when we begin to be a bit more
deliberate and systematic about how we
choose to allocate our time and energy
then we actually liberate some of those
resources to be productively invested in
other aspects of our lives
which makes our lives not just our work
more very interesting and rewarding
something to keep in mind
and remember that if pulling back really
creates an issue
trust that people will let you know
it's just like in sports
unless the foul is really flagrant the
ref isn't gonna go straight for the red
card usually it's just a whistle
and if you don't hear anything assume
the ball is still in play
