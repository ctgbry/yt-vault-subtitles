You said in one of your interviews that
women should bring out their nastiest,
side to seduce a man.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it got me into trouble. So, I've
switched it to the giving the richest,
creamiest milk they possibly can.
&gt;&gt; Is that worse?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter]
Yes, that is.
&gt;&gt; Um, why? [music] So the reason for that
is you have to pair this also with the
reality in today's day and age that with
relationships sex precedes commitment.
That's the modern
&gt;&gt; situation is how does it typically go?
Yeah. In the western world, right? But
that's changing even in other parts of
the world too. It's [music] we go on
some dates, we're attracted to each
other, we sleep with each other. Maybe
that goes on for a few weeks and a few
months and it's like, well, what are we
what's going on? Like who? And then you
have the define the relationship
conversation, [laughter] right? Cuz it's
usually the woman. So, it's it's a
couple months later and then it's like,
"Oh, I thought we were just really chill
and this is what you wanted or oh, you
yeah, I like you, too, and let's let's

[01:00]
yeah, I like you, too, and let's let's
have a relationship and what does that
look like?" And we're having a
conversation and you guys have been
screwing for weeks or months at this
point, right? [music] So, to believe
that the commitment will come before the
sex
&gt;&gt; is that's very expensive in today's day
and age because your competition is
giving away free samples. So [music] you
can't really charge when your
competition is giving away free samples.
The old line [music]
that like why buy the cow when you can
get the milk for free. It's now more or
less like why would you buy the cow if
you have to pay for the milk? Like I
expect the milk now. If you don't give
the [music] milk then I'm just going to
pass you on to one of the two dozen
people who I have lined up who will give
that to me. So if you can't
differentiate yourself based on [music]
you know what you charge for your
samples, what can you do? You can make
sure that your sample is the richest,
creamiest milk that's available. That's
where that comes from.
