I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is make her
work for it so you've probably heard the
fact that women disproportionately end
relationships like they break up and
divorce at significantly higher rates
than men do now there are many many
reasons why that might be the case but
today I'm going to talk about a
relatively unappreciated one namely most
women don't have to work for the
relationships they have what do I mean
by
that women make men work for sex they
are not just handing sex out on street
corners to all interested parties women
demand that men be sufficiently
attractive which could take years of
hard work that they engage her emotions
and demonstrate authentic interest for
the person inside her body and buy her
drinks and meals and make an effort and
wait until she feels ready at etc etc on

[01:01]
wait until she feels ready at etc etc on
the other hand men often do not make
women work for investment I mean that in
a lot of cases men are offering women
relationships resources attention and
commitment on a silver platter men will
jump through their own butts trying to
give a woman what they think she wants
in order to secure a sexual relationship
with her they surrender the duties and
privileges of gatekeeping the
relationship in their unwillingness to
potentially jeopardize the sexual
opportunity Now relationships aren't
much different from many things in life
it's easy come easy go if it doesn't
take much effort if it doesn't take much
sacrifice if it doesn't take much
resilience for a woman to secure a
relationship with a man she is not going
to Value it very much this not only
means that she is more likely to end a
relationship she hasn't really worked
for relative to a man but that she will
likely end a relationship sooner and

[02:02]
likely end a relationship sooner and
with less provocation as well on the
other hand a woman who has worked to
secure a relationship and has done so at
some cost to herself isn't going to
throw it away at the first sign of
trouble she is much more likely to try
to make it work because she's pot
committed that's a term from poker it
means that you've already bet enough of
your money that you functionally have to
play the hand For Better or Worse most
women are not pot committed
because most men don't give them the
opportunity to
invest so what can men do instead I'm so
happy you asked men if your goal is to
have a peaceful satisfying relationship
with a woman you need a woman who really
wants to be there she needs to think
that you are her very best option and
she needs to be highly attracted to you
when these two things are in place she
is going to perceive being with you to

[03:00]
is going to perceive being with you to
be intrinsically valuable and a
privilege and this will motivate her to
make an effort to secure and maintain
the
relationship remember people don't think
that things that are given freely are
valuable this is just how perception
works like expensive things aren't
necessarily better but the more
expensive something is the more likely
we think that it's good research has
even shown that more expensive placebos
are more effective than less expensive
place
this means that a woman cannot perceive
your commitment to be free in fact the
more expensive it is to her the more
valuable she will perceive it to be and
the more she will desire it all things
being equal you have to make her work
for
it if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my

[04:00]
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available an ebook audio book and
paperback formats the links are in the
description
now the way to do that as a man in the
sexual Marketplace the way to encourage
women to make an effort is to practice
Catch and
Release don't focus on women and
absolutely do not Target one to the
exclusion of all others instead focus on
being attractive to many women to
ascending to your captaincy to building
an emotionally compelling lifestyle to
understanding seduction and intersexual
Dynamics women will circulate in your
Ambit and if like you can initiate

[05:01]
Ambit and if like you can initiate
sexual relationships with them and just
leave it at that if a woman wants more
then she'll have to work for it just
like you had to work for it in order to
get laid it's actually kind of fair both
sides get to gatekeep it's just that in
the Modern Age where sex precedes
commitment women gatekeep first which
can lead less successful men to conclude
that men don't gatekeep at
all the legendary Patrice O'Neal had
this great bit about how men like to
fish for sport which is very different
from fishing for food I'll put a link to
his routine in the description it's
definitely worth checking out if you
haven't seen it they catch the fish
because it's exciting and fun and
pleasurable to catch fish and then they
throw it back into the water now some
fish are going to be upset at being put
back into the water they will feel as
though they were just a passing object
of the fisherman's fancy and resent
being hauled out of their element but to

[06:03]
being hauled out of their element but to
be fair these fish often did little to
hook the fishermen which is why they
were potentially thrown back into the
water they just thought it was enough to
be caught which isn't true however every
once in a while some fish that was put
back into the water is g to jump back
into your
boat now men you don't have to have a
relationship with any old fish that
jumps back into your boat again women
don't just give sex to every guy who
makes an effort but you absolutely
should only choose to have a
relationship with fish that jump back
into your boat these fish are making an
effort and doing so at some cost or
expense to themselves after all there
are presumably other boats they could
have potentially jumped into the
benefits of doing this should be obvious
a fish that is chasing you isn't leaving
you like it's not physically possible to
do both at the same time a fish that is

[07:02]
do both at the same time a fish that is
investing in you isn't criticizing you
it's very difficult for people to put
something down that they've poured their
heart and soul into in fact they will
typically go out of their way to reframe
their flaws and failures as features and
virtues men who insist that women
demonstrate through their
actions a repeated commitment to
securing a relationship at some cost or
expense are significant ific more likely
to end up with women who value the
relationship this is because these women
literally created that value through
their investment do not Rob women of the
opportunity to do this finally these men
also understand that any woman who bul
at the necessity of making the effort
does not really want the relationship
and therefore is not worth the men's
investment women insist that you invest
before sex and sex in today's

[08:01]
before sex and sex in today's
Marketplace is insanely cheap men you
need to insist that women invest before
commitment it is the far more valuable
commodity a fish that doesn't want to
jump back into the boat wants you to
join it at the bottom of the sea don't
let Sebastian fool you it's better on
the boat it is better on the yacht than
in the cold dark oce
and the fish know this that's why they
let themselves get caught so do not go
down to the fish have the fish come up
to you and any fish that doesn't want to
do that can keep swimming around in the
ocean they're not worth getting wet for
do you understand men this is your best
chance of securing a loving and
satisfying relationship with a woman
choose someone who has made the
consistent repeated effort to choose you
give her the opportunity to jump back

[09:01]
give her the opportunity to jump back
onto the boat and until that happens
don't take it personally if a fish swims
away just keep on with the Catch and
Release and enjoy your day on the water
it'll happen
