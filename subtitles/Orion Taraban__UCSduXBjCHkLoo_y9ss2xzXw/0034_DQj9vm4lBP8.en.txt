I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is the
tale of Blue Beard the story of Blue
Beard is an old fairy tale from Western
Europe and if you don't know it allow me
to Briefly summarize its plot basically
Blue Beard was a very wealthy nobleman
who married a series of women who all
vanished under mysterious
circumstances at the beginning of the
story Blue Beard Weds another beautiful
young woman and he gives her the keys to
all the rooms in his expansive Mansion
full of riches and wonders however he
expressly forbids her from opening the
locked door in the basement so it's kind
of reminiscent to the Garden of Eden in
the Book of Genesis the new bride can do
whatever she wants can partake of all
the pleasures of the mansion and can go
wherever she wants accepting one
specific room and of course her
curiosity about one room eventually

[01:01]
curiosity about one room eventually
overpowers her and she one day enters
the Forbidden room and finds the
mutilated corpses of all of blue Beard's
former wives Blue Beard catches her in
the act and makes to kill her but she
delays her death by asking for a moment
to pray during which time the woman's
Brothers appear and kill Bluebird
instead so that's the end of the
story and why am I telling you this
story I think that one moral of the
story is that somewhere deep in the
heart of man is a door that it might be
better off not to open that we all have
skeletons in the closet though hopefully
not literal skeletons like in the case
of Blue beer but emotional skeletons and
in most cases we actually gain little by
exposing them to the light in fact we
may even endanger ourselves by doing so
this means that in relationships if you
want perfect transparency

[02:00]
want perfect transparency
you can't expect perfect goodness
because no person including myself and
yourself is perfectly
good now to be fair in the fairy tale it
kind of makes sense for the bride to
open the door because it contains a
secret that directly relates to the
basis of her relationship with Blue
Beard the secret that he kills his wives
would reasonably influence a woman's
decision to marry him however in real
world relationships between people in
the vast majority of cases the emotional
skeleton doesn't directly relate to the
basis of that relationship for instance
how does the secret of an extramarital
affair actually relate to the basis of
the relationships between co-workers or
between a politician and his
constituents sexual Fidelity doesn't
even play a small part in either one of
those types of relationships so why open
that door it doesn't hide a secret that
can reasonably impinge upon the the

[03:00]
can reasonably impinge upon the the
basis of that
relationship if you look under a rock
you're going to find bugs and if you
look at anybody close enough your
partner your children your neighbors and
even yourself you will eventually
discover something that doesn't sit
right with you and it could be something
you might have a very hard time ever
forgetting so it's kind of good maners
to respect the doors of others
especially if you wouldn't want your own
shameful skeletons paraded through the
light of day
and the presence of that door doesn't
make you a bad person it doesn't mean
you're incapable of doing good it just
means that you're complex a mixture of
good and bad Darkness and Light like the
rest of us and accepting that fact about
yourself will probably help make you
more tolerant of the complexities of
others so that's what I have to say if
you have a topic you'd like discuss in a
future episode or would like to schedule
