i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
date like it's your job
let's say that you are unemployed and
you want
work
in this situation your job
is finding a job finding a job becomes
your full-time occupation
you don't just send out one or two
resumes throw your hands in the air when
you don't get a response and say well i
tried
if you want to have the kind of success
in the professional arena where you have
multiple good options to choose from you
have to take the prospect of seeking
employment seriously this might mean
reworking your resume taking workshops
on how to improve your presence in
interviews sending out dozens of resumes
a week learning new skills in order to
become more competitive in the job
market leveraging your personal network
creating social media accounts and
pounding the pavement if necessary
if you're serious about getting a job
you don't approach the job search
casually you strategize and implement on

casually you strategize and implement on
a large scale until it works
the same is true for dating
if you do not currently have access to
certain relationships and you want those
relationships then finding those
relationships becomes your full-time
occupation
it's just as hard
for most people to arrive at a place
where they have multiple good options to
choose from without concerned effort in
dating as it is in employment
this might mean going out on dozens of
dates a month overcoming your approach
anxiety mastering small talk learning to
polarize and signal attraction creating
accounts on dating apps socializing
around people with similar interests and
values investing in your look learning
about sex and seduction going to the gym
to improve your physique taking
workshops or engaging coaches to
increase your confidence anything to
move the needle forward and improve your
odds in a reality-based way you

odds in a reality-based way you
strategize and implement on a large
scale until it works
do you really expect to find a high
paying high value job by sending out a
resume or two
then why allow yourself to fall into a
similar delusion with respect to finding
a high value high quality relationship
if you want the good stuff you have to
be willing to put in the work
