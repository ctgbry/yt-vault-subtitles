does monogamy kind of seems like an
absolute well it is and I talk about in
the book the origin of romantic love is
transliterated religious impulse
basically and just like the original
religion that became romance was
monotheistic the relationship ideal
under romance is monogamy we've taken
one God and put them in another human
being is it true in the past so for
example if you're like a gas Khan right
you have you know hundreds of wives
right and like thousands of kids but
I've also heard that in the past before
religion really kind of took form or
became overly popular that women also
had many men as well well it depends on
how far back you want to go like this is
talked about in sex at dawn have you
read that book no it's an excellent book
and it describes what sexuality might
have looked like in prehistoric Days by
examining let's say more primitive
cultures that still exist on this planet
and in a lot of cultures there is no
monogamy
