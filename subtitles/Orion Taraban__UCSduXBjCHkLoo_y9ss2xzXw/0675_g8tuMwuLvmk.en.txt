I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how men
get suckered into fighting with women
like many things I discuss on this
channel this is something that I've
learned the hard way however once I
figured this out I was able to turn this
franchise around in a really big way and
today I'm going to share the secret with
you first and foremost it's important to
appreciate that big things can have
Small Beginnings an entire Forest can be
burned down from the flame from a single
spark in the context of the present
discussion this means that many
arguments with women begin with a very
small Catalyst and this is exactly where
men need to be most cautious as they are
often subject to thinking that these
small catalysts shouldn't really matter
or are no big deal and that isn't NE

[01:00]
or are no big deal and that isn't NE
necessarily
true that said these small catalysts are
vulnerable precisely because they're
small it's always easier to pull a weed
that has just sprouted than to wait
until it sunk its roots deep into the
ground so this danger is also our
opportunity the opportunity to nip a
potential problem in the bud before it
becomes a problem as
such now most men do not want to fight
with their women
however they are often suckered into
fighting with them because they fall for
a very subtle trap a trap that women
when they are emotionally
[Music]

[02:00]
they will make bigger and give back to
you if you give a woman a little
irritation she'll grow it into
aggravation and give it back a few more
volleys like this and you're
functionally Off to the Races so the way
to never fight with a woman is to
constantly and consistently clarify your
tone when speaking with one if it's
completely devoid of negativity then
there won't be anything that she can
grow and reflect back to you that you
wouldn't want to receive
so if men don't want to fight with their
women then where does this Tone come
from to begin with the tone comes from a
thought it's a dangerous thought because
the thought leads down the slippery
slope toward an argument and it's a
simple thought I know you're going to
recognize it immediately when I point it
out to you however this thought if
unaddressed Will flues into a feeling
which will leak out out into your

[03:00]
which will leak out out into your
communication as a tone so what's the
Thought when your woman comes to you and
for whatever reason she is provocative
or complaining or needy or critical or
what have you the Trap that gets sprung
in your mind is some version of the
thought I shouldn't have to [ __ ] deal
with this or ah Jesus Christ here we go
again or I can't believe this [ __ ] can I
have a moment of Peace in house or
something along those lines and these
thoughts and their variations are all
traps they are traps because as soon as
you validate these thoughts as true
which if you're not careful can happen
in the fraction of a second you are
going to begin to experience
impatience which will seep into your
tone as a kind of strained
self-control this tone in turn is
incubated and reflected which creates a
positive feedback loop that eventually

[04:01]
positive feedback loop that eventually
bursts into open hostility and this is
how men get suckered into fighting with
women they can't tolerate their own
impatience and this is a problem because
if you can't tolerate the initial
provocation how are you going to be able
to tolerate the incubated and reflected
version if you appreciate the insights
on this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book
the value of others over the course of
432 pages I delve deep into my economic
model of relationships and explain the
behavior of both men and women in the
game of mating and dating I also provide
a lot of actionable advice on how to get
and keep more of what you want in the
sexual Marketplace once you read the
value of others you'll never look at
relationships the same way again now

[05:05]
description so what's to be done about
this the way to prevent this outcome is
to improve your kung fu your mental Kung
Fu anyway the secret to emotional
equilibration is to maintain constant
vigilance over the contents of your
Consciousness behind every feeling is a
thought and certain thoughts will
predictably lead to certain emotional
States if you're able to root out those
thoughts while they're still small they
won't have a chance to flues into
emotions which means that you won't have
to cope with them emotionally which is
generally more timec consuming painful
and expensive better to rip them out
while they're still small and the way to
do this is through the block and replace
technique you become aware of the
thought I shouldn't have to [ __ ] deal
with
this well who says like where the [ __ ]
is that written why shouldn't you have

[06:01]
is that written why shouldn't you have
to deal with this since you're
apparently dealing with a woman who
hasn't entirely clarified her own
communication and you're dealing with
yourself who has yet to cultivate
sufficient patience to withstand her
provocations like are you sure you
shouldn't have to deal with this under
those conditions expecting reality to be
other than it is is just asking to be
disappointed and frustrated but whose
fault is that do you understand what I'm
saying this is harsh but it's effective
when a woman comes to you in this way
you have to understand that you are now
in the emotional gym the physical gym is
an actual location that we consciously
and intentionally go to the emotional
gym is a psychological location that
comes to us whether we're ready for it
or not and the emotional gem comes to us
when we start to become engaged with
negative emotional states when we start
to give over onto loneliness or
irritation anxiety or Despair and it's a

[07:02]
irritation anxiety or Despair and it's a
gym precisely because it's the
opportunity to strengthen the
commensurate virtue that will help you
defend against that particular weakness
in the future which in this case would
be self-possession or patience or
courage or hope respectively after all
how can you grow these virtues if you
don't ever have the opportunity to
practice them so these difficult
situations are the opportunity to grow
stronger in the virtues that will defend
you against future difficulties it's
sort of like building a tolerance to
poison you can do it by exposing
yourself to increasingly stronger doses
to build up your ability to withstand
its influence over time without that
exposure you might be taken out by a
small quantity of the substance but with
gradual exposure even large doses might
have no effect on you it's also helpful
to consider your woman in these moments

[08:00]
to consider your woman in these moments
at least to be your teacher she's your
teacher because she's showing you where
you still have buttons to push and as
frustrating as this is this is actually
a very beneficial service that she's
providing your woman is teaching you
that you still have buttons to push in
the privacy of your own home and the
relative safety of your relationship so
that you do not need to learn that you
still have buttons to push out in the wi
wider world where the stakes might be
much higher in most cases the woman's
motivation here is not malicious however
even if it is malicious she can still be
your teacher after all it's for you to
decide where you take your
lessons in any case in these moments
your woman is pointing out where you are
still vulnerable where you are still
susceptible to attack where you still
have buttons that can be pushed and the
correct response to a lesson even a

[09:00]
correct response to a lesson even a
lesson that you may not have wanted to
learn is
gratitude thank you thank you teacher
for showing me that I still have this
button I didn't realize H I thought I
had gotten them all but you know you
have helped me to see something that I
couldn't see for myself now when you
feel your buttons being pushed then do
your mental Kung Fu to prevent the
fluoresence of the emotion and if the
emotion presents itself use your
emotional coping strategies to prevent
the situation from spiraling out of
control and help you return to Baseline
and then further down the road when you
have the time and the space to do so you
should examine what happened like why do
I have that button why did that prick my
ego why did that get under my skin so
much really try to figure that out
because by examining and processing your
emotional response you can effectively
remove that button from your

[10:00]
remove that button from your
psyche the goal of course is to become
buttonless or at the very least to
remove that particular button from
commission the next time she goes
looking for that button you can't let
her find it there now when she can't
find it she's GNA push harder to make
sure that the button is really gone so
you have to be prepared for that but
after she pushes harder and realizes
that the button is really gone then
she's going to stop pushing she might
try to seek out another button to push
but she probably won't bother with the
one that is somehow
disappeared the idea is that a master
can turn anything to his purposes in
this way a good man can use even a
disrespectful and disagreeable woman to
become emotionally resilient and
invulnerable what do you think does this
