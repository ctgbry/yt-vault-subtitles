I'm Dr Orion taband and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is you're
only as good as your routines this
episode was inspired by my recent
travels in Japan something about me is
I'm constantly in the process of
experimentation and I've recently been
experimenting with new ways of living
and part of this experiment was to take
a month off which I haven't done since I
started working over 20 years ago and
spend some time living like a local in
Japan I visited Japan many years ago and
I loved it it's an enchanting place and
in my opinion it's one of the best
cultures that exists on the planet today
so I wanted to see what it would be like
to spend an extended period of time
there and on the whole I had a fantastic
time however as the month went on I
found my mood beginning to deteriorate
and this was surprising to me as I was
ostensibly on holiday doing whatever it
was that I wanted to do whenever I
wanted to do it I was having new
experiences and eating great food and
generally having fun but I frankly
wasn't feeling feeling as well inside of

[01:01]
wasn't feeling feeling as well inside of
myself as I do when I'm back home living
my little day-to-day life and that's
when it kind of clicked for me and I
realized that a lot of my sense of self
a lot of my emotional regulation a lot
of my self-esteem a lot of my happiness
and satisfaction and joy actually come
from the structure I have created over
the years and the routines that I have
cultivated in my daily daily life like I
already knew this intellectually but
this trip really helped me understand
this more deeply on an emotional level
and then kind of makes sense because as
an entrepreneur I've been able to Custom
Tailor nearly every aspect of my life
over the years to my personal preference
so my day-to-day life really works for
me because I was moving around from
place to place in Japan I didn't have
consistent access to a gym so my
exercise routines fell off and because I
was staying in short-term rentals I
didn't have access to a good kitchen so
I wasn't cooking my own meals and
because I was in a country where I
didn't speak the native language it was
much more difficult for me to make
connections with the people I was

[02:00]
connections with the people I was
meeting so I wasn't supported by my
friends and confidants and because the
constant travel demanded that I be at
certain places at certain times my sleep
weight Cycles were disrupted so I wasn't
feeling as rested and focused as I
usually do it might sound boring but in
my day-to-day life I often do the same
exact thing every single day I wake up
at the same time every day I make the
same breakfast every day I start work at
the same time every day not because
anyone is telling me I have to be
anywhere at any given time that might
actually be easier to maintain but
because I'm telling myself where I need
to be at any given moment of the day and
this consistency kind of helps me stay
in the zone it allows me to dependably
perform at a very high level day after
day I also noticed that after two weeks
I really started to miss my work this is
because I don't really think of my work
as a job yeah it's the primary source of

[03:01]
as a job yeah it's the primary source of
my income but it also gives me so much
fulfillment and it provides me with
meaning and connection and inspiration
and it's intellectually stimulating and
emotionally rewarding I usually feel
better at the end of my workday than I
do at the beginning of it that's that's
the truth I don't feel like I need to
take time away from my work anymore than
I feel like I need to take time away
from fulfillment connection and
stimulation in many respects I might
need that work more than that work needs
me so what's the upshot here well after
kind of patting myself on the back for
making good choices with respect to my
lifestyle and my line of work I had to
come to grips with the fact that a lot
of my satisfaction and performance had
less to do with me like with factors
that inhere in myself like intelligence
or creativity or what have you and more
to do with the structures in which I
routinely find myself basic stuff like
sleeping eating exercising sex and
connection these things regulate my

[04:00]
connection these things regulate my
emotion and clarify my thinking more
than I think I previously appreciated
it's not like I had some kind of
meltdown or breakdown when they were
disrupted but the change in me wrought
by their disruption was not
insignificant and it only took about 3
weeks for me to start to feel the
negative effects of that disruption now

it's Word of Mouth referrals like this
that really helped to make the channel
grow and you can also hit the thanks
button and tip me in proportion to the
value you feel you've received from this
episode I really depend on your support
and your donations because it makes
everything here happen I really thank
you now all of this made me think of the
millions of men out there who are
struggling with depression struggling
with low self-esteem and purposelessness
and dejection men who just feel shitty
in their own subjective experience and I
thought wow if I don't feel great when I

[05:00]
thought wow if I don't feel great when I
deviate from my routines for like two
weeks how would it feel to deviate from
my routines for years how would it feel
not to have a structure to begin with
and I think it would feel a lot like
depression which I experienced very
intensely when I was younger and my life
was a mess I think there's a connection
there it's like of course how can anyone
feel good inside themselves when they
are not supported by these structures
these routines I just don't think it's
really possible for the vast majority of
people I don't think we're like
hardwired to be able to do that my dudes
you are only as good as your routines
allow you to be what do you do every
single day tell me what you do
repeatedly and I'll tell you how happy
you probably
are these things are more responsible
for your quality of life then you likely
give them credit for and if your
depression leads you to contact a
therapist and that person doesn't ask

[06:00]
therapist and that person doesn't ask
you about your sleep and your nutrition
and your exercise and your relationships
and your work and your sex life then
you're not really talking to a therapist
you're talking to a drug dealer and
that's exactly the solution they're
going to offer you as I discussed in a
previous episode it's important to rule
out the confounds if you have all of
these things dialed in and taken care of
and you're still not feeling very hot
then there might be other things to
consider but why not rule out the things
that we know for a fact significantly
impact mood and
cognition first like things that frankly
you may not need to pay a therapist for
before you hire the services of a
professional like how could that be bad
for you A lot of people especially young
people and especially young men have
difficulties with the idea of structure
they only view it in its restrictive
attribute uh like a cage or a cell the
best model I have for structure is a
skeleton without a skeleton you're just

[07:00]
skeleton without a skeleton you're just
a [ __ ] puddle on the floor you're not
going to move and you're not going to
get anywhere it's your structure your
skeletal system that allows you to stand
upright and that creates the opportunity
for Locomotion for movement in your life
without that structure you're a soft bag
of flesh wriggling on the floor so get
your routines down gentlemen Channel
your inner Postman and do it in spite of
your feelings do this and your habits
will eventually move you forward when
you're finding it hard to carry on
support the Habit so the habit can
support you it might be hard at the
beginning but it's probably hard anyway
