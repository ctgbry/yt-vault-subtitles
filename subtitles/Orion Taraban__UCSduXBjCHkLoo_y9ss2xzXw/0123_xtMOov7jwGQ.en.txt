i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
to hope
is to wait
this is a realization that i came to the
other day while i was watching a
portuguese language film
in which the characters repeatedly use
the verb esperara
now many of you probably already know
that in several romance languages the
verb esperar means both to hope and to
wait which to my english language
imagination always seemed like two very
different actions
but the more i considered it the more i
realized that there is an inextricable
component of waiting to hoping
for example
let's say you want to go to the movies
but when you stroll the theater there is
a line to speak to the cashier in the
box office
most likely you will decide to wait in
that line as you have a reasonable
expectation a reasonable hope
that if you exercise sufficient patience

[01:02]
that if you exercise sufficient patience
you will eventually arrive at the front
of the line
and you can purchase a ticket to the
movie you hope to see
it would be unreasonable to hope that
this would occur if you decided not to
wait in the line
or if you instead chose to wait in the
line in front of a nightclub saying
hope is not justified without waiting
nor is it justified when waiting
inappropriately
some people are just waiting
they're waiting in the wrong place
which means that they're waiting without
hope irrespective of whatever they
happen to be telling themselves this is
foolish
there must be an element of justified
hope to our waiting otherwise we're just
wasting our time
so if you're waiting for something you
hope to achieve
be sure that you're waiting in the right
line
hopefully that makes sense
