relationships absolutely don't turn on
the fulcrum of attractiveness a rich
handsome arrogant man and a beautiful
sexy entitled woman are both very
difficult to date like all the benefits
they provide might be completely
nullified by their toxic personalities
and sociopathic tendencies however For
Better or For Worse people will still
try to date them and people will still
try to make it work with them and they
will try longer and harder to make it
work with them before they give up why
because they are attractive believing
that this shouldn't be the case is
pointless it is what it is of course the
best dating advice should include both
perspectives the ideal is to be a good
and attractive partner however this is
very difficult and extremely expensive
most people can't do both
