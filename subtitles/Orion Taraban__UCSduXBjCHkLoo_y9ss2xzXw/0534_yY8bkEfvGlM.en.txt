I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the Trap
of the high value woman so I'm very
happy to report that I've been doing a
lot of consultations with women these
days I love doing consultations with
women because I love helping women see
things from a man's perspective this is
important because just like in marketing
you kind of have to see things from the
perspective of your potential customers
so that you can make a value proposition
that resonates with them insisting that
people should simply buy what you're
selling independent of their own wants
and needs doesn't work so seeing things
from a man's perspective will help women
get the kinds of relationships that they
want from the men they want to have
those relationships with now a certain
issue has come up repeatedly in these
consultations so I thought I'd make an
episode about it because if several

[01:00]
episode about it because if several
women in the recent past have been
struggling with this issue chances are
very good that many many women are
currently struggling with the same issue
right now and it kind of goes like this
usually these women come to me and they
say Orion I'm in my 30s and I understand
that my time is limited I'm ready to
have a family in the next year or two
and I need your help to make that happen
and I say great let me help you do that
so let do a little role play let's say
that you're you and I'm the guy that you
want to make things happen with okay if
you come to me like this I'm going to
say something like all right I just met
you not too long ago and this is a
little pushy but okay I'm willing to
move things along to fit your timeline
let's say I'm willing to give you a
lifelong commitment and to provide for
you and the children I make a lot of
money a lot more than you do which is
probably part of the reason why you
singled me out so your quality of life
should improve considerably if I take

[02:01]
should improve considerably if I take
you on now what will I expect to receive
in
return and this question stumps a lot of
women usually they first come back with
some really highlevel stuff like I'm
intelligent and educated and I would
make a really supportive partner and in
my roleplay I respond okay well that
might be the case but I already have a
lot of support in my life I have a
therapist and a lawyer and a priest and
various professional Consultants each
one is an expert in his or her field and
are specialized in the functions they
serve in my life no offense but I don't
think you're going to give me better
advice than they can in the domains in
which I consult them so that's not
actually something that I need from you
and then the women start to coton on a
bit and they say oh okay well I can give
you children right those people can't do
that and I respond well almost any woman
could give me children are you going to

[03:00]
could give me children are you going to
be a mother are you willing to quit your
job and raise those kids most of the
time the women are frightened by that
Prospect and they reply no I'm not
willing to give up my career or I would
expect you to do your share of the child
care too and so I counter so you're
telling me that you're willing to be a
surrogate and that I'll end up paying
someone else to raise my children so
that you can make a little more money at
your
job sometimes that irritates them and
they respond that they don't think it's
fair that they should do all the child
care and that they're looking for a
50/50 relationship and I reply that's
totally fair but that means that you
should probably be asking someone who
makes around the same as you do that way
you can both invest equally in the
lifestyle that you jointly build that
said you probably and understandably
think what's the point of getting
married if it's not going to
significantly improve my situation which
is why you're talking to me and and not
some other guy and we go back and forth

[04:02]
some other guy and we go back and forth
like this for a while until eventually
we hit on the truth of the matter namely
if I'm a high value guy the kind of guy
that you want to get married to and have
children with the only way that you're
going to get what you want is by
providing something that I don't already
have and the more I have the harder
that's going to be however in general
there are three things that a woman can
provide most straight high value men
they are one consistent fantastic sex
two children and child rearing and three
obedient agreeableness that improves his
quality of life and to be honest men can
actually buy all three of those things
however there's still a lot of stigma in
judgment about buying these three
particular things which actually creates
an opportunity in the marketplace for
women to potentially fill

[05:00]
women to potentially fill
let's focus on this last item a bit
shall we obedient agreeableness that
improves his quality of life can look
like many things but two of the most
common ways of doing this historically
are cooking and
cleaning oo okay the push back I
typically receive on this point is
considerable and usually something on
along the lines of that is low value
labor Orion I'm not interested in being
someone's maid or some man's mommy the
man I want can afford a maid let him pay
someone else if he wants his house
cleaned and I say fair enough you have
absolutely no moral obligation to cook
or clean for a man however I'd like you
to consider that if a man pays for that
service that is one less way in which he
might need you you can look at these
tasks like oppressive servitude or you

[06:02]
tasks like oppressive servitude or you
can see them as opportunities to
intimately integrate yourself into the
man's lifestyle remember the most
dangerous man for a woman is the man who
has everything because if he has
everything he doesn't need you for
anything which means that you'll be a
play thing at
best next let's look a little closer at
this judgment you have about cooking and
cleaning being beneath you as being low
value labor let's imagine that we go out
to a Michelin star restaurant for a real
high-end dining experience the dinner
will be quite expensive and it may have
taken us months just to get a
reservation and let's imagine that
during our dinner we call over our
waiter and ask for a glass of water and
he explains oh we don't serve water here
this is a high-end restaurant Resturant

[07:00]
this is a high-end restaurant Resturant
we only serve champagne you can get
water anywhere and I would encourage you
to take your business elsewhere if
that's what you're looking
for yeah how would that go over not well
right what makes a high-end restaurant
is not that it doesn't do what the
average restaurants do but that it does
everything that the average restaurants
do and then some if all the other
restaurants serve water
you can't really get away with not
serving water no restaurant is above the
minimum standard of service the high-end
ones not only go above and beyond the
minimum they also perform the standard
of service with class you want a glass
of water right away they'll put it in a
nice glass with artisanal ice cubes and
a lemon wedge garnish they do low value
stuff with enthusiasm and laity because

[08:00]
stuff with enthusiasm and laity because
it's the service that improves the
quality of the experience which is what
you're paying for at a Michelin star
restaurant do you
understand now let's be honest many of
these activities are greatly facilitated
by modern technology between my
dishwasher laundry machines and robot
vacuums I personally keep a
three-bedroom house clean with maybe two
actual hours of Labor a month a month
with grocery delivery services I can
spend two hours a week preparing all my
breakfasts and lunches and a few more
cooking a few dinners pitching in here
and there is frankly not a very big ask
which is why I argue that this
resistance in women is an ego thing it's
really an issue of Pride and as I've
said pride is women's greatest enemy
it's the number one thing that keeps
them from getting into the relationships
they want with the men they want to have
the with look if you want to split the

[09:01]
the with look if you want to split the
housework and child care find your Dark
Horse find a man who has about the same
as you and build something together
however if you're looking for a more
successful man to wife you up and give
you kids on your timeline you have to be
prepared to provide value and this has
to be a value that he finds valuable
because the cat decides what milk is
good and all things being equal
providing obedient agreeableness is one
of the easiest and cheapest and safest
ways of doing just that women find ways
of doing this that work for you
something to consider what do you think
does this fit with your own experience
