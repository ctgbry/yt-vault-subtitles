I don't know that I've heard you say
this, but that women will generally in
younger ages date for potential before
it actually switches to power in men is
what that's what I'm hearing you say.
&gt;&gt; They should and sometimes they do. Like
I made an episode a long time called
Ladies Find Your Dark Horse, which is I
think one of the best sexual strategies
for a long-term mating that women have.
Women have this tendency they they want

him. Like that that's just an immature
boy. It's like come on. Let's let's be
real. That's something that almost all
men would enjoy and find difficult to
