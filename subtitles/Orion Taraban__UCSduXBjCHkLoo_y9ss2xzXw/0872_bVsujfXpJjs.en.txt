The third pathway is social circle. This
is the way that people used to meet.
They had the same friend group in
college or they attended the same local
church or they even worked together.
Basically, in social circle game, you
date your friends, colleagues, and
co-workers. And there are a number of
pros to this approach. Most notably,
it's the safest bet when it comes to
long-term relationships because you can
vet women slowly and over time. This
could occur over multiple group outings
with friends or in the context of an
escalating office flirtation. Compared

build a connection with a person before
you start dating, it means that if you
do start, you're probably more likely to
stay together. So, what's the problem?

dating apps make the vast majority of
rejection unseen and unfelt, and an
awkward approach can leave a bad taste
in your mouth for a few minutes,
rejection where one works or prays or
studies can be brutal. Hey.
