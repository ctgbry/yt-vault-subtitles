and here's the most important part of
all this it's the most important part
because it's the part you women actually
control men get married when everything
is working especially in the
relationship every problem that you
unnecessarily introduce into the
relationship is a stumbling block that
you're throwing in your own path why
because when a man is thinking of
getting married he's going to look at
his woman and think could I deal with
this this for the rest of my life that
means if you're issuing demands and
ultimatums he's going to think am I
going to have to deal with demands and
ultimatums for the rest of my life and
you know what I don't care who he is he
is not going to want to deal with
demands and ultimatums for the rest of
his life so why the would he sign up for
that same thing with jealousy or
criticism or laziness or emotionality or
judgmentalism or sexlessness or any of
the hundreds of things that women are
subject to Bringing to their
relationships
