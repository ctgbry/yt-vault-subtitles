in the truth about commitment janine
georgette asks doesn't this also apply
to friendships well it does to a certain
degree it's certainly the case that
friends can take increasingly divergent
paths in life which causes the
relationship to slowly degrade over time
or people can suffer perceived or actual
betrayals at the hands of their friends
which lead to an abrupt end to that
relationship
so
friends don't always exist forever but
the kind of commitment i'm speaking
about in this video on romantic
relationships a little bit different if
a friend came to you and said look
i really want to get all of our friends
and family together in one place and
even hire a priest to attest to god and
to the moon that you are my best friend
and nothing will ever come between us
till death do us part and i want to sign
a legal contract to attest to the fact
that you are my best friend
it would probably seem a little
off-putting wouldn't it it's like we
don't expect that from our friends
which is a good thing
