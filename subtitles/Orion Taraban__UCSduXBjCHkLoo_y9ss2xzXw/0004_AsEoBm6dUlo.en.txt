i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology so the
topic of today's short discussion
is on the inevitability of pain
so uh you know we live in this
biological organism
we are attracted to pleasure we have
this
natural aversion to pain and
the consequence of that is sometimes we
can find ourselves
at a crossroads in our life where we're
sort of peering down the different paths
to determine okay which one is likely
going to get me the most pleasure for
the least amount of pain what i call the
hedonic calculus
um you know that's all well and good to
a certain point
but sometimes we fall into this trap of
prioritizing
the avoidance of pain and it's actually
a psychological
truth that people are much
more likely to to work to avoid pain

[01:00]
more likely to to work to avoid pain
than they are to secure pleasure so in
our in our calculus it's not like a
one-to-one it's like
one ounce of pain isn't worth one ounce
of pleasure in our minds
so we're generally more pain averse than
a pleasure attracted
okay so the idea here is that sometimes
we can try to avoid
pain by kind of any means necessary
and the fact of the matter is is that
pain is inevitable so what does this
mean this means that
if you go if you don't change that's
painful
if you change it's painful if you go
left it's painful if you go right it's
painful
if you if you move forward with a
committed relationship and get married
and start a family it's painful
if you stay single and secure your
freedom
it's painful no matter what you do there
will be pain
so what i often counsel my clients is to
really deeply accept and embrace the
inevitability of pain
and rather than let the

[02:00]
and rather than let the
the avoidance of pain be the guiding
factor
in our decisions at the crossroads of
life rather to say
to ourselves in essence okay no matter
what i'm going to
feel in pain there's going to be pain
associated with whatever choice i make
so rather than so it doesn't really
enter
or shouldn't really enter into the
calculus of our decision making because
it's common to every alternative uh
we have to examine how our the
alternatives are different
not how they're the same and how all the
alternate alternatives are the same is
that there's pain involved
so we accept that pain is inevitable and
rather than let that be our guiding star
we think okay
which path is the pain
worth it in which path do i
at least go where i want to go at
which point is the cost of my suffering
in some way recompensed

[03:00]
in some way recompensed
by the benefit or the growth that i
receive as a result of that decision
when you start to think this way and you
on some level you begin to minimize or
even kind of
ignore or accept the inevitability of
pain you make decisions that are
actually more in line with your
your best interests your goals your
vision in life
and your long-term growth so thanks for
