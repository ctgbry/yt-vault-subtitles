let's do some very basic math shall we
let's say that you want to have a family
with two kids and as we've seen 40 is a
pretty hard Line in the Sand with
respect to pregnancy that would mean
that you would kind of need to have your
second child by the time you were 40
which means that we need to get pregnant
with that second child at 39 which means
that you would have to have your first
one at 38 which means that you would
have to get pregnant with that one at 37
which means you kind of have to get
married at 36 which means you kind of
have to get proposed to at 35 which
means you probably have to meet the guy
at 33.34 at the latest if this woman
wanted to have two kids she didn't have
years to figure it out she had months
now obviously things don't necessarily
have to progress the way I just
described but if they don't that time
has got to come out of somewhere or it
could mean only having one child
Etc you can delay the decision on the
front end but the time has got to come
out of somewhere and taking time out of
the back end can often be more
problematic than taking the time out of
the front
