I think a lot of guys who don't have a
lot of experience with women may in a
vacuum be more attractive, but then they
offer up relationships way too early. I
tell this guy to guys all the time, it's
like I really feel like if I'm dating a
girl after we've slept together, she
needs to be the one to ask what are we,
not me.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, I think this comes from a little bit
of misunderstanding. Yeah. uh we could
call it maybe failure of perspective
taking is that a lot of men myself
included growing up think that women
just want relationships.
&gt;&gt; Men want sex. They don't want
relationships. Women want relationships.
They don't want sex. And that's that's
not true. Is that women want different
things from different men.
&gt;&gt; There would be no Las Vegas if that was
true.
&gt;&gt; So these guys are thinking, well, I know
what women want. They want relationships
and commitments. So I will give them
what they want because then they will
give me what I want.
&gt;&gt; Which is actually the basis of rational
exchange.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But it's not that simple.
&gt;&gt; They're bidding against themselves
sometimes out of desperation.

[01:00]
sometimes out of desperation.
&gt;&gt; They don't realize that though. It with
limited understanding from uh it it kind
of looks rational or logical what these
guys are doing. They just need better
information into what women are actually
valuing.
