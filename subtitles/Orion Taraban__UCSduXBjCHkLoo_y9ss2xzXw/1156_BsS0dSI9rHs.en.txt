And now we come to the third and most
important reason why men should do as
little as possible early on in the
courtship process. It helps to identify
the women who are actually attracted to
you, the man, and not just attracted to
what she can get from you. As I've said
before, all men pay, but the more she
likes you, the greater the discount. A
woman who is 10 out of 10 attracted to
you won't care if your idea of a date is
sitting in your parked car behind the
local Taco Bell. You don't have to spend
any money on her, let alone do anything
fancy or extravagant. And you certainly
don't have to bend over backwards trying
to show her how beautiful and valued she
is. Why? Because she finds just being
with you valuable enough. Like she is
being paid in access to you. That is
what her attraction is telling her. But
a woman who doesn't have that level of
attraction for you will need things to
compensate her for, in her mind,
settling for a less attractive option.

settling for a less attractive option.
And attraction is very personal. The
same man can be very attractive to one
woman and very unattractive to another.
This is because attraction isn't
entirely objective. It largely lives in
the mind of the beholder. The upshot
here is that by offering very little out
of the gate, you can easily determine
which women are highly attracted to you
and filter out the Yes.
