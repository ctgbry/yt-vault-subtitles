I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how women
disrespect men without realizing it
understanding power so this is the first
installment of a two-part episode for
the ladies I'm here to help you
understand how you might be getting in
your own way with respect to your
relationships with men as I mentioned in
my episode how to get any man you want
the unbreakable rule the one thing that
you women must absolutely never do to
the man with whom you want to have a
long-term relationship is disrespect him
this does not mean that you have to
respect him though that would obviously
be preferred disrespecting someone and
not respecting someone aren't the same
thing and this also does not mean that
you have to agree with him or approve of
everything that he does however it does
mean that you have to find a way to
disagree or disapprove in a way that

[01:00]
disagree or disapprove in a way that
does not disrespect him and trust me
this is possible to do now there are
some very obvious ways in which women
are subject to disrespecting men they
can do this through open mockery and
contempt or passive aggression and
neglect or even physical or emotional
abuse I'm not talking about these things
I take it that the vast majority of
women understand that these behaviors
are disrespectful and toxic rather
today's talk is going to be about ways
in which women disrespect men without
realizing it the idea here is to call
women's attention to the ways in which
they may be inadvertently sabotaging the
relationships they want with the men
they want to have them with and keep in
mind I'm not arguing that women have a
moral or ethical responsibility not to
do these things Visa men I'm arguing
that women who voluntarily choose not to

[02:02]
that women who voluntarily choose not to
do these things will be much more
effective in achieving their
relationship goals this is all about
Effectiveness across these two episodes
I'll be briefly discussing five ways
women often disrespect men without
realizing it this list is by no means
exhaustive but it should serve as a
general template for examining one's
behavior in light of this value as
stated in previous episodes the general
rule of thumb when it comes to
disrespect is if you wouldn't say the
same thing in the same way to your boss
if you were interested in keeping your
job then you shouldn't say that in that
way to the man with whom you want to be
in a long-term relationship so we're not
only talking about criticizing and
demeaning language like word choice
we're also talking about nonverbal cues
of disrespect like eye rolling or
dismissive sighing or po body language

[03:01]
dismissive sighing or po body language
Etc as we'll see most of these behaviors
involve women inappropriately assuming
more power than is warranted in their
intimate relationships which is
emotionally perceived by men as
disrespect let's jump right into it the
first way that women disrespect men
without realizing it is through
inappropriate
questioning the ability to ask question
CH s is a privilege that is awarded to
those with more power have you ever been
arrested in the interrogation room you
don't get to ask the officers questions
they do just like they say in all the
cop dramas hey we're the ones asking
questions here have you ever attended a
session of the Supreme Court during oral
arguments the justices are empowered to
ask the attorneys present as many
questions as they want even interrupting
their responses to ask ask even more

[04:00]
their responses to ask ask even more
questions if necessary the attorneys
never get a chance to grill the justices
why because the court wasn't convened to
answer to the lawyers that would be an
inappropriate usurpation of
authority women when you interrogate Men
by questioning their intentions their
whereabouts their motivations their
choices you are basically communicating
that you believe that you occupy a more
power ful position relative to them you
communicate that you believe that you
have a right to know certain things and
that you believe he must answer to you
and it's only the less powerful who must
answer to the more powerful never the
other way around this is functionally
placing yourself in a higher position
relative to that man which will
absolutely be perceived as disrespect
find ways to learn what you want with
without prying or interrogating despite

[05:02]
without prying or interrogating despite
what you believe no man has any
obligation to answer to you now before I

using the venmo link provided I'm doing
it this way because I get all of your
donation that way as opposed to just a
fraction of it when going through
YouTube I really appreciate your support
it helps keep all of this running thank
you now the second way that women
disrespect men without realizing it is
through granting
permission in general we have to ask
permission of those who have the
authority to grant our requests this
means that we act as though the good in
question is actually in the possession
of the authority who can grant gr us
permission whether that's technically

[06:01]
permission whether that's technically
true or not taking possession of that
good without permission would be an
egregious Act of insubordination and
this is because permission only moves
from the high to the low those with more
power never have to ask permission of
those with less now the fact of the
matter is that unless you come to a
mutual agreement to the contrary a man
has no obligation to ask your permission
for
anything even if he's in a committed
relationship with you he was a sovereign
and autonomous individual when you met
him and he remains a sovereign and
autonomous individual until he
explicitly enters into a new arrangement
to the contrary this means that a man
has absolutely no obligation to ask your
permission or check in with you first to
spend time with his friend

[07:00]
spend time with his friend
or leave his house or pursue his Hobbies
or really do whatever it is that he
wants to do with what could very well be
his One and Only Life on this planet
women would you want to ask your man's
permission before you spent your own
money wouldn't that like wrankle you
like it's your money you earned it why
should any man have the power to decide
what you do with it well by the same
token
why would any man need to ask your
permission on how to spend his own time
it's his life not yours a woman who acts
as though a man must ask her permission
to spend his own time is like a man who
acts as though a woman must ask him
permission to spend her own money only
worse because you can get money back and
expecting your man to check in with you
before he makes a decision with respect
to how how he spends his own time is

[08:01]
to how how he spends his own time is
acting as though you have the authority
to Grant or withhold permission on the
matter as before this is functionally
placing yourself in a higher position
relative to that man which once again
will absolutely be perceived as
disrespect and of course any man who
allows himself to fall into this Dynamic
is more than partly to blame for his
situation all right the Third Way that
women disrespect men without realizing
it is through
surveillance this could be done through
a location tracking app or snooping
through his phone or rifling through his
finances even the government isn't
allowed to do these things without
permission the fact of the matter is
your desire to know does not take
precedence over his right to privacy
women who do these things are
functionally treating their men like
pets and acting like their owners as
should be obvious vious this is placing

[09:00]
should be obvious vious this is placing
yourself in a higher position relative
to that man which will be perceived
as disrespect you got it and it will be
perceived as disrespect even if the
motivations for doing so are neutral
like simple curiosity or even positive
like care or concern as with all of
these the feeling that compelled you to
act in this way is irrelevant it is the
behavior itself self that is
disrespectful parents can go into their
children's rooms this is because
everything in that room actually belongs
to the parent like it's only the child's
room in name and parents ultimately
remain responsible for their children
until they turn 18 it's not only their
right it's their duty to supervise their
children's lives but this is only
because children lack the capacity to
supervise themselves on the other hand

[10:00]
supervise themselves on the other hand
I'm willing to bet that your man was a
fully functioning adult when you met him
and he remains a fully functioning adult
to this day acting as if you have a
right or a duty to supervise his life is
treating him like a child do you like
being treated like a child do you like
being in fantz does that hurt your Widow
feeings like that's infuriating and dis
respectful right like that's why we
don't talk like that to other adults but
if we're committed not to infantilize
adults with our words and tone we should
likewise be committed not to infantilize
adults with our actions and
behaviors make sense all right that's
enough for one episode I'll round out
the list and make some final comments in
the next installment so stay tuned what
