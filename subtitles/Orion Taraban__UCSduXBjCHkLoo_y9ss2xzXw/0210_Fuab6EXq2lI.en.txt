i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the truth about social media posts
so social media offers a very distorted
vision of reality i think we all know
that but i'd like to demonstrate why
this happens to be the case with a
little analogy
let's say that you find this really
amazing hole in the wall restaurant the
food is fantastic and affordable the
atmosphere is cozy and intimate the
staff is friendly and personable and the
owner always comps your dessert
it's your spot
are you gonna tell the world about this
place
i don't think so
if everyone were to know about this
restaurant it would kind of degrade the
experience you'd have to make a
reservation months in advance or there
would be a line out the door just to get
a table
the truth is that if you have something
truly good
you don't tell other people about it

[01:00]
you don't tell other people about it
because they can ruin it
so if somebody creates a post on social
media that seems to be about something
that's very good
there's really only two real
possibilities
one it's not actually good
it's just a slice of that experience
selectively curated to depict the
minority of good from among the majority
of mediocre or bad or two
it's not actually
theirs
they're at this fancy hotel
so they're promoting someone else's
property that they rented for a night or
they're standing in front of a
lamborghini so they broke into the valet
parking lot
i mean do you see
if you have something good you don't
share it indiscriminately with the world
so if someone appears to be doing just
that
it's either not good or it's not theirs
those who do have something good are
used to it
it's no longer an event

[02:01]
it's no longer an event
if you are a person who routinely flies
first class
are you posting about flying first class
no you're used to it
and the more you're used to it the less
likely you'll think
to set it aside for special attention
something to consider
