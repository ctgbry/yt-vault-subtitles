I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the most
common male sexual strategy this episode
is going to be a little different
because it is a sponsored episode I'm
going to read the email that I received
from this particular listener and then
kind of Riff Off of My ideas contained
therein so let's jump right into it this
one comes from Daniel C and it reads
hi Ryan so I've noticed that a lot of
your advice is geared towards dating EG
finding the right woman to have an
effortless relationship walking away if
necessary what is the advice that you
would have for somebody like myself who
has already been married for 12 years
with two kids and who has spent the
first 37 years of their life doing the
exact opposite of what an attractive man
should be doing such as engaging the
wife through logic being the adore and
putting her on the pedestal allowing her
to Captain our relationship negotiating

[01:01]
to Captain our relationship negotiating
sex through overt and covert contracts
being a people pleaser an all-around
nice guy who's an introvert and not very
exciting or charming to boot
um tragically for the first 37 years of
my life I thought I was right and that
my wife was wrong for not seeing things
my way
as such my Beta or Nice Guy behaviors
are deeply ingrained in my subconscious
that'll happen this new world of
psychology emotions game and passion is
overwhelming and I'm not quite sure
where to begin what are the baby steps
that I need to take and the mindset that
I should have going forward is my
relationship a lost cause will I be able
to change my wife's impression of me
eventually
guards all right so
this is a very common story that I hear
from men both in my therapeutic practice
and among those I do consultations with
the way I'm going to summarize it is
that they have realized
already in a pre-existing relationship

[02:01]
already in a pre-existing relationship
that their strategies for maintaining
attraction from their woman are
unsustainable and this is because they
utilized
what is unfortunately the most common
male sexual strategy that does not
produce long-standing results in
heterosexual relationships let me
explain what that is first then I'll
talk about whether it's possible to
change it is but not with a great deal
of effort unfortunately so
if you haven't done so already check out
my episode on the sexual Marketplace in
which I describe the sexual Marketplace
as sort of like a dock where there are
men who are selling their services as
ship captains and women who are going
around and sort of checking out the
vessels and the itineraries of all the
various offerings and if a woman likes
the ship in the itinerary of a
particular Captain she can get on that

[03:00]
particular Captain she can get on that
boat and the two of them can ride off
into the horizon
now that's
so the most common way that men attempt
to attract women down at the sexual
Marketplace
is to advertise their ship as a means
to the woman's end
basically the man is saying hey if you
get on this boat I'll take you where you
want to go
so A boat like this we call a ferry
which is basically like a water taxi
you're hiring this ship to go towards
your destination
do you understand and there are many
women who find that proposition
attractive great
if I go with this person I can get there
faster safer and more reliably and he's
willing to take me where I want to go
this sounds not like too bad of a deal

[04:01]
this sounds not like too bad of a deal
to me
now here's the thing a lot of guys don't
actually want to be fairy captains
they're using this as a strategy to get
the woman on the boat the issue is you
can't really ever stop being a fairy
Captain imagine that you were like
taking a a cap and you took that cab for
12 years and that driver took you where
you wanted to go hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of times
if one day you got in that cab and the
guy turned around and said hey you know
I've been taking you to your destination
for the last 12 years I was kind of
wondering if maybe we could switch roles
and you could get up here in the
driver's seat and take me to where I
want to go for a change
you're gonna get the [ __ ] out of that
cab because that's not the point of a
cab not ever there is never a point in
the cab fairy relationship in which the

[05:02]
the cab fairy relationship in which the
cab driver gets to stop being the driver
of the passenger's destination do you
understand
um that's not what that woman signed up
for and I can understand
her potential indignation at the offer
because it's almost like is is this like
a fake cab that's not how cabs operate
and that's how you advertised yourself
you made it clear that you wanted to
take me where I wanted to go and that's
why I got on your ship dude
um I'm didn't sign up for switching
roles here
so be if you found yourself in this
situation it's a it's kind of a a decent
way to get your foot in the door
um but it creates this long-term trap
because you can't ever really deviate
from that role do you understand
so

[06:01]
so
it's possible to change the dynamic but
it takes a lot of intention and patience
why is that
if you want to change a behavior within
your relationship especially that
behavior has been long standing and is
associated with some sort of
reinforcement and reward to the other
party
what you'll experience when you try to
do that is what's called an Extinction
burst it happened in the little
metaphorical story I gave where the
where you were like what give me the
[ __ ] out of this cab this is not what I
signed up for that's an Extinction burst
if you try to mess with somebody's
reward protocols
um it's not going to go over well and an
Extinction burst is an intensification
of the exact Behavior you're trying to
extinguish as a means of trying to put

[07:00]
extinguish as a means of trying to put
more
um
influence on maintaining the status quo
so it's very very hard to break out of
the status quo because when most people
attempt to change they experience this
ex Extinction burst which can be really
overwhelming and chaotic
and a lot of guys unfortunately then
just say oh okay it's not worth it if
this is going to be the outcome and they
go back to whatever they were doing
before it's almost like the woman kind
of used her emotions to bully the guy
back in the fairy role which is what he
signed up for to begin with
do you understand so you really can't go
about trying to change your relationship
until you are very prepared to weather
the emotional storm that is almost
certainly going to result from changing
the reinforcement Protocols of that

[08:00]
the reinforcement Protocols of that
relationship
but if you're willing to do that you
begin by targeting very specific
behaviors and you do this intentionally
ideally with a therapist or a coach
because you might not really know
what is a more effective Behavior if you
have been doing this for the last 12 or
37 years of your life
um and to Target kind of one thing at a
time you definitely do not sit down with
the woman and say I am going to be
making some changes I'm going to be
reinforcing this behavior I'm going to
be not reinforcing this behavior and I'd
I'd like this to be the result
you that's not going to work so instead
you focus simply on changing how you
show up in the relationship
and that's going to force some kind of
change in your system
because in a system it's not possible
for one part to change without sort of
influencing some kind of a change in the
other parts with which it is commingled

[09:02]
other parts with which it is commingled
the issue is we don't know exactly what
that change is going to be so it is a
bit risky the upshot here is that it's
possible to change a long-standing
dynamic within a relationship but it's
always always always better
to start a new relationship
with the end in mind
because if you do kind of a bait and
switch thing to use the strategy of I'll
take you where I want to go to get the
woman on your boat hoping that further
down the line you can have some sort of
reciprocity
that's not going to work you should
start from the very beginning
practicing with that particular woman
the relationship you would like to have
with her in 12 years
