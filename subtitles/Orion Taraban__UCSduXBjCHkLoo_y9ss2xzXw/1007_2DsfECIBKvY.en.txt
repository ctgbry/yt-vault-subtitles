In case you've been living under a rock,
incel is short for involuntarily
celibate. Basically, an incel is a man
who wants to have sex but can't seem to
find a willing participant. While I
don't think the term was originally
derogatory, it's definitely used as a
porative today, especially by women. In
fact, it seems as though every man women
disagree with these days is either an
incel or a misogynist, or both. I
suppose they might not be mutually
exclusive. In any case, it's generally
not meant as a compliment. I must admit
that I find the use of this term incel
absolutely baffling as an insult, and it
really only takes a little bit of effort
to understand why. While it's clearly
the case that some men are more
attractive than others, no man who has
ever existed has been universally

of gods being turned down by mortal
women. And this means that every man
irrespective of how handsome or famous
or powerful or charming he might be has
been frustrated in his sexual desire at
some point in his life. Even the most
successful kasanovas don't bat a
thousand 100% of the time. In fact, if
there is a single experience that binds
together all men of all cultures, it is
having one's sexual interest rebuffed.
And in that moment, that man is an
incel. He wants to have sex, but he
doesn't have a willing partner. While
unattractive men might experience this
more frequently, even the most
attractive men cannot have sex whenever
they want, however they want, with
whomever they want. If such a thing is
possible, it is a privilege that only
beautiful women enjoy.
