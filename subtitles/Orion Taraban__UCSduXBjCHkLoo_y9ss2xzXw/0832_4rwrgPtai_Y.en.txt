I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
Easter egg hunt as I've mentioned
repeatedly on this channel women are
doing very well in today's day and age
they live longer than men they
outperform men in most academic metrics
they out earn men when they're childless
in many Urban centers yay
women that said it's interesting to note
that these relatively recent successes
have occurred in a very particular
cultural moment characterized by
strategies and tactics that specifically
seek to advance women's interests now
it's probably not possible to determine
the extent to which these strategies are
responsible for women's success and the
extent to which women have succeeded on
their own merits but it's precisely this
uncertainty that casts a PA of Suspicion
on women's recent achievement ments are

[01:01]
on women's recent achievement ments are
these successes due to women's efforts
in the relevant games or to their
efforts in the cultural metagame almost
certainly It's a combination of both but
the exact proportion remains an open
question in any case today I'd like to
bring some of those strategies and
tactics to light and to do so I'd like
to share a story from my own life
because I think it might illustrate in a
small and silly way what might be going
on on a grand
scale this is the story of the Easter
egg hunt and it goes like
this when I was a boy every year my
mother would plan an Easter egg hunt for
me and my younger sister and every year
without fail I would absolutely demolish
my sister with respect to the number of
eggs I could find like it was never even
close and of course this made sense I
was bigger so I could get to more out of

[02:02]
was bigger so I could get to more out of
the reach places I was faster so I could
cover more ground more quickly and I was
older so I had more experience with
respect to where my mother liked to hide
the eggs given the circumstances it
would have been functionally impossible
for my sister to win a hunt like we
could have run that test 10,000 times
and I would have won 10,000 times it was
a foregone conclusion
and this wouldn't have been an issue if
it weren't for the fact that somehow my
smaller slower younger sister believed
that she should win and every year when
she didn't win she would cry and sulk
and otherwise make things difficult in
the
household as a result no one except me
was particularly pleased when I won and
everyone except me was displeased when

[03:01]
everyone except me was displeased when
my sister
didn't one Easter when I was probably
around 10 years old I was gearing up for
another easy Victory as I made my way
around the house I went into the pantry
to grab an egg or two and to my surprise
my mother came in after me shut the door
and blocked me in my confused expression
motivated her to get right to the point
honey she said couldn't she let your
sister win this
year I was a
guas my mother my own mother had just
suggested that I take a dive that I fall
on my own sword this was not the spirit
of competition what happened to May the
best man win the person who can get the
most eggs should get the most eggs right
otherwise the outcome is just a sham and
the contest is meaningless I responded
that she can win if she can collect more
eggs than me

[04:00]
eggs than me
this did not satisfy my mother she then
implemented what I've since recognized
to be a predictable progression of
tactics to get me to change my mind
first she tried
pity your sister never wins and you've
won every single time she's going to cry
and pout can't you give her at least one
little Victory I think it would be so
nice and I know it would make her very
happy and I probably responded with
something like like well that doesn't
sound very nice to me could you move out
of my way now when pity didn't work she
tried
shame don't you think you're a little
old for Easter egg hunts anyway a good
brother would want to help his sister
don't you care about her feelings and I
remember thinking to myself this is a
contest there are winners and losers
what are her feelings have to do with
anything and I probably responded with
something like I could share some of my
candy with her but if I find that candy

[05:02]
candy with her but if I find that candy
it's mine to share or not share as I see
fit and when this didn't work she got
upset you know if this is how you're
going to behave maybe this is the last
year that we do this I don't think the
competition is very healthy for you and
of course because I could win and my
sister couldn't canceling the hunt would
be tantamount to taking away something
that was functionally mine and I
probably responded with something like
then I better make this one count and I
squeezed past my mother and left the
pantry even at that age I was pretty
good at resisting emotional manipulation
because in that house I had a lot of
opportunities to do so in any case the
foregone conclusion happened yet again
even despite the handicap I collected
more eggs than my sister and once again
my sister made things difficult for
everyone I think that was the last year
we had an Easter egg hunt we just got
got baskets of candy from that year

[06:01]
got baskets of candy from that year
onward I think about that conversation
in the pantry with my mother from time
to time in retrospect I can understand
why she would want her daughter to win
but I felt betrayed that she didn't seem
to care that that would mean that her
son would have to
lose ultimately it was clear that my
mother didn't see the hunt as a contest
of Merit like I did keeping the peace
and achieving certain outcomes was more
important than fa and honest competition
after all it's just a bunch of plastic
eggs who really cares
anyway if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice

[07:01]
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook Audi book and
paperback formats the links are in the
description now let's return to the
broader topic under consideration we
don't like to admit it but many things
in life really are zero sum games for my
sister to win I would have to lose for
there to be more female CEOs there would
need to be fewer male CEOs why well
there are a limited number of positions
for a woman to be promoted they would
need to pass over a man for there to be
more female doctors there would need to
be fewer male doctors why well doctors
come from medical schools and medical
schools only admit so many students
admit more female students and you'll
have more female doctors further down
the road for there to be more female
engineers there would need to be fewer

[08:00]
engineers there would need to be fewer
male Engineers why well those tech
companies have limits to their headcount
to hire more women they'll have to hire
fewer men etc etc this is an inescapable
feature of reality most games for
specific goods are zero
sum and I think it's no coincidence that
the significant improvements in women's
outcomes in recent years have taken
place in a cultural moment characterized
by the widespread use of the same
tactics my mother used on me in the
pantry first there is pity especially in
the context of History men have had all
the power and all the wealth for
centuries isn't it about time that women
had their chance and if that doesn't
work there's shame a real man isn't so
fragile that a woman earning more than
him would damage his ego a good man
supports women and celebrates their
victories and if that doesn't work

[09:01]
victories and if that doesn't work
there's always outrage male success is
evidence of a sexist patriarchal system
that must be dismantled and any man who
questions the advancement of women's
interests is an incel and a
misogynist pity shame anger pity shame
anger PSA these are the metagame
strategies that dominate the cultural
moment in which women's victories have
occurred and I'd like to submit that
this is unfair that is that it's unfair
to women it's unfair to women because it
like puts a little asterisk next to
their victories are there
accomplishments due to the fact that
they are doing so well or because men
are doing so poorly a lot of guys aren't
willing or able to stand up to the
consequences of resisting this kind of
emotional manipulation indeed a lot of
them aren't even aware that it's
happening they're trapped in the pantry

[10:00]
happening they're trapped in the pantry
often from a very young age where they
are on the receiving end of these PSA
tactics not once not twice but hundreds
and hundreds of times by the time
they're adolescence they fold under the
pity they fold under the shame and they
fold under the outrage and when they do
they create an opportunity for women to
advance in the context of zero some
games now Orion are you saying that
women can't succeed on their own merits
not at all I know many intelligent
hardworking kind women who are very
capable in their positions of authority
women can and do beat men in
head-to-head competitions of skill and
ability what I am saying is that there
is no way my younger sister could ever
have found more eggs than me perhaps if
I had an older sister who was bigger
faster and more experienced than I was
she would have had chance but as things

[11:01]
she would have had chance but as things
stood my sister couldn't possibly have
won if she could have why would those
tactics have been
necessary but that of course begs a
question if the situation were reversed
and my sister were undefeated in the
hunt would my mother have tried to get
her to let me
win we can't say for sure because it's a
hypothetical scenario but I kind of
think not
after all I've never heard of anyone
systematically attacking the fairness of
any domain in which women enjoy an
advantage and there are many such
domains and I would be more likely to
train harder than throw a tantrum if I
lost so fewer people would be distressed
by my defeat after all I don't think my
mother really wanted my sister to win
she just didn't want to deal with the
consequences when she

[12:00]
consequences when she
lost what do you think does this fit
