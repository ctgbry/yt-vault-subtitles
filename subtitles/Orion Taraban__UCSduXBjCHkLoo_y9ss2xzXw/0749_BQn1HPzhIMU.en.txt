I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is all women
play Blackjack so this is an episode for
the young men out there if you're a
young man in the dating pool you're
probably dealing with women in their 20s
and early 30s and this talk will help
you understand a lot of what might
otherwise be very perplexing female
Behavior which I'm sure you've observed
by now
so let's get to it the truth is that all
women play Blackjack what does this mean
well in the game of blackjack players
are trying to get the sum of their cards
values as close to 21 as possible
without going over and this means each
new card they acquire is a risk it could
safely bring them closer to 21 which is
good or it could push them over the edge
into busting

[01:00]
into busting
which is bad well it's possible to hit
21 on your initial cards that's called a
blackjack this is relatively rare most
people start out with a sum that is less
than 21 and they have to make a decision
as to whether to hit that is to acquire
another card or to stand that is to
settle for their current value and the
decision to do this is based not not
only on the value of the cards held by
the player but also on the value of the
card the dealer is showing both pieces
of information are essential to making
an informed decision to be effective a
player can't make a decision based on
just one of these data sources in
isolation and based on this information
people can make more rational decisions
about how to act given the balance of
probabilities in effect make sense

[02:00]
probabilities in effect make sense
now the same thing is happening with
women in the sexual Marketplace we don't
like to say it many won't even admit it
but all women understand something about
men namely a big part of why men give
them attention and pursue them for
sexual relationships is because they are
physically attractive and that physical
attractiveness diminishes with time
until the point when it becomes
increasingly difficult though not
technically impossible to secure the
type of relationship she would prefer
with the man she would prefer to have it
with that's busting she waited too long
or refused to settle and now she's over
21 now some women really don't like
hearing this they'll contend that the
issue isn't with their decision-making
but with the superficiality of men's
desire which inordinately cares about
how they look and hey no arguments here
that is super superficial however as

[03:01]
that is super superficial however as
I've previously discussed that
superficiality may obscure some
surprising depths and in any case it's
not going anywhere anytime
soon on the other hand other women
accept the rules of the game
irrespective of whether they approve of
them and do their best to play as
effectively as possible these women are
actively trying to secure the most
favorable relationship terms they can
with the most attractive men they can
access before they bust and they do this
by considering the information contained
in the cards in their hand which is
potentially you the man they are
currently dating and the information
conveyed by the Dealer's show card which
is the other men she could potentially
access for a relationship she'll use
information from both sources to
determine whether to hit or to
stand now sometimes this decision is

[04:00]
stand now sometimes this decision is
very simple when you're holding a 20
against a five you stand and when you're
holding a four against a 10 you hit
however in many cases it's not so easy
to decide what to do especially if
you're not surrendering to a rational
strategy of action and most people do
not have and shudder at the possibility
of having a rational strategy of action
when it comes to dating they'd prefer to
make decisions based on how they feel
feel and these feelings can be very
conflicted in certain
circumstances it can be hard to stand
because standing is settling by
definition when you settle you could do
better however you won't be able to know
how much better and on what timeline by
the same token it can be hard to hit
because hitting is risky in any
ambiguous case that is in any case in

[05:00]
ambiguous case that is in any case in
which there is a real decision to make
hitting could jeopardize the entire
Endeavor in wanting more you end up with
nothing and these are non-trivial
consequences when it's your money on the
felt if you're interested in taking your
understanding to the next level I would

hope to see you
aboard so why is all this important for
young men to keep in mind in the first
place it will help you to appreciate
that it's not always about you like it's
only

[06:00]
only
partly about you you can hold a solid
hand but if the show card is stronger
then that's going to motivate hitting
not standing by the same token your hand
might be relatively weak but if the show
card is even weaker then that's going to
motivate standing not hitting the point
is that only so much depends on you and
only so much is in your control here it
also suggests that one of the best
things you can do to improve the
likelihood a woman is going to stand
irrespective of the cards you're holding
is to seek out contexts in which you can
be a contextual Alpha when you're one of
the most attractive options in a woman's
social milu this is tantamount to
playing against a weak show card you're
going to look good by comparison and
this of course also explains some of the
mate guarding behaviors that both sexes
Implement to maintain a relationship
they've already secured the introduction

[07:00]
they've already secured the introduction
of more attractive options will increase
the likelihood of hitting though this
likelihood will be mitigated if your
hold cards are high enough finally it
helps to explain some of the more
baffling and frustrating female dating
Behavior the flakiness the unpredictable
interest the
impulsiveness in the game of blackjack
the most difficult decision to be in the
most difficult decision to make is when
you're holding 16 and the dealer is
showing
10 the Dealer's down card is more likely
to beat your 16 than not but you're more
likely to bust if you hit than not even
players who are trying to implement
perfect strategy can make an emotional
decision here because it's hard to hit
when the odds are against you even if
it's the logical thing to
do just like the blackjack player the
woman is going back and forth back and

[08:00]
woman is going back and forth back and
forth should I hit or should I stand
should I settle or should I wait for
something better you can understand the
probabilities but that still won't tell
you what will actually happen this
vacillation indicates that she likely
finds you attractive which is good but
not attractive enough to sufficiently
reassure her that she won't find someone
better before it's too
late which is not so good
if she thought you were either more or
less attractive than she currently does
you wouldn't be dealing with as much of
this infuriating Behavior as a man you
have to focus on what's in your control
namely improving your value proposition
increasing the value of your hold cards
and creating opportunities to be a
contextual Alpha playing against weaker
show cards and the good news is as long
as you don't muck anything up you'll
typically get better at both as a

[09:00]
typically get better at both as a
function of time you'll know that you're
making progress because women won't be
exhibiting this kind of vacillation
which should indicate that they're
seeing you as a much safer
