i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
humility is knowing your proper size
you know i grew up with the impression
that humility meant to be very very low
self-effacing and potentially even
groveling in relation to other people or
the mystery of the universe
and i've since evolved my understanding
of this idea
i now believe that humility is knowing
one's proper size
now one of the paradoxes of the human
experience is that we are both very very
big and very very small
at the same time
we certainly know most of us that we are
very very small
the universe is
incomprehensibly vast billions of light
years across
and we are from this point of view
simply floating on a speck in an
unremarkable corner of a galaxy caroming
through a near infinite void

[01:00]
through a near infinite void
it's hard to believe your existence
matters at all when you zoom out to that
perspective
by the same token we are also very very
large
each one of us is comprised of trillions
and trillions of cells and organisms
and in you
lies the ancestral history of millions
of years of evolution stretching all the
way back to the dawn of life itself you
are composed of the ejecta of supernova
which means that you are literally star
stuff
and you can be very very very important
to some of the people close to you
while remaining completely unknown to
the vast majority of humanity so this is
the paradox of the human experience you
are both very very big
and very very small very very important
and very very inconsequential at the
same time
now usually when we talk about people
needing to embrace humility
it's typically in relation to folks that

[02:00]
it's typically in relation to folks that
we would like to see taken down a peg
you know they seem to be a little too
big for their britches a little too full
of themselves
a little more self-important than they
actually are and that certainly happens
there are people out there who don't
seem to have taken that zoomed out view
of the universe in quite some time
however after 10 years of talking to
people as a therapist
i've discovered that people thinking
they're bigger than they really are
is actually a much less common problem
than people thinking that they're
smaller than they really are
most people aim for very modest goals
and often don't even believe themselves
capable of achieving these
these folks don't come anywhere
close to realizing their full potential
and they significantly underestimate the
value of their existence in many
respects it's
more dangerous to err on the side of
believing you are too small than on the
side of believing you are too big
the truth is

[03:01]
the truth is
you have the capacity and the potential
to become and achieve immeasurably more
than you currently are and do
something to consider
