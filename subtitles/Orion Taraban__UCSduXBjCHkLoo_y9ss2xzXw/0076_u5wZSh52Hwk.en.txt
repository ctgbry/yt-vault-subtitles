i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the next right move
so sometimes folks can get a little
overwhelmed by the apparent scope of a
problem it's very important to restrict
the aperture of our attention to the
smallest diameter that still
circumscribes the problem in question
otherwise we can very easily become
overwhelmed by the prospect of action
so for example sometimes people can get
into a tizzy trying to figure out the
problem of the rest of their lives you
know what am i doing with my life
the issue here is that the scope of that
problem is so broad and so vast that it
becomes very difficult to move in any
direction with any sort of confidence if
that's how the problem is defined
so rather than conceptualize the problem
in its entirety it's often a better idea
to restrict your attention to the next

[01:00]
to restrict your attention to the next
right move that you believe stands a
good chance of moving you incrementally
toward your goal today
there's generally no need to plan how to
get all the way to the end before you
take the first step
and this is good because it wouldn't
even be possible to do so in the event
of necessity i mean we can barely
predict the weather with any reasonable
degree of accuracy a week in advance
it's just such a complex phenomenon
now imagine having to forecast who you
will be and what your life will be like
decades from now it's just not possible
instead focus on the next right move
that you can bring you a little bit
closer to your goal
in the time it takes you to make that
move the world will have changed
both as a result of your action
and as a consequence of a trillion other
independent events the game board will
have shifted and it will have shifted in
ways that you couldn't possibly have
anticipated in their entirety

[02:02]
anticipated in their entirety
at that point the next right move will
be based on configurations that didn't
even exist a move ago
which means that sometimes planning even
two moves ahead is a wasted exercise
in this way focusing on the next right
move allows us to remain committed to
our goals and flexible in our means
the combination of which dramatically
increases our likelihood of success
attending to the next right move also
facilitates action
if the aperture of your focus is
restricted to what you can do today to
move the needle forward
then you will utilize what is more or
less immediately available to you and
this is important because as i've
discussed in another episode it's
essential that you begin where you're at
really because there's literally no
other place you could start
when you focus on the next right move
the revealed possibilities are therefore
more likely to be actionable

[03:01]
more likely to be actionable
and you make progress toward a goal by
chaining together actual actions not
theoretical plans but actual actions
so this mindset will accelerate your
growth irrespective of your chosen path
