i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
bet on yourself
i heard this phrase recently from one of
my clients and it really resonated with
me the moment i heard it the phrase
immediately made me think of the
baseball great pete rose for those who
don't know
pete rose holds the all-time major
league baseball record for total hits he
has more hits than any other player in
the history of major league baseball
he also won three world series
championships with the cincinnati reds
and went on to manage the team for
several years i mean extremely
impressive guy
however pete has also since been
permanently banned from baseball
in the baseball hall of fame where he
very likely belongs
because he was betting on his games
while acting as manager
that said pete's defense to these
charges is and has always been that he

[01:02]
charges is and has always been that he
only ever bet on the reds to win
now if he had ever been on the reds to
lose there would have been an obvious
conflict of interest with the
possibility that he would have tried to
throw some of his games in order to make
some extra cash
but by betting on the reds to win
his goals as an individual gambler and
as a team manager were aligned
if anything his wagers might have
incentivized him to be an even better
manager for his players
i like this phrase to bet on yourself
for two reasons
first
when we bet on when you bet on yourself
you demonstrate at least to yourself and
that's no small thing
that you are confident in your own
eventual success it's like all things
being equal i think i can do it i
believe that i can win
that's important
if you don't think you can do it
why the heck would anybody else think
you could do it you at the very least

[02:00]
you could do it you at the very least
have to think that you can do it
the second reason why i like this phrase
is that it incentivizes successful
action
when you bet on yourself you have some
skin in the game this could look like
signing up for that course on business
development or moving to a new city or
running for elective offices elected
office when you do these things you're
basically saying i've got some money on
the felt now so i'm even more focused on
and motivated toward a successful
outcome
betting on yourself i think it's a
really useful idea
