i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
people are as happy as they choose to be
happiness is a choice
it's based on an internal turning toward
reality as enough
so when we decide to predicate our
happiness on external conditions
three things happen
we disempower ourselves
we rob ourselves of the potential for
joy in that present moment and we enter
into games of control
why is this true
first if you believe that your happiness
depends on external conditions whatever
they may be
then you are complicit in enshrining
those conditions as masters over you and
as your masters they will now be capable
of either providing or withholding what
you desire which is a very disempowering
position to be in
and this position can cause people to
act in desperate or degrading ways it's
not something that you want
second

second
it robs you of the potential inherent in
the present moment
the core component of happiness is
contentment
which is a turning toward the present
moment as enough that's it
that's all that's required to be content
and that makes sense think about it
if you needed certain external things in
order to be happy then happiness as an
experience would have been inherently
impossible throughout the vast majority
of human history when those external
things simply did not yet exist
if happiness were predicated on external
circumstances then the vast majority of
human beings even today would not be
capable
of being happy and that's not the world
i observe
and finally
it forces you to enter into games of
control
if you believe that your happiness
depends on external conditions well
then you're going to do all that you can
to make external reality which generally
involves other people conform to your
preferences

[02:00]
preferences
and this is something that is both
expensive and ineffective
it's kind of like making water flow
upstream you can do it
but it takes a lot of energy
so it's generally more effective to work
with the current of the river than it is
to work against it
instead you can choose to approach
happiness by turning toward the present
moment as enough
