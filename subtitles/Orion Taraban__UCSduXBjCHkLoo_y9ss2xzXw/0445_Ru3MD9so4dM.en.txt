I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is
psychack's Better Living Through
psychology and the topic of today's
short talk is why marriage kills sex
so I'll start off by saying that by
marriage I don't necessarily mean the
legal institution of marriage because
this will happen in long-term committed
relationships especially cohabitating
relationships so I'm using the term
marriage in this more dilated sense and
it seems to be the case that the organic
tendency in relationships is for the
frequency and intensity of sex to
decline as a function of time there are
things you can do to prevent or mitigate
this tendency but doing nothing
generally produces outcomes in this
direction
and while I will give you some
actionable though counter-intuitive
advice on how to prevent this from
occurring in your own relationship
we first have to spend some time
understanding why this cooling tendency
occurs in the first place

[01:01]
occurs in the first place
now there are many reasons why this
happens because sex is actually a really
complicated activity it's not just about
making babies and hedonic pleasure there
are lots of things that sex does in
human relationships and one of the most
important things that it does is
facilitate emotional bonding
this is largely due to the fact that
certain sexual behaviors like nipple
stimulation in women and orgasm in men
are associated with increased levels of
oxytocin the hormone that facilitates
emotional bonding the higher the
oxytocin levels the stronger the bond
this is why sex is typically so hot and
heavy in the early stages of the
courtship process at this stage of the
relationship neither party has any
legitimate claim on the other and so
neither can reasonably expect to see
that person ever again

[02:00]
that person ever again
this creates a lot of uncertainty and
insecurity especially when there are
high levels of Attraction which
stimulate the impulse to solidify the
emotional bond basically when early
couples have sex they're functionally
saying with their bodies I want you to
come back
and the stronger the bond the more
likely the person will return
now this situation changes dramatically
over time once a relationship has been
defined and a commitment has been
secured and a mutual lifestyle
established the idea that the other
person is just going to up and leave
becomes less and less of a probability
in fact there is no need to wonder
whether someone is going to come back if
they never leave in the first place
the relationship becomes more secure but
in so doing the other person becomes a
sure thing and once this happens one of
the primary functions of sex the

[03:00]
the primary functions of sex the
establishment of an emotional bond
becomes irrelevant and redundant
there is no necessity to create Security
in completely secure relationships it's
just not needed and because it's not
needed it's very hard in some cases to
arouse an authentic desire for it few
people crave food when they're not
hungry
on the whole people have trouble
tolerating uncertainty and insecurity
especially with people they're attracted
to and this anxiety motivates people to
reduce that uncertainty and insecurity
in their relationships as much and as
quickly as possible and sex is one great
way to do that
the issue is that no one gets aroused by
security and stability
to keep desire alive in committed
relationships we need to have a greater
Collective tolerance for uncertainty and
insecurity because it's in that space

[04:01]
insecurity because it's in that space
that the necessity for sex as a bonding
agent remains Evergreen

I rely on your support to make all this
happen and I really appreciate it thank
you
okay so how do we go about solving this
problem well there are many potential
solutions to this problem and what I'm
going to recommend might not work for
everyone in all cases however you might
have to appreciate the fact that if you
could have solved the problem by now you
would have solved the problem by now so
the solution you seek will likely be
found in a place you haven't looked yet
and while I'm not going to encourage

[05:01]
and while I'm not going to encourage
anyone in the situation to have an
affair
I am going to suggest that they act as
if they were having one
that's my suggestion act as if you were
having an affair
stick with me while I break down why
this works let's just imagine for a
second that you were having an affair
what kinds of things would you be doing
well you might be a bit more withdrawn
at home you might be a little more
secretive after all you now have
something to hide you might be deviating
from your routine leaving the house at
odd hours or going places you wouldn't
ordinarily go
you might be less communicative and
available like you wouldn't answer a
call or respond to a text right away if
you were with your lover and you might
be less needy or demanding about getting
sex in your primary relationship because
you're now getting it on the side all
these things seem like plausible
indicators of an affair right like if
your partner changed in all of these

[06:01]
your partner changed in all of these
ways all of a sudden wouldn't you
suspect cheating and what kind of
feelings would that suspicion arouse
again I'm not advising people to go out
and cheat on their spouses but
everything that goes with cheating
the space the mystery the novelty the
freedom the risk the elusiveness is
really good at maintaining sexual
interest
stop asking permission
do something different without telling
your partner
carve some space for yourself that
doesn't involve the other person resist
the urge to communicate throughout the
day
break out of your routines and
simultaneously pull back on pursuing sex
in your primary relationship give your
partner the opportunity the gift of
wondering about you
of feeling your absence of missing your
presence
after all you can't connect with someone
if you never disengage

[07:02]
if you never disengage
the idea here is to cultivate a sense of
the unknown in explored territory with
long-term Partners it's easy to fall
into the fallacy that you know
everything about them
that's because you've heard all their
stories sometimes many many times over
and you might be in constant
communication throughout the day so when
you actually come together in the
evening you might suffer from the belief
that they're a completely known entity
which won't Inspire any interest let
alone curiosity
by being spontaneous unpredictable and
dare I say it selfish
you cultivate an island of novelty in
the midst of a well-known Sea by
disrupting my expectations I pay
attention
in paying attention I notice a change
in noticing a change I become curious
and in frustrating my curiosity I become
interested
that interest motivates me to close the

[08:02]
that interest motivates me to close the
distance that you intentionally created
and to confirm a bond that you
intentionally made just slightly more
tenuous
throw in the suspicion of another woman
or another man and voila you've got
yourself a recipe for passion
some of you may think this is game
playing but remember
we like to play games
we play games for fun
so if your relationship feels like a
joyless obligation or a boring routine
or a neutered friendship
you might consider injecting some play
into your situation and one way to do
that is to act as if you were having an
affair humans are weird and we don't
always make sense something to consider
