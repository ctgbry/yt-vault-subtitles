i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology the
subject of today's
short video is cut the main line
so what does that mean that means that
in general if you're looking to change
your behavior in some way i want to
start doing this
i want to stop doing that
it's generally preferable that rather
than try to find
eight nine ten new good things that
you could be doing to further your
growth
that you really examine your behavior
and you stop doing the one or two things
that are
really holding you back you'll make
much faster more significant
progress this way than trying to build a
multitude of positive habits
that might ultimately be counteracted by
the perseverance of the negative things

[01:00]
the perseverance of the negative things
that are sabotaging your progress
like one of the things that i i am
approached
frequently about from with clients has
to do with anxiety
and sometimes these folks want to learn
a whole bunch of new behaviors to deal
with their anxiety they want to learn
about mindfulness and they want to learn
about cognitive restructuring and they
want to do exposure therapy and it's
like okay
but then it comes out that they're like
you know
two bottles of wine every night which
when they recover from it in the morning
sends their sympathetic nervous system
into overdrive because alcohol is a
neurodepressant
which creates the somatic experience of
anxiety so
like they're putting liquid anxiety into
their bodies
every single day and rather than examine
that behavior that's that's really
putting fuel on the fire of their
anxiety
they want to on some level keep doing
that but
to to practice these other behaviors
which at best are going to be band-aid
solutions

[02:00]
solutions
in sort of dealing with or lessening the
impact of the symptoms
of what might be the the main line
behavior issue which in this case in
this identical example would be the
alcohol abuse so um
and you don't really need a therapist to
tell you these things to be honest it's
like
if we really are truthful with
themselves
the vast majority of us know we know in
our heart of hearts
the one or two things that are really
getting in our way
and sometimes we bend over backwards and
twist our minds and our bodies and our
lives into all kinds of
unnatural shapes in order to avoid the
simplicity of that
of that state of affairs which is that
they're we generally know
the one or two things that are really
subject to tripping us
up so rather than try to kind of
accommodate
those the existence of those things in
our lives by kind of
creating more behaviors that that make

[03:00]
creating more behaviors that that make
it easier to live with those things
attack those behaviors directly they can
be the target of behavioral change just
as much as
these other more positive behaviors not
that those things don't have a place
but they generally come a little bit
later to make a
habit a bit more ingrained
so better to cut the main line of the
problem first
so please like and subscribe we'll talk
more in future episodes thank you
