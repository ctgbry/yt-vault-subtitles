[00:00]
and the other one that I think really
impacts the dating scene is the idea of
like the Superwoman or the girl boss
that she can do everything that she has
the um the high-powered job and she can
have the husband and kids and
um
that that
uh that letting go of any of those
criteria is on some level a
mission that she couldn't hack it that
she didn't have the right stuff to be
like the super Wonder Woman does that
make sense right yeah absolutely
well I think it it kind of boils down to
the fact that
in in I work with women all the time so
I'm not anti-women in any way shape or
form I tell them this to their face uh
the reality is
feminism
the world of feminism
is the playground for the boy if
you want to call him you know without
any real judgment you know that's what
they say so
yeah tell me the biggest losers the

[01:02]
yeah tell me the biggest losers the
biggest losers in feminism are women
they've actually lost more than anyone
and here's why I say that
because
in reality nobody really wants to work
like nobody really wants to work a job
you know people want money sure people
want the trappings of success people
want some level of Independence and
self-determination but nobody wants to
come and pledge a clock and work every
day nobody wants to do that so what
women have been sold
is that you come to work at this job
you're going to be a boss like you said
or you know you get an education and you
get take on a lot of student loan debt
um you're gonna and then at the end of
the rainbow you're gonna be a boss
you're going to be a particular guy and
you guys are going to become a Power
couple where you know you go get some
other multi-millionaire and y'all build
this empire together and you you're

[02:02]
this empire together and you you're
basically like Oprah and they're like
um Obama or something or whatever you
want to you know I over and who no one
knows who Oprah's partnered with you
know what I'm saying yeah you're Oprah
and you're not but he's not Steadman
you're Oprah and
that's kind of what women were sold for
the most part and
the reality of that is if you're in that
10 to 1 that's able to be able to
accomplish a lot of the things then as
far as your life is concerned it's going
to be pretty good yeah you might feel a
little upset about the fact that you may
not be able to find the guy that you're
looking for necessarily but you still
have the opportunity to go somewhere
else and hook up in the same way that
some of these guys do but
most women are never going to end up

[03:03]
most women are never going to end up
lawyer
Oprah
um uh actress famous you know or some of
these influencers even where it's like
oh I got millions and millions of
followers and everybody thinks I'm the
most beautiful thing in the world and I
got fans most women are never going to
experience that it's just not realistic
most people are going to be secretaries
uh LPNs
um you know this is you know these are
decent jobs not saying they're not but
it's not going to be the Glamorous boss
life that you were sold and then what
you're going to be left with in most
cases is also struggling to even find
the equivalent of yourself in a man
so now you're not going to have those
two incomes together to be able to
create a better life because when you're
young you don't want it
when you get older a lot of times

[04:01]
when you get older a lot of times
I don't want to say you've aged out of
it because it's not really true but
it's made a lot more difficult it's not
as easy as it was when you were 23 when
you were 22. it's just not
unfortunately that's what happened a lot
of times like
things don't turn out the way you
thought it would yeah you're when people
think about feminism they think about
the top
yeah I'm gonna be a boss I'm gonna be
the CEO of Facebook but
for most people it's like nah you're
more likely to be like maybe an
assistant manager at a grocery store or
something like that that's real well
that's that's interesting a couple
things I want to say about that
um my advice to women especially young
women is that they if they really do
want to be everything if they want to be
the successful corporate Warrior and
they want to have the the husband and
the kids why don't they do the husband

[05:00]
the kids why don't they do the husband
and kids part first
like absolutely like get that locked in
in their 20s when they have the best
possible chances of attracting the best
possible man because they're at their
Peak sexual Marketplace value and if
they feel like they're missing out they
could become an employee in their 30s if
they really want to but most women are
trading their 20s which is when they are
at their their Peak
um and able to let's say negotiate the
best deal for themselves for us a salary
which uh you could potentially get at
any stage in their life but it's much
much harder to get
um that that kind of commitment at other
stages
but here's the thing
well another thing I wanted to say is
um I hear what you're saying but I I
don't know if it's really going to
change anything and you know that I used
to be an actor I know you've done some
acting too I'm sure at some point
someone said to me Orion you know that
99.9 of actors don't make it it's a

[06:02]
99.9 of actors don't make it it's a
really tough profession
but that doesn't stop millions of people
from shooting their shot because
everyone secretly thinks that they have
what it takes to be that top point one
percent
and it's just like a question of when
you realize that you're not in that you
know that very small band can you get
out with acceptable loss on some level
but yeah I think everyone secretly
believes that they're going to be the
CEO that they're going to be the movie
star that they're going to be the
athlete until sometimes it's tragically
too late
but well I think that's
what you were saying there I think the
problem with that for most people like
you you were saying most people aren't
going to believe that and I understand
that completely but I think what people
often don't do is ask themselves the
question what is it that you actually
want from life
a lot of women that I talk to over the
years they they are people who are in

[07:01]
years they they are people who are in
the team in the one percent they
actually made it they are the success
story this is the best that story is
going to ever get
you know they made millions of dollars
so I was like okay if you can make
millions if you make two or three
million 10 million ain't gonna change
your life that much just the reality of
it
so there are people who I have worked
with over years who have made Millions
and they are in that they're they're the
success story but for a lot of them
they they're they're saying you know
what
the problem with this is these successes
that I've been able to accomplish
don't get me what I actually want I
wanted the power couple where I was with
a guy and he's basically what I am
but unfortunately the two three million
that I got
the you know 500 000 I make a year or
something like that whatever I'm making
for whatever reason my credentials just

[08:00]
for whatever reason my credentials just
are not adding up to me being in a
situation where I can get the my
equivalent my male equivalent I'm in a
situation where
Oprah is with Stedman
you know what I'm saying Oprah is not
with LeBron or Michael Jordan or
somebody here you know like she's like
you know it's like it it doesn't it's
not with Tom Cruise or something it
doesn't work that way most of the time
so
