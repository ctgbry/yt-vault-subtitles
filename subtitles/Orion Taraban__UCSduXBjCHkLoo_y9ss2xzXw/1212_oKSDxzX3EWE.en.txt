Are you finding that men want to have
children as much as they did in the
past?
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't think so.
&gt;&gt; I think the rates are going down.
&gt;&gt; So that's [music] why I'm asking cuz I'm
wondering
&gt;&gt; if men are wanting to have kids less and
I know women I I I know in general
people are having kids later and less
&gt;&gt; then why is that a factor still so much?
&gt;&gt; It's a great question. Well, I don't
think it necessarily needs to be, but
why would a woman want to get married?
So, in my opinion, the only reasonable
reason to get married is to start a
family. Otherwise, you can just be two
adults who enjoy spending time with each
other. Like, why do you have to get the
government involved? Why do you have to
make a contract? It's kind of weird cuz
we talk about it being like love,
&gt;&gt; but like I'm sure you love your friends,
but you never sat them down and made
them sign a document that promised that
they would never stop being your friend.
And if they did, you would be entitled
to all kinds of compensation as a
consequence of that. [laughter]

[01:00]
consequence of that. [laughter]
Like a friend who gave you that
agreement would look at you like you're
nuts and be like, "This is not a friend,
dude. We're just we're just homies."
Like what what's why do we need a
contract?
&gt;&gt; Misinterpret how much I like you.
