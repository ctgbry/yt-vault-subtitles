i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
the subject of today's short talk is
the lie of anger
i experience anger as a voice in my head
that tells me things
it tells me things like
it's gonna feel really good to do this
or
this person deserves what's coming to
them
or
i'll finally get the respect i deserve
or
my anger will terrify them into
submission
in all of these cases
in every single instance
this voice has lied to me
anger is a deceiver
it wants to trick you into surrendering
your control
it does so
by offering you the prospect of power
the feeling
of powerfulness

[01:01]
of powerfulness
the issue is that as soon as you
surrender your control
you become powerless in the face of what
provoked you
you're like a bull charging a matador's
cape you can be led exactly where the
provoker wants you to be
anger is a liar and its intention is to
deceive you
that said
anger isn't completely evil
there is righteous indignation there is
legitimate rage
but as soon as we give in to anger's
seductiveness
and surrender our self-control
then anger ceases to be our servant
becomes our master
and this is usually to our great
detriment
on the other hand
if we can yoke the power of anger to
constructive intentional action
we can often accomplish a great deal

we can often accomplish a great deal
