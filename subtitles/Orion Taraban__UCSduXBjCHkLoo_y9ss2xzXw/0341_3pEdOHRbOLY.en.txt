I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
women are making Society polygamous now
this is obviously a very provocative
title but that doesn't necessarily mean
that it isn't true and I hope to back it
up with some evidence and arguments in
this episode
I will say at the outset that I don't
think this movement is intentional that
is I don't think that women are
consciously attempting to accomplish
this purpose this is an epiphenomenon
that emerges out of the data on Mass
kind of like how a wave emerges out of
the movements of individual particles
none of which are particularly wave-like
none of the molecules has any awareness
that it is contributing to the wave but
the wave arises out of the molecules
nonetheless this is the mystery
surrounding individuals and populations
the two are obviously connected but it's
impossible to see how unless you take a

[01:01]
impossible to see how unless you take a
wide enough Vantage and of course before
I lay out my arguments please be sure to
like this episode And subscribe to this
channel it takes less than a second
costs you nothing and it's also a way
for you to be a part of something much
larger than yourself so do the thing
now to understand why this is happening
why women are making Society polygamous
you have to first understand that women
today are absolutely crushing it
well there was a gender gap that clearly
favored men 50 years ago we now have a
gender gap that clearly favors women and
in many domains the size of this gender
gap is larger than the size of the
gender gap that we had a half century
ago probably for the first time in human
history in most western societies
childless women under 30 are earning
more than childless men under 30. women
are graduating from high school from

[02:01]
are graduating from high school from
College from gross from postgraduate
institutions at a significantly higher
rate than men in fact at a nearly two to
one ratio the
very well so hooray women
that said all this success does come
with an unintended consequence with
respect to the dating market and before
the women complain well who cares about
dating
let me just say that you should care
about dating Because unless you want to
go back to your father choosing your
husband for you this is pretty much the
only Pathway to long-term relationships
marriage and children which are things I
often hear women caring about so
problems with dating will have important
Downstream consequences
so what is the unintended consequence in
order to understand it you first have to
appreciate that women tend to date
hypergamously
for those of you have never heard this
term before hypergamy is the tendency to

[03:01]
term before hypergamy is the tendency to
date across and up status hierarchies to
put it simply women want a man who is at
least as good as her if not better
and better of course is how women choose
to Define it because it's for the cat to
decide which milk is good
however with respect to some very
obvious metrics women tend to marry men
who are older taller stronger higher
status and higher earning
and here's the rub
if women are outperforming most men and
women continue to date hypergamously
then voila
you have an increasingly shrinking pool
of men that the majority of women would
even consider as candidates for dating
and mating
and that's bad for women because fewer
eligible men significantly increases the
intra-sex competition for a dwindling
pool of potential mates and it's also
bad for most men because most men are

[04:03]
bad for most men because most men are
just flat out being disqualified from
the sexual Marketplace
on the other hand if you are a top 10
percent man a top five percent man
wow is it a time to be alive and why is
that because all of these beautiful high
achieving intelligent successful women
are competing for you one of a smaller
and smaller subset of men
and the men at the top of these status
hierarchies are just having a lot of sex
with a lot of different women and this
phenomenon is accelerating at a
fantastic rate
in the last 10 years the number of
sexual partners that the average man has
had has remained the same however over
that time according to the General
Social Survey the number of men under 30
who had no sex in the past 10 years in

[05:01]
who had no sex in the past 10 years in
the past year has tripled from 10
percent to nearly 30 percent this means
that one in three one in three young men
have absolutely zero presence in the
sexual Marketplace
on the other hand only roughly one in
six went
in that age group reported the same
thing
this creates a correspondence of roughly
five women for every four men
and that assumes an even distribution
across the remaining participants which
is absolutely not the case the top
performing men are not only having more
sex with more women they're having a lot
more sex with a lot more women
what does this mean well if you put two
and two together it means that Society
is becoming increasingly polygamous in
which a smaller and smaller subset of
men are enjoying a larger share of the
sexual access to all women

[06:02]
sexual access to all women
to put that five to four ratio another
way this means that 20 percent of women
under 30 are currently in a polygamous
relationship
whether they're aware of it or not
this situation is not conscious or
intentional but the data back it up
and just to be clear this is not
something men are doing this is not
something that men are forcing on women
why well in the first place you have to
remember that more men are getting less
sex than they had 10 years ago so if
this is a conspiracy on the part of men
they're doing a really bad job of it and
in the second place women are
Gatekeepers of sex
these women are not having sex with a
smaller subset of men against their will
it's the women who are functionally
voting with their
feet
that it's either these men or no men at
all for me thanks and what's the
likelihood that any one of these top men

[07:02]
likelihood that any one of these top men
who now have historically unprecedented
sexual access to women what's the
likelihood that one of these top men is
going to exclusively commit to any one
of these women
I would say that it becomes increasingly
smaller
so this is one of the unintended
consequences of women's recent success
and what are the solutions
well we know that there are several bad
or unlikely ones including reactionary
social movements that relegate women to
traditional gender roles or asking women
to date and mate with men who are less
desirable to them
I mean neither of those things are going
to happen so to be honest the best
solution that I can come up with is to
really
support men like to support men with at
least as much Vigor and enthusiasm as we
currently support women
so that the pool of desirable men

[08:01]
so that the pool of desirable men
continues to grow rather than shrink for
many years to come
you can be the judge of How likely that
will be anytime soon
what do you think let me know your
thoughts in the comments below and thank
you for listening
