i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the force of revenge
revenge is an extremely powerful fuel
in my own personal experience
many of the periods marked by my most
aggressive growth and development came
in the wake of major setbacks or
heartbreaks
it's not very flattering to admit
but a lot of that effort was motivated
by a desire to make certain people
jealous or envious the idea was
basically i'll show them
all the people who didn't believe in me
all the people who rejected me all the
people who put me down and criticized
and mocked me i'll show them by becoming
so
unmistakably successful that they have
no choice but to admit that they were
wrong and regret their poor judgment
and i don't think that this is by any
means unique to me i think in fact that
the vast majority of high achievers are

[01:00]
the vast majority of high achievers are
motivated at least initially by a
similar force the force of revenge the
force of i'll show them
and this is not necessarily a bad thing
because it's such an explosive force
it's sometimes necessary to yoke your
will to the force of revenge to like
achieve escape velocity
to get to the stars you need a really
powerful energy dense fuel and revenge
certainly fits that bill so it can be
very useful and constructive to yoke
your will to the force of revenge in the
initial stages of a setback or rejection
however
you don't want to burn that fuel forever
why
because at a certain point maintaining a
connection to the force of revenge
becomes well
pathetic
if you're 40 years old and you're still
trying to get back at the girl who
turned you down in high school or you're
50 years old and you're still seeking
your parents approval it's not a good
look
so revenge is like a first stage rocket

[02:02]
so revenge is like a first stage rocket
fuel it helps you to achieve escape
velocity but once you've left the
gravitational field you need to find
some other means of propelling your life
forward
and ideally you want this to be a more
positive force like some sort of mission
in life like the will to serve others or
the desire to create a legacy or the
vision to marshal new ideas or new works
of art into the world or even the drive
to achieve self-transcendence and
enlightenment
these forces can be just as powerful as
the force of revenge and they don't come
with any of those dark undertones
