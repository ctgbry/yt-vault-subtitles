there are many models for masculinity
one of my personal favorites is one of
the Japanese Samurai I love archetype of
the Japanese Samurai because not only is
he strong and selfless and stoic and
long-suffering and resilient he also has
enough sensitivity to be able to write a
Haik coup about the cherry blossoms and
to be moved by the beauty of the
transient seasons and on some level it's
like yeah that's that's correct it's
like why be so strong and tough if it
means destroying the thing inside of you
that that strength and toughness was
designed to protect which unfortunately
is like the victim in so many men's
lives is they they choke off or or
completely repress that sensitivity that
should be defended and protected as much
as like women and children on some level
in traditional masculinity and by
cutting that off you you cut off a great
deal of the richness and and joy in life
and experience so I think I think that's
a really good model
