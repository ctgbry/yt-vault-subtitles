in my recent short when sober reality is
magnified mo dickens asks is it morally
wrong to be addicted to something and
this is a question that i have struggled
with for quite some time and the answer
that i've come to for myself personally
is that no it is not morally wrong to be
addicted to something i do believe
addiction creates a great deal of
unnecessary pain and suffering both for
the addict
addicts themselves and for those close
to them however it's ultimately not for
me to say how other people should live
their life if a person wants to spend
their potentially one and only life on
this planet in heroin haze or homeless
on the streets and
it's
okay i mean
they're gonna have their experience and
maybe they'll pass through it and maybe
they won't and
that will be their life
it's not a wrong way to live now it is
wrong if you have specific goals
like it's very hard to achieve certain
things if you have an act of addiction
but in the absence of those goals the
addiction itself is neither right nor
wrong
