as discussed previously across all
cultures and throughout history the man
has been expected to proposition the
woman this proposition can range from
you up to can I buy you a drink sometime
to will you marry me but it is always
the man who makes the offer to the woman
and this is peculiar because there
doesn't seem to be like a necessary
reason for this like if we can
collectively question the necessity of
pretty much every other traditional
gender role I'm not sure why this one
has survived to the present day and just
for the record I would love to be taken
out to dinner like if you want to make
all the plans and pay for everything or
if you want to invite me over for a
home-cooked meal I would be thrilled to
show up and look pretty provided of
course you are sufficiently attractive
you meet all of my criteria and you
don't assume I'm just gonna sleep with
you because that would be creepy and my
eyes are up here women don't seem
interested in occupying this
traditionally male role in the courtship
process
