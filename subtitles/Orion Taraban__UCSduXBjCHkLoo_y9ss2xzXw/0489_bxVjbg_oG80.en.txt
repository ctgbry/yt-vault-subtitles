what you have to understand is that in
the beginning you are basically a blank
slate to other people folks are going to
take a look at your physical appearance
and the way you dress and the way you
carry yourself and form some snap
judgments with respect to the kind of
person you might be and that's why first
impressions are so important however a
lot of the things that go into a first
impression can actually be proactively
addressed prior to Any Given interaction
you can give a lot of thought to your
dress and your appearance and your
carriage in advance and if you do these
kind of passively exert their influence
throughout the encounter so you can
focus on other things in the beginning
people don't know much more about you
besides that which means that in these
initial interactions what you're
primarily doing no matter what you are
ostensibly discussing is teaching people
how they should feel about you and you
do this through your nonverbals your
tone your expression your body language
your eye contact Etc and if you're like
most people you probably want whomever
you're speaking with to come away from
the interaction with a positive
impression of you
