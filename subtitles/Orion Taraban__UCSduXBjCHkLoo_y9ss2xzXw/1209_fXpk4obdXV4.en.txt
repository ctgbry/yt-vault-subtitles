If you are dating the same person over
and over and saying, "I deserve better."
Well, you don't want better. You want
what you're getting. You're getting

His first argument, I don't even know
what I did to offend him, but it was
something was his first argument says,
"I go," he goes, "I am here with 26
friends." And I look around, I go,
"Well, where are they?" And so does he.
And goes, "Oh." And then the
