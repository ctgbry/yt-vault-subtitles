I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
handle relationship
jealousy this is a subject on which I
routinely give consultations in my
private practice jealousy is an
extremely corrosive emotion I've only
felt it a couple of times in my life but
I can tell you it is my least favorite
emotion like I hated it it's a terrible
feeling so if at all possible we want to
prevent the fluoresence of this emotion
in our
relationships because a person who has
been overcome with jealousy is subject
to all kinds of destructive and
regrettable behavior so it's best to
think of jealousy like a powerful spice
just a little bit of it can make your
food more interesting but any more than
that and it will probably ruin the
dish this means that jealousy is

[01:01]
dish this means that jealousy is
something that needs to be managed and
it's your responsibility to manage your
own emotions so let's talk about how to
do that today to begin with what you
need to understand is that jealousy only
manifests in response to a perceived
romantic threat if a 300 pound
unemployed screen jockey who lives in
his parents basement slid into your
girl's DMs I don't think you'd have a
problem
you might even be able to have some fun
with it like whoa that's a fine fish you
reeled in here are you sure you want to
settle for a little old me when there's
so many more attractive options out
there in the world for you and why would
you be able to play this off so easily
because you wouldn't feel threatened by
this guy at all jealousy only manifests
in response to a perceived threat and
the perceived threat is always the same
namely the belief that the other party
might be better than you you in a

[02:00]
might be better than you you in a
self-relevant dimension of your identity
and might therefore be a better option
for your partner than you
are you might feel many things when
another man hits on your girl Amusement
disgust
bewilderment but you'll only feel
jealousy if this condition is fulfilled
the key here is to understand that this
is just your perception jealousy is a
response to a perceived threat he might
not act be a threat in reality he might
be but he might not be you understand
the issue however is that as soon as you
start to act from a place of jealousy
which usually looks like contemptuous
critical or controlling Behavior what
you're effectively doing is
communicating to your partner that you
think this other person is a better
option for her and that might change her
perception to align with yours I cannot

[03:00]
perception to align with yours I cannot
stress this enough your woman might not
see a man as a better option until you
start to express jealousy about him
that's why it's not a good idea to plant
that idea in your woman's head which is
what you essentially do when you start
behaving
jealously this means that no matter what
even if you feel that hot evil feeling
Rising inside of you you have to put on
your best poker face and express
indifference to let's say casual
interactions casual interactions are
behaviors that while potentially
slightly unusual still fall within the
range of normal behavior these could be
things like talking to someone a bit
longer than you might like at a cocktail
party or communicating with someone over
social media remember whatever you
attend to gets bigger I understand that

[04:01]
attend to gets bigger I understand that
you do not like this behavior and you
feel the need to take action to ensure
it doesn't happen again in the future
but flying into a jealous Rage or trying
to control who she can talk to and when
and under what conditions isn't going to
do that what it is going to do is make
you significantly less attractive
because when is emotional instability
ever attractive in a man well at the
same time making the other person
significantly more attractive and this
not only because you have effectively
communicated that you yourself believe
this other guy to be more attractive
than you are but also because few things
in life are more irresistible than
forbidden fruit and when you start to
control or restrict your partner's
Behavior you make the Forbidden more
attractive to her than it otherwise
would be I don't make the news I just

you're thinking of going to grad school
then check out my top R GRE study
program at Stellar g.com I rate the
whole thing you'll love the content it's
awesome check it out okay let's get back
to it all right so you don't want to do
things to destabilize your relationship
and increase your woman's attraction for
other men so what's the alternative the
alternative is to adopt the attitude
that other men make me look
good and given the General State of men
these days this unfortunately is not
actually a very high
bar other men make me look good

[06:00]
bar other men make me look good
and if you can't bring yourself to
believe that yet all right then take a
look at your life and do what you need
to do to be able to say that to yourself
with
conviction take care of your health and
your finances and your lifestyle and
make it happen because when you arrive
at that place where you can confidently
say other men make me look
good and you're going to feel all other
things being equal that you are a
woman's best option
and when you feel that way you won't
need to rely on games of manipulation or
control to keep her with you think of it
like this a man in this state is the
king and what did Kings do back in the
day when they were going to wife
somebody up they took their bride to be
around the whole Kingdom and showed her
off like a prize Pony and all the Pres
The Peasants would line up to see her
and kiss her hand and say things like
ver L the fairest blossom in all the

[07:01]
ver L the fairest blossom in all the
land and oh if only I were 20 years
younger and your eyes are fiery orbs
plucked from the fabric of the firmament
Etc and the King didn't get upset his
subjects would lowgrade flirt with his
fiance right in front of him and he just
smile and Nod his head why because he
understood that the peasant's
appreciation for her beauty was actually
a way of respect in him it was their way
of saying good choice my do you
understand and the King doesn't even
imagine getting upset because Kings know
that women don't leave Kings for
peasants because that's not how women
Operate Now does that mean that Kings
never become jealous no it does not
however when kings do become jealous
it's when they forget that they're

[08:02]
it's when they forget that they're
kings so to defend against the
fluoresence of jealousy you need to a do
the things you need to do so that you
can confidently say to yourself that
other men make me look good I.E to
ascend to your kingship and B react to
any perceived threats in the same way
that you would react to a perceived
non-threat and this is an essential
skill to learn because let's be honest
men are going to lust after your girl
they are going to try to seduce your
girlfriend even marriage doesn't prevent
this men are still going to shoot their
shot the only way to prevent this from
happening is to get with an ugly girl
I'm serious commit to the woman that no
other man wants and you won't have to
deal with this problem but is that
really worth it probably not on the
other hand if you want a beautiful
desirable woman you're going to have to
deal with the fact that other men men
are going to want to [ __ ] her okay and

[09:03]
are going to want to [ __ ] her okay and
you can deal with that by abiding in
your
kingship understand that they're hitting
on her is actually a reflection of your
power and Status why because she's with
you you
dummy just remember other men make you
look
good they don't have your woman they're
just making you look better and women
don't leave Kings for peasants that's
not how they work make sense what do you
