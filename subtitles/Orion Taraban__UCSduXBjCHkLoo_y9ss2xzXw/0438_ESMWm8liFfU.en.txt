in general when it comes to women the
more transactional the relationship the
less you actually pay this is because
like if we're talking about literal
prostitution men in these situations
only pay with money on the other hand if
you're dating for a committed
relationship you're generally paying
with time with attention with
exclusivity with compromise and with
money and there is never any guarantee
of sex so while you technically might be
spending less money on a date than you
would on a prostitute the value of all
the other things you could be
surrendering for seeking sex in a
relationship is likely collectively
greater than the difference in the
financial transactions the upshot is if
you're a man you will have to pay to
access the opportunity for sex one way
or another and that's just the way it is
there is a silver lining here which is
that the price of that access is
inversely proportional to the particular
woman's interest and attraction
