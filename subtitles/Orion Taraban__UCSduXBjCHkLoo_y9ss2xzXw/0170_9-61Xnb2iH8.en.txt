i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
stop having panic attacks without
medication this will be the second part
of my talk on the subject so if you
haven't done so already you might want
to check out part one before continuing
so
where were we
basically we were discussing how panic
disorder is a dysfunction in the
mechanism of attention
the intention to protect yourself from
panic attacks leads to checking behavior
which leads to finding the signs of
early onset panic which are disturbed
and intensified by our attention which
are interpreted and validated in a
highly negative light now all of this
can happen very very quickly but it
always happens in that sequence of
events
on some level panic attacks are actually
a completely self-created problem which
i guess is a good thing because if it's
self-created we can self-solve it now
how do we do that
first and foremost

[01:01]
first and foremost
you need to stop checking
this is hard to do but it's absolutely
essential you have to stop checking your
pulse or taking your temperature or
feeling for the tightness in your chest
or whatever it is you do to determine
whether you're experiencing the early
onset symptoms of a panic attack you
have to stop checking
there's going to be this impulse to go
and check but you're going to have to
block it it's just like a craving to use
or to engage in a bad habit do something
else and the impulse will pass and this
is important because if you don't check
then the whole process that i just
described gets nipped in the bud it just
doesn't move forward
all right but let's say you do check
and you find something abnormal now what
do you do
well in that case the best thing you can
do
is to try to disrupt the catastrophic
thought cascade that leads to the
fluorescence of the panic attack as
quickly as possible you can do this by

[02:00]
quickly as possible you can do this by
distracting yourself a great way to
distract yourself is to use the serial
sevens technique you can check out my
episode on serial sevens if you want to
know more about this
or you could name all the capitals of
europe or you could translate a song
into another language or you could jump
in a cold shower or you could mindfully
attend to your environment anything to
get you out of your head or to disrupt
the process from moving on to the next
step
all right but let's say you checked and
you didn't distract yourself and now
you're starting to feel your racing
heart or your rising temperature and
you're aware of your negative judgment
oh this is bad i'm starting to have a
panic attack oh boy well you can
intervene here as well
the best way to do that is to attack the
interpretation using the block and
replace technique and you can check out
my episode on the block and replace
technique if you want to know more about
this
for instance you could say no
it's not true that i'm having a heart
attack i've experienced this before

[03:02]
attack i've experienced this before
it's normal for heart rate to be
variable sometimes my heart is beating
slower sometimes my heart is beating
faster this is one of those times it
will go away by itself in a few minutes
it's perfectly fine this has happened
before and i was fine before too long
so
don't check
distract yourself as quickly as possible
and block and replace any negative
judgments about what's happening to you
and if for whatever reason the ball
slips by all three of these goalies
then you're in emotional coping mode now
and you just need to do what you can to
mitigate the damage
that might mean putting on some soft
music
wrapping yourself in a nice warm blanket
or having a cup of like herbal tea
whatever you need to do
to make yourself feel safe and
comfortable and then allow the process
to take its course
now
it's normal in the course of treatment
for panic attacks to continue to happen
a few times as you get better at
mastering these techniques but generally

[04:02]
mastering these techniques but generally
within a few weeks to a few months
a person can with sufficient discipline
break the dysfunctional pattern of
attention that undergirds the mechanism
of panic attacks so that they stop
happening entirely
this has been true in my own life and
it's been true in the lives of dozens of
the people i've worked with on this very
problem
