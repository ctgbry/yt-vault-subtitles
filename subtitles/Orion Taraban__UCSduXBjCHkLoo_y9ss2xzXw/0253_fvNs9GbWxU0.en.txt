in the truth about commitment marcelo
enrique almeida asks our parents and
grandparents weren't like this what
happened good question in my opinion
there are three reasons why the strength
of commitment has degraded significantly
over the last 50 to 100 years one
life is so much easier than it used to
be today a single individual can get by
by himself or herself in a way that just
wasn't possible a hundred years ago
two
commitment is no longer the gateway to
sex
100 years ago if
the average person wanted to have sex he
or she needed to be in a committed
relationship if not a marriage that is
no longer the case
and three
the
dramatic increase in actual and
perceived options 100 years ago there
was the 10 people in your village that
were around the same age that could be
your potential partners now it's
hundreds of thousands of people within
your metropolitan area long-distance
relationships are possible etc
