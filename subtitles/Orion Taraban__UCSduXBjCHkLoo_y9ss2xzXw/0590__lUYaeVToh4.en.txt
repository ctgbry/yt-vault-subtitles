I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the price
of living your own life so living your
own life is something that is actually
very difficult to do this is because
doing so functionally requires that you
resist the pressure to conform to your
culture's expectations of what your life
is supposed to look like in my culture
this looks something like well first you
graduate high school and then you go to
college and once you finish college you
try to land a good job and if you work
really hard at that job you will climb
the ladder and make a good salary and
this will allow you to buy a car and a
nice house and a vacation in Hawaii of
course while you're advancing your
career you should also be looking for
that special someone after you date for
a while you should become exclusively
monogamous after a year of this you
should move in together and after a year
of this you should get married and after
a year of this you should have kids
you'll go to church on Sundays and spend
every other Thanksgiving at your in-laws
and encourage your kids to graduate high

[01:00]
and encourage your kids to graduate high
school so they can go to college they
can get a good job Etc you understand
what I'm saying this there is a very
clear Runway that your culture maintains
with respect to how your relationships
are supposed to proceed with respect to
how your career is supposed to progress
and with respect to how your family is
supposed to behave and let me tell you
those runways don't work for a lot of
people I mean just look at marriage
everyone knows that it fails more often
than it succeeds and yet people continue
to get married not only that but if you
tell people that you not interested in
getting married they'll look at you like
you have two heads even if their own
marriages are broken and unhappy by the
same token most jobs are neither
necessary nor interesting nor rewarding
they will also never make you rich true
Financial Freedom will never come from a
job every day millions of people work

[02:02]
job every day millions of people work
jobs that they literally hate so that
they can continue to earn enough to
afford to live in a city to work a job
that they literally hate and this is
common knowledge and yet people continue
to get jobs not only that but if you
tell people that you're interested in
working for yourself or becoming an
entrepreneur they'll look at you like
you have a screw loose even if they are
counting the days to their own
retirements the fact the matter is that
these structures are not going to work
for a lot of people if you actually want
a life that fits you that fits your
preferences and your interests and your
personality and your temperament you're
going to have to build it
yourself because the only life that
could possibly fit you that well is
going to be custom tailored for you just
like you can't expect clothes to really
fit you if you just buy them off the
rack you can't expect your life to
really work for you if you just follow
your cultures

[03:00]
your cultures

equivalent of shopping at Walmart it

all the content myself it's the same
strategies that got me my perfect score
I think you'll find
it very excellent so let's get back to
it so why don't more people live their
own lives well there is a cost
associated with living your own life the
cost is simple

[04:00]
cost is simple
but it's hard for a lot of people to pay
here it is the cost of living your own
life is the approval of
others that's it if you want to live
your own life you have to give up any
claim to social
approval even though these cultures fail
people every single day people are very
emotionally attached to them they've
largely dictated how their friends have
lived their lives they've largely
dictated how their relatives have lived
their lives and they've largely dictated
how their neighbors and colleagues and
fellow congregants live their lives as
well these people might not be able to
approve of your choices because chances
are they won't be able to understand
them and how can someone possibly
approve of something that he doesn't
understand but that's the reality the
more your life deviates from these
cultural expectations the less your life
becomes comprehensible to others and and
this can be a very lonely situation

[05:02]
this can be a very lonely situation
what's more as soon as you start to say
hey you know what that doesn't really
work for me and you start to take a
different path you run the risk of
inciting the Envy of others because your
courage will reflect their own cowardice
it will reflect the extent to which they
have given up on their own lives and
this generally does not make people feel
very good couple the incomprehensibility
of your life with the vague negative
feeling they tend to experience in your
presence and you have an easy recipe for
hostility aggression and
ostracization which is why people who
choose their own paths in life are
subject to experiencing far more
persecution and Injustice than those who
conform even if their choices aren't
harming
anyone so it's important to understand
that the approval of others isn't just
like this warm fuzzy emotional
validation it's a kind of social safety

[06:00]
validation it's a kind of social safety
net upon which those who do not conform
cannot
rely many people incorrectly believe
that it would be easy for them to forgo
the approval of others mostly because
others is still in this case an abstract
entity it isn't anyone in particular
it's harder when it's your dad or your
wife or your children I don't care how
cold and hard you think you are I
guarantee there are some people in your
life that you would definitely prefer
for them to support you however the fact
of the matter is that your friends might
not be able to do that your siblings
might not be able to do that your
parents might not be able to do that
when you start to live your own life
you're going to not be able to count on
the support and understanding of those
around you and it's potentially going to
feel very
lonely loneliness is a very difficult
emotion for many people to tolerate and
it's loneliness that often drives Those
Who start to live their own own lives

[07:00]
Who start to live their own own lives
back into those conventional structures
they may not work but at least there are
other people there I might be miserable
but at least I'll have company and we
can all kind of be miserable together
and that's actually what a lot of the
world is a community of shared suffering
it's not the only way to live but it's
how a lot of people live fortunately
though and let's end this on a high note
this doesn't have to last the issue is
that your family and your friends are
large l ly in your life by accident like
you did not ask to be born into your
family it was not your choice to be born
to those parents at that time in that
place by the same token most of your
friends are accidental friends you all
happen to be born in the same general
geographical region at around the same
time and you struck up a relationship
because you both happen to be I don't
know assigned to the same home room
question how many of your friends would
you be friends with if you you met them

[08:00]
you be friends with if you you met them
today if you've actually allowed
yourself to grow and change over the
past 10 or 20 years probably not many of
them you both will have taken Divergent
paths in life and your values now might
be very different now I'm not saying to
break up with your old friends but to
understand that there are some things
that old friends can give you and there
are some things that old friends can't
give you and if you start to live your
own life these friends might not be able
to give you support and approval they
might be able to but they might not be
able to and that's to be expected now
the good news is that once you start to
live your own life and you forgo the
approval of others and your life
actually begins to manifest you will
attract other people into your life who
resonate with that Vision other
people for whom your life is
intelligible and comprehensible and then
you definitely won't be lonely in fact
this might be the only way to to ensure
that you are seen and understood by

[09:01]
that you are seen and understood by
those around you you just can't have it
both ways if you want to be approved by
the masses then you have to be
understandable to the masses which means
that you cannot deviate from a
conventional life on the other hand if
you want your own life if you want your
own chance at happiness and wealth and
freedom then you have to be
incomprehensible to the masses because
if they still understand you you
probably haven't deviated enough to make
a difference what do you think does this
