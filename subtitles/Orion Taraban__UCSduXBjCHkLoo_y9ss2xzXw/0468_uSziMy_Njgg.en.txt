a lot of women prioritize other things
in life and they assume that they'll
just be able to have a family when
they're ready and then they get to their
mid or late 30s and they realize that
it's actually much more difficult to
attract a man for marriage and kids now
than it would have been in their early
or mid-20s the game changes
significantly at 30 and men are expected
to make the same offer which typically
becomes more expensive as a function of
time and that's why 80 percent of women
who ultimately end up childless arrive
there unintentionally in my opinion it's
a better strategy to secure partners and
children in their 20s when their smv is
high and it's biologically advantageous
to do so and devote the 30s to career
and development once the kids are in
school one of the reasons for this is
that there is not really a point at
which women can stop making money or
traveling we're spending time with their
friends but there is absolutely a point
at which women can stop having children
