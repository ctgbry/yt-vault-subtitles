Why women get ghosted. Yes, women can
and do get ghosted. In today's episode,
I'm going to explain why this happens
and what women can do to reduce the
likelihood that it will happen to them.
First and foremost, however, I cannot
pour into a full cup. Many women already
believe they know why men ghost them.
However, this explanation doesn't really

this is just not true. There are
vanishingly few men who will see

relationship with you, they would not
have assumed the trouble and the risk
and the expense of asking you out and
executing the date. Women shame men's
sexual attraction to them to their own
detriment.
