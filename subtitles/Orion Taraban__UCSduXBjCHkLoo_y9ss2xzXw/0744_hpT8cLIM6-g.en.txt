what are the biggest mistakes men make
when they're rolling up on a woman so
you said you know they might surprise
them in some way they might be shut down
their personal space by getting a bit
too close yeah I think most of them are
overc compensations for their
nervousness it's scary to approach a
girl and so there's generally two things
that happen one is the men hesitate too
long and then they get weird and stilted
like they start to think about well what
should I say I need a good opener like
okay that now that line sucks and oh
jeez oh she's talking to somebody now
it's not a good moment they get to in
their head which generally means they
don't approach but if they do they're
generally so like out of the moment and
in their minds that their Vibe is just
off and women reject the vibe because
they don't come off open and confident
how do I get the vibe you start to
listen you start to listen it's like
sales man the same approach isn't going
to work with everyone who walks in your
dealership some guys they're going to
need the real soft touch and you need to
keep a real big distance and not
interfere with their own process CU
they're going to sell themselves on the
car other people need a lot of
handholding a lot of guidance
