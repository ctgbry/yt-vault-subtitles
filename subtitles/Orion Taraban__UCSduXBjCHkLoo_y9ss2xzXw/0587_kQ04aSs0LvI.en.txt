very few people are going to consciously
think to themselves I've decided to
enter into a relationship with this
person because I believe it will be a
net gain for me in that the benefits I
expect to receive will significantly
exceed the costs associated with
acquiring them it sounds psychotic to
verbalize but it accurately reflects
what's going on beneath the surface so
what happens in the vast majority of
cases is that the final calculation gets
transmuted into a feeling for instance
when this covert calculus predicts that
the value of a certain relationship is
going to significantly exceed its costs
people don't think to themselves this is
a beneficial transaction for me they
think I'm pretty excited about this
person I think she might be a keeper on
the other hand when the calculus
predicts that the value of a
relationship is not going to
significantly exceed its costs people
don't think to themselves this is a wash
and therefore a loss to me as it it is
preventing me from entering into more
personally beneficial transactions they
think you know she's a she's a really
nice girl but I feel like something is
missing
