I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
meet women that's right I'm going to
walk you through your options there are
only four ways to meet women in today's
day and age they also happen to be the
only four ways to meet men it's not like
there are different ways of meeting
women than there are for meeting men
however men and women encounter
radically different challenges and
opportunities in these four spaces so
while the General pathways are the same
the strategies and tactics involved are
going to be very different to say the
least so today I'll be approaching this
framework from the male perspective
let's get to it as I said there are only
four ways to meet women today they are
dating apps cold approach Social Circle
and social media that's it and I'm going
to be talking about them in that order
because I've ranked them from the

[01:01]
because I've ranked them from the
easiest fastest and least successful
Pathway to the hardest slowest most
successful pathway this is to be
expected a pathway that is easy and fast
and has a high rate of success would
like break the sexual Marketplace like
most things in life there aren't any
real Shortcuts To Success you have to be
willing to put in the time and you have
to be willing to put in the effort but
let's be clear these four pathways are
not mutually exclusive the best case
scenario is that men are doing or at
least that men are perfectly capable of
doing all four of them at once of the
main reasons that men are suffering in
today's sexual Marketplace the primary
one is that they are overly relying on
one strategy to the exclusion of the
other three namely dating
apps dating apps are seductive because

[02:00]
apps dating apps are seductive because
rationally they make a lot of sense they
are also convenient inexpensive lowrisk
and largely passive the best thing about
them is that you can literally get
started for free in like 20 minutes and
with the correct system you can have a
consistent pipeline of women in a couple
of weeks the issue of course is that the
success rate on apps is very low at
least if you're an average guy on the
other hand if you are a man who is eight
or above in terms of pure physical
attractiveness especially with respect
to your face like good cheekbones facial
symmetry nice hair pretty eyes you can
absolutely clean up on the apps it
doesn't matter if they're broke or
living with their parents or addicted to
heroin for such men dating apps become a
Non-Stop funnel of new enthusiastic
women however this is not going to be
the experience of the vast majority of

[03:01]
the experience of the vast majority of
men in fact I would argue that you
really need to be at least a six in
terms of pure physical attractiveness to
see any appreciable success on the apps
furthermore lots of men are
automatically discounted by women's
filters my brothers if you are under
57 or you are older than 50 you are
going to have a very hard time on the
apps
the algorithm will just not show your
profile to most women though it will
continue to show those women's profiles
to you giving you a false sense of hope
now women will absolutely date older men
and women will absolutely date shorter
men however when they're sitting in the
privacy of their own homes and imagining
their ideal man and the app encourages
them to think that they're in a sell's
market their standards increasingly
start to deviate from it in any case

[04:01]
start to deviate from it in any case
dating apps don't have a high success
rate because most men are not attractive
enough to beat out their intersexual
competition and because they don't have
a system for engaging the technology
correctly average guys who are just
randomly swiping are much more likely to
end up feeling frustrated demoralized
and hopeless than they are finding a
woman to date so let's move on to the
second pathway which is cold approach
cold approach picking up women that you
do not know in the real world is a very
useful skill very useful like knowing
how to hunt or to defend yourself the
ability to create a sexual connection
with women as you move through the world
gives men like a plus 10 boost to their
overall confidence which in turn makes
it more likely for them to succeed in
the future cold approach also has two

[05:01]
the future cold approach also has two
definite pluses first you know what the
woman looks like and you know that you
are attracted to her I lost count of the
number of women I met from dating apps
who either were not using recent
representative pictures of themselves
and or for whom I failed to feel even
the slightest sexual interest on the
date in cold approach this isn't an
issue as you're likely sufficiently
attracted to the woman to functionally
intrude into her life
and second you have direct access to the
woman right here right now she might not
be on the apps she might not ever enter
into your Social Circles and she might
receive hundreds of DMS every day on
social media but because you are with
her in the same place at the same time
in the real world you have been afforded
an unobstructed view to shoot your
shot of course there are several
liabilities to cold approach as well
first first you will likely have no idea

[06:02]
first first you will likely have no idea
whether any particular woman is
currently in the market for a sexual
relationship second women are going to
be the most cautious and defended in
this approach as you will have to
contend with stranger danger third
success depends on Snap judgments based
on your current presentation as there
won't be an overarching context that can
provide more and better information on
your behalf and fourth it can be really
scary to approach women out of the blue
men generally need some kind of system
and accountability structure to overcome
their approach anxiety and they will
likely need to do at least a few hundred
approaches before they begin to feel
remotely confident in this strategy
combine this with the fact that even the
best pickup artists in the world still
have success ratios that read like
baseball batting averages that is they
still strike out more often than they
get a hit and Men usually need to
approach scores of women for cold

[07:00]
approach scores of women for cold
approach to make sense as a dating
strategy this creates the fifth
liability which is grinding through
approaches can feel like a soulless
hustle as a result most men when they do
approach women only approach once in a
while and this means a they don't get
enough repetitions to really get good at
it and B they really draw out the
timeline for Success like given how few
men approach women anymore more 10
approaches a year would probably be
considered above
average imagine if you only swiped on 10
profiles in a year on a dating app like
good luck getting any kind of
relationship that way that said if men
actually apply themselves to pickup they
can get pretty good at approaching women
in a couple of months so this is the
second fastest Pathway to a woman if

understanding to the next level I would

hope to see you
aboard the Third pathway is Social
Circle this is the way that people used
to meet they had the same friend group
in college or they attended the same
local church
or they even work together basically in
Social Circle Game you date your friends
colleagues and co-workers and there are
a number of Pros to this approach most
notably it's the safest bet when it
comes to long-term relationships because
you can vet women slowly and over time
this could occur over multiple group

[09:00]
this could occur over multiple group
outings with friends or in the context
of an escalating office flirtation
compared with the other approaches
you're much more likely to know what
you're getting into and because you have
more time to build a connection with a
person before you start
dating it means that if you do start
you're probably more likely to stay
together so what's the problem well it
turns out there are several first it can
take a long time like it takes at least
at least 6 months to make a new friend
or to feel a sense of belonging in a new
place and only if you dedicate the time
and effort to forge the new connection
second your optionality will be severely
restricted like if you want to only date
within your church there might be only a
handful of eligible candidates and you
might not like any of them and third the
risks of rejection are Al actually much
higher here than in other approaches
whereas dating apps make the vast

[10:00]
whereas dating apps make the vast
majority of rejection unseen and unfelt
and an awkward approach can leave a bad
taste in your mouth for a few minutes
rejection where one works or prays or
studies can be
brutal if the other person doesn't feel
the same way you may irrevocably alter
the relational Dynamic both proactively
moving forward and retroactively in that
person's memory people will likely
gossip about it because that's what what
people do and other people might begin
to treat you differently as well
furthermore because this approach takes
time you may have been focused on one
person for months or years who might
have disabused you of any hope in a
matter of minutes in another context and
through this all you will likely have to
keep showing up to work or church or
school all this is to say that you
should be fairly confident that the
other person reciprocates your feelings

[11:01]
other person reciprocates your feelings
before you pull the trigger in your
Social
Circles also relying on your Social
Circle to meet women if you're not one
of the higher status men in the group
it's probably not going to work status
is very contextual you can be the Top
Dog in one group and the low man on the
totem pole in another in General Social
Circle Game Works if you can be a
contextual Alpha which basically means
that the other in the group formally or
informally look up to you as its leader
as we all know women don't want no scrub
a scrub is a man who can get no love
from them so if you're not one of the
higher status men it might be more
effective to look for a different scene
or even better build a new scene around
yourself and there are systems for doing
just that and last but not least we come
to the fourth pathway social media this
this approach is Far and Away the

[12:02]
this approach is Far and Away the
absolute best way to meet women at the
present moment however of the four it
can take the longest to generate results
so you know better get
started there are several reasons why
meeting women on social media is amazing
first and foremost this is where the
most attractive women are they're not on
the apps they're not at your local dive
bar and they're probably not in your
little Social Circle
the most beautiful and desirable women
in the world are on social media if you
want to catch a certain type of fish you
have to go where they swim there really
is no way around this one second once
this starts to work you don't have to
approach women anymore women will
approach you or if you do choose to
initiate they are much much more likely
to be receptive to your advances this is
because to popular belief the most

[13:01]
because to popular belief the most
reinforcing resource to a woman is not
money or power or visible ABS it's
attention attention more than anything
else the ability to command attention
makes men irresistible to women among
other reasons this is because it can
actually be fairly difficult for women
to recognize things like money status
and Power and this isn't only due to the
fact that men habitually put false
signals out into the sexual Marketplace
think about it would you be able to
recognize a European Noble if he sat
next to you on an airplane in plane
cloth or how about the CFO of a major
bank or the general manager of a sports
franchise or a two-star general probably
not I know I couldn't and this means
that women could literally be sitting
next to royalty or billionaires and not

[14:02]
next to royalty or billionaires and not
know
it however this is not true if you're
famous when millions of people know your
face then you become recognizable to
women in a way that many people with
more wealth or more status or more power
aren't what's more Fame with the halo
effect it produces can make men who are
otherwise not very physically attractive
much more desirable like I guarantee
that a decent looking but famous man has
better optionality than a very
attractive man on the apps Fame is a
force multiplier for men in the game of
meeting and
dating and the good news is that while
it's obviously difficult to get famous
it has never been easier in the history
of the world to do so thanks to social
media whereas before you would have to
go through casting directors and
producers and Power brok Brokers of
every kind and anyone who wanted to get

[15:02]
every kind and anyone who wanted to get
in touch with you would have to pass
through some form of gatekeeping you can
now just hit record on the magic
rectangle in your pocket and anyone who
wants to reach you can contact you
instantly and directly what a
world unfortunately there are two big
drawbacks to this approach first the
vast majority of social media channels
don't go anywhere and those that do
require years of effort and consistent
dedication for instance only 6% of
YouTube channels have over 100,000
subscribers however given the fact that
there are 51 million YouTube channels
this means that there are roughly
300,000 successful creators on that
platform so it's rare but it's not
impossible and second it is far more
difficult for men to succeed on social
media than it is for women like I doubt
I could put on a skimpy out and just
like jiggle at the camera for 10 seconds

[16:02]
like jiggle at the camera for 10 seconds
and get a million views as I discuss in
my book men expand their reputations by
being visibly competent and that
competence can take years to develop
before the very first video is even
uploaded however if and when the
strategy Works famous men enter into a
world of dating of which the average man
for his own protection is only dimly
aware
so those are the four Pathways gentlemen
dating apps cold approach Social Circle
and social media and like most things in
life the rate of success is kind of
organically calibrated to the amount of
time and effort involved the fast and
easy options have low rates of success
while the success rates of the slower
and more effortful options are much
higher there's plenty more that I could
say on the subject but this is already a
long episode as it is so I'll leave it
