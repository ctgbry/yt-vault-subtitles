i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
life is a mystery to be experienced
when i was younger and a bit more
intellectually arrogant
i believe that some of the big questions
in life were still unanswered simply
because a person of sufficient ability
hadn't yet come along to answer them and
i believe that i was smart enough to be
able to solve some of these apparently
unsolvable problems of life
and i no longer believe either of these
to be true
i think that there are many aspects of
the universe and existence itself
that are irreducibly
mysterious
i mean as a very specific example you
have the quantum uncertainty principle
which stipulates that we cannot know the
exact position and velocity of a
particle simultaneously this problem is
not due to a lack of clarity it's not
due to inappropriate instrumentation
it's not due to insufficient resolution

[01:01]
it's not due to insufficient resolution
it's inherent to reality itself
or
there's the fact that we are composed of
trillions and trillions of cells and are
absolutely gigantic relative to the
components of our being while at the
same time we're floating on a tiny speck
of rock around an unremarkable star in
the distant corner of a dusty galaxy
among billions caroaming through the
expanding universe
we are both
incomprehensibly large and
incomprehensibly small
at the same time
and that's not a problem that can be
solved through mentation through
intellectualization
both are true and there's no way
of reducing the mystery of scale one way
or another
we'll never decide nope it's actually
we're very small
or no it's actually we're very big
both mutually exclusive realities are
simultaneously true at the same time

[02:02]
simultaneously true at the same time
this is not a problem to be solved it's
a mystery to be embraced with the heart
and life is characterized by an almost
infinite number of these irreducible
mysteries and my work as i get older has
been to surrender this impulse to
collapse everything down to certainty to
definiteness
using the tool of the intellect
because i now understand that the
intellect as amazing as it is
has inherent limitations on what it can
and can't accomplish
i now understand the universe
has no obligation to be rational
the universe has no obligation to
restrict its being to what can be
comprehended by the intellect
as hamlet says to horatio there are more
things in heaven and earth than are
dreamt of in your philosophy
ultimately the universe is what it is

[03:01]
ultimately the universe is what it is
and it's far more complex and mysterious
than anything our minds can ever hope to
comprehend
and so rather than try to reduce the
universe to those dimensions that are
comprehensible to the intellect only
let's reposition ourselves relative to
being such that we can accept with our
hearts the mystery of what is
and i think that when we do that we have
a much richer and more interesting and
more peaceful life
we don't have to figure everything out
and that's good because not everything
is figured out
sometimes we just have to accept what is
what do you think
