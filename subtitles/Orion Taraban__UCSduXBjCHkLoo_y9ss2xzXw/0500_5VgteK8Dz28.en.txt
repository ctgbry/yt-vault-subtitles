I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
get any man you want the master key this
one is for the ladies and it's a long
one so be sure to watch until the very
end over the last several months many of
you have requested that I make some
episodes from the perspective of women
who are finding it difficult to enter
into the relationships they would like
to have with the men that they want to
have them with and if you're one of them
then it's your lucky day not only am I
going to make an episode on the subject
I'm going to make three episodes on the
subject this one being the first however
some caveats before we begin first if
you're a woman who is not looking to get
her needs met in a relationship with a
man then these episodes aren't for you
you're not going to find much of
Interest here and you might as well just
click away now second these episodes

[01:01]
click away now second these episodes
aren't about securing a relationship
with just any guy that's actually fairly
easy these episodes are about securing a
relationship with the high value men you
really want to have relationships with
these strategies will work on alpha
males and Millionaires and professional
athletes or anyone else you happen to be
targeting and third these suggestions
are not moral exhortations okay I'm not
suggesting that women have a moral or
ethical responsibility to act in certain
ways in their relationships what I am
saying is that if women act in certain
ways in their relationships they will
significantly increase their chances of
securing a commitment from any given man
this isn't about what women should do in
a moral sense it's about what works in a
practical sense all good then let's get
to it now right off the bat I have some
good news and some bad news for you

[02:02]
good news and some bad news for you
women the good news is really good the
good news is you can get any man you
want I'm not kidding any man the only
stipulation as we'll see is you you need
to have direct access to him which means
you need to be able to contact him and
you need to be able to meet with him
that's it but that means that these
strategies aren't going to work on say a
celebrity or a stranger and these
strategies will work to get any man you
have access to even if you're not super
hot yes if you are physically gorgeous
it's going to make things a whole lot
easier however you have no control over
that and the truth of the matter is that
many of these women are nightmares to
have relationships with being very
attractive is a real Advantage for women
but it's not the whole story and of of
course you should do all that you can to

[03:02]
course you should do all that you can to
present yourself in as the most
attractive version of yourself possible
like don't neglect this just because you
can't be a supermodel so that's the good
news you can get any man you
want great the bad news is that if you
haven't yet been able to do this it's
your
fault you are the problem I'm not
kidding since most men will entertain
sexual offers from most women if you're
having trouble converting a man into a
relationship it's your fault the flip
side of this is that it's the man's
fault if he can't attract female
interest like wouldn't you agree it's
the man's responsibility to develop
himself to the point where he becomes an
attractive option to women right it's
not your fault if you're not attracted

[04:00]
not your fault if you're not attracted
to him we're not going to blame women
for not wanting to sleep with
unattractive men and women certainly
aren't going around sleeping with men
out of pity or sympathy or moral
obligation right attraction is his
problem but if you can't get a man to
commit to you that's your problem and
it's your fault it's your responsibility
to do the things you need to do in order
to get a guy to commit to you and it
works like this because women are the
GateKeeper of sex which is why men need
to work at becoming viable sexual
options for women and because men are
The Gatekeepers of commitment which is
why women need to work at becoming
viable commitment options for men you
don't get commitment just because you
want it or simply as a function of
time which is why telling men that
you're looking for a serious
relationship right out of the gate is
wild wild and wildly ineffective you

[05:03]
wild wild and wildly ineffective you
also can't like just stick around long
enough I'm sure that there are men in
your life who have wanted to [ __ ] you
for years but they wanting it or they
wanting it long enough wasn't sufficient
for you to give them what they wanted
was it so simply putting in the time is
not a reliable strategy in fact it
carries a number of risks most of which
are disproportionately born by you the
woman so if it's your fault then what's
the main thing tripping you up what is
the biggest way in which women are their
own worst enemies in a
word
pride in most cases pride is what is
standing between you and the
relationship you want with the man you
want to have it with and let me tell you
as someone who has suffered from pride
pride himself pride is cold company

[06:00]
pride himself pride is cold company
it does not keep you warm at night so
what I want you to consider is that
there is a time and a place to
prioritize pride and there is a time and
a place to prioritize Effectiveness or
Harmony and it's going to be really hard
for you to have a loving harmonious
relationship if you consistently
prioritize your own Pride over these
other interpersonal goals you may need
to choose do I want to hold on to my
pride or do I want to hold on to my
relationship you may not be able to have
both I I told you I you can get any man
you want but you can't get any man you
want in any way that you want to get him
there are ways that you have to behave
in order to do that and letting go of
that Pride might be one of them now
before I go any further if you're liking
what you're hearing please consider
sending this episode to someone who
might benefit from its message because
it's Word of Mouth referrals like this
that really helped to make the channel
grow you may also consider hitting the
thanks button and tipping me in
proportion to the value you feel you've

[07:01]
proportion to the value you feel you've
derived from this episode I don't do
corporate sponsorships or product
placements though I get asked to do them
all the time so this helps me stay
independent and it helps keep the light
on I really appreciate it thank
you okay so if you can get any man that
you have access to then what exactly do
you have to do well you need to do three
things hence three episodes the first
two are things you have to do the third
thing is something that you have to not
do and the rest of this episode will be
concerned with the first thing which I
call the master key as it's the single
most important factor in unlocking the
relationship you want all women will
benefit from this however it is
absolutely essential for women who
aren't very attractive like if your
normalized sexual Marketplace value is
below an eight which doesn't mean that
you're more attractive than 80% of your
intersexual competition because nsmv is

[08:00]
intersexual competition because nsmv is
curve linear not scalar so fewer than
20% of all women are eights or above if
your nsmv is below an eight then this
thing is non-negotiable you have to do
it to get a commitment from the guy you
want you either have to do this or you
have to be extremely manipulative so
pick your poison and if you don't do
this one thing then the man will [ __ ]
you but he won't commit to you are you
ready the master key the one thing that
you absolutely have to do as a woman in
order to secure a commitment from a man
is you have to be
useful useful that is the key you have
to be useful I'll say it as many times
as I need to you have to be useful and
this is actually a reversal of the way
that most women go about dating and
relationships in which it's all about

[09:00]
relationships in which it's all about
them relative to the man you want you
are not the
prize you are only the prize relative to
the men who want you and you don't want
those guys and this means that you can't
expect to be the adored in this Dynamic
if you assume that this guy is going to
go out of his way and come to you and
pick you up and buy you dinner and work
on your schedule and cater to your
desires you have another thing coming
it's not about you a busy successful man
with lots of options doesn't have time
for that nonsense he's on a mission and
his mission which is generally
associated with a self-transcendent
overarching goal is more important than
what you want but here's the catch you
can get what you want if you can help

[10:00]
can get what you want if you can help
the man achieve his mission that is if
you can be
useful ask not what your man can do for
you but what you can do for your man
okay that is essential because if you
can be useful to a man you can slowly
integrate yourself step by step into his
life to the point where you are so
involved in the everyday mechanics of
his existence that it would be
functionally impossible to get rid of
you a man will never get rid of a useful
woman he might not commit to you that
takes still other things we'll talk
about that in future episodes but he
will never get rid of you in the absence
of a marriage contract which you don't
have yet usefulness is your safety net
why because if your usefulness would
significantly disrupt his life if you
were to leave you now have job security

[11:03]
were to leave you now have job security
if the only thing you take with you when
you leave a relationship is your Netflix
password you [ __ ] up you were not
providing valuable instrumental support
which made it easy to replace you and or
let you
go and how do you help a man you help a
man by making his life
easier yeah I'm sorry you help a man by
making his life better
and his work easier most women do
neither of these things y'all can be a
real headache to deal with you're like a
second job that we have to pay to work
and relationships like this not only
generally don't last but are
characterized by conflict and strife
until they fall apart as well however if
you can approach relationships with a
different mentality with the
understanding that you are earning the
privilege of a relationship with the man
you desire by Prov providing value

[12:00]
you desire by Prov providing value
you're going to have a much easier time
of things it's just like in business
just asking for a job or a professional
commitment doesn't work you earn your
opportunities with your competence and
your effort and your savviness the same
is true here now how you can actually be
helpful depends on the man in question
I'm not talking about token gestures of
affection buying flowers or baking
cookies or sending text
those things are nice but they're
generally what women like and none of
them are really going to make a man's
life much easier you can learn how to
help a man by becoming curious about his
life do your
research ask questions listen to him
this isn't some schmuck who's sitting on
the couch getting high and playing video
games there is a reason why you're
attracted to him and that reason
probably has to do with the fact that he
has a lot going on the the number one
thing I hear from women that they want

[13:01]
thing I hear from women that they want
that they're that they want in a man is
ambition they have a lot of things going
on ambitious men between his career and
his mission and his lifestyle his hands
are full it takes time and effort and
energy to execute those things you're
not just here to benefit from all of his
hard work that's narcissistic and
entitled remember the only women who get
this treatment are trophy wives and to
be a trophy wife you need to a be
enviably
beautiful and B stay on the shelf where
you
belong most of you are not a and most of
you don't want B so you need to
cultivate other expectations with
respect to how you approach
men get curious about the guy's life
figure out what he's about and how he's
about doing it what would help him him
along his way what would make his life

[14:01]
along his way what would make his life
easier what could you possibly take off
his plate then start offering assistance
based on the information you've gleaned
from your research why because if you
help a man achieve his goals you're
going to be standing next to him when he
gets there that is what smart women
understand the ticket to being next to a
successful guy is getting involved in
his success not just enjoying the
benefits of his success provide
instrumental support this could look
like making meals doing housework
managing Logistics researching options
running errands managing aspects of the
business taking care of things
proactively before they become problems
etc etc etc it's like a woman who is
doing that for me how could I get rid of
that woman she would be invaluable to me
and it would be relatively easy easy to
slide into that role because there's not

[15:01]
slide into that role because there's not
a lot of
competition there are tons of women who
are competing for my attention and my
time and my money Etc but there's not a
lot of women competing to help me most
men get zero
help this is your opportunity it's a way
to bypass
99% of your competition in the sexual
Market place I'm not kidding ladies this
is how you get in what you have to
understand is that service is a gift for
you it's a gift because it's the pathway
into that man's life and it's a gift to
you because in general the value you
provide is still less than the value you
receive helping the guy out grants you
access to increasingly more intimate
aspects of his life and it can be very
Val to be in some people's inner circles

[16:01]
Val to be in some people's inner circles
you have to earn your place in men's
lives much like men have to earn their
sexual opportunities I mean you're not
just giving out sex to anybody who wants
it right the guy has got to do things
for you and do things to you the same is
true for you you can't just sit there
and expect the guy to hand over the keys
to the kingdom and in this market sex is
much much cheaper than commitment
you gain access to that commitment by
being useful and providing value and
that usefulness is determined by the
specific man's needs and the specific
man's Mission and what's going to stop
you from doing
that Pride that indignant voice that
lies to you and tells you I shouldn't
have to do that or that's beneath me or
this isn't the 1950s or what about me
that voice is what is standing in your

[17:02]
that voice is what is standing in your
way listen to me your best bet at
getting your needs met from a high value
man is serving his after all that man is
not going to enter into your frame
you're not going to take care of him
you're G to enter into his and he's
going to take care of you and your
ticket into that frame is by offering to
make its operation smoother and
easier that responsibility is a
privilege because it's an invitation
into that man's inner sanctum and the
more you become implicated in the actual
mechanics of his life the harder it will
be to ever remove you from that
situation again women don't have to do
these things but trust me these things
work hopefully that makes sense what do
