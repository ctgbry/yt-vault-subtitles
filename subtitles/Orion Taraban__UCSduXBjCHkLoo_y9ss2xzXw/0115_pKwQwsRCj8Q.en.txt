i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
the topic of today's short talk is
wanting is free i like this phrase
wanting is free and i'm going to explain
why in this episode
there are two ways of looking at this
phrase the first is when someone else
wants something
the second is when you yourself are
doing the wanting
let's break it down
when someone else wants something
especially
when someone else wants something from
you
it's important to always remember
that wanting is free
that is
it cost this someone
absolutely nothing to want this
something from you your agreement your
compliance your understanding
they're free to want whatever they want
and from a purely economic perspective
it makes a lot of rational sense for
others to want things from you because
again that wanting cost them nothing

[01:02]
again that wanting cost them nothing
and that wanting can sometimes obtain
the desired result
but in my mind this also makes it easier
to reject
disappoint and otherwise turn down
people's desires since it cost them
nothing to want to begin with you're not
really hurting them by saying no
in tort law we could say that no loss or
harm has occurred as a result so that's
one way to look at it
another way to look at the phrase
wanting is free
is from your own perspective that is
when you yourself want something well
again wanting is free
getting
is expensive
so if you pass your time just wanting
things but not spending any of your time
energy or money in the pursuit of your
desires then
you're you're not understanding how this
works
getting
is expensive
if you want to start getting
you have to start spending

[02:01]
you have to start spending
this doesn't necessarily mean money
but you have to spend resources broadly
defined in order to obtain the objects
of your desire okay
