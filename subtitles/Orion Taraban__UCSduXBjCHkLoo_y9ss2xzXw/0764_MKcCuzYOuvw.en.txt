I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is test her
my dudes it is absolutely essential that
you test women before you enter into
sexual relationships with them women
have figured this out a long time ago
women test men all the time
unfortunately due to their poor
optionality the average guy doesn't
think to test a woman who shows interest
in him he's just happy to be there
unfortunately this attitude
significantly increases the likelihood
that he will get involved with a
dangerous difficult or disordered woman
on a long enough time frame and I'm here
today to teach guys on how to go about
avoiding that to be honest I'll probably
have to do several episodes on the
subject but hey you got to start
somewhere now there are many different

[01:00]
somewhere now there are many different
kinds of women you're going to want to
avoid getting involved with and one of
these kinds I call a
bomb what do bombs do they
explode sometimes at the slightest touch
bombs are women who are going to explode
at you the first time you don't do
something right or the first time you do
something wrong and I'm putting those
words in quotes because they're notion
of right and wrong is almost never
connected to some kind of extrapolated
morality and is almost always based on
their own subjective interests and goals
that is right is what she wants and
wrong is what she doesn't those who give
her what she wants are good those who
don't are bad or unhealthy or toxic or
sexist and so on when you touch a bomb
the wrong way and boy are some of these

[02:00]
the wrong way and boy are some of these
bombs touchy they're going to explode
and they're going to explode with all
the force of being convicted in their
own
self-righteousness she might yell or
pout or call you names or throw things
or threaten the continued basis of the
relationship these are all forms of
immaturity and emotional disregulation
at best and may be signs of more
significant personality dysfunction at
worst
it should go without saying but here it
is this is a type of woman that you
absolutely do not want to have a
relationship with why because only one
of two outcomes is inevitable here
either she's going to keep exploding and
you're either going to spend a
significant portion of your relationship
fighting or conducting damage control or
you're going to end up tiptoeing around

[03:00]
you're going to end up tiptoeing around
her trigger points and walking on
eggshells in either case your life is
going to be stressful and unnecessarily
complicated much better to just not get
involved in the first place now the good
news is that this type of woman is
actually very easy to avoid indeed in
the majority of cases you can identify
them before you even meet them which
will save you a good deal of time energy
and money so how do you do that well
what does the bomb squad do when they
encounter a suspicious package they take
it to a safe location and they perform a
controlled
detonation they set it off this renders
the bomb if it is a bomb safe and
harmless and if it isn't a bomb they can
move forward with their business but you
know better safe than sorry right to
understand why this works let's briefly
consider the professional equivalent

[04:00]
consider the professional equivalent
given that the same economic principles
govern behavior in the dating market and
in the job market they're actually
eerily similar to one another as I've
said before dating is really an extended
hiring process and men are the employers
because they're in a position to extend
a relationship opportunity to a woman
and in the context of a job market one
of the functions of an interview is to
weed out problematic or difficult
characters as early in the process as as
possible one way to do that is to
question the applicant with respect to
their willingness to perform certain
tasks especially those that the
applicant might not be keen on
performing but are nevertheless
associated with that position for
example this job might require you to
work on Saturdays is that going to be an
issue assuming that most people would in
fact prefer not to work on Saturdays
this request is a bit of an imposition

[05:01]
this request is a bit of an imposition
and that's why it's a useful indication
of the applicant's interest in the role
irrespective of whether working
Saturdays is actually necessary like
it's still useful to ask the question
Eng gauge the response because if it's
not working Saturdays per se it will be
working late or redoing a project or
taking on an unpreferred role or some
other impositions you get me uh the
response will not only provide useful
indirect information on the applicant's
interest but also on the applicant's
character think about it if an applicant
really wanted the job how would she
respond absolutely that's not a problem
you can count on me or if she really
wanted the job and were somewhat clever
how would she answer you know that's not
something I would ordinarily do but but

[06:00]
something I would ordinarily do but but
since I really care about this company
and its Mission I'm willing to make an
exception here that's a very smart
response because it's going to make that
interviewer feel special about something
she was apparently willing to do anyway
so it's a simple way of conjuring
additional value out of nothing clever
in any case both of those responses
indicate a high level of Interest now if
the applicant is only somewhat
interested in the role she's going to
negotiate this is a sign that she
believes that she is on equal footing
with the prospective employer because
negotiation is really something that
only occurs between perceived equals the
response might be something like I can
work Saturdays if you pay me
double now this might not fly with the
prospective employer however she's
apparently willing to rock the boat and
risk losing the opportunity because
either a it has consequently become less
attractive to her and or B she has other

[07:02]
attractive to her and or B she has other
more attractive options that she is more
interested in in any case this does not
indicate a high level of Interest lastly
consider the applicant who chooses to
become offended at the
suggestion what how dare you ask me to
work Saturdays that wasn't in the job
description do I need to report you to
the Better Business Bureau who do you
think you are etc etc this person is a
bomb and you've just performed a
controlled detonation congratulations
and it's not because she didn't want to
work weekends think about it what
stopped this applicant from saying
unfortunately I wouldn't be willing to
do
that nothing like there's absolutely no
reason to explode on the prospective
employer and the fact that she did
indicates a a low interest in the
position and or B A perceived
superiority relative to the prospective

[08:00]
superiority relative to the prospective
employer For Better or Worse people
don't talk up power hierarchies in that
way but they might talk down them in
such a fashion such people believe that
they're doing the employer a favor by
interviewing there of course if they had
anywhere better to interview we'd have
to assume they'd be there instead so
this is an arrogant and entitled
response now no one has to work
Saturdays right some people really value
having their weekends free however that
value comes at a cost that's why we call
them values they're valuable they're
costly and one of the costs associated
with having such a value might be losing
out on certain opportunities like why
wouldn't the employer offer the job to
the applicant who is just as qualified
and is willing to work work on Saturdays

[09:00]
and is willing to work work on Saturdays
right so anyone who implements such a
boundary is functionally communicating
that the potential risk of losing this
opportunity is less than the potential
harm that working a Saturday would cause
so far so

hope to see you
aboard now let's shift back to testing
women in the context of dating there are
many different ways for men to perform
controlled detonations on perspective
Ive lovers and ideally these tests are

[10:01]
Ive lovers and ideally these tests are
conducted before the date even occurs
saving both sides a lot of time and
energy one easy way to do this is to ask
a woman to send you picks prior to a
date I understand this is going to be a
contentious suggestion for some folks
but I think it's a good idea for a
number of reasons let's explore this
further first and foremost requesting
picks from a woman is kind of a way of
making sure that you're both more or
less on the same page with respect to
the nature of this potential
relationship like this isn't going to be
a friendly chat or some kind of
interview it's a date with all of its
attendant sexual associations and
possibilities this will not only help
prevent men from entering into ambiguous
interactions with women but it will give
men important information about the
woman's level of Attraction and aspects

[11:01]
woman's level of Attraction and aspects
of her character as well and it's very
important for men to gauge both of these
components as early in the courtship as
possible it should go without saying but
you only really want to go out with
women who a Express a very high level of
attraction for you and B have
non-reactive non-explosive characters
the risks and costs associated with not
doing this are just too high for men in
today's day and age so let's run through
the various possibilities if a woman is
very attracted to you and is interested
in a sexual relationship how is she
going to respond you guessed it by
sending you some piics maybe with a
little note attached let me know if
there's anything else you want to see
kissy face kissy face and if she's very
interested and somewhat clever how would
she answer you know I don't usually do
this kind of thing but you seem like

[12:00]
this kind of thing but you seem like
such a nice guy and I feel like I can
trust you smart now not only did she do
it but she did it in a way that made
that guy feel special effectively
Conjuring additional value out of
something she was apparently willing to
do anyway well done in any case you can
now be fairly confident that the woman
in question has a high level of interest
in a sexual relationship and you can
feel safer about moving forward on the
other hand a bomb is absolutely going to
explode at such a request what how dare
you talk to me like that how disgusting
and disrespectful I can't believe you
would ask for something like this what
kind of a man are you is that all that
you're interested in etc etc etc
congratulations you've just detonated a
bomb at a safe distance her response
communicated in no un certain terms that

[13:00]
communicated in no un certain terms that
she had little interest in a sexual
relationship with you even though she
presumably had no problem with you
taking her out and giving her your time
energy and
money furthermore she demonstrated that
she apparently feels justified in
punishing men who violate her
expectations with respect to how the
courtship and presumably the
relationship should proceed remember
punishment only flows from the high to
the low so this is a woman who probably
thought she was doing you a favor by
allowing you to take her out in any
event she is likely searching for a man
to fit into her frame and to provide her
a relationship on her terms dating her
would be a slow
castration now when you successfully
detonate a bomb it's important not to
argue with her don't try to defend
yourself or pressure her into compliance

[14:02]
yourself or pressure her into compliance
or clap back in a critical spirit
remember she did you a favor you should
be grateful she showed you who she was
before you had to spend dollar one if
only it were always this easy just say
something like completely understandable
thank you for your time and move on to
the next
applicant this is just one way that men
can test women there are plenty of
others but in the interest of time we're
going to have to wrap it up here just
remember it's not really about the pick
there are even ways for women to
demonstrate a high level of attraction
and good character while acting demure
the point is to collect reliable data on
these metrics before you engage so that
you can make better decisions on how to
spend your necessarily limited resources
