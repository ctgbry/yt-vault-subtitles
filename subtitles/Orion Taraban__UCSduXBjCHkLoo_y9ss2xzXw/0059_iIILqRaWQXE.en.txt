i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
the best years of your life
now if you're a younger person
and you've spoken with folks of an older
generation it's generally only a matter
of time before you're told the time in
and around your college years say your
late teens to your early twenties is
quote the best years of your life
and having spoken to a lot of young
people in this age group i've discovered
that to the extent that that individual
believes this to be true
these young people experience a lot of
pressure and a lot of fomo
there can be this almost manic quality
to their behavior as though this is
their one and only chance to enjoy life
before their crushing descent into full
adulthood
now it's certainly true that
responsibilities tend to increase over
time
however as responsibilities tend to
increase so too do privileges like

[01:01]
increase so too do privileges like
resources and opportunities so it's kind
of fair
and it can certainly be true that young
people while experiencing a high degree
of freedom from restriction and
obligation
still lack a good deal of freedom to
manifest their desires into being
which means that in some respects their
freedom is somewhat squandered by their
circumstances
my argument to this belief that the
early 20s or the best years of one's
life
is basically an examination of the lives
of those who believe it
are these people happy now
an older person who romanticizes this
phase of life often feels regretful and
restricted as a consequence of his
choices
and so longs to return to a time before
he quote was forced to decide
his responsibilities did not provide him
an adequate return for the sacrifices
involved
so he yearns for the days of possibility

[02:00]
so he yearns for the days of possibility
and potential before his choices
cumulatively conspired to situate him in
his current location
on the other hand those who made quote
better decisions that is decisions that
facilitated the development of their
best interests and chosen lifestyle
their lives get better with time and
this is because with each passing year
they accumulate more resources and more
opportunities to execute on their
preferences
resources and opportunities they may
have lacked when they were younger
as a result these folks experience an
increase of freedom with the passage of
time both freedom from onerous
restriction and freedom to realize their
chosen path
it all comes down to the choices we make
in life the best years of your life are
behind you
if your choices have locked you into a
sub-optimal lifestyle
and the best years of your life are
ahead of you if your choices facilitate
the development of your chosen lifestyle

[03:00]
the development of your chosen lifestyle
hopefully that makes sense
