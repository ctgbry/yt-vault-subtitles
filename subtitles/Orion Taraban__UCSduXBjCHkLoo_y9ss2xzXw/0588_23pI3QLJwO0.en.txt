women are going to be a part of our
lives in one way or another and when
fully integrated the red pill allows men
to have fulfilling relationships with
women in a way that makes sense for the
particular individuals involved women
are not the enemy and they are not to be
feared or hated or shunn these emotional
responses indicate a lack of acceptance
and understanding that said I'm also not
saying that men should just get over it
many men have been significantly harmed
by women and working through their
trauma is going to be in a essential
stage of their journey and I'm not
saying that the end result is supposed
to look like men and women holding hands
and singing Kumbaya for many men it is
entirely appropriate not to return to
the relationships they once had what I
am saying is women aren't going anywhere
and the vast majority of men will
continue to relate to women in some form
or another after they swallow the red
pill understanding women an intersexual
Dynamics more generally is kind of like
finally reading the rule book to a game
you have little choice but to play
