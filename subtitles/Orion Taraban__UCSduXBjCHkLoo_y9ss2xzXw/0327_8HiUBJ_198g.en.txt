I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is sync
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to be indestructible
to understand how to become
indestructible
you must first understand why you are
destructible to begin with leaving aside
basic biological vulnerabilities the way
that people are emotionally or
psychologically destructible is this
they inappropriately identify with
external reality
now before I explain what that means
please remember to like this video And
subscribe to this channel takes less
than a second costs you nothing and it's
a great way to get a little finger
exercise
so do the thing
all right
people are destructible because they
identify inappropriately with external
reality and to understand that we first
have to understand what identity is
my working definition of identity is
that identity is what is left over
after everything that can be taken from

[01:00]
after everything that can be taken from
you
is taken from you
and this is because everything that can
be taken from you will be taken from you
in time
if something can be taken from you and
you continue to exist after the taking
then clearly what was taken wasn't you
it wasn't who you are it was something
that you have
now most things in life fall under that
category they are things that you have
not things that you are
these are very obvious things like your
job your relationships your family your
bank account
but they can also be things that are
more intangible like for example your
physical attractiveness that will be
taken from you in time
or your intelligence
ditto no one stays mentally acute
forever
the list sort of goes on and on so
what's the problem the problem shows up
when people identify with these things
that is when they confuse something that

[02:00]
that is when they confuse something that
they have
for something that they are
now this is almost always unconscious
however that's what kind of makes it
even more powerful
folks have all kinds of core identity
statements in their hearts and Minds I
am my status I am my reputation I am my
relationship I am my money I am my
intelligence I am my beauty and none of
these statements is true
they are all false statements
and it's living in falsity that makes
you destructible
falsity is like a in your armor
this is because if anybody attacks or
threatens those things you will perceive
them psychologically to be attacks or
threats on yourself
and you will react in ineffective ways
commensurate with that interpretation
so how do you become indestructible the
path to indestructibility is basically
the process of systematically
de-identifying from that which you

[03:02]
de-identifying from that which you
falsely and unconsciously identified
with sometime in your past
or to put the same thing another way
it is the process of systematically
identifying who you really are
you can observe your reactions to know
if you are making progress
if I came home one day to find that my
mailbox was all busted up in the past I
might have gotten Furious I might have
perceived that to be some kind of
personal attack a personal insult you
know I'm kind of disrespect
because on some level I was identified
with that mailbox
even though it was just an object I
could have said that with my words
I must have felt that on some level it
was me otherwise my reaction wouldn't
really have made sense
nowadays if that happened I'm not sure
if I would bat an eyelash oh
a mailbox is busted I wonder how that
happened
you fixed do I need a new one
at the end of the day it's just a

[04:00]
at the end of the day it's just a
mailbox so not that big of a deal
now if you can react like that with a
mailbox
it's a sign of progress a good first
step
but if you can react like that with your
beauty
your wealth
your intelligence
your reputation
your relationships
if you can treat those things like a
mailbox
then you're making real progress
you will understand that while you can
have those things in your life there
remains a wide Gulf between what you
have and what you are
and no matter what happens to what you
have who you are remains intact
now this doesn't mean that you should
neglect or disrespect the things that
you have I mean
I took care of my mailbox
I didn't venerate it I didn't obsess
over it
I couldn't worry about it
I wasn't devastated when it inevitably
fell apart

[05:00]
fell apart
from the time that I had it I took care
of it
just like I try my best to take care of
my body and my relationships and my
reputation
well I have them
even though I will lose them all in time
de-identification does not mean neglect
or disrespect but it does mean holding
things lightly
enjoy and appreciate them while you have
them
and surrender them with love and
gratitude when it's time to let them go
if you can do that if you can identify
yourself with yourself
no more and no less then
who can have power over you
other people Society reality itself will
have no leverage over you
leverage can only exert influence over
what you have
and what you have is only yours to a
point because you will have to give it
back whether you want to or not
if you succeed in de-identifying who you

[06:03]
if you succeed in de-identifying who you
are from what you have then you will
become indestructible
impervious to any form of coercion
manipulation or domination
either overt or carvert
no man or woman
will be your master
because you will be your own
hopefully that makes sense what do you
think let me know in the comments below
