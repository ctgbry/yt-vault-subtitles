There's a a study that I heard Matthew
Hussy talk about which you'll probably
be familiar with. Um, two hamsters, one
who gets to run on the wheel when they
choose, attached to another wheel that
has a hamster in that only runs when the
other one chooses to. Have you seen
this?
&gt;&gt; I don't know this study, but I can
picture it.
&gt;&gt; Basically, you've got one that's got
internal locus of control and the
other's got external locus of control.
One is running under their own valition
and the other is being made to run when
the other one chooses to. and a pretty
nasty experiment. You know, if you
imagine that there was someone that did
something compulsively and you had to do
it at the same time, it would be pretty
painful. But very interesting. The
stress levels of the two hamsters when
you compare them together are just night
and day. They're completely different.
This is the mental equivalent of that.
If you can try and take a little bit of
power back from whatever it is that's
occurred to you, I chose this
as opposed to like I am happening to it,

[01:00]
as opposed to like I am happening to it,
it is not happening to me.
&gt;&gt; And of course, even the hamster who
could get on the wheel whenever it
wanted was in a cage. I mean, it had
very strict limitations on what it could
do. So, we're really talking about just
a relative difference. Most of us in
terms of our human experience are the
second hamster. There's the universe is
just so much larger than we are. and it
was set into motion a long time ago and
we're coming up against forces that are
rippling from across the stars. Uh all
we can really do is choose how we want
to respond to them. Victor Frankle
talked about this. It's like sometimes
you're in a situation where there is no
possibility of escape.
And so all you can really do is choose
how you respond to that. And he saw that
there was an opportunity for dignity and
self-trcendence in even the most you
know abhorrent circumstances.
