I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is what men
and women have to do in order to love
I'm not talking about finding love so
this isn't a question about dating or
attraction what I'm talking about are
the unique challenges each sex seems to
face with respect to their capacity to
love they're being able to love another
person most people think they already
know how to love they don't the fact of
the matter is is that love is an
incredibly High thing and few people are
capable of doing it in their present
State and regardless of their capacity
we can all certainly learn to love
better so let's get to it let's start
with the ladies women the image that I'm
going to keep coming back to with
respect to your capacity to love is
water
we often talk about dirty water or
unclean water but that's actually in

[01:02]
unclean water but that's actually in
precise language technically water H2O
is always pure if there are impurities
at that level then it's not H2O and
we're not talking about water
what we mean when we say the water is
dirty is that the liquid that contains
the water also contains a bunch of other
impurities
and it's those things that make the
liquid dirty and dangerous to drink but
Water by itself is always pure and
uncorruptable
the same principle holds true for
women's love what love is there to the
extent that it is love is always pure
the issue with women is that their love
is subject to being mixed up with so
many other impurities that it can even
be toxic to experience and what are some
of those impurities there are so many of
them their love can be mixed up with
possessiveness materialism jealousy

[02:03]
possessiveness materialism jealousy
control Pride delusion martyrdom deceit
and greed just to name a few
when these things are added to the
transmission of love then the result can
be extremely toxic to receive it doesn't
mean that the love that is transmitted
is impure or bad but just like water if
it's mixed up with some of this other
stuff it can make a person really sick
it's very hard for men to receive that
kind of love and women who don't get
this end up alone at the end of a string
of broken relationships to prevent this
women have to filter their love to
strain out all the other impurities that
are subject to contaminating the
transmission of love and this requires
some very honest self-reflection the
ability to discern with some degree of
accuracy and integrity when their love

[03:00]
accuracy and integrity when their love
is mixed up with things that don't
belong there and the more that women
succeed in filtering out those things
the more their Love Will Shine forth
pure and unadulterated so
that's women

this episode this really helps to make
this all happen and I really appreciate
your support
now let's move on to men guys we have a
very different challenge with respect to
love and our challenge actually has two
parts the image that I would ask you to
consider with respect to this topic is a
tree

[04:00]
tree
now all people are born soft as Tiny
Sprouts or little saplings and because
they are extremely soft they are also
extremely vulnerable and it's in this
incipient phase of life that a tree is
most likely to die and this is analogous
to people if you can survive childhood
there's actually a pretty good chance
that you'll make it to old age
now here's the thing men cannot stay
saplings just like a sapling would never
become a tree if it didn't get busy
getting hard a boy will never become a
man if he stays soft
so what does that sapling do it armors
itself in tough bark
thickens its bowl and digs its roots
deep into the ground
and these things provide a firm
foundation on which to grow taller
and it does this not because it's a flex
to be tall but because that plant would

[05:02]
to be tall but because that plant would
literally die if it didn't it's not like
the established trees that are that are
there are going to get out of the way of
the sun just because there's a growing
tree beneath their canopy that needs
some light a tree has to fight for its
right to exist and the same is true for
men for better or worse in our society
men have to carve out a place for
themselves otherwise they remain boys or
worse
and this struggle is hard
like many things in life it would be
much easier under ideal conditions
however these are not the conditions
under which trees actually find
themselves in the real world and just
like trees men need to learn how to grow
under less than ideal conditions for
example it would be much easier for a
man to succeed if say those around him
supported him
but if he can only succeed if those

[06:00]
but if he can only succeed if those
around him support him then he really
can't do it yet
likewise it would be easier for a man to
succeed if he was given opportunities to
do so but if he can only succeed if he
has given those opportunities then he
really can't do it yet
like the tree in the forest a man needs
to fight for his right to occupy a place
in the world
and the way he does this is by becoming
hard
if he doesn't he will secure no sympathy
and the world will keep on spinning
now what does this have to do with love
well if a man doesn't get hard
then this challenge is largely moot as
the man will find it very difficult to
find someone to give his love to and the
pun here is intended guys just like a
man needs to get hard physically in
order to have sex he needs to get hard
emotionally in order to get love
in order to give love hardness isn't

[07:00]
in order to give love hardness isn't
optional for men and getting hard is the
first step
but it doesn't end here the issue here
is that it can happen that later on in
life men are subject to growing so hard
that they are more or less inured to all
kinds of emotions or at least to all
emotions besides anger that's the one
that never really seems to go away but
out of force of habit in an instinct for
survival men can grow so rigid that they
no longer know how to give or receive
some of the other emotions like love
and this is dangerous because a tree
that is too rigid will break when the
weather which is in motion is too
extreme
for a tree to sustainably thrive in
maturity it must be firm
firmness is like rigidity tempered by
pliability
like a tree a man must be firm he needs

[08:02]
like a tree a man must be firm he needs
to temper his hardness and strength with
something approaching suppleness
and this suppleness allows men to give
and receive love more effectively
now at this point I can almost hear the
women who have gotten this far saying
yes I wish men would open up more and be
more vulnerable and share their feelings
Etc and it's like I hear you ladies but
I'm also here to tell you that most men
don't have this problem
in today's day and age most men are too
soft
they don't need to worry about this
second step yet and when they do I'm
advocating a touch of suppleness to
temper the hardness not a little
hardness to toughen up the softness men
will never be like you and that is how
it should be so don't use the same
standard on your girlfriends as you
would on your boyfriends we have
different challenges to overcome and
what are those challenges again women

[09:01]
what are those challenges again women
you have to filter the impurities out of
your liquid water and Men you've got to
get hard and then soften a bit doing
both will make it easier for both sexes
to love and be loved
