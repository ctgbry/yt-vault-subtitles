i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic today's short talk is how
to love without emotional attachment
now this is a topic that has been
requested many many times by my viewers
so i decided to do an episode about it
it's difficult to love without
attachment but it's extremely important
to learn to do so this is because if you
can't quite bring yourself to love
without attachment then you will either
resort to games of control
or resign yourself to the emotional
rollercoaster
by loving without attachment you can
maintain your peace and serenity and
enjoy relationships with those who
freely choose you in return sounds good
right so how do you do that
the way to love without attachment is
to treat people
like cats
cats come when they please not when you
call them
and they leave when they want if you try
to pick up a cat that doesn't want to
get picked up you're going to get the

[01:01]
get picked up you're going to get the
claws
and if you don't give attention to a cat
that wants it it's going to harass you
until you do
i like cats because i understand them
now where i live in my neighborhood
there is a neighborhood cat a siamese
and the two of us enjoy each other's
company probably at least in part
because i like to put milk out for it
i'm never really sure when i'll see it
again but if i put out good milk the cat
will come back cats don't pass up good
milk it's in their nature
so if i put out good milk consistently
the cat will come back and will enjoy
each other's company again it's kind of
sweet now
now
i have no idea what that cat gets up to
when it's not around but when the cat is
not there
i'm not thinking about it
i'm not worried about it i'm not
wondering if it misses me i'm not
suspicious that it's at somebody else's
house and that's because i have other
things to do with my life
i'm working on my businesses i'm going
to the gym i'm spending time with my
friends i'm living my life the cat is a

[02:01]
friends i'm living my life the cat is a
fun benefit
when it's there i'm with it completely
for a pleasant moment and when it's gone
it disappears entirely from my
consciousness
i'm not waiting for the cat to come back
but if i put out good milk it probably
will
now by now some people are probably
thinking okay orion but people aren't
cats you know
people have responsibilities and duties
and obligations and i mean what if that
cat is out there drinking someone else's
milk
well here's something to consider
if that cat is drinking someone else's
milk
that's not your cat
that cat does not belong to you that cat
belongs to the neighborhood
do you see
you have to be very very careful with
thoughts related to ownership in
relationship as this enters into the
conceptual territory of slavery i don't
believe in slavery i don't think it's
right or just
but you end up with emotional bondage

[03:00]
but you end up with emotional bondage
bondage is a synonym for slavery when
you cannot or will not love without
attachment
think about that it's a sad truth that
many people give more love and freedom
to their pets than to their partners
and humans need significantly more love
and freedom than animals do it's just
harder to give it to them
at the end of the day even a marriage
license doesn't entitle you to ownership
of the other person and trust me a
marriage license isn't nearly as useful
at securing a good relationship as is
consistently putting out good milk
back to the metaphor
cats like milk if you keep putting out
good milk the cat will keep coming back
and if you put out the best milk in the
neighborhood it will come to your house
first
now you can't really control if it goes
to someone else's house but it will be
less likely to do so if either it it's
not still hungry when it leaves
and or your milk is so much better than

[04:02]
and or your milk is so much better than
any other milk it could get in the
neighborhood that it kind of puts its
nose up in the air and passes it by
and just for the record it's the cat who
decides who has the best milk and the
cat communicates that judgment through
its actions
now
why do i put milk out because i want to
trap the cat in a lactose-exclusive
relationship
not really like i said i like cats i'm a
cat person i put milk out because i like
cats i'm not expecting anything in
return the cat will come back in its own
time and will enjoy each other's company
and if it doesn't well
some other cat will
because i put out good milk do you see
in this way by just putting goodness and
value out into the world you will never
belong without company
in some cases people will beat a path to
your door
and those who recognize the value in
what you give will come back every day

[05:02]
what you give will come back every day
of their own free will because they
can't get that milk anywhere else do you
understand it's the best milk around
and what happens with those you connect
with every day
you form relationships with them
and these folks stay in your life
because they choose you every day
and not because you somehow stop them
from leaving
but if for whatever reason you don't see
them again
be grateful for the good moments that
you had wish them well
and keep putting out good milk
another cat will be along presently
so there are a number of lessons here on
how to love without attachment as a
recap here are some of them first
put out good milk
second when the cat isn't there
go on with your life
third
beware of thinking
this is my cat and fourth
get comfortable with the fact that cats
come and go in their own time
this is how you love without attachment
