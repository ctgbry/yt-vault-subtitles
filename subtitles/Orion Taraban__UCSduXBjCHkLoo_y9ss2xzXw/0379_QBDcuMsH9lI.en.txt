I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
improve your motivation as a man
sorry ladies but this episode is really
just for the fellas but don't worry I'll
get to you next time
all right guys so there is actually a
very simple way to quickly and
significantly improve your motivation
regardless of your particular goal are
you ready here it is
all you need to do is stop masturbating
simple but not necessarily easy so let's
dive into this now why is this advice
particularly relevant for men and not
for women don't women masturbate well
they certainly do however the sexual
impulse is very different between men
and women men have what I would call a
sexual drive this is something that has
been baked into us from millions of
years of evolution and this drive is
more or less consistently active at a

[01:00]
more or less consistently active at a
high level except for the few minutes
immediately following orgasm
after a man ejaculates his system is
flooded with prolactin which is directly
associated with reduced desire for sex
impotence and even infertility in fact
men with abnormally high levels of
prolactin do not even produce sperm so
we see that this hormone is like a
circuit breaker for the sexual drive in
men and why men often feel the only
respite from sexual desire in their
lives immediately after climax
women are different for women the sexual
impulse is more like a mood when they're
in the mood they want it when they're
not in the mood they don't want it but
they don't seem to have this constant
unremitting desire for it like guys do
also when a woman orgasms her system is
flooded with oxytocin and serotonin
which are directly associated with
feelings of well-being and closeness on

[02:00]
feelings of well-being and closeness on
the other hand men's oxytocin levels as
well as their dopamine levels decrease
after masturbation which is probably one
of the reasons why men often feel so
guilty and icky after masturbating if
dopamine spikes are rewarding dopamine
drops or punishing whereas women tend to
feel relaxed and glow now before I go

my point here is that the sexual derive
is really only present in men and as
I've said this drive has emerged over
the course of millions of years of

[03:00]
the course of millions of years of
evolution on the other hand the rule of
law and the repression of civilization
is only a few thousand Euros old Max
men can no longer just take a woman if
he had the opportunity that behavior is
shall we say frowned upon in the Modern
Age however men's sexual drive
apparently hasn't gotten the memo
the upshot is that men have had to find
ways to channel their sexual energies to
more pro-social ends if a man does not
succeed in doing this he will become
increasingly frustrated or blocked and
over time this will eventually lead to
either some kind of self-defeating
implosion in which men sort of surrender
to despair which we see in the Modern
Age
or some kind of anti-social
transgression
which we also see in the Modern Age
not being able to successfully Channel

[04:00]
not being able to successfully Channel
or sublimate his sexual drive leads to
one or the other negative consequences
in men
the compromise solution for millions of
men is to masturbate this reduces the
frustration making both the two negative
outcomes I described less likely however
in reducing the frustration masturbation
also makes sublimation unnecessary and
Men kinda need the power of the
sublimated libido to accomplish great
things
libido the sex drive is like a powerful
Mustang full of vigor and strength by
itself this potency is useless even
destructive nothing can really be done
with a horse that's bucketing and
rearing all the time
masturbation is kind of like spooking
the horse so that it will Tire itself
out with running and therefore not cause
you any problems for a while
on the other hand sublimation is
discipline and a harness

[05:01]
discipline and a harness
submitting that Mustang to both and you
now have a terribly powerful engine on
your hands think about it libido is
actually the life force
six since sex creates life that kind of
makes sense so if a man harnessed his
life force in the service of his ends
what could he not accomplish look around
you the books on your shelf the
skyscrapers in your city the athleticism
on your screen all of these are products
of sublimation nothing great can be
accomplished quickly
that is why nothing great can be
accomplished without some constant
unremitting Drive capable of breaking
through resistance and rising to the
occasion
constant unremitting Drive rising to the
occasion now where might a man be able
to find that in himself
and how might that drive be squandered

[06:01]
and how might that drive be squandered
by his unwillingness to tolerate
frustration
now for some guys pornography and
masturbation is an addiction however for
most guys it's more like a vice or a bad
habit and quitting just requires some
effort and intentionality and like
stopping any other habit if you can go a
few months without indulging the new
Behavior becomes significantly easier to
maintain
and I'd argue that quitting masturbation
is most important
for the guys who likely use it the most
namely single men
why is that well if you are a single man
you don't really have a socially
acceptable release for your sexual
frustration
masturbation will temporarily release
you from that tension however as I said
earlier it also significantly reduces
your desire for sex so any motivation to
actually go out and find a human sexual
partner is significantly compromised
for straight men finding asexual partner
is a risky Endeavor It generally

[07:01]
is a risky Endeavor It generally
requires an expenditure of resources
time energy money as well as a certain
willingness to tolerate rejection and
disinterest
in this way finding a sexual partner is
a little like hunting in traditional
societies it's an uncertain and
expensive endeavor
so why do it
because you're hungry if people didn't
get hungry no one would consider the
risk and expense of hunting to be
justified to use a phrase the juice
wouldn't be worth the squeeze
however in my experience everyone
becomes a hunter if they get hungry
enough and some men in our society could
stand to get a little hungrier the fact
of the matter is that you won't feel
sexually frustrated if you sublimate
correctly however you need to feel at
least somewhat sexually frustrated in
order to sublimate and once you do that
it's like you're powered by this
miniature nuclear reactor it's a potent

[08:00]
miniature nuclear reactor it's a potent
and amazing feeling and one that I hope
all men can experience for themselves
