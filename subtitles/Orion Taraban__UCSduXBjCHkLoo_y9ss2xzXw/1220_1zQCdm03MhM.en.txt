I feel like it's important to admit to
ourselves and to society what men and
women actually want in long-term versus
short-term relationships. They want
something totally different. Sorry,
sorry to interrupt. Please do.
&gt;&gt; So, I I learned this personally. So, in
my early 20s, I was an actor living in
New York City and I was broke all the
time and I was living in public housing
in Brooklyn. Oh jeez.
&gt;&gt; And you know, monthto month just sort of
like trying to make ends meet so I could
live in New York for another month to
make ends meet. But I had no trouble
finding women to have sexual
relationships [music] with.
You do not need money to get women.
That's I know that 100%. I call things
like a fancy car or a 7 figure bank
account attraction proxies. All things
being equal, if we have two exactly the
same guys and this guy's broke and this
guy's a millionaire, of course the women
are going to choose the millionaire. But
men incorrectly believe that just having

[01:00]
men incorrectly believe that just having
a million dollars or a Ferrari means
that you get effortless sexual
opportunity. And that's not true. It's
not like they just line up in front of
the car until you like go out for a
drive and throw themselves at you.
[music] You still have to engage their
emotions. You still actually have to
listen to them and go through the whole
process. So back then when I had no
trouble attracting women, I wanted to
get married. I wanted a long-term
relationship. But none of the women,
they didn't even want to be my
girlfriend. They didn't even want people
to know that they were dating me. You
know what I'm saying? But but they were
coming over to my house seven nights a
week. Do you know what I'm saying?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Then fast forward a little bit. I clean
up my act. I move to California. I get
my doctorate. I start making decent
money. Now all the women want to get
married. And I just want to hook up.
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Oh man.
&gt;&gt; You know, so people kind of want what
they can't slash don't have because
that's what wanting means. It means both
to lack and to desire.
