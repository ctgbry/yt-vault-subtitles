i'm dr o'reilly and taraban and this is
psychx better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the path is already there
so this is an insight that came to me
while i was on the pacific crest trail
for those of you who don't know the
pacific crest trail is a nearly 2700
mile long hiking trail that runs from
mexico to canada along the western coast
of the united states it's very
challenging and it can take six or seven
months to hike continuously
so every single day it can feel like
you're making very little progress
towards your ultimate goal sometimes the
path doesn't even tend north it takes
detours to the west or even to the south
and it can feel like you're just never
going to get there
it was in a moment like this that i
realized that as difficult and
time-consuming as the journey was for me
the path was already at the destination
like the trail the literal thing i was
standing on was already where i wanted
to be

[01:00]
to be
that was a profound moment of
realization for me because if the path
is already there well a couple of things
happen
one
i can trust the process
the trail might turn west or south but
if it ends up in canada then what's the
problem in fact there might be good
reasons for these detours that i just
can't see from my current vantage point
and two
my arrival is assured
if the trail is already at the
destination then all i really have to do
is put one foot in front of the other
in some sense i can't not arrive as long
as i keep moving
it's a simple insight that's easily
generalizable to life
