Can you be both loved and the lover?
&gt;&gt; It's possible. It's difficult to do.
Like you technically you probably can't
do it simultaneously. Like the moment
that I'm receiving, I can't also be
giving.
&gt;&gt; Mhm. We talk about that sometimes with
our own love. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Because that would also be a
invalidation of your gift. It feels good
to give, right? Which means that you
need to be with someone who can take.
And if I just as soon as I receive
something, give something back, which is
generally what people do with something
like a compliment. Most people can't
even take a compliment. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You say, "I'm just, oh, but it's nothing
about you. You look fantastic." You
know, but on some level it invalidates
your gift
&gt;&gt; because I just sort of like paved it
over with my own. It's also, I think,
interesting to be able to just sit in
receiving
&gt;&gt; without necessarily having to give it
back. You might give it back tomorrow or
you know a week from now but just like
in that moment just take it in.
&gt;&gt; Schedule the compliment in the future.
In 5 days I will say it back. For now
it's [laughter] all about me.
