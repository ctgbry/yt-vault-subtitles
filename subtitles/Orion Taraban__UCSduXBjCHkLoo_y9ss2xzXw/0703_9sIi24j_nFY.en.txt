I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is write
your own invitation what does this mean
this means that if you want an in
somewhere if you want to be accepted by
a certain group or individual you
generally can't wait for an invitation
to come to you you will need to write
your own invitation and you do that by
creating something of sufficient value
to motivate the person or group you want
to get in with to come to you or at
least to recognize that you exist if you
do not do this if you do not cultivate
sufficient value then you will remain
invisible to that group or person I
guarantee
it and to illustrate what this might
look like we're going to take a peak
behind the curtain and discuss some of
my motivations in creating this channel
now the primary mission of this channel

[01:00]
now the primary mission of this channel
is was and will be to reduce the amount
of unnecessary suffering on this planet
like that's not going to change and
while this might sound very Noble let's
also not pretend that I wasn't motivated
by my own self-interested concerns as
well however these concerns weren't more
money I was already making pretty good
income in my private practice or fame
I'm actually fairly introverted by
Nature what I wanted was to be able to
meet some of the the people that I
respected and
admired I heard some people talking on
YouTube and in The Wider sphere of
social discourse and I thought I would
like to have a conversation with them
these people are talking about things
that I'm interested in and I actually
know a lot about I would like a seat at
that table to talk to interesting people
about things that I care about how cool
would that be that was my personal
motivation in starting psycha and to do

[02:00]
motivation in starting psycha and to do
this I worked for a few years without
any reward recognition or payment that's
how much I wanted it and I did this
because I knew I had to do this like
imagine I just sent a cold email to one
of these famous and important
individuals and I said hey you don't
know me but you really should I'm a
psychologist and an expert in
relationships and I'd love for the two
of us to get together so I can share my
ideas about intersexual Dynamics and we
can have a high L discussion on our
differences and commonalities let me
know when you're free like no one would
ever respond let alone take me
up on the offer and it's not because I
didn't know what I was talking about or
because we wouldn't have had a fantastic
conversation or because we couldn't even
have become friends or at least
acquaintances it's because I was a
random nobody and irrespective of what I
did or did not know or what I could or
could not do there was no way I could

[03:01]
could not do there was no way I could
access those people while I remained a
random
nobody the way to get an invitation to
that table was to build something of
such sufficient value that it wouldn't
be a loss for these people to interact
with me and trust me it would have been
a loss successful intelligent
interesting busy people have lots of
places to go and lots of people to see
consequently they have to make choices
about how to spend their time and
allocate their attention and it would be
irrational for them to give me their
time and attention as long as more
potentially rewarding opportunities were
available the opportunity cost would
just be too great so to offset that cost
I needed to be able to offer something
of value to these people to make an
interaction with me more competitive in
the context of their overarching
optionality and that's something what
the ability to command an audience with

[04:02]
the ability to command an audience with
respect to making decisions about their
time this was more important than any of
the ideas I might discuss with them do
you understand even if these people
might have genuinely and
enthusiastically been interested in
talking to me about certain things it
never would have happened had I not been
able to provide that audience which is
the value that prevents the conversation
from inflicting a loss the par parallels
to other types of relationships
especially sexual relationships should
be
obvious if you appreciate the insights
on this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice

[05:00]
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description to access certain
opportunities it is essential that you
cultivate sufficient value to justify
the interaction and you will likely need
to assume the risk and expense of doing
so in advance of the invitation now this
is important for all people to
understand but it is especially
important for men to understand as we
are often told we are currently in the
midst of a male loneliness epidemic and
just to be clear this doesn't just mean
single men sitting at home alone on the
couch some of the loneliest men I know
are married with kids in fact the more
people around you who don't see you or
accept accept you the lonier you tend to

[06:02]
accept accept you the lonier you tend to
be in any case there are a lot of lonely
men out there and why is that it's not
like men don't value male friendship my
male friends are some of the most
important people in my life however men
do tend to prioritize their friendships
rather low like when a friend hangs out
with me he doesn't get laid he doesn't
get paid he doesn't get stronger he
doesn't build a legacy with his children
do you see I could be the coolest
bestest friend in the world but I'm
still going to be the eighth highest
priority for my male friends and this is
because men are making value
calculations about how to spend their
time and attention which is entirely
rational For Better or Worse men don't
seem to Value connection for the sake of
connection as much as women do which is
a big part of why women aren't suffering
in the same
way now it's hard to make new friends
especially as an adult man but going to

[07:00]
especially as an adult man but going to
share the secret of how to do so with
you today the way to make new friends as
a man is to figure out how to Parlay
your value into a
relationship it's the value proposition
that bumps you up several points in
men's internal calculations which will
significantly increase the likelihood
that you will have more interactions
that could potentially lead to
friendships on the surface this just
looks like a professional thing and
sometimes it is like in my case
sometimes I show up for an interview we
do the talk and I never hear from them
again but that's actually pretty rare
what happens in the vast majority of
cases is that there is a lot of back and
forth leading up to the interview and a
fair amount of interaction both before
and after the recording and generally
some socializing dinner drinks
afterwards in some cases it's almost
like the interview was kind of the
excuse to hang out with each other

[08:00]
excuse to hang out with each other
and we typically stay in touch from that
point on and while I wouldn't say that
many of them are friends I've only met
some of them very recently we are
certainly on friendly terms and the
longer that goes on the more the
relationship will tend in that direction
my dudes if I can do it you can do it
this is the secret as I say in my book
it is neither the good nor the loving
nor The Virtuous who are desired for
relationships but the people
whom others want things from if you want
to be rich in relationships you will
need to be willing and able to provide
value this is not necessarily because
everyone is greedy and materialistic at
a certain point people tend to have more
than enough you need to be able to
provide value in order to offset the
loss you would constitute without it do
this and people will make space for you
and in their busy and successful lives

[09:01]
and in their busy and successful lives
for most of us there is no other way to
get in the game what do you think does
