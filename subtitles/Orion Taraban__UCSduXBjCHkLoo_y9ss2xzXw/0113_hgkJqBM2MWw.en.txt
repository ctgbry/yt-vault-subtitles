i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
sleep and death
in greek mythology
hypnos the god of sleep and thanatos the
god of death were twin brothers
i like to keep this in mind when i work
with folks with death anxiety the fear
of dying
and i actually find that this fear is
more prevalent among young people than
it is among old people
even a child can think
one day i will die
but a full emotional appreciation of the
fact that one's own death is unavoidable
and inescapable generally occurs in the
late teens to early 20s
and this can be quite difficult to pass
through
many will ultimately see this as a
positive experience however few would
likely argue that it's a comfortable one
now
as i've said
younger people tend to fear death more
than older people why is that

[01:01]
than older people why is that
well from the perspective of the 20 year
old death which at least could
potentially occur at any time
where to come now would take 60 70 good
years of life
contrast that with the 80 year old who
may already have lived a full and happy
life this isn't to say that 80 year olds
aren't or can't be afraid of death but
in their cases there just is less time
left to lose
so the stakes are lower relative to the
younger person
even though the 20 year old is at
significantly less risk of dying than is
the 80 year old that's not always how
death is held psychologically
and the concept of stakes indicates why
this might be the case so this is where
death anxiety in young people comes from
now
why else might an 80 year old have less
death anxiety well i think for a similar
reason why we generally don't resist
sleep at the end of a long day

[02:00]
sleep at the end of a long day
if it's 11 a.m and we're forced to go to
bed we would probably protest
he wouldn't be tired yet and we would
likely still have more to do
but if we were to work all day
until arriving in the evening with a
feeling of connection and accomplishment
if it were if we were in short to feel
as though our time were spent well then
sleep becomes a welcome respite
it's something that most of us even look
forward to at the end of the day sleep
is rest after a day well spent
well that's potentially true both on the
scale of a day
and on the scale of a life
and to bring it back around i think
that's why sleep and death are twin
brothers in greek mythology
the practice of embracing sleep at the
end of the day
is training
for embracing death at the end of our
lives
sleep
is practice for death
since the two are twins that is
practically indistinguishable

[03:01]
practically indistinguishable
and the best way to approach death is
also the best way to approach sleep
as a welcome rest at the end of
well-spent time
so don't hold back
use your time while you have it folks
