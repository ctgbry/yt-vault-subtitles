I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is a simple
anxiety reduction technique let's do
some ruthless gardening today and
discuss an easy way to experience less
anxiety in your everyday life to do this
we'll need to understand some of the
differences between the concepts of want
and
need need at the end of the day is
associated with survival there are very
few things that we actually need in life
we need some food we need water we need
some measure of safety and shelter and
living in society we need some money to
acquire those things and beyond that
there's not much that we need so the
concept of need is related to
survival and that means that it's
psychologically associated with
dissolution and Death on the other hand
the concept of want or desire being

[01:01]
the concept of want or desire being
related to acquisition and growth is
psychologically associated with
assimilation and life now in many
respects need and want are kind of like
two sides of the same coin however which
side you choose to focus on can make an
enormous difference in the experience of
your everyday life for instance a person
might Harbor the belief I need to be
rich if you feel into this statement you
can sense a lowgrade anxiety permeating
this belief and that's because when we
use the concept of need there is an
implied threat that if it doesn't happen
something very bad will occur you can
almost imagine this like mental slave
driver whipping people into shape in
order to avoid the imagined catastrophic
outcome now contrast that with this
belief I want to be rich

[02:00]
belief I want to be rich
the truth is that you don't have to
avoid a negative like poverty in order
to want to make money rich people want
to make money I like this reframe
because it doesn't require it doesn't
invite in the negative as a necessary
motivating force there is no ill to be
avoided just a good to be acquired by
transforming need statements into want
statements we learn to focus more and
more on the positive things in life that
we want to secure as opposed to the
negative things we want to avoid and
this is important because what we focus
on becomes the content of our
Consciousness the stuff out of which our
reality is constructed Moment by moment
if we focus on ills to be avoided by
misapplying the concept of need then
reality becomes a dangerous place full
of bad things lurking around every

[03:01]
of bad things lurking around every
corner and how would that not exacerbate
a form of generalized anxiety on the
other hand if we focus on the good to be
acquired by utilizing the concept of
want then reality becomes an abundant
Place full of resources and
opportunities so instead of looking for
what you need to avoid search for what
you want to find and a good way to do
this is to become incre inly Mindful and
intentional in our use of these
important
Concepts what do you think remember to
