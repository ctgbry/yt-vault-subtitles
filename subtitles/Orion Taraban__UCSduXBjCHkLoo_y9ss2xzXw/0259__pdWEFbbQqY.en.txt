in the two kinds of dates abc defgh asks
if you only have one chance with a man
should you go all out or be a bit
reserved as a woman you should
go all out
this is very similar to a shark tank
scenario
you have a pitch to some high-powered
business executives
it took a lot to get this meeting on the
books they say i'm a very
we're very busy people you have three
minutes
wow me are you gonna hold back
you better have practiced your
three-minute pitch to this to a and
polished it to a mirror sheen because if
they don't like what they hear in the
first few minutes you're not gonna get a
fourth
and the same basic premise holds true
whether it's a professional opportunity
or a romantic opportunity you have to be
able to demonstrate very quickly that
you can deliver what the other person
wants
or else they're not going to give you a
second chance it's that simple
