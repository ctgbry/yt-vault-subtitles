I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to be
wise so this is a question that has come
up repeatedly not only in the comments
on this channel but in individual
consultations as well people have
expressed their curiosity as to how it
is I've learned the things that I talk
about on this channel I certainly didn't
learn them from a book let alone grad
school
and I usually respond that to the extent
that I am wise I am wise through pain
and insight
that's the secret recipe for wisdom pain
plus insight some people think that
wisdom is simply the result of
experience or age and that is certainly
not true the world is full of old fools
that might feel disrespectful but simply
not dying does not automatically confer
wisdom nor does having a variety of
experiences many people pass through
their lives more or less on autopilot
their various experiences don't register

[01:01]
their various experiences don't register
any more deeply than a factual memory
by the same token simply experiencing
pain is generally not sufficient to
generate wisdom either
here's why everyone experiences pain
most people have an incorrect attitude
towards it pain is the gift that nobody
wants pain is your greatest teacher in
life
pain is the universe giving you feedback
that you need to pay attention to a
particular aspect of your life because
pain is a signal that your model of
reality is incorrect
and pain is your opportunity to bring
that model into closer Conformity with
the way things really are if you can
alter your relationship with pain you
will accelerate your self-development
100 fold
so what prevents people from using the
opportunity inherent in pain well there
are many potential obstructions but
three principal ones

[02:01]
three principal ones
the first principle obstruction is that
some people are so stubborn or arrogant
or ideologically possessed that they
double down on their incorrect version
of reality they continue to believe that
their right despite their pain they hold
on to the belief that the way they think
things should be is how reality should
in fact operate they chide reality for
deviating from their models rather than
hold their models accountable for
deviating from reality
pain is reality chiding you from having
a deviant model do you understand so
arrogance and ideological possession can
prevent people from entering into this
opportunity
the second principle obstruction is that
some people just see pain as something
to bear
now there is a time and a place to grit
your teeth and carry your cross and
tolerate the pain of existence

[03:00]
tolerate the pain of existence
but if you simply tolerate pain if you
simply bear it then you might not
cultivate any curiosity about why you
may be in pain to begin with you just
kind of think of it as a burden you need
to carry for as long as you have to and
so the pain is sort of a wasted
opportunity
what I've discovered is that a great
deal of the pain that exists on this
planet is due to the fact that people
don't know why they're in pain
there is a saying that ignorance is
bliss no it's not a crying baby is not
Blissful most people are suffering
because like the infant they don't know
why they're suffering if they knew why
they were suffering Not only would they
quickly and significantly reduce their
suffering but they could also
potentially generate meaning and
cultivate wisdom as well
and the third principle obstruction is
that many people just simply try to
avoid the pain entirely this is of
course understandable pain is an

[04:01]
course understandable pain is an
unpleasant or even an excruciating
emotion
the issue is that when people try to
avoid the pain either with drugs and
alcohol or with hedonic pleasure or with
social media in video games or with sex
and excitement or with money and career
all of these are forms of anesthesia
offered by your culture
people also avoid the lesson inherent in
the pain and the thing about anesthesia
is that it doesn't eliminate suffering
just like in a surgery even if you're
anesthetized your body still suffers
your body is still traumatized
anesthesia doesn't really make the pain
go away it just sort of cuts your
Consciousness off from your actual
embodied experience
which is actually kind of crazy making
and that's why people who anesthetize
themselves for years tend to go a little
nutty
they've cut themselves off from their

[05:00]
they've cut themselves off from their
embodied experience for so long if they
were to remove the anesthesia Not only
would they have to deal with the flood
of accumulated pain which could be
overwhelming but what they'd have to
deal with the fact that they haven't
learned how to trust let alone make
sense of their embodied experience
and if you can't trust your own
experience what can you trust
Authority science
religion
nothing
I wonder what the world would look like
if billions of people couldn't trust
their own common sense

[06:00]
couldn't do it without you and I really
appreciate your support thank you
so
what's the alternative
I'd like you to consider that pain is an
opportunity to cultivate wisdom
why because pain is essentially feedback
from the universe that your mental model
is not in line with reality it's
information that you're bumping up
against something that you're straying
from the truth that you don't quite
understand things perfectly yet pain is
painful by Design in order to attract
your attention and that attention should
stimulate curiosity why am I in pain
what decisions did I make that preceded
this experience of suffering what were
the cognitive emotional and behavioral
antecedents that led me to this point in
my life this curiosity should look very
closely and without Judgment at the
various factors that led to the
experience of pain
this is the opportunity to generate
Insight like the practice of looking at

[07:00]
Insight like the practice of looking at
yourself closely and without judgment is
insight and the more you practice
Insight the more insightful you get and
with Insight comes a host of good things
once you clarify the chain of events
that led to the experience of pain not
only should that understanding reduce
your experience of suffering now but it
should allow you to make better
decisions to avoid unnecessary suffering
in the future
furthermore you can kind of operate
under the assumption that you're not all
that different from every other person
on the planet and so through careful
observation of your own experience you
can kind of reverse engineer every other
person on the planet you may not be able
to get it exactly right but with
sufficient practice you'll be able to
get pretty close
and this is really important because For
Better or For Worse other people are a
black box to us even if we were to cut
them open we wouldn't really find
anything of use to us there you know
what I'm saying the experience of their
thoughts emotions and Consciousness is

[08:01]
thoughts emotions and Consciousness is
irreducibly inaccessible to us we can't
ever truly know the inner workings of
another person but we can potentially
know our own inner workings very clearly
and very deeply and this self-knowledge
is the most reliable Pathway to other
knowledge as well as to empathy kindness
and compassion that I'm aware of
the self-knowledge born of accurate
Insight allows for better relationships
and a higher degree of Effectiveness
whatever your goals happen to be this is
because accurate Insight should lead to
a reduction in pain which is a sign that
your mental models are increasingly
coming into alignment with reality
this allows you to act with effortless
Effectiveness which is the most reliable
signal of wisdom that I am aware of it's
a kind of Life mastery
the seed of wisdom is curiosity about
your pain and it is cultivated through

[09:00]
your pain and it is cultivated through
the increasingly masterful application
of insight
and this process can be accelerated by
swallowing your pride this is because
the assumptions required for curiosity
may be my model of reality is incorrect
maybe I've contributed to my own
suffering maybe I don't know what I
don't know all of these assumptions
require a lot of humility the humility
to admit at least to yourself that you
don't know everything
and that you're not perfect and that
some people might even know more than
you or might be a little further along
the path than you
these people needn't be threats they
could be mentors
they could be like big brothers or Big
Sisters folks who well certainly
imperfect might be a little further down
the road
and so you see when people ask me how I
know the things I know I usually respond
because of pain
I've been in a lot of pain and in a lot
of different flavors of pain and my own
selfish desire to escape that pain has

[10:02]
selfish desire to escape that pain has
led me over the years to cultivate
insight to a very refined degree which
may have produced some degree of wisdom
