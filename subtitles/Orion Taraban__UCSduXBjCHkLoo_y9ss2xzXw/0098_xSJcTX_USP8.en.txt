i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the gift of your absence
sometimes this is the gift that you have
to give people who for whatever reason
have temporarily forgotten your value
when someone close to you has become
disrespectful
unappreciative
withdrawn or unjustifiably critical
there is a human impulse to invest more
energy in the relationship to try harder
to win back the approval of the
dissatisfied individual
and sometimes this is right and
necessary so it's important to examine
your own behavior are you comporting
yourself in a way you can be proud of
are you meeting your obligations
are you an honest and caring friend or a
loving and supportive partner
if not the behavior of the other person
is valuable feedback and you may need to
course correct
however if you feel like you can answer
all of those questions in the

[01:00]
all of those questions in the
affirmative then rather than work harder
in order to try to disabuse this person
of his or her devaluation
it might be necessary to give this
person at least for a time
the gift of your absence
if you're a good friend colleague or
partner and you make yourself scarce
then what often happens is that people
will miss you and they will remember why
they were in a relationship with you to
begin with
on the other hand
if you devolve to the level of the
unjustifiably unappreciative other
and sulk and complain and chastise and
punish
then no one will miss you if you storm
off in a huff
quite the contrary they'll feel relieved
that you're gone
i appreciate that it's easier said than
done but if you can exercise sufficient
emotional self-control to give others
your best
and then take yourself out of the
relationship if you feel you can no

[02:00]
relationship if you feel you can no
longer do that
you'll succeed in giving people the gift
of your absence
this will help them to remember your
value and to re-engage with the
relationship as a mature reciprocator
i will say that this has an almost 100
percent success rate
sometimes it takes months sometimes it
takes years but in almost every case
those to whom i have given the gift of
my absence come back say that they've
missed me and attempt to resume the
relationship
now whether i choose to do so depends on
a number of factors however at this
point it at least becomes an option on
the table
something to keep in mind
