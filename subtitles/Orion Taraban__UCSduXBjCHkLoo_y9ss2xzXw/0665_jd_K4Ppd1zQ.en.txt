I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why
dating apps are making it harder to date
so if you weren't aware you should know
that I published my first book just a
few days ago it's called the value of
others and it's the product of nearly 10
years of deep critical thinking and
research on the subject of mating and
dating basically I attempt to provide a
single model to explain the behavior of
both men and women in the sexual
Marketplace which is no easy task the
book is not a recapitulation of ideas
I've already presented on this channel
it's overwhelmingly new content and I
don't expect to discuss this content on
the channel moving forward however to
give my audience a taste of what's in
the book I'm going to put out a few
episodes that touch on ideas you'll find
within its Pages this is one of them so
if you like what you hear you might
consider buying the ebook the audiobook

[01:02]
consider buying the ebook the audiobook
or the paperback version of the book
links in the description below and be
sure to listen to the end of this
episode for the
kicker all right so lots of people
struggle on dating apps for lots of
different reasons which can be
surprising as the idea that dating apps
are actually making it harder to date is
counterintuitive on some level it's
never been easier in the history of the
world to have direct access to more po
potential mates than it is today you
just switch on the magic rectangle you
carry around in your pocket and boom you
instantly have access to thousands of
single and not so single people in your
area ostensibly looking for love in fact
we've seen a dramatic uptick in the
proportion of couples who met online in
the past decade 10 years ago about 20%
of American couples met online now it's
around 50% so most couples now meet
online and that frequency has more than

[02:01]
online and that frequency has more than
doubled in just the past 10
years however across that same time
period we've seen an equally dramatic
downturn in the frequency of all kinds
of sexual relationships over the past
decade fewer people are getting married
fewer people are getting into
relationships and surprisingly fewer
people are even hooking up some of these
numbers are at historically
unprecedented lows so while it's only a
correlative find
it's highly suggestive the more people
rely on dating apps for sexual
relationships of all kinds the fewer
sexual relationships are actually
transacted so why might that be it's not
the whole story but I'm going to advance
a simple economic argument to explain
why dating apps unintentionally create
fewer relationships it kind of goes like
this in the sexual Marketplace men are
fundamentally attempting to exchange
resources for sexual opportunity and

[03:01]
resources for sexual opportunity and
women are fundamentally attempting to
exchange their sexual opportunity for
resources in many respects the
incentives of men and women are actually
antagonistic to each other that is men
attempt to get as much sexual
opportunity for as few resources as
possible and women generally attempt to
secure as many resources for as little
sexual opportunity as possible and the
negotiation phase of any courtship
process no matter how brief or extended
is function an attempt to sus out who
gets what for how much and just like in
the commercial Marketplace the
perception of supply and demand
interacts with this fundamental reality
in the sexual
Marketplace let's first consider the
experience on a dating app from the
man's perspective within his
subjectivity when he engages with an app
he is one man interacting with a
functionally infinite number of women he
neither perceives nor interacts with any

[04:00]
neither perceives nor interacts with any
other men so he encounters no
intersexual competition on an app it's
just him and an endless supply of women
which gives him the impression that it's
a buyers
Market just like in a commercial
Marketplace apparently playing with
fewer buyers than sellers drives down
the cost of the proposed transaction as
a result men reasonably come to believe
that somewhere in the sea of infinite
optionality is a a more attractive
option who will be willing to transact
her sexual opportunity for fewer
resources and he's right there is just
like in a global economy there is always
someone who will be willing to do the
same job for less money in the
unregulated sexual economy there is
always a woman who will be willing to
transact her sexual opportunity for
fewer
resources ultimately this creates a race
to the bottom in which a greater
proportion of men are emboldened to

[05:01]
proportion of men are emboldened to
transact directly for women's sexual
opportunity for little to no resources
in Exchange men's subjective perception
on dating apps in combination with
rational economic principles creates the
[ __ ] boy phenomenon from his perspective
given the ratio of buyers to sellers he
should be able to secure sex at Bargain
Basement prices and he's not necessarily
wrong now before I go any further if

let's get back to
it next let's now consider the
experience on a dating app from the
woman's perspective within her
subjectivity when she engages with an
app she is one woman interacting with a
functionally infinite number of men she
neither perceives nor interacts with any
other women so she encounters no
intersexual competition on the app it's
just her and an endless supply of men
many of whom whom are apparently
extremely eager to transact for her
opportunity which gives her the
impression that it's a sellers Market
just like in a commercial Marketplace
apparently playing with fewer sellers
than buyers drives up the proposed
transaction as a result women reasonably
come to believe that somewhere in the
sea of infinite optionality is a more
attractive option who will be willing to
transact more resources for the same
sexual

[07:00]
sexual
opportunity and she's right there is
just like in a global economy there is
always someone who will be willing to
pay more for the same good somewhere
which is the principle that makes
mercantilism or geoarbitrage possible in
the unregulated sexual economy there is
always a man who will be willing to
transact more resources for a given
sexual
opportunity ultimately this creates
hyperinflation in which a greater
proportion of women are emboldened to
transact for men's resources for little
to no sexual opportunity women's
subjective perception on dating apps in
combination with rational economic
principles creates the gold digger
phenomenon from her perspective given
the ratio of sellers to buyers she
should be able to command a premium for
her sexual
opportunity and she's not necessarily
wrong and just to be clear any woman who

[08:00]
wrong and just to be clear any woman who
comes right out of the gate asking for a
committed relationship is on the gold
digger Spectrum like I can understand
why women are insulted when men just
proposition them for sex from a woman's
perspective such men are trying to get
value for nothing however women
demanding a significant relationship
upfront is even more ludicrous as male
commitment is far more expensive than
female sexual opportunity into today's
dating Market from Men's perspective
such women are trying to get a lot of
value for nothing so what's the upshot
because of the differences in their
subjective experiences while using
dating apps and because of the
differences in their gendered incentives
to engage in the sexual Marketplace what
ends up happening is that men and women
are growing increasingly Divergent in
their valuations of sex and commitment
men think sex should cost this much
women think sex should cost this much

[09:03]
women think sex should cost this much
and they're both right at least within
their respective
subjectivities but here's the thing when
people get too far away from each other
in terms of
valuation they can't do business with
each other if one side wants to buy for
a dollar and the other wants to sell for
a million they're not going to meet in
the middle since the middle is just too
far away from either one of their
anchorings in fact one of the
fundamental principles of the book is
that people enter into Relationships by
transacting unequal Goods of comparable
value the more incomparable the
valuations the less likely the
relationship and if the two parties are
too far away from each other in terms of
their valuations then there are no
grounds for a negotiation at all so
nothing gets transacted practically
speaking this would mean to a
significant reduction this would lead to
a significant reduction in all forms of
sexual relationships from marriages to

[10:01]
sexual relationships from marriages to
one night's dance and this would only
make sense if men attempt to secure
sexual opportunity for resources in the
sexual Marketplace and women attempt to
secure resources for sexual opportunity
in the
same thanks for watching all the way to
the end of the episode so what's the
kicker the kicker is that the idea
presented in this episode constitutes
just three paragraphs of my 432 page
book book another way to say the same
thing is that my book the value of
others is equivalent to 500 unreleased
fulllength psyx episodes it's packed
full of unflinching truths about the
sexual Marketplace and the game of
meeting and dating so if you like what
