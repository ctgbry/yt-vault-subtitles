I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
lead your woman at this point in my life
based on both my personal and
professional experience I can state with
a high degree of conviction that sexual
relationships between men and women tend
to thrive when the man is confidently
and respectfully leading the
relationship that said in today's day
and age it can be difficult for many
women to follow follow this is because
they believe that if a man leads they
will need to submit to male Authority
and while this isn't entirely untrue it
is invested with a fear that may not be
wholly justified in many cases it may
even be in the woman's best interests to
follow however the men in question need
to approach this with sufficient
knowledge and tact in order to allay
their anxieties in today's episode I'll
be speaking to Men on how to do just
that there are two things that men have

[01:01]
that there are two things that men have
to do in order to lead their women and
since leadership is so important and
obvious in a military context I'll be
making a number of analogies to that
discipline in this talk to explain these
core principles first and foremost men
if you want to lead your woman you have
to be more competent than she is like
you have to be the better leader or else
why the are you in that role and
this is actually no small thing as there
are many very competent and capable
women out there as women continue to
develop their own competencies the bar
is constantly being raised for male
leadership good like a little healthy
competition never hurt anyone ladies I
want you at your best because as far as
you can go I can go further as high as
you can climb I can go higher and as
good as you can

[02:00]
good as you can
I can be better if you're tough I'll be
tougher if you're brave I'll be braver
if you're kind I'll be kinder like I
will justify my leadership by being at
the very least just a little bit ahead
of you and the better you are the more
powerful the go for my own
self-development which is wonderful
really like I wouldn't be the man I am
today without your often ruthless
discrimination and this in my opinion is
the only legitimate basis of any
leadership Merit so the best way to get
a woman to accept your leadership men is
to become men worth
following because in the absence of that
how do those without Merit attempt to
secure obedience by reminding others of
their place of authority in the military
this is called pulling rank which is
when you remind someone beneath you in
the chain of command that you're their

[03:01]
the chain of command that you're their
Superior officer and they have a duty to
obey you like no Commander actually
wants to have to do that because if he
has to resort to that tactic it means
that he has lost the hearts and minds of
his soldiers who no longer see him as a
leader and follow him out of loyalty why
would you need to remind your
subordinates that you're their Superior
like why would they have
forgotten what's more pulling rank
generally just increases resentment in
your
subordinates now the equivalent to
pulling rank in sexual relationships is
insisting that women should follow you
just because you're a man this is
arguing that women have some kind of
moral obligation to obbey you because
you have a dick my dudes they do not
have such a moral obligation like that
only works in some very specific
religious traditions and both parties
need to be consenting participants in
that tradition for that to work it also

[04:02]
that tradition for that to work it also
begs the question why would you need to
remind your woman that you're the man
like why would she have
forgotten insisting that women should
obey you just because you're a man is
kind of like I don't know a medical
doctor insisting that everyone should
uncritically follow his advice because
he's an authority like that I'm not
an idiot give me a reason to obey you
show me that your leadership is
necessary or prudent or wise and I will
follow
enthusiastically if the only argument
you can give is your ascribed position
then it's probably best that you remain
quiet for the time being work on
capturing hearts and minds and you will
never have to remind people of whatever
Authority has been ascribed to you
because at that point your Authority has
actually become very tenuous so that's
the first
thing if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage

[05:00]
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description the second thing that's
important for men to appreciate with
respect to leading their women is the
necessity of understanding Their
audience in a military context this
means never giving an order that either
cannot or will not be obeyed follow that
rule and you will never have a problem
with obedience

[06:00]
with obedience
ever now there's obviously two parts to
that so let's break it down the first
part is to never give an order that
can't be followed this is really
important officers need to understand
the skill sets the talents and the
liabilities of those under their command
why tell the Gunner to patch up the
wounded or order the medic to pick up
the machine gun like in the absence of
dire necessity that's a very stupid idea
the person you are commanding literally
might not be able to do the thing you
are commanding them to do and becoming
more forceful in your commands isn't
going to change that with respect to
sexual relationships the Trap here is to
think that your woman should be able to
do this like what's your proof of that
on some level when leading a woman you
have to act like a good coach a good
coach deeply understands the skill level
of those he coaches and he encourages
them to go just a little bit further

[07:01]
them to go just a little bit further
than what they've shown themselves to be
capable of in the past the total scope
of what can be achieved is not bounded
by what has already been accomplished it
also stretches a little bit past that
and this is why people benefit from good
coaches they help them grow and succeed
at higher levels and when a coach helps
bring out the best in us we are very
grateful for that coach's presence in
our lives we follow them less because
they're the the coach and more because
following them has proven to be
beneficial to us so a good order must be
within the realm of possibility given an
accurate understanding of the abilities
of the person in
question and the second part of this
piece of advice is to never give an
order that won't be followed and this
really has to do with understanding the
current circumstances you're passing
through like a good coach knows when to
push his athletes it's not really for
the athletes to decide it's for the

[08:00]
the athletes to decide it's for the
coach to decide and the coach also knows
when to give his athletes deep rest
after that kind of activity a bad leader
is a slave driver who just whips and
whips and whips to ensure that his
commands are followed a good leader
knows when to give rests and rewards and
praise the leader who doesn't is a
tyrant and a tyrant will grow to be
hated if possible you never want to get
into a power struggle with your woman
this is because you don't have any real
recourse like in the military at the end
of the day you have the capacity to
execute a punishment on insubordinate
who decide they will not follow an order
and have become disobedient however in a
voluntary consensual at will romantic
relationship you can't really do that in
fact you can really only do that in
romantic relationships through emotional
manipulation which people do all the
time but which I think lacks in
integrity and ultimately degrades the

[09:01]
integrity and ultimately degrades the
quality of the
relationship in my opinion it's better
not to ask a woman for anything she's
not willing to do and if you think Orion
well why the would I be in a
relationship if she's not willing to do
the thing that I want her to do and I
would answer yeah why the would you
be in that relationship my dude go out
and find someone who wants to do the
thing you want them to do like that's
the secret as I say in my book
90% of a successful relationship is
selection find the woman who
enthusiastically wants to do what you
want her to do trust me she's out there
though you may have to improve your
value proposition to find her and you
may be able to find her in today's day
and age though you will still need to
sift through a lot of chaff to discover
her and there it is gentlemen to lead
your woman you need to be more competent
than she is and you need to learn how to
give orders that neither cannot nor will
not be

[10:01]
not be
disobeyed good luck out there soldiers
