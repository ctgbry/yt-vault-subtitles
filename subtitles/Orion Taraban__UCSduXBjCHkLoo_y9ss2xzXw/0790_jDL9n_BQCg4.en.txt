I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is where the
battle is won and lost so here we are in
the new year and many of you will be
motivated to make some changes in your
lives this could be starting a new good
habit or stopping an old bad habit both
are good though as I've said before
you'll get more bang for your disciplin
buck by stopping that bad habit than
starting that good one in any case today
I'm going to be speaking on where the
battle for this behavioral change is so
often won or lost and how best to emerge
Victorious now in my personal and
professional experience a lot of the
issues that people run into with respect
to behavioral change take place in this
10c window of time before they decide to
do or not do something the outcome of
this 10-second battle often determines

[01:01]
this 10-second battle often determines
what people will do for the next hour or
so and what people do for the next hour
or so can either solidify a behavior
into a habit just a little bit more or
undermine good progress made up until
that point both virtues and vices are
habits and habits are formed by what we
consistently do and when we lose these
little battles we strengthen the habit
of inconsist Y and weaken our will to
action not good so the First Council is
not to take this 10-second battle
lightly winning or losing this Skirmish
has much bigger consequences than might
be immediately apparent the good news is
you just have to get through that
10-second
battle now the reason why people tend to
lose this 10-second battle is that they
open this little door in their minds
sometimes just to crack and entertain

[02:01]
sometimes just to crack and entertain
the possibility of not doing the thing
that they had previously committed to
most often this takes the form of
checking in with themselves on what they
feel like doing as I've discussed
previously once you make a commitment to
do or not do something your feelings no
longer matter you just do it you Channel
your inner Postman and you deliver the
[ __ ] maale irrespective of whether
it's raining or snowing or hailing you
make your appointed rounds that's it
this means that it's unnecessary at best
to confirm whether you still feel like
doing the thing you committed to and
dangerous at worst so this question do I
still feel like doing that is a terrible
terrible question to ask yourself like
in order to make progress you might have
to remove that question from your
internal dialogue alt together together

[03:01]
internal dialogue alt together together
and I say this because let's be honest
it's far more likely that you will not
feel like doing the thing at any given
moment then you will feel like doing it
why because if you felt like doing it
you would have been doing it by now
people generally don't need to be
encouraged to do what they really want
to do they need to be restrained if they
really wanted to go to the gym or lose
weight or quit smoking or give up
pornography start a business they'd be
doing it
already we have to accept the fact that
most of us would rather watch TV or eat
rich foods or use substances or look at
naked people or take it easy when people
are interested in making a behavioral
change they typically have to do
violence to their desires which are what
got them into this trouble to begin with
so it might be a good idea to avoid the
question of what you feel like doing or

[04:01]
question of what you feel like doing or
what you don't feel like doing all
together at least until the new behavior
is such an integrated and consistent
habit that your feelings about it have
organically shifted and that can take a
good deal of
time so most of the time you're not
going to feel like doing the thing that
you committed to and that's okay some
days you'll feel motivated and inspired
and energized and a lot of other days
you won't feelings come and go they're
kind of like the weather and on some
level you may have to act in spite of
the weather like the journey you are
undertaking is going to last much longer
than the temporary weather event you are
currently experiencing this means that
you kind of have to anticipate
encountering all kinds of weather along
the way and to push forward in spite of
conditions this is how you make
progress if you're interested in taking
your understanding to the next level I

[05:00]
your understanding to the next level I

see you
aboard now it's also important to
accept the fact that you like most
people typically follow the path of
least resistance it is what it is
however you can use this to your
advantage how by structuring things in
such a way that the good habits that you
want to cultivate are easier and require
less effort than the bad habits that you
want to stop there are many different
ways to do this though how you approach
this obviously depends on the behavior
in question question I'll give you some

[06:01]
in question question I'll give you some
examples from my own life there was a
time in my life when I felt I was
playing too many video games and that
that time could be more profitably spent
in other ways now what I didn't do was
make a commitment to never play video
games again like that wasn't going to
happen really extreme commitments like
that are very difficult to maintain long
term over a long enough timeline they
tend to lead to relapse and shame which
isn't very helpful and doesn't change
the behavior anyway I didn't want to
stop entirely I just wanted to reduce
how much time I was spending on this
Pursuit so I made the decision that
every time I stopped playing for the
night I would dismantle the entire
system put it back in its box and put
the box in the back of the closet that
means when I wanted to play again I
would need to get the box from the back
of the Closet open it up and set the
system back up now this only takes a few

[07:00]
system back up now this only takes a few
minutes to do but it is a little
inconvenient I couldn't like impulsively
turn on the system in that 10-second
window when I would ask myself what I
felt like doing with my time this made
it much easier for me to make a
different decision during that mental
Skirmish and the upshot was that I very
quickly and significantly lowered the
amount of time I would spend playing
video games every week and I did this by
making my vice more difficult more
inconvenient and more expensive to
perform by the same token when I wanted
to cultivate a habit of going to the gym
more regularly I began to pack a bag
with my gym clothes and electrolytes and
whatnot and keep it right by the door
like I would have to step over it on my
way out of the house and when I got back
from the gym the sweaty clothes would go
on laundry and I would immediately
repack the bag with new supplies that
way it was already ready to go for the

[08:02]
way it was already ready to go for the
next session and because I did this I
didn't have to spend a few minutes
getting everything together which could
derail the decision to go to the gym
entirely this made it much easier for me
to keep my commitment in that 10-second
battle and the upshot was that I quickly
and significantly improved my gym
consistency and I did this by making my
new habit less difficult less
inconvenient and less expensive to
perform
finally it can be useful during that
10-second Skirmish to play the tape
forward in your mind imagine being in
the same place and struggling with the
same issue one year from now how does
that make you feel another year has gone
by and once again you've made no
progress on this issue that you yourself
insist is important to you and and how

[09:00]
insist is important to you and and how
many chances do you really have left
like how many years are you
guaranteed if this never changes will
you regret it sometimes we need to be
more afraid of things continuing as they
are in order to become behavioral to
overcome behavioral inertia and motivate
consistent action remember it was only
the Ghost of Christmas future that could
get Scrooge to change scare yourself
straight and hold that Vision in your
mind's eye whenever you're forced to
fight that 10-second
battle what do you think does this fit
