I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is it gets
worse before it gets better so I give
consultations to guys from all walks of
life and from all over the world and in
these consultations we discuss many
things however one of the most common
reasons why guys reach out to me is
because they are wanting to change a
dysfunctional dynamic in their primary
relationship or marriage makes sense now
if if you're one of these guys I've got
both good news and bad news for you the
good news is that it's possible you can
change even long-standing Dynamics in
your
relationship however the bad news is
that it's very hard to do it's always
easier to do the right thing from the
beginning than to do the wrong thing for
years or decades and then try to fix the
problem so it's going to be tough what's
more it's going to take some time it may
not get all the way to where you want it

[01:01]
not get all the way to where you want it
to be and it will always always get
worse before it gets better so a lot of
bad news but as long as you're not in a
hurry and you brace yourself for the
period of discomfort that comes after
you begin to initiate a change it's
possible to alter even deeply ingrained
Behavior patterns now today I want to
talk about this last caveat that no
matter who or what you're dealing with
it's going to get worse before it gets
better this phenomenon is due to
something called an Extinction burst and
this is something that all men need to
be aware of the extinction burst is why
you absolutely should not go around
making changes to a long-standing
dynamic casually or half-cocked changing
these Dynamics is something you need to
do very strategically very intentionally
and with a definite plan of action this
is because among other things Extinction
bursts can be very very difficult to

[02:00]
bursts can be very very difficult to
deal with this is a term from behavioral
psychology which to my mind has
undeservedly fallen out of favor in
recent years to understand what an
Extinction burst is let's imagine that
we're behavioral scientists running an
experiment in a lab in this experiment
we'll place a rat in a cage with a
little lever the goal of the study is to
cultivate a lever pushing Habit in the
rat and to do this we're going to reward
the rat with a food pellet every time he
pushes the lever it won't take long in
its initial exploration of the
environment the rat will probably brush
up against the lever and unintentionally
trigger the food pellet however since
food is so reinforcing most rats will
quickly learn that the lever is Magic
that pushing it down causes food to
appear it will only take a few
reinforcements to cultivate this
Association in the rat now let's say
that we allow this to go on for a few
weeks and then we decide to make a

[03:02]
weeks and then we decide to make a
change to the study the new goal of the
experiment is to extinguish the lever
pushing habit we previously cultivated
in the rat and we do this by putting
lever pushing on what we would call an
Extinction Protocol in this case the
protocol is very simple we just stop
rewarding the rat with food no matter
what he does with respect to the lever
and of course we can't inform the rat of
this change in writing we're just going
to change the reinforcements and see how
long it takes for the rat to get the
message how do you think the rat is
going to
behave what's going to happen is that
the rat is going to go up to the lever
and press it as usual and when no food
appears he's probably going to look a
little confused he'll his head in
interest hm that's a change and then
then he might push the lever again

[04:02]
then he might push the lever again
possibly a little harder this time and
when no food appears again he might
begin to manifest signs of agitation
something approximating fear or anger
and then he's GNA go him on that
lever like where is my food pellet and
that my friends is an Extinction burst
it's a dramatic increase in the
frequency Andor intensity of a behavior
that occurs when habitual reinforcement
is disrupted before the behavior goes
away entirely there will be a period of
intense and frequent iteration of that
behavior slated for extinction that's
things getting worse however if you can
get through the extinction burst without
reinforcing the target Behavior then
things will eventually start to get
better that's because no rat is so dumb
that it's going to continue continue to

[05:00]
that it's going to continue continue to
push that lever indefinitely in the
absence of reward after all lever
pushing holds no intrinsic value for
rats our little participant only
manifested that behavior because of the
result of that behavior change the
result and you change the behavior this
is the Crux of operant conditioning in
the consistent absence of a reward rats
will learn their lesson now before I go
any further if you're liking what you're
hearing please consider sending this
episode to someone who might benefit
from message because it's Word of Mouth
referrals like this that really help to
make the channel grow and you may also
consider hitting the thanks button and
tipping me in proportion to the value
you feel you've derived from this
message I really depend on your support
to keep all of this going and I thank
you very
much back to the lab now the lever
pushing Behavior might not disappear
entirely a few days later the rat could
see the lever and think to himself hm I
wonder if the magic lever is still
broken broken and he'll give it a push

[06:01]
broken broken and he'll give it a push
just to check and when no food is
forthcoming he'll leave it alone for a
week and when he checks
again he'll leave it alone for a month
Etc the point is that the target
Behavior should become less and less
frequent as a function of time however
since these manifestations are much less
aggressive and intense than the
extinction burst they're also much
easier to handle but here's the thing if
one day months and months down the road
we scientists decide to change the
reinforcement schedule again and we
decide that we'll go back to rewarding
lever pushing Behavior with a food
pellet then all we really have to do is
reward a lever push with a food pellet
once and that habit of lever pushing
will immediately return in that rat in
full force just as if no time had passed
at all since that period of regular

[07:00]
at all since that period of regular
reinforcement this is why habits are so
hard to break and so easy to fall back
into it's not fair but that's the way it
is now there are several important
takeaways here the first one is the most
obvious but it needs to be said
regardless that is if you want to Target
a certain behavior for extinction if you
want a certain Behavior to go away you
need to stop rewarding it in the
experiment the scientists had to stop
giving the rat the food pellet in order
to motivate him to change his lever
pushing Behavior it's not functionally
possible to get rid of a behavior that
you are still
reinforcing sounds obvious right but
you'd be surprised what might be less
obvious however is the method of
reinforcement not all reinforcement is
as clear and explicit as a food pellet
is and if you're in a dysfunctional

[08:01]
is and if you're in a dysfunctional
Dynamic chances are good that you have
been inadvertently reinforcing the
target behavior in ways that you didn't
fully realize common types of
reinforcement that are often
unappreciated are
attention
interest emotion
concession time and of course giving
people what they want so that's lesson
one to get a behavior to disappear you
first have to stop reinforcing it lesson
number two is once you stop reinforcing
it be prepared for some nasty Behavior
whether explicitly or implicitly the
other person is going to be
like what do you mean you're not going
to give me what I want that's not how
this goes you've given me what I wanted
every single time I've done this for the
past 10 years did you not hear me do I
need to get louder for you to understand
stand where's my food pellet do you see

[09:03]
stand where's my food pellet do you see
this is things getting worse and you
need to be prepared for this kind of
reaction because if you Buckle under the
increased pressure of the extinction
burst you've just made your situation 10
times worse because you've started to
train your partner to behave monstrously
Andor aggressively to get what she wants
this goes south real fast past gentlemen
you have to reward the behavior that you
want to see more of if you reward
aggression or withholding or
spitefulness or chaos you will only get
more aggression withholding spitefulness
or
chaos that is not good for you and it's
not good for your woman so as hard as it
gets during the extinction burst no
matter what you do don't give in Trust
trust in behavioral psychology and

[10:01]
trust in behavioral psychology and
understand that no rat is so stupid and
spiteful that it will persist in an
intrinsically unrewarding Behavior
without reinforcement indefinitely After
the Storm the sun will shine again and
finally the third lesson is once you get
to the other side of that Extinction
burst to never ever ever ever reward the
behavior that you successfully
extinguished again not once ever a lot
of guys followed my advice and things
get better a few weeks no problems a few
months no problems and they think okay
well maybe we've turned the page and I
can relax my discipline here nope wrong
incorrect you never get to reward that
behavior again period because it only
takes one reinforcement of a previously
extinguished Behavior to bring the old
habit back in full force so if you're
gonna go for it be prepared to go all

[11:01]
gonna go for it be prepared to go all
the way otherwise don't even bother what
