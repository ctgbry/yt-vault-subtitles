I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic today short talk is three
tips for dealing with Envy
Envy is a very corrosive emotion and if
left unchecked can devour people's minds
if not their very Souls this is
exacerbated by the fact that Envy tends
to be invisible folks might willingly
admit to being angry or sad or afraid
but few people will admit to feeling
envious and this invisibility makes it
difficult to manage that said I have
three tips to deal with this negative
emotion and I'd like to discuss them
with you today but before I do please
remember to like this episode And
subscribe to this channel it takes less
than a second costs you nothing and it
helps to defeat the haters so do the
thing
to begin with I'll offer a definition of
envy so that we're all on the same page
Envy is actually a fairly complex
emotion it needs a number of things in

[01:00]
emotion it needs a number of things in
order to exist here's my definition
Envy requires a perceived deficit with
respect to a personally relevant good
relative to a perceived equal that's
complex so I'll say it again Envy is a
perceived deficit with respect to a
personally relevant good
relative to a perceived equal so there's
a lot of things that need to happen in
order for Envy to occur and this is good
because if we can dismantle any one of
those things then Envy sort of falls
apart it needs all three components in
order to exist
the first useful Avenue of attack is to
dismantle the relative to a perceived
equal part
no two blades of grass are the exact
shade of green
so we need to be careful about our
assumptions of similarity is it true
that whoever you might be envious of is
really your equal
are you too equivalent which is to say

[02:01]
are you too equivalent which is to say
could we swap you for the other person
without anyone noticing
does this person have more experience
than you does this person come from a
background that may have given them
advantages in certain ways does this
person have other skills or traits or
talents or abilities that might
influence the perceived disparity if so
maybe it's not exactly true that the two
of you are equals in every sense and
creating a kind of psychic distance
between the two of you might help to
mitigate your felt sense of envy
another Avenue of attack is to address
the idea of a perceived good I've
noticed that we as a society tend to
ascribe the attribute of good to things
that are more properly neutral
for instance money is not inherently
good
for many folks money accelerates their
self-destruction
a relationship is not inherently good
many folks are abiding in abusive or

[03:01]
many folks are abiding in abusive or
hateful relationships right now
power is not inherently good the more
powerful you are the more you become a
target for others animosity
from a stoic perspective the things that
people tend to feel envious about are
generally not Goods but neutrals and the
proper attitude to maintain towards
neutrals is one of indifference the
sheer fact that someone has money or a
relationship or power tells us nothing
about the goodness of the person or his
or her internal happiness reminding
yourself of this can help to dismantle
the emotion of envy
and now we come to the Third Avenue of
attack as suggested by my definition the
idea of a perceived deficit chances are
very good that if you're watching this
you're neither the best in the history
of the world at something nor the worst
in the history of the world at something
this means that there is always a bigger
fish and that you are the bigger fish

[04:01]
fish and that you are the bigger fish
relative to certain others it's also
very likely that in the near infinite
domain Of Human Action you are neither
better nor worse in all aspects of being
than any other specific individual this
means that whomever you are envious of
has traits or abilities that aren't as
impressive as yours
focus on these Instead This is a
downward comparison that can do a lot to
alleviate feelings of envy
Envy is a complex emotion and there's a
lot more I could say about it these are
just some initial thoughts in general if
you understand how an emotion is
constructed you can also learn how to
effectively dismantle it I hope these
tips help what do you think got any tips
of your own if so let me know in the
comments below and thank you for
