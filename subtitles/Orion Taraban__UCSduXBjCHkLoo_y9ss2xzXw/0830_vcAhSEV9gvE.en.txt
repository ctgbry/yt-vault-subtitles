this was a question that I was asked in
one of my courses back when I was a
professor question was functionally Dr
terban you've talked so much about
unnecessary suffering and how to undo it
but what about calling some suffering
unnecessary assumes that some suffering
is necessary which I kind of believe is
true certainly from like a Buddhist
perspective we can't escape old age
sickness and death let's put it that way
so there's somewh necessary suffering
that human beings are subject to passing
through how do you deal with that and
what came to me was this image of a
horse in the rain you ever seen a horse
in the rain Mark you just stand there
that's right it's just standing there
getting wet it's not trying to dance
around the raindrops in some sort of
manic futile desire to not get drenched
it's not like beating its Hooves and
lamenting the Injustice that it's
raining here and not over there on those
horses it's not enviously plotting
against the horses in the stable it's
not like laying down and just
surrendering oh my God this is so
miserable I'll never be dry again like
those are all human forms of suffering
animals don't experience that which is
part of why I think we Envy animal in
some respect
