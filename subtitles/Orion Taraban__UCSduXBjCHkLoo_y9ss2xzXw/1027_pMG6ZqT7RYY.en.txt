Publicly shaming and doxying men is
absolutely not not not going to make

isn't lost on you. After all, the whole
point of tea is to leak personal and
private information about men without
their consent because safety. And I
can't help but wonder if those women
feel safer now that their names and home
addresses are out for the world to
