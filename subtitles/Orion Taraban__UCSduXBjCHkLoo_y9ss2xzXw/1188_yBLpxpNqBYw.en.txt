So, this is a way of thinking that I
fell prey to for many years as a young
man. I'm going to address it today
because I think it still remains a very
prevalent problem in today's society.
When I was younger, I had an emptiness
inside of me. And I hoped that this
emptiness could be filled by the love of
a woman. I believed that by entering
into a relationship with a woman, I
would be able to feel her love and
affection for me. and that if I felt
enough of her love and affection, it
would fill that emptiness and I would be
happy. And I'm here to tell you that
this is not only not what actually
happens, but that this isn't even
possible. This thinking is also
associated with all kinds of suboptimal
outcomes with women because women,
regardless of their intentions, don't
want to do this. This is not something
that any woman really wants to do. Women
enter into relationships with men
because they want or need things from

because they want or need things from
them. But few women, if any, want or
need like a broken man that they can
make whole with their love. They might
want a beastly man like in Beauty and
the Beast that they can tame and
conquer, but they generally don't want
an empty, broken man that they can heal.
Maybe if they did, they'd have more
luck.
