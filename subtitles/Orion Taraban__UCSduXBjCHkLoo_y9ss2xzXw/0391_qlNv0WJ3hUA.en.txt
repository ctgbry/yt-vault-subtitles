I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
superficiality of Desire
so I've been kicking around this episode
in my head for a while and I've come to
the conclusion that humans seem to be
more or less hopelessly
tragically superficial with respect to
what they are attracted to and I think
this is true for both men and women the
internets would love to have a
protracted argument about which sex is
more superficial than the other however
I think it's safe to say that both are
extremely superficial albeit in
different ways and after discussing what
I mean by this I'm going to offer a
potentially radical and
counter-intuitive suggestion with
respect to how folks might choose to
navigate this reality so let's get to it
all right it is woefully apparent that
the things that men and women are
attracted to the things that men and
women tend to look for and swipe for in
their potential Partners have little to

[01:03]
their potential Partners have little to
no relation whatsoever to the things
that we know tend to make people happy
or the things we know tend to make for
successful relationships the height of a
man
the size of her bust
for instance have zero absolutely
nothing zero to do with whether that
particular man or that particular woman
is capable of even a non-terrible
relationship and it's also true that
pointing this out
isn't going to change a goddamn thing
people want what they want even if it's
unreasonable even if it's socially
unacceptable even if it's downright
toxic fighting against this is a losing
battle and one that I personally believe
doesn't need to be fought anyway because
I've come to some measure of acceptance
with respect to this reality
so how do men and women differ with
respect to their superficial desires
well it will probably come as little

[02:00]
well it will probably come as little
surprise that men tend to be tragically
superficial with respect to women's
physical appearance and that's a real
kick in the teeth for some women because
if a woman doesn't meet certain minimum
standards of attractiveness in a man's
eyes she's going to be functionally
invisible to that man as a potential
mate now there are many many things that
are within a woman's control that can
influence her appearance Fitness and
fashion foremost among them however none
of them will make a woman gorgeous if
the genetics aren't there to back it up
so I have some sympathy for women
there's only so much you can do and
hitting the genetic Lottery with respect
to looks actually tells us nothing about
whether she can say regulate her own
emotions let alone hold a conversation
but men are going to keep wanting what
they want now before I go any further if

now on the other hand women not only
have their own superficial desires with
respect to men's physical appearance a
man's height again being at the top of
the list women also tend to be
superficial with respect to the things
around men
which means their lifestyle more
generally
many years ago I went out on a first
date with a woman in college and I
thought the date went fairly well we
actually ended up in a multi-year
relationship further down the road but
that night when I invited her back to my
dorm room she turned me down and she
told me that she wasn't interested in
never seeing me again
okay many years later I learned that the

[04:01]
okay many years later I learned that the
reason why she didn't come back with me
that night the reason why she apparently
wasn't interested in seeing me again was
that her previous boyfriend had had his
own apartment and she felt like it would
be a step backwards for her to be dating
a guy who lived in the college dorms as
Chris Rock has said men cannot go
backwards sexually and women cannot go
backwards in lifestyle here's an example
of this in action
unfortunately and this is where women
really shoot themselves in the
collective foot eliminating a man
especially a young man from
consideration due to his circumstances
is not only superficial it's stupid
why well in my own personal case I lived
in those dorms for like another six
months after which I got my own
apartment
the lifestyle of a man is going to
change and if the guy has any sense or
ambition at all it's probably only going

[05:02]
ambition at all it's probably only going
to get better and better
but women often don't want to wait they
don't want to be a part of the process
by which the man extrapolates the
desirable lifestyle
they want to hang out at the Winner's
Circle which as I've mentioned in
previous episodes is actually a really
bad mating strategy for the vast
majority of women ladies you can watch
my episode find your dark horse for a
counter-intuitive recommendation
on what you can Implement instead on the
other hand a woman's face
is kind of her face
it's unlikely to improve over the course
of her lifetime so while men might be
superficial in basing mate preference so
heavily on physical attractiveness
they're they're not quite as stupid
now maybe there's a reason women seem to
be impatient they don't have the same
luxury of time as men do given their
reproductive window so let's assume
there's some kind of evolutionary
incentive for women's and patients with

[06:00]
incentive for women's and patients with
the lifestyles of men however it's also
likely true that women tend to reject
more men for more superficial reasons
than men reject women for purely
economic reasons women just tend to have
more options than men do it's easier to
kick someone out of bed for eating
crackers if you have some folks sitting
up in the living room
and the greater the perceived
optionality the more superficial women's
superficiality becomes and why not
I'm convinced that most men would do the
same if they enjoyed the same degree of
optionality I think this is an economic
principle not necessarily a
gender-specific one okay so why am I
talking about all this ideally I would
like people to at least consider the
possibility that the gender-specific
examples of the superficiality of Desire
that they are personally frustrated at
or enraged by
are likely not going to change anytime
soon
among other reasons they are likely

[07:00]
among other reasons they are likely
rooted in evolutionary and economic
principles that are royally indifferent
to whatever social ideology happens to
be prevalent at the time
the superficiality of Desire is here to
stay
and within this understanding my
counter-intuitive recommendation is to
accept this reality and learn to play
the game of superficiality more
successfully
now when people take offense at this
recommendation they generally do so from
the position akin to something like
Orion the things you're talking about
are Petty and insignificant
why should it matter if I have my own
place what does that have to do with me
who I am as a person or a flat stomach
or a nice haircut or that I wear high
heels or not who cares those things
aren't me I fall in love with people's
minds with people's souls and I want
someone who wants me for me
not what I have or happen to look like

[08:03]
not what I have or happen to look like
okay and leaving aside the obvious lack
of acceptance this response indicates my
answer to this is something like
if what I'm talking about is really so
petty and insignificant
why not just do it
I mean it might be Petty and
insignificant that your boss prefers
bluing to Black Ink on his reports but
if it's really no skin off your back and
if it helps you keep your job
just use the blue pens
the more superficial and insignificant
the objection becomes the less
defensible it becomes especially if the
costs associated with addressing it are
dwarfed by the potential liabilities of
not addressing it
this means that women should not only
take care of their physical appearance
they should invest in it
and potentially invest heavily and men

[09:03]
and potentially invest heavily and men
should not just take care of their
Lifestyles they should invest in them
and potentially invest heavily
if getting a personal trainer
significantly increases your attraction
then do it
if having a stylish outfit increases
your attraction then what is the problem
my people if you can spend a few
thousand dollars to raise your
attractiveness a point or two
that might very well be one of the best
possible uses of your money
I'm not sure if people can see your mind
or your soul
but I'm absolutely sure that if they
don't like your Packaging
they're not going to stick around long
enough to see it
assuming they can at all
fortunately addressing The Superficial
elements of Attraction is actually far
easier and far cheaper than addressing
many of the other things that factor
into the mating dating game so you might
as well start there just keeping it a

[10:01]
as well start there just keeping it a
buck
