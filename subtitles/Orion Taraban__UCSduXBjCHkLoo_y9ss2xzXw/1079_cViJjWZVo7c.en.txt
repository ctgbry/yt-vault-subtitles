So, the upshot here is to find ways to
do more difficult, scary things in order
to raise your courage stat. How does one
go about doing that? Easy. You turn
toward whatever it is you're currently
avoiding. And trust me, everyone is
avoiding something, whether it's with
their friends or their family or with
themselves. Courage, like all virtues,
is a habit. The more you turn in the
direction of what you're currently
avoiding, the more you develop the
courage to face what you fear. Most
people don't do this. Remember, Frodo's
first reaction to learning the truth
about the ring was to try to hide it. It
takes balls to go to Mordor. It also
helps to assume more difficult
challenges in all domains of your life.

money? How are you pushing yourself
emotionally? Like how honest are you
with yourself? Are you actively trying
to push through your resentments and

more you take on with respect to your
fitness and your finances and your
friends, the more likely you're going to
see a woman as just another challenge
among challenges. It's not scary. It's
potentially an exciting opportunity.
