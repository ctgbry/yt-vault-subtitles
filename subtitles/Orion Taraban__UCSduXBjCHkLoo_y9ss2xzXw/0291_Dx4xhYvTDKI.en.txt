I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is neglected
kinds of love
order so I was recently inspired to
begin a series of episodes in which I
examine the concept of love from a less
conventional perspective but to most
people associate with the concept of
Love well love is patient love is kind
love is a warm fuzzy feeling in our
hearts Etc I think you can make an
argument that love can be those things
however I see love in a slightly
different way and before I explain what
that is please remember to like

thank you for your help
now for me my template for love is a
spiritual template and I try to look at
the way that God exists in relation to
the created Universe for Clarity on what

[01:02]
the created Universe for Clarity on what
love is because if we assume that the
higher power is omnibenevolent that is
that he is all good and all loving then
we should be able to see in the way the
higher power relates to the created
Universe attributes of that love
and in many respects when you examine
love from this perspective you don't
actually see some of the things that I
mentioned at the beginning of this
episode and other attributes come to the
Forefront and one such attribute that
I'd like to emphasize today is order
if anything love is often associated
with disorder it's like this Whirlwind
that sweeps into people's lives and
turns everything upside down
however it's interesting to note that in
Greek mythology Eros the god of love was
the son of chaos the god of primordial
disorder
this suggests that out of chaos comes
love
and we can see that in the created

[02:01]
and we can see that in the created
Universe just look around
what can the ordering principle be that
can take the dissolute and disparate
elements of the universe and combine
them in such a way that life can be
sustained what can the principle that
fundamentally makes life possible be
if not love
life let alone the things that make life
worth living cannot exist in a chaotic
environment to create order out of chaos
to put things in their proper place to
assign actions to their proper season to
approach process in the correct sequence
these are all examples of how order can
be an aspect of love
and we can certainly see that in the
created Universe we see that in how
night is separated from day and how the
seasons progress in their orderly
sequence and how our bodies are
organized and how water flows down and

[03:01]
organized and how water flows down and
fire flares up and it's within the
context of this order that life becomes
possible and that goodness and
prosperity are allowed to flourish so
order in my opinion is a neglected form
of love that deserves far more
acknowledgment and appreciation than it
currently gets hopefully that makes
sense to you what do you think please
