i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
the truth about romance
tragedy
so this is the second part in my series
of talks about romantic love in this
episode i'm going to talk about a facet
of romantic love that has really been
staring you in the face your entire life
but which you may not have adequately
appreciated here it is
every romance
is a tragedy
they all
every single one of them
end in death
romances never have happy endings
this is not an accident
it's not like the lover simply had the
bad fortune of dying at the end of their
stories
death is actually an essential feature
of romantic love remember romantic love
is actually the secularization of a
religious doctrine which elevates the
purity of spiritual love

[01:00]
purity of spiritual love
within the romantic conceptualization
there is always something
inherently unsatisfying about love as it
is practiced on the material plane
no matter how close the lovers become
they will always exist as two hearts and
two bodies
which despite their closeness
feels like an infinite distance
so love on this planet will always
involve some degree of separation from
the adored
this is at odds with the ultimate goal
of romantic love which again is
secularized worship namely to achieve
perfect and lasting union with the
beloved
now in traditional religion the beloved
is god
and believers hope to achieve this
perfect and lasting union with god
after they die
where they will exist in everlasting
harmony with their creator and while
practitioners of romantic love have
exchanged a human being for the divine
as the object of their adoration their

[02:01]
as the object of their adoration their
goal remains the same namely to achieve
perfect and lasting union with the
beloved which can only occur after they
die
in the romantic conceptualization
death is actually
the desired outcome
though the lovers themselves are
generally unconscious of this goal
because it is only in death where two
can achieve a permanent lasting union as
one
in its opposition to marriage which
represents life in the generation of
children
romantic love can be seen as a kind of
death cult that promotes the
supernatural spiritual love over the
natural
everyday human relationships
this is why every classical romance ends
in death
not
marriage that's the classical definition
of a comedy
and since classical romance is a
psychologically accurate but emotionally

[03:01]
psychologically accurate but emotionally
unpalatable idea
we created a whole new genre of stories
the romantic comedies to avoid these
unpleasant feelings
unfortunately these stories aren't
really grounded in any kind of
psychological reality and so provide a
grossly unrealistic template of love and
relationships to contemporary audiences
