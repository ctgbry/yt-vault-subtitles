I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is an update
to the gift of your absence so this
video The Gift of your absence is the
video that most likely brought you to
this channel it now has over 100,000
views and it is by far my most watched
episode and so I thought at this
Milestone that I would release a brief
update to that video first of all I'd
like to say thank you so much for taking
interest in what I have to say um it's
actually pretty rare for people to care
about your thing and I'm very very
grateful for your support let's keep
growing the channel together now I want
to take this opportunity to clear up a
few points of potential confusion that
may have Arisen from that video first
and foremost I want to emphasize that
the primary goal of giving people the
gift of your absence is not to encourage
people to chase after you in some
indirect or UL ative way this can happen

[01:03]
indirect or UL ative way this can happen
but it's best if this is not the primary
intention behind doing this if for no
other reason that we're not as cunning
as we think and people generally react
poorly to feeling manipulated it's a
strategy that often backfires the
fundamental goal of giving people the
gift of your absence is to increase your
own self- value by exercising
self-respect it's demeaning in the long
run to remain in a relationship whether
it's personal or professional where you
feel consistently undervalued life
really is too short for that so we model
for others how to respect us by first
and foremost respecting ourselves now
pulling back also generally increases
perceived value this is economics 101
people I didn't make this up scarcity
creates value so if you shown up well in
a relationship whether you're a good
work worker or a great wife or a good

[02:01]
work worker or a great wife or a good
friend and you make your presence
scarcer regardless of how you've been
treated in the past this will tend to
increase your perceived value in that
relationship however I'd like you to
consider that this is kind of an extra
bonus that comes with increasing your
own self value by exercising
self-respect and whether you ought to
put too much stock in whether someone
who has consistently undervalued you
suddenly has a change of part is another
story like any other gift you shouldn't
give the gift of your absence with
strings attached so do this for you now
a criticism that a few people have
leveled at this strategy is that it's
passive aggressive and I can kind of see
how pulling back or not responding could
be seen in that light however I'm going
to respectfully disagree with that
assessment if done properly the gift of
your absence is neither passive nor nor

[03:00]
your absence is neither passive nor nor
aggressive it's certainly not passive I
mean in this case you're taking steps to
remove yourself from the relationship
that's active not passive and it
shouldn't be aggressive there's no door
slamming or name calling or backhanded
Snipes otherwise your absence wouldn't
be a gift it would be a
relief the intention isn't to hurt
someone else the intention is to stop
hurting yourself by remaining in an
actively antagonistic relationship to me
it would be passive aggressive to remain
in that relationship and withdraw
emotionally or refuse to talk with them
or some such thing you see the
difference it's also important to keep
in mind that generally when people
decide to leave a job or leave a
relationship it's not the first thing
that they tried by the time they've
gotten to this point they've spoken with
their boss or had multiple conversations
with their partner and have tried any
number of strategies to communicate

[04:01]
number of strategies to communicate
their dissatisfaction and distress
people typically don't say k bye the
first time things go sideways so we kind
of have to assume that people have
arrived at this strategy because nothing
else has worked and expecting that
you're somehow going to get through to
somebody when nothing else has worked by
sticking around is
lunacy like I say in my episode to hope
is to wait if if you're going to wait
you need to have a reasonable hope of
obtaining the desired outcome through
patience and if you've exhausted all
these other outcomes you do not have
that hope and on some level you owe it
to yourself to take yourself out of that
relationship whatever it may be finally
I did get a number of people reaching
out to me asking well what if you live
with this person what if you can't
otherwise avoid this person what do you
do then and unfortunately the answer is
you can't give such people the full gift

[05:02]
you can't give such people the full gift
of your absence under these
circumstances but there are things you
can do to make your life more bearable
and I'll make another episode on how to
handle those situations in the future so
thanks again for your interest here's
