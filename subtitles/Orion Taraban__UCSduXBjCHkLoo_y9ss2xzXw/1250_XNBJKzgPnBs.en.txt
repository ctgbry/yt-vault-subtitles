Conservative men seem to be looking for
tradives, who I assume are women who
wear frocks and stay at home to bake
pies and raise babies. These men argue
what a sweet deal that is for women. No
awful commute, no frustrating grind, no
managerial obedience. Just you and the
most meaningful and fulfilling thing
you'll ever do in your entire life.
What's not to like? On the other hand,
modern women have been launching a
somewhat dubious counter campaign to
normalize the stay-at-home dad. A man
who cleans and does his share of the
housework. How sexy. He's definitely
getting laid more often than that
selfish, emotionally unavailable
executive who expects his wife to
perform all the physical and emotional
labor around the house. Don't worry
about the social stigma. We women think
it's so hot. So, who are we to believe?

much more accurate and reliable guide as
to their values than their words. And I
think it's safe to say that if staying
at home with the kids was really such a
huge good deal, then both men and women
would be fighting for the privilege to
do so themselves. They wouldn't be
trying to convince the other party to do
it. So I think we have to conclude that
in reality neither men nor women find
the prospect of staying at home with the
kids to be all that attractive. Give.
