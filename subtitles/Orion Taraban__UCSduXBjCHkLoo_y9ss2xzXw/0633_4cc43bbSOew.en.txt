I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is romance
is a game of hide and seek so this is
another episode in my truth about
romance Series in today's episode I'm
going to explain the fundamental game of
romantic relationships and exactly how
it
operates as the title suggests the
fundamental game at the heart of
romantic relationships is hideand-seek
it's very simple it kind of works like
this first I am going to cut out a part
of myself and then I'm going to hide
that part of myself in somewhat of my
choosing and then I'm going to forget
about the cutting and the hiding and the
choosing the forgetting is actually a
very important part of all this because
as we'll see becoming increasingly aware
of this mechanism of action ruins the
entire game after all if you're going to
have any fun seeking you can't already

[01:00]
have any fun seeking you can't already
know where you've hidden the thing that
you're looking for now can you but those
are the rules that's how you play
there's the cutting and the hiding and
the choosing and the forgetting let's go
through each step first the cutting the
idea here is to repress awareness of
certain aspects of the self so that we
are no longer in emotional contact with
those parts of ourselves it's not that
they're actually removed we didn't
really cut them out we just kind of
can't see them or feel them inside of
ourselves for a while so we kind of
assume that they're not there now people
do this all the time I've talked several
times on this channel about the
mechanism of evil whereby people disavow
the shameful and unacceptable parts of
themselves project them onto others and
then attempt to cleanse the world of
their own darkness by destroying the
object onto which that Darkness was
projected this is the source of the vast
majority of unnecessary suffering on
this planet Roman on the other hand

[02:00]
this planet Roman on the other hand
Works a little differently rather than
cut off contact with the unacceptable
parts of themselves Romantics actually
cut out some of the most acceptable and
respectable and ennobling parts of
themselves and then project those parts
into others these are the parts that are
beautiful and good and kind even the
parts that recognize the share of
divinity we all partake in as human
beings these parts are cut off and
hidden in somebody else hidden in
somebody that they can now very
literally call my
love of course this creates a liability
for Romantics as long as they are cut
off from these parts of themselves
they're going to feel less than whole
incomplete even broken a fragment of
what they could otherwise be and love in
their imaginations will remain a kind of
Mythic Alchemy whereby the fractured
self is finally healed and made whole
and they're going to seek that wholeness
in in reunion with the person on whom

[03:02]
in in reunion with the person on whom
they have projected these disavowed
parts of
themselves now if Romantics were to go
through all this trouble you would think
that they would at least choose to hide
these disavowed parts of themselves in
summon with whom they would be likely to
unite but if you still think this you
don't yet understand the point of the
game which I'll get to in a moment in
point of fact Romantics seem to do their
darnest to hide these parts of
themselves
in the last people with whom they could
reasonably hope to
unite and this happens too often to be
mere coincidence people often say that
attraction isn't a choice that
technically isn't entirely true because
this whole game doesn't progress at
random or by accident it's probably more
accurate to say that attraction isn't a
conscious Choice people aren't simply
the innocent victims of Cupid's driveby
they're generally more involved in the
process than they might think now before

[04:00]
process than they might think now before
I go any further if you're liking what

inquiry form on my website if you're
interested in booking a paid
consultation links to everything in the
description let's get back to
it now Romantics tend to choose to hide
these parts of themselves in people with
whom for whatever reason it would
actually be fairly difficult to connect
maybe they're just in from out of town
for the weekend or they're already in a
relationship with somebody else or
they're way out of their league Etc and
the reason for this is kind of
counterintuitive but here it is
Romantics don't don't actually want to

[05:02]
Romantics don't don't actually want to
get what they
want after all to the extent that I'm
right the easiest way for them to get
what they want would be to become
increasingly aware that they had it the
entire time and that this complicated
rigar roll is completely unnecessary and
they don't want this for several
significant reasons first ever wonder
why people in emotionally s Ying
relationships or with full and
interesting lives in which they are
cultivating meaning and purpose don't
seem to fall in
love it's not a coincidence that people
tend to fall in love when they're
dissatisfied with their careers or
they're in an unsatisfying relationship
or no relationship at all or they're
kind of lost or coasting through life
there are certain conditions under which
a game of hideand-seek becomes more
appropriate this is not merely a
diversion from boredom or a distraction

[06:02]
diversion from boredom or a distraction
from the misery of existence though of
course it can be it's a way of
motivating action how well if you're
unsatisfied with your life then you kind
of need to hide what good you possess
somewhere else as this will motivate you
to leave an unfulfilling situation and
seek out that goodness elsewhere and
this kind of makes sense like it
wouldn't be motivating to project the
bad things out out there that's not
going to motivate anyone to seek them
out the game of romance is functionally
casting out a line that you've baited
with certain disavowed positive aspects
of yourself so that you might catch
yourself in a different location you'll
catch yourself in a different location
because you've baited your lure with
something that you want and you've cast
your line out beyond your present
circumstances at least in theory you
have however as stated previously
Romantics don't actually want to catch

[07:01]
Romantics don't actually want to catch
themselves because that would bring the
whole game to a close and they would
functionally need to stay where they are
and build with what they have and this
can be a bitter pill to swallow because
people are
disappointing and life can be tedious
wearisome and
hard there is Adventure in seeking there
is no Adventure in finding
getting what they want would effectively
end the game for Romantics and eliminate
the possibility that somewhere out there
there's a better life waiting for them
contending with hopelessness is not
something humans typically do very well
in any case Romantics want to get what
they want about as much as they want to
become aware of this whole process
that's why the game has to be hidden so
deeply in order for it to be playable
just like you can't really tickle

[08:01]
just like you can't really tickle
yourself Romantics have to feel as if
those parts of themselves really do
inhere in external reality in order to
feel something otherwise what's the
point this is why people are not only in
denial about this process but they are
often willfully in denial about this
process and will fight tooth and nail
against anyone who threatens to bring
this to their awareness romantic love is
a very cherished golden calf
however the truth is that you can't
actually reunite with the disavowed
parts of yourself by entering into a
romantic relationship with another
person that's the truth you can only do
that by preventing the disavowal of
those parts to begin with Romantics have
been whole the entire
time they only feel incomplete and
separate in their own perceptual
experience as a consequence of this
disavow to become whole
people don't need a relationship people

[09:02]
people don't need a relationship people
need to wake up to their own essential
wholeness and heal from whatever
emotional wound caus the self to become
fractured in the first place this is
typically not as exciting as the game of
hide-and-seek but trust me it is far
more rewarding what do you think does
