I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
limitations of science
so I'm going to be approaching this
theme through the lens of this channel
as you may have noticed I don't often
talk about psychological research I've
done a few episodes in which I've
discussed some interesting articles and
I've linked those episodes to the
articles in question but I definitely
don't back up everything that I say with
a citation from the literature and I'd
like to discuss why that is in today's
episode
the main reason why I don't corroborate
all of my claims with empirical
literature is because having conducted a
fair share of psychological research in
my time I know how easy it is to lie
under the guise of objectivity
as Mark Twain once said there are three
types of Lies there are lies damned lies
and statistics
the fact of the matter is is that the
vast majority of people do not

[01:01]
vast majority of people do not
understand how to interpret statistics
they do not understand how statistical
models function and they do not
understand how to evaluate research
design
and without these three understandings
the average person is an absolutely no
position to evaluate the strength of a
given study and that is because such a
person cannot evaluate the biases in the
model the limitations of the analysis
and the assumptions inherent in the
design
the average person stands in relation to
science much the same way a medieval
peasant stood in relation to the
Catholic church he couldn't understand
the Latin but it was also impressive
sounding that it certainly must be true
if I wanted to I could find a research
study that corroborates the claims I
make in any given episode
and if I wanted to I could find a
research study that corroborates the
opposite of anything that I claim in a

[02:00]
opposite of anything that I claim in a
given episode
this is because Dirty Little Secret if
you understand how to conduct research
you can more or less make the evidence
come out the way that you want it to
if you understand how to finagle
statistical models and you know how to
manipulate research protocols you can
Custom Tailor the finding to your study
and this will bamboozle most of the
people who aren't about to carefully
evaluate the study and make up their own
minds
the complaint used to be that people
just read the abstracts of articles
now they just read the headlines based
on the titles of the articles
contemporary research is also
significantly influenced by both funding
interests and the publication process
for instance a non-significant finding
which might be meaningful and important
from the perspective of Truth or the
progression of pure science is almost
certainly not going to be published in a
respectable Journal where there is a
strong bias for significant findings to

[03:02]
strong bias for significant findings to
that end researchers are heavily
incentivized to create studies and to
utilize methods that facilitate the
identification of statistically
significant differences
keep in mind that a statistically
significant difference might not be a
meaningful difference to anyone with a
head on their shoulders which is also
why studies tend to focus on either the
irrelevant or the obvious especially in
the social sciences
most people have no direct experience
with the dumpster fire that is the
environment within which scientific
research is formulated conducted and
disseminated
when serving on the faculty of
psychology departments I found that even
grad students tend to gloss over the
methods and results sections of most the
articles that they read
this is because until you've read
hundreds and hundreds of these articles
the methods and results sections of Any
Given paper basically read like well
medieval Latin

[04:02]
medieval Latin
these parts of an article are
functionally written in another language
and it takes time and suffering to
achieve any degree of appreciable
fluency but if you don't read the
language what happens you can't tell
whether the interpretation is grounded
appropriately in the results you can't
tell if the abstract is an accurate
summary of the interpretation and you
can't tell if the title is a fair
reflection of the abstract sure almost
every sentence in the article has a
corresponding citation but did you read
all of those articles to determine
whether they had any Merit most of the
most of this is taken on faith
faith in a scholarship and objectivity
that I'm afraid may not be warranted
now before I go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing then please
consider sending this episode to someone
who might benefit from its message
because it's Word of Mouth referrals
like this that really help to make the
channel grow and if you're liking what
you're hearing then please consider

[05:01]
you're hearing then please consider
hitting the super thanks button it's
those three little dots in the lower
right hand corner beneath the screen and
tip me in proportion to the value you
feel you've received from this episode
it's those donations that make all of
this possible so I really appreciate
your support
in any case well I typically do not
corroborate all the claims that I make
in an episode with a study I do believe
that the vast majority of my claims are
at least falsifiable that is that a
study at least in theory could be
conducted to substantiate my claims
that said well I'm not going to lie to
you I'm much less interested in what is
factually accurate than what is
meaningfully true
appreciation of this difference leads to
two very different conceptualizations of
science
on the one hand you have the cult of
scientism
which with which we are all duly
familiar at this point this belief
system is usually practiced by people

[06:01]
system is usually practiced by people
who have enough knowledge to know that
they know some things but not enough
knowledge to know that they know very
little
this particular combination can make
them very proud
notwithstanding they routinely mistake
descriptions for explanations believe
randomized controlled trials are the
gold standard of Truth and indirectly
succumb to arguments of authority all
the time
however that's just one
conceptualization of science
on the other hand you have the let's say
more humble and eminently more useful
conceptualization of science as know-how
the ability to do the thing
I've personally met illiterate and
unschooled people who possess a
knowledge of reality that greatly
outstrips scientistic understanding
and this science clearly shines forth in
their ability to among other things live
in prosperous harmony with themselves
and others and to attend to the

[07:01]
and others and to attend to the
necessities of man which if you think
about it are the only legitimate goals
of science to begin with
if you can explain it but you can't do
it then you have a scientistic
understanding if you can do it but you
can't explain it then you have a
know-how understanding
both are forms of science but know-how
is higher
it's the difference between
extrapolating the laws of aerodynamics
and building an airplane that flies
ideally we use the former to do the
latter but that is not strictly
necessary
again I don't often speak from the
perspective of the empirical literature
because a I'd rather not just summarize
someone else's ideas I have some of my
own thank you very much and B because
the empirical literature is what we call
a show
and if you don't understand how that is
true then frankly you're not in a
position to evaluate what you believe
from the perspective of science

[08:00]
from the perspective of science
and I doubt anyone who actually
understands the literature will take
issue with anything I've said here today
so while I don't often speak here on the
basis of empirical evidence I do often
speak on the grounds of my know-how
that is my expertise
this is expertise that comes from as it
were building thousands and thousands of
airplanes
I've seen how people act up close and in
confidence and I know what people
generally have to do to achieve their
desired outcomes and there is nothing
that I have ever advised a client to do
professionally nor anything that I have
ever abdicated on this channel publicly
that I have not first tried myself and
found it to be useful in achieving a
desired outcome
this is because it is very rare for
someone to present me with a problem
that I haven't to some degree
encountered in my own life
in any case if the plane flies maybe I
do have a science to what I'm talking
about but hey don't take my word for it

[09:00]
about but hey don't take my word for it
try it out for yourself and see whether
it works and remember if you already
knew
you would probably already have the
outcome that you wanted
so if your life doesn't yet quite look
like the way you want it to it's good to
keep an open mind you'll find the
answers where you haven't already looked
