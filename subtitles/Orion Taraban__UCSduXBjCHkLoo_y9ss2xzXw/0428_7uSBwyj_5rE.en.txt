basically I'm a psychologist in private
practice and I specialize in men's
Mental Health
and I've been in private practice for a

my clients I felt that what I could
offer might be of benefit to an even

I tried to think about how I could do
that so of all the different options
that I considered it seemed like
starting a YouTube channel might be

to working on this podcast and
Publishing regularly like clockwork with
no exceptions for at least three years
and if I still didn't reach my primary
threshold of success I would reevaluate
at that time and that primary threshold
of success was a hundred thousand

little less than two so I overshot the
time estimate but that's you know better
than the other way around because I
might have given up
