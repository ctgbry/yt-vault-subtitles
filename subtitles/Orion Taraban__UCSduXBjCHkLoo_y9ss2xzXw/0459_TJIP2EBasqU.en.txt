I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how men
mess up new relationships this issue I'm
about to discuss is very common in this
episode I'll discuss what this issue is
why it's a problem and what you the male
viewer can do instead so you don't have
to go through the premature termination
of a promising relationship let's get to
it
to understand how men fumble in the
early stages of the courtship process we
have to take a quick detour into the
field of developmental psychology
in the early 20th century developmental
psychologist Margaret Mahler described a
phase that all children go through
called the reproachment stage this
occurs between a year and a half and two
and a half years of age the toddler is
up and walking and is curious about its
environment the world is fascinating
everything is new and it wants to
explore to learn to grow to mature

[01:01]
explore to learn to grow to mature
that's the organic propensity of life
that said the child only recently
learned it's a separate entity from its
mother does not yet possess the
psychological concept of object
permanence and is very small and
vulnerable this is a tricky situation to
be in
so what toddlers basically do is they
run off to explore say the backyard or
different corners of the house in order
to satisfy that need for expansion and
growth but once they lose sight of mommy
once they're out of earshot they start
to feel insecure
they start to feel a little afraid does
mommy still exist did she forget about
me
and what they do is they run back to
Mommy not because they really want to
like spend time with her but because
they want to make sure that Mommy is
still there
and this is why Mahler talked about how
it's really important in this stage for
parents to be a secure base for their

[02:02]
parents to be a secure base for their
children like Mommy needs to be home
base so that the child can come back for
reassurance and encouragement when it is
feeling uncertain and insecure and once
it's reassured it runs off and gets back
to exploring
so the reproach them all stage is a is
characterized by a lot of back and forth
I'm running away and now I'm running
back I'm running away and now I'm
running back
and this stage kind of approximates the
early courtship process alternating
periods of togetherness and separateness
and where guys mess up at this stage of
the process is that for whatever reason
maybe they can't tolerate the distress
of the woman's absence maybe they're
impatient for another sexual encounter
for whatever reason
guys try to collapse this appropriate
rhythm of interaction one way or another
that is either they try to get her to
stop exploring to secure a commitment
quickly and before she's ready or they

[03:02]
quickly and before she's ready or they
try to call her back sooner to decrease
the periods between subsequent
interactions
and doing either one of these things is
going to jeopardize the burgeoning
relationship
now most women want commitment that is
most women want committed relationships
from the men they want to have those
relationships with but they kind of want
to trap themselves in that relationship
as opposed to feeling like they're being
trapped by the men that they're dating
and let me tell you if a mother isn't
comfortable for whatever reason with the
child running off and spending time
without her and tries to call the child
back before the child is ready to return
and that mother is going to be met with
indifference or willfulness or
frustration
as hard as it may be the mother has to
tolerate her own distress in the face of
the growing Independence of the child
and Trust the child will come back in
its own time

[04:00]
its own time
and if the mother tries to accelerate
that moment through her own insecurity
or impatience she's going to pass
through a difficult time
by analogy men you have to tolerate
whatever distress or discomfort comes up
in you when you haven't heard from a
woman in a certain amount of time
trust the process and have confidence
that she will return in her own time and

because it's your donations that make
all of this happen I really appreciate
your support
now let me talk about a distinct but

[05:01]
now let me talk about a distinct but
related way in which men snatch defeat
from the jaws of success in the first
weeks or months of dating
remember when I described the reproach
them all stage I noted that it's when
the child hasn't seen mommy in a while
that it starts to feel anxious and
insecure
and it's these emotions that motivate
the child to go back to make sure mommy
is still there
the important thing to appreciate here
is that if the child didn't feel anxious
or insecure the child wouldn't go
running back to Mommy
so what does this mean with respect to
the courtship process men what it means
is that though it's weird to say the
anxiety the uncertainty the instability
these things are your friends
because it's these things like in the
case of the child that are going to
motivate the woman to return
for her to come back she kind of has to

[06:01]
for her to come back she kind of has to
miss you to wonder about you and to
question whether you're still going to
be there
and she can't miss you or wonder about
you if a you don't allow her the time
and space to miss you and B if you don't
allow her to wonder about you because
you've already confessed your feelings
for her
as I've mentioned before it's important
to give people the gift of your absence
because it's your absence that creates
the necessary conditions for a reunion
you can't reunite with someone who never
leaves or who is not allowed to leave
women like children in the reposia mall
stage need to be allowed to come back in
their own time seriously don't worry
about it if you play your cards right
you'll miss this phase of the
relationship before too long
and part of that longing for your
presence should be a sense of wonder a
hint of uncertainty

[07:01]
hint of uncertainty
men mess this up all the time they try
to reduce that uncertainty as much as
possible as quickly as possible they
text I had a great time last night I
really like you I can't wait to see you
again like good work dude
um it might be nice for a woman to hear
those things in the moment that she
hears them but what they functionally do
is they provide her reassurance without
actually interacting with you
remember when the child is feeling
insecure it actually had to run back to
Mommy for that reassurance and here you
are providing the reassurance without
the interaction and by doing so you make
the internet action unnecessary and
redundant wow good job there is no need
for her to come back to you to confirm
how you feel as you've already made that
abundantly clear the reunion is made
necessary by the separation and the
uncertainty don't mess with them

[08:00]
uncertainty don't mess with them
ideally and this is especially true in
the early stages of the courtship
process the woman should feel unsure
about how you feel about her
this creates the necessary conditions
for further interaction to resolve that
uncertainty like after you first sleep
with a woman she should pass through a
moment where she begins to wonder
whether that was just a one-night stand
she should think oh that's strange I
usually hear from a man by now
was he just using me for sex was that
just a hookup I thought he liked me the
date went really well huh
this is a good place for a woman to be
because it creates the emotional
motivation for her to come back to
resolve her uncertainties
and before I get any Flack for this
suggestion just consider that the
alternative is trying to get women to
come back before they're ready to do so
and we all know how well that goes
