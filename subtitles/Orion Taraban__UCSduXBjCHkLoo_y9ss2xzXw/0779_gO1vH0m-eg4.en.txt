it's important to consider that a lot of
the kindness that people perform in
their everyday lives is the unrecognized
kindness of those who don't stop this is
because so many people are really just
trying to keep their heads above water
they are so wrapped up in the busyness
of their lives they are so taxed with
respect to their time and their money
and their attention that frankly the
only kindness they're capable of doing
which is not necessarily a small thing
is discharging their own
responsibilities it's generally those
who have enough time or enough money or
enough emotional bandwidth who are in a
position to lend a hand of course there
are people who have tons of time and
money and do jack so that's true
too but what I've discovered is that
it's so much easier to help other people
when you have arrived at a place of
abundance a surplus of time attention
emotional bandwidth and very often money
because let's be real very few actual
problems are solved with a kind word
