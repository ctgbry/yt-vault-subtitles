i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
how to believe in yourself when you have
no good reason to
so in my episode bet on yourself i spoke
on the importance of being your biggest
supporter
if you don't believe that you could do
it why would anybody else
unshakable self-confidence is a game
changer both in personal and
professional relationships
seems pretty self-explanatory
that said i occasionally get pushback
from some of my clients on this subject
and the most common objection i hear
is some variant of all right orion
self-confidence is all well and good but
what if you feel like you're kind of a
worthless waste of space
and that you never do anything right
and that you don't yet have any
successes to speak of
how can you be authentically confident
if that's what you're working with
i mean fair enough right
and the way i generally respond to this

[01:01]
and the way i generally respond to this
objection is to ask these people to
consider that they're the coach of a
high school football team that's down at
halftime
what would a coach in this situation do
throw his players under the bus
complain about how incompetent and inept
his team is and decide it would just be
better to forfeit the rest of the game
and go home
that is not what a coach would do
a coach in this situation needs to do
three things
first he needs to acknowledge the
scoreboard yep
they got us in that half not gonna lie
it's been tough out there and we're down
by a lot
second he needs to make a new plan okay
so this is what we're gonna do different
where we zigged in the first half we're
gonna zag in the second and maybe
that'll help turn some things around
and third he needs to set his players up
for a comeback
we're not out of this yet there's still
time on the clock when we come back from
behind they're going to be talking about
this game for years so who's with me

[02:02]
this game for years so who's with me
so that's how you root for yourself when
you feel like you have no good reason to
you acknowledge the scoreboard you make
a new plan and you set yourself up for a
comeback a coach doesn't give up on his
players and you can never
give up on yourself
