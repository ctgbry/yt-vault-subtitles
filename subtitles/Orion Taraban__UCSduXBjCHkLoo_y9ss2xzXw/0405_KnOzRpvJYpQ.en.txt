I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is most
people are delusional
now I'm not suggesting that most people
think the CIA is beaming thoughts into
their Consciousness or some such thing
that is very bizarre for a delusion and
because it's bizarre it's very
noticeable
if most people are delusional in the
sense of having a false belief about
reality then that could really only
happen if the delusion in question were
so prevalent that it's ubiquity renders
it invisible
much the same way that fish can't see
the water and everyday delusion is
functionally transparent to those who
believe it but for all the people under
its spell it remains a delusion
nonetheless
in so many words the most common
delusion that people suffer from
is that our judgments about reality in

[01:02]
is that our judgments about reality in
here in reality itself
let me explain to begin with you have to
understand that the universe is empty
and I don't mean empty in the sense of
devoid of matter though the universe is
in fact also mostly empty in this sense
but empty in an instrumental sense like
a cup is empty it's the emptiness of a
cup that makes it functional and that
emptiness is kind of non-discriminatory
it's not like a cup can only contain
certain liquids and not others a cup can
contain any liquid that can be poured in
it that's what makes it useful
in this way the universe is like a cup
in that it can contain whatever a mind
projects into it because it is empty the
same phenomenon can contain a positive
judgment projected from one mind and a
negative judgment projected by another
so which one is the phenomenon really

[02:02]
so which one is the phenomenon really
positive or negative
it's probably true is to say it is what
it is which while accurate isn't very
informative it's a tautology which means
that it's true by definition and it
doesn't give us any new knowledge in
fact it kind of frustrates the act of
knowing which has long been used as a
strategy in the service of Enlightenment
but I digress
reality is empty
in that it can receive any judgment a
human mind is capable of projecting into
it
and that's somewhat tragic because most
people's judgment
are not grounded in objectivity or
wisdom or even a consistent morality
rather most people's judgments are
incredibly self-centered
to the vast majority of people good is
what they want or what they believe in
and bad is what they don't want and or
what they don't believe in

[03:00]
what they don't believe in
it kind of goes like this
when something happens and in that
moment people perceive that it aligns
with their personally relevant goals I.E
it's what they want they judge that
something as good and project that
judgment into reality
and almost as soon as they do this they
kind of wipe their own memory of that
projection
it's like a self-imposed amnestic
disorder and since they forget or
willfully suppress that awareness
that they projected that judgment into
reality then they experience reality as
if their judgments in here in reality
itself
people believe they are experiencing a
good thing like the thing itself is good
and not their own externally projected
Judgment of goodness in the vast
majority of cases they think they are
accurately perceiving something that
objectively exists in reality and that

[04:01]
objectively exists in reality and that
is the delusion
but before I go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this video to someone
who might benefit from its message it's
Word of Mouth referrals like this that
really help to make the channel grow and
you can also hit the super thanks button
and tip me in proportion to the value
you feel you derived from this video I
really appreciate your support
now this delusion is enacted
quintillions of times a day by billions
of people
it's also constantly reified by our
language when we say things like he's
such a nice boy or what a rude thing to
say or things are starting to look up or
that date was disappointing or that was
the best thing that ever happened to me
or that's wrong or Etc and just like
delusions in clinical practice this
delusion is accompanied by a whole
spectrum of insight there are people who

[05:02]
spectrum of insight there are people who
experience this delusion but possess
enough awareness to let's say hold their
perceptions lightly
and there are those who are going to
think that I'm absolutely nuts for
suggesting that good things aren't good
and bad things aren't bad
these folks while potentially
well-meaning just don't see the water
yet
from a purely psychological perspective
your experience of reality is likely
much more a reflection of your own mind
than a consequence of anything inherent
in that reality and this is problematic
because if all people see are facets of
their own projected Consciousness then
the universe is really just one big Hall
of Mirrors which is functionally the
narcissistic dilemma everything is a
reflection of the self and if that
reflection is a projected judgment that

[06:00]
reflection is a projected judgment that
is functionally based on whether you
want or don't want something to happen
then the entire universe is reduced to
an instrumental extension of your desire
which is functionally hell
when people are operating under this
delusion they actually can't see
anything other than themselves like
their eyes can see the forms of reality
like that's a tree and that's a man and
that's a house but what they're really
perceiving are the projected aspects of
themselves that they then experience as
inherent in reality
and this way of navigating reality is
extraordinarily common
so what can we do about it
well we can become increasingly aware of
this mental process I don't believe it's
possible to completely refrain from
projecting our judgments or mental
constructs into reality but I absolutely

[07:00]
constructs into reality but I absolutely
believe that it's possible to let's say
withhold certain judgments and clarify
others that is we can divest them of
their emotionally provocative content
and that's typically a sign that we're
closer to reality because again reality
is what it is it's kind of hard to feel
one way or another about reality the
more we see it clearly
I can't really say anything more about
reality because going beyond that is
tantamount to imbuing it with my own
projected judgment
and this is why Enlightenment which may
be understood as entering into reality
is always described as an ineffable
experience it's something that even the
greatest spiritual Traditions can kinda
only point to from afar like the Dao
that can be named is not the real Dao
kind of thing
and why is that because the Dao or
reality will never be isomorphic with

[08:01]
reality will never be isomorphic with
whatever projected judgment or mental
construct I use to define or describe it
and to make matters worse people might
confuse the projection for The Real
McCoy make sense
again the vast majority of people on
this planet suffer from the delusion
that their judgments about reality in
here in reality it happens so often and
is reified by our language that we see
nothing crazy about it
in fact we reserve the term delusion for
folks whose judgments about reality
deviate significantly from the
conventional judgments we have tacitly
agreed are appropriate to assume in here
in reality the two groups aren't really
doing anything different there are just
socially acceptable delusions and
socially unacceptable delusions but they
are delusions all the same
the only way out that I can see is to
become more aware of this process over

[09:00]
become more aware of this process over
time awareness can help shatter the
mirrors and facilitate a more direct
experience of reality as it is
everything else is a prison of your own
making
