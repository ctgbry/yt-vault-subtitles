this is the diagnostic and statistical
Manual of mental disorders published by
the American Psychiatric association now
in its fifth edition it contains nearly
300 different illnesses but here's the
thing none of these nearly 300 mental
illnesses can be objectively assessed
for all of these illnesses diagnosis is
primarily based on self-reported
criteria checklists of symptoms this
means that you could book a session with
a doctor say you've had five of these
eight symptoms over the past month which
has caused you a lot of distress and
boom you now have a mental illness can
you imagine a medical system in which
the patient tells the doctor that he has
strep throat or pancreatic cancer or
brain aneurysm and that the doctor has
no way to objectively confirm that
assessment and of course if there were
no way to objectively confirm the
presence of these diseases then there
would also be no way to objectively
confirm whether the diseases ever went
away
