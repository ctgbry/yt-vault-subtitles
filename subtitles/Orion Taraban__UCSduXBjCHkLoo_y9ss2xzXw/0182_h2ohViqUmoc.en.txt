i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
love
sex
and commitment
these three concepts are
completely independent of each other
love does not guarantee sex or
commitment
sex does not guarantee love or
commitment and commitment does not
guarantee sex or love you can have none
of these
all of these or most commonly some
combination of these
however understanding that the existence
of one does not imply the existence of
the others should help to reduce the
amount of unnecessary suffering in
relationships
in this episode i'm going to run through
the eight different possible
combinations of these factors using
examples from cinema to illustrate each
so if you want to learn more about these
various types of relationships go watch
the movie i'll also note that i'm basing
some of these concepts on robert

[01:00]
some of these concepts on robert
sternberg's triangular theory which used
the concepts of intimacy passion and
decision to reflect similar combinations
so let's give credit where credit is due
let's get to it
the first possibility is that you have
none of those things no sex no love no
commitment in film this person is often
depicted as some sort of strange weirdo
like travis bickle in taxi driver or a
pitiable buffoon like andy stitzer in
the 40 year old virgin however that's
not really quite fair because this is
pretty much everybody's starting point
so if you're in this stage chances are
you're still a young person early on in
the process don't worry that will change
next let's say you have sex
no love no commitment
this is hookup culture and i think this
is best exemplified in the movie fight
club in the relationship between tyler
durden and marla singer tyler treats

[02:00]
durden and marla singer tyler treats
this woman like crap and to be fair she
kind of enjoys it which is interesting
and they obviously have no explicit
commitment to each other but they do
have riotous epic sexual escapades and
that's what their relationship is about
then you can have love
without sex or commitment
this is often unrequited love or a
strong mutual friendship one of the best
examples of this is in the movie in the
mood for love in which the male
protagonist falls in love with a woman
who is married to another man she
actually reciprocates the feeling and
they kind of have an emotional affair
but it's never consummated and she
ultimately decides to remain with her
husband
next you can have commitment
but no love or sex
a lot of marriages actually end up here
not so fun fact around 20 of american
marriages are considered sexless
according to the national health and

[03:01]
according to the national health and
social life survey a great example of
this is in the relationship between
lester and carolyn burnham in american
beauty
they're married to each other but
they're clearly not happy and they're
obviously not having sex at least with
each other the relationship kind of
falls apart in an arguably beneficial
way when the two start being more honest
with each other and with themselves
okay
now let's move on to the next level
where you get two out of the three
let's say you have sex and love
but no commitment
this
is modern day romance remember the
romantic sect was opposed the catholic
sacrament of marriage though they
weren't big on sex either to be fair
hence modern day romance a great example
of this is the relationship between jack
and enos in brokeback mountain those two
guys loved each other they went on their
fishing trips together but they were
married to other women it's a common
romantic plot

[04:00]
romantic plot
next
is love and commitment but no sex
this is generally known as companionate
love it's the kind of love that's
romanticized in the idea of growing old
together
sitting on the porch holding hands and
basking in the warmth of your sweet and
wholesome love a great example of this
is norman and ethel in on golden pond
it's sweet and endearing though the
passion has long since gone out of the
relationship
next is sex and commitment but no love
there are a few different forms this
combination can take but the most common
one is a tumultuous and whirlwind
romance in which two people who don't
know each other very well and may not
even like each other very much can't
keep their hands off each other and rush
to get married a fantastic example of
this relationship
is in the french classic la atalante in
which the newly married couple
fight and make up to fight and make up

[05:02]
fight and make up to fight and make up
and last but not least is all three
which you might call ideal love i'm
gonna be real with you this one is
really hard to get in real life
most people are gonna end up with two
out of three for the better part of
their lives
so pick your poison
and there also aren't a lot of great
examples of this in cinema most likely
because the story of a loving committed
and passionate relationship doesn't make
for good drama
what when these relationships do show up
in film it's usually in the early part
of the movie and then something happens
and the protagonist loses access to that
relationship which kind of serves as
character motivation for the rest of the
film
a good example of this is the
relationship between tom and edie in a
history of violence
when we first meet tom played by vigo
mortensen he's married to a beautiful
wife and has a couple of kids edie loves
him and their peaceful little life and

[06:00]
him and their peaceful little life and
she even dresses up in her old high
school cheerleading uniform for him
there's even this point in the movie
where he's like looking at her in that
uniform and he's thinking i'm the
luckiest guy in the world what did i do
what did i do to deserve the situation
and then of course something happens in
the film and all this is jeopardized
which creates the dramatic thrust of the
film
so remember
love sex and commitment are independent
concepts the presence of one does not
imply the existence of the others and
the examples i've given you all come
from great movies that deserve to be
watched in their own right i hope you
found this useful what do you think
