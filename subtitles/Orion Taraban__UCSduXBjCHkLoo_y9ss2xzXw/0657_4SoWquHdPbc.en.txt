I spoke with a woman in her early 50s
recently who had two kids by two
previous marriages and who told me that
she wasn't willing to have sex before
marriage with any man she is currently
dating you can't make this up as may be
unsurprising she has been single for
quite some time I spoke with another
woman recently she was 41 who was
looking to get married and start a
family she told me that she blamed her
inability to have secure this
relationship already on the fact that in
the past she jumped into bed with men
too quickly I assured her this was not
the problem women should be very
sexually generous with the men they're
hoping to catch the problem was not what
she was doing the problem was who she
was doing it with as I've said before
women do the right things with the wrong
men but rather than examine her tendency
of targeting the wrong men she decided
to shoot herself in the foot by making a
relationship with her even more
expensive than it otherwise would have
been by making men wait longer for sex
now she wouldn't sleep with a man until
at least the third date
