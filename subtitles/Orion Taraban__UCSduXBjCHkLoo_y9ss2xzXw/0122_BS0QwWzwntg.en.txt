i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychs
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is drax
and the warriors mindset
so in today's episode we're going to
take another dip into pop psychology
right now i'm playing through the
surprisingly excellent
guardians of the galaxy video game for
the playstation 5. it has been a blast
the game is so imaginative the script
writing is phenomenal and all of the
voice acting is
first rate across the board with a
standout performance from jason cavalier
who voices drax the destroyer excellent
work jason really really digging your
interpretation of the character
so for those of you who are unaware the
guardians of the galaxy are kind of a
ragtag group of misfits who fly around
on a spaceship and basically bluster
their way through all sorts of
predicaments
all the protagonists are kind of damaged

[01:01]
all the protagonists are kind of damaged
in their own way and that's a big part
of what makes them endearing and
relatable
and one of the characters is drax the
destroyer who as the name suggests is
this big muscle-headed guy with a
sketchy past and a noble warrior's heart
and i'm calling drax out for two reasons
first he has this relationship with
challenge that i think is really really
useful
rather than shying away from the
grueling and demanding tasks like most
of the other characters
drax sees the easy path as undignified
and unworthy of his attention
he seeks out the biggest baddies to
tangle with because only those opponents
will bring him glory and renown
while the others are complaining about
their misfortune draxes enthusiastically
embracing the challenge because anything
less would betray his legacy and reflect
poorly on him as a warrior so i really

[02:02]
poorly on him as a warrior so i really
like this mindset got a big challenge
great bring it on i a victory of this
magnitude will only add to my legend and
anything else is it worth my time
that's one of the messages i get from
drax
he also has this really great attitude
with respect to death
over the course of the game the heroes
get into a bunch of hairy predicaments
and while the other characters are
screaming that they're about to die drax
seems to be enjoying himself immensely
for drax it doesn't seem to be a
question of if he will die that's a
foregone conclusion he knows that he
will
the question is whether he will die a
noble and glorious death fit for a
catastrone warrior
he's not interested in avoiding the end
he's interested in making sure that his
inevitable end is worthy of his life
and if so he will embrace it
wholeheartedly

[03:01]
wholeheartedly
so just a brief character analysis of
drax the destroyer who exhibits at least
a couple interesting and admirable
character traits
