I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is what
people fail to understand about
depression depression is one of the most
commonly diagnosed mental illnesses on
the planet Legions of Americans are
currently taking some form of prescribed
anti-depressant it is a problem that
affects the quality of life of millions
and millions of individuals every day
and it's also an issue that is generally
misunderstood
by the vast majority of people including
those suffering from it let's talk about
this today the principle way in which
depression is
misunderstood is that is considered to
reside entirely between the ears of the
depressed individual I call this the
intas psychic fallacy and this fallacy
gives rise to the two most popular
approaches to intervention neither of
which unfortunately is associated with a

[01:00]
which unfortunately is associated with a
very high rate of success we can look at
each one in turn the first way this
fallacy manifests itself is in the
belief that depression exists in the
brain of the depressed individual you're
probably familiar with some version of
the monoamine hypothesis which I have
previously discussed on this channel the
monoamine hypothesis is the theory that
depression is caused by an imbalance in
certain brain chemicals like serotonin
and if this were true true it would make
sense to recalibrate the balance of
these brain chemicals using
pharmaceutical
interventions now many people don't know
that this hypothesis was actually
recanted by its originator decades ago
due to a lack of evidence to quote the
largest metaanalysis ever conducted on
the topic quote the main areas of
Serotonin research provide no consistent
evidence of there being an association

[02:02]
evidence of there being an association
between serotonin and depression and no
support for the hypothesis that
depression is caused by lowered
serotonin activity or concentrations
linked to the full study in the pinned
comment note that the finding was no
association which means the metaanalysis
failed to identify even a correlation
let alone a causation between serotonin
levels and
depression what's more anti-pr pres that
manipulate serotonin have a terrible
track record in randomized controlled
trials when compared against an active
Placebo and why aren't these findings
more widely known you know I'm not sure
but I doubt it could have anything to do
with the fact that there is an entire
rationale for a multi-billion dollar
industry that is predicated on the
validity of that hypothesis but I
digress the point here is that
anti-depressants are one of the
inevitable consequences of cons
considering depression to exist in the

[03:01]
considering depression to exist in the
brain of the depressed individual and
the second way this fallacy manifests
itself is in the belief that depression
exists in the mind of the depressed
individual we could call this the
cognitive hypothesis which maintains
that depression is caused by the
presence of certain distorted beliefs
about the self in the world if these
thoughts and beliefs were sufficiently
restructured or brought into alignment
with reality then the depression should
diminish significantly and if this were
true
it would make sense to restructure
certain beliefs like those related to
the self-concept or associated with
self-efficacy using individual
Psychotherapy and this isn't entirely
wrong Psychotherapy especially cognitive
behavioral therapy is associated with a
reduction in depressive symptoms what's
more these reductions are typically more
enduring than any reductions associated
with psychiatric medications that means
that folks tend to derive a protective
benefit from therapy even after it is

[04:01]
benefit from therapy even after it is
discontinued that they don't derive from
Pharmaceuticals after they are
discontinued and certain therapeutic
interventions might be necessary though
perhaps not entirely sufficient to
eliminating depression for instance it
is extremely difficult if not impossible
to recover from depression while the
critical inner voice is still active and
highly engaged and Psychotherapy can
significantly help to silence this
Insidious inject in any case the point
here is is that individual Psychotherapy
is one of the inevitable consequences of
considering depression to exist in the
mind of the depressed individual now

g.com I wrote all the content it's the
best on the market you're going to love
it okay so let's get back to
it so what's wrong with the in psychic
fallacy well in my opinion it largely
ignores where the L's share of
depression comes from namely people's
relationships to their larger
environments of particular note is the
fact that depression is associated with
being low status in a self-relevant
dominance
hierarchy life is hard at the bottom of
the latter low status individuals are
more likely to have limited if any
optionality with respect to professional
opportunities and little to know access
to sexual relationships they may have
few to know friends or close confidants
they may be ignored or even reviled by

[06:01]
they may be ignored or even reviled by
those around them and while it is
possible strictly speaking to be
peaceful and contented and resilient at
the bottom of the hierarchy it is
extremely difficult to do so and those
who reside at the lowest rungs of these
hierarchies are typically those least
equipped with the skills to mitigate the
effects of their status and guess who
always starts out at the bottom of Any
Given status hierarchy young men as soon
as you get out there at 18 you are at
the bottom of the barrel that's why
that's why this is a particularly
Insidious disease among young men this
kind of status oriented
depression the fact of the matter is
that many people are depressed because
of the actual state of their lives
unfortunately the symptoms of depression
can keep people mired in this state much
longer than is necessary this is not
only because depression is unjustifiably
pessimistic or even hopeless about the
future and so inappropriately assumes

[07:00]
future and so inappropriately assumes
that the way things are is the way
they're always going to be but because
depression is associated with behavioral
inertia which makes constructive
conservative effort to alter the
unfavorable state of things less likely
as well however I'm here to tell you
that moving up status hierarchies is one
of the most reliable ways of becoming
less depressed for the simple reason
that life doesn't suck quite so much
when you're not at the bottom of the
barrel this is probably why the
intervention that is most consistently
associated with the alleviation of
depression in the literature is
behavioral
activation actually getting out there
and doing something different when
people change what they do over and
above changing the thoughts inside their
minds or the chemicals inside their
brains they stand their best possible
chance of influencing their positioning
within any given status hierarchy and

[08:00]
within any given status hierarchy and
their relationship to their larger
environment among other things this
these increases in status can make life
significantly more comfortable Pleasant
and rewarding and while it is certainly
still possible to be depressed when life
is comfortable Pleasant and rewarding
it's probably a good idea to first rule
out the possibility that the depression
is caused by life being uncomfortable
unpleasant and
unrewarding like are you depressed or
are you lonely are you depressed or are
you unfulfilled are you depressed or are
undisciplined loneliness unfulfillment
and a lack of discipline are not
diseases so why would you go to a
medical doctor to fix
them in any case it's always a good idea
to rule out the confounds first what do
