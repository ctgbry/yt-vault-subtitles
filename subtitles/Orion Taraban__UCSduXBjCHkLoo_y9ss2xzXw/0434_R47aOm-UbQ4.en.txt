I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is
psychack's Better Living Through
psychology and the topic of today's
short talk is most people don't really
want relationships
most people this means men and women
most people do not really want
relationships and as we'll see this will
go far toward explaining why both sex
and relationships are at historically
all-time lows especially in younger
heterosexual populations fewer young
people than ever before are having sex
and fewer young people than ever before
are entering into relationships why
might this be the case
well as I said this is because most
people don't really want a relationship
remember
relationships are the medium in which
value is transacted if you already
possess the proposed value or if you can
obtain it more easily or more cheaply or

[01:01]
obtain it more easily or more cheaply or
more safely elsewhere
there is no need to enter into the
transaction
look at it like this no one really wants
a job
they want a job because of what a job
can give them namely money
If people could get what they wanted
money more easily more cheaply or more
safely elsewhere than they probably
wouldn't go looking for a job
but for the vast majority of people a
job is the only way they know to get
money
so they go looking for a job that said
they don't really want the job they want
the money and if they had the money they
wouldn't go looking for the job okay so
the same basic premise holds true with
respect to heterosexual relationships
especially in today's day and age most
people don't really want a relationship
they want what the relationship can give
them
and if they can get those things more
easily more cheaply or more safely

[02:02]
easily more cheaply or more safely
elsewhere than then we would expect them
not to enter into relationships as
frequently so what do men and women want
from relationships well they want all
kinds of things but in general men are
trading resources that is time energy
attention and money for sexual
opportunity
and women are trading sexual opportunity
for resources time attention energy and
money
if either sex could more easily more
cheaply and more safely get what they
wanted in places besides relationships
we should predictably see the number of
relationships Decline and that's exactly
what's happening
now there are two major culprits behind
this decline in relationships especially
in the 20-something demographic

[03:00]
in the 20-something demographic
pornography and social media
and this is very interesting because
it's generally men who have problems
with pornography and it's generally
women who have problems with social
media this obviously isn't always the
case but it does seem to fall along
gendered lines first let's take a look
at men in porn remember what men
generally want from relationships is to
trade resources for sexual opportunity
if they could get sexual opportunity
without exchanging resources or
exchanging far fewer resources then they
are rationally going to move in that
direction
and that's exactly what porn offers men
porn offers men free immediate and
dependable sexual opportunity and this
is only going to improve in the coming
years with artificial intelligence and
virtual reality
and rather than transact his one bundle
of resources for sexual opportunity from
one specific woman
he can now transact his one bundle of

[04:01]
he can now transact his one bundle of
resources for sexual opportunity from an
unlimited number of women on the
internet
men are not only able to buy sexual
opportunities from porn far more cheaply
than they would be able to do so from
women but given the abundance of
rejection and frustration that generally
comes from seeking out sexual
opportunity from women
far more safely as well
so if the sexual opportunity that women
represent is both expensive and high
risk then it's little wonder that so
many men are moving toward the cheap and
low risk sexual opportunity that porn
represents
now you could argue that porn isn't
truly a sexual opportunity it's just the
simulation of sexual opportunity
and I would agree with you
masturbating with porn is definitely not
the same thing as having sex with a
woman
but it's apparently enough like the same

[05:03]
but it's apparently enough like the same
thing that it's trapping a lot of men
especially because from a certain
perspective it's less risky and less
expensive
in any case men are foregoing
relationships at least in part due to
the fact that they can transact sexual
opportunity more easily more cheaply and
more safely elsewhere
so that's men
now before I get into women if you're

thanks button those three little dots in
the lower right hand corner and tip me
in proportion to the value you believe
you've received from this episode it's
your donations that make all this happen
and I'm very appreciative
now what about women
well women tend to get trapped by social
media because what are women looking for
from relationships in exchange for

[06:00]
from relationships in exchange for
sexual opportunity they're looking for
resources time energy attention and
money and women can get these things
more easily more cheaply and more safely
on Instagram or only fans than they can
in relationships so when a woman posts
thirst traps on Instagram or sexualized
content on only fans she's actually
using technology to leverage her sexual
opportunity through mechanical
reproduction
rather than transact her one sexual
opportunity for resources from one
specific man she can now transact her
one sexual opportunity for resources
from an unlimited number of men on the
internet
using social media a woman is able to
get the things she would otherwise
transact for in a relationship time
energy money and attention more easily
more cheaply and more safely
however since it's generally easier for
women to extract resources from a man

[07:01]
women to extract resources from a man
than for men to extract sexual
opportunity from a woman not as many
women have only fans accounts as men
have PornHub accounts
that said I would argue that the safer
Criterion is more important here than it
is with men
using sexual opportunity to obtain
resources for men is an inherently risky
Endeavor for women this is not only
because they tend to be smaller and
physically weaker but because there is a
profound vulnerability in the feminine
opening herself up to be penetrated by
the masculine so if women can eliminate
the risk associated with transacting
sexual opportunity for resources in Vivo
by digitizing it then you will see a
sizable proportion of women move in this
direction
now again you could argue that social
media doesn't provide true resources the
money might be real but the attention is
just Anonymous likes and the energy is a
mediated surrogate and I would agree
with you the validation and connection

[08:02]
with you the validation and connection
that comes from social media are
definitely not the same things as the
validation and connection that come from
an actual relationship
but apparently it's enough like the same
thing that it's trapping a lot of women
especially because from a certain
perspective it's less risky and less
expensive
in any case women are foregoing
relationships at least in part due to
the fact that they can now transact
resources more easily more cheaply and
more safely elsewhere
so what's the upshot
that people are increasingly replacing
relationships with simulated
relationships that is rather than
transact resources for sexual
opportunity in actual relationships
people are increasingly transacting
simulated resources for simulated sexual
opportunity in simulated relationships
and men and women are inhabiting roles
online that mirror their roles in the

[09:01]
online that mirror their roles in the
real life sexual Marketplace it's
fascinating
