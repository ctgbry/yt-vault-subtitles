I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is
addressing female disrespect
this is an extremely important topic
both for men and women so I hope
everyone will be listening carefully to
today's talk let's Jump Right In
the first thing that's important to
understand is that disrespect is
typically a process
it happens gradually over time
the best predictor of overt disrespect
is covert disrespect which are small
behaviors that have plausible
deniability
so if you don't want to have a larger
problem on your hands further down the
road it's important to address
disrespect while it is still in its
smaller forms
the clearest examples of the process of
disrespect are seen in high schools and
prisons
a bully doesn't usually go straight to
shaking down his Target that's actually

[01:00]
shaking down his Target that's actually
pretty risky if he doesn't know who he's
dealing with he could always pick the
wrong guy to mess with and that's going
to make his life more difficult and
complicated than he intended
so what these folks tend to do is they
kind of test their victim
classic example is bumping into their
target as they're crossing paths in a
hallway and seeing how he responds this
is a subtle test because there's some
plausible deniability here like oh well
maybe this person just wasn't looking
where he was going it happens sometimes
people jostle into each other
however
if the bully bumps into the target
and the target says excuse me
that person is now pegged as a target
for escalation
on the other hand if the target were to
respond appropriately and cast a warning
glance at the bully or issue a verbal
warning that bully could always play it
off whoa hey man chill out what got you
so worked up

[02:00]
so worked up
but he would probably think twice about
escalating the situation
now the issue is that most bullies kinda
know that they're bullies
and while women absolutely can be
bullies that is they are intentionally
using tactics to inflict emotional or
psychological pain in order to get what
they want
I also believe that a lot of women women
actually aren't aware of how they may be
communicating disrespect to men and this
is because at least in part respect
means different things to men and women
now before I go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this video to someone
who might benefit from its message its

now at this point I'm going to offer the
women in the audience a really simple
test to determine whether a behavior is
likely going to be perceived as
disrespectful to a man
here it is
with respect to any Behavior just ask
yourself
would I say the same thing in the same
way to my boss if I was interested in
keeping my job
if the answer to that question is no
congratulations you potentially have a
disrespectful behavior on your hands
if you are interested in keeping your
job would you roll your eyes at your
boss
would you be dismissive of your boss's
feedback would you complain angrily
would you respond to your boss's
requests sarcastically
would you nag your boss to comply with
your demands would you mutter under your
breath when your boss talks at meetings

[04:01]
breath when your boss talks at meetings
would you talk badly about your boss
with your co-workers behind his back
would you tease your boss would you be
openly indifferent or uninterested in
your boss's proposals
would you mock your boss's attempts to
maintain order and discipline
I think most of us understand that if
we're interested in keeping our jobs the
answer to all of those questions is no
and for the three percent of you out
there listening to this who are now
saying to yourselves well Ryan actually
I I tease my boss all the time we have a
really warm and playful relationship
okay then the question for you becomes
would you act like that with your boss
in front of other clients or customers
of course not and why is that because
you know how that behavior would come
off to other people who are not
initiated into your special little
dynamic and this means that you

[05:00]
dynamic and this means that you
understand my point
now before I address why this behavior
is detrimental to women's best interests
let me respond to the most common
objection I usually receive at this
point in my argument in short the
objection is some variant of that's nice
but a man is not the boss of me
okay fair enough
however your boss is not the boss of you
either
you're not his slave
he can't make you do things that you
don't want to do you are a participant
in an at-will professional relationship
he's not the boss of you however he is
the boss of you in a professional
context or even better he's the boss of
the employees which is a role that you
voluntarily agreed to assume and within
that Dynamic the boss has legitimate
authority to make reasonable demands of
and set reasonable expectations for his
employees
the person who builds the frame or to
use my sexual Marketplace metaphor

[06:00]
use my sexual Marketplace metaphor
builds the ship is the boss or captain
this is not always the man but it
generally is why because it's usually
men making bids to women to enter into
their Lifestyles not the other way
around
however even if you disagree with that
perspective a valid retort to the
objection I previously stated would be
why do you feel that your boss is
entitled to a higher level of respect
than I am
go shack up with that guy or see how he
puts up with your on his time
off
Ladies If you communicate if you
disrespect your man in ways that you
wouldn't disrespect your boss you are
functionally communicating that your
professional relationship with your boss
is more valuable to you than your
intimate relationship with your man and
maybe for you it is
and the communication is appropriate no
problem however if it isn't you should
be aware that you may be communicating
this message inadvertently
all right so why is disrespecting men

[07:01]
all right so why is disrespecting men
bad for women
we can approach the answer in two ways
in the first place a man who has any
self-worth whatsoever
and who enjoys any kind of optionality
in the sexual Marketplace will not
tolerate disrespect
so the woman being overtly or covertly
disrespectful she may be jeopardizing
what could otherwise be a fulfilling and
rewarding relationship for her that's
kind of the obvious reason but here's
the second reason and it's a little
spicier
disrespecting men not only threatens the
women's relationships
it also threatens their positive
emotionality
this is because it is not possible for a
woman to love a man she does not respect
it is possible for a man to love a woman
he does not respect that happens every
day however it is not possible for a
woman to love a man she does not respect
one of the many differences between men

[08:00]
one of the many differences between men
and women
for a woman where the respect goes the
love follows
so disrespect not only threatens the
relationship it threatens the love in
her heart it threatens the woman's own
positive regard
men nipping covert disrespect in the bud
is absolutely essential to the long-term
health of your relationship addressing
it is a way to safeguard her positive
regard for you
if the disrespect is allowed to continue
without consequence not only will the
behavior likely become increasingly
problematic
but the high interest and attraction you
may currently enjoy which are the
conditions of her continued loyalty
will be jeopardized compromising the
sustainability of the relationship
understand this is a long video but it's
an important subject what do you think
what is your experience with covert
disrespect let me know in the comments
