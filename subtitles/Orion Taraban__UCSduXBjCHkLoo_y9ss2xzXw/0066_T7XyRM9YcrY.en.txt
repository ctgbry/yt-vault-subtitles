i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is don't
feel guilty
now i'm going to approach this subject
from a slightly unconventional angle
which is basically this
in the vast majority of cases
guilt is a form of ineffective expiation
so what does that mean
xb8 kind of means to do penance
to feel pain in order to absolve
yourself of wrongdoing
so generally when we do something that
we know we shouldn't have done
or when we didn't do something that we
know we should have done
there's this tendency to engage in
self-castigation beating yourself up in
other words
and the idea here is that if i inflict
sufficient pain on myself well one no
one else will come to inflict more on me
i'm hurting myself so you don't have to
and two
i can then remove the guilt from my
consciousness comfortably
i don't have to feel bad anymore about

[01:00]
i don't have to feel bad anymore about
what i did because i've already punished
myself for it
so in this way guilt kind of has this
potential to remove the pain associated
with wrongdoing from one's consciousness
by inflicting another usually lesser
form of pain in its place
the problem with this is that generally
the issue recurs
and when it does you got to get out the
old whip again and give yourself the
lashes
and this continued self-punishment can
be very exasperating both for yourself
and the people around you because
without addressing the underlying issue
the problem just keeps coming back
so what i'm going to suggest is that
instead of feeling guilty
you strive to feel contrite
contrition is another word that we don't
use very often
maybe because like expiation it has
slight religious undertones but it comes
from the latin words khan meaning with
and tristitia meaning sadness
so contrition means with sadness

[02:01]
so contrition means with sadness
contrition means that we really allow
ourselves to feel the pain associated
with our behavior the pain we caused
other people
and the pain we really caused ourselves
without substituting a lesser pain like
guilt which is really a pain about pain
in its place
and the idea is that when we come into
contact with the pain of contrition
which is more intense than the pain of
guilt
and we don't try to avoid feeling the
pain we caused others and ourselves
it's usually unbearable and this
experience can motivate reality-based
sustainable behavior change
this can include making amends to others
but it can also mean making a sincere
enduring commitment to not repeat that
behavior
now that we've really emotionally
experienced the consequences of that
behavior
so don't feel guilty because in many

[03:00]
so don't feel guilty because in many
ways that just lets you off the hook for
a repeat offense
if you're serious about getting to the
bottom of this
instead
strive to feel contrition
by empathically entering into the
experience of others in order to feel
the emotional consequences of your
actions
this will not only better repair your
relationships
but will set you up for more sustainable
behavior change moving forward
