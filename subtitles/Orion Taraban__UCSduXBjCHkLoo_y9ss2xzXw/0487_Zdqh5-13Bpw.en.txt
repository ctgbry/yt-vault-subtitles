I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic today short talk is you have to
teach people how to feel about you
this is true for all relationships and
it's especially true with respect to
your interactions with women so if you
want to learn how to present yourself
confidently in Social relationships then
this episode is for you
what you have to understand is that in
the beginning you are basically a blank
slate to other people yes folks are
going to take a look at your physical
appearance and the way you dress and the
way you carry yourself and form some
snap judgments with respect to the kind
of person you might be this is going to
happen and that's why first impressions
are so important however a lot of the
things that go into a first impression
can actually be proactively addressed
prior to Any Given interaction you can
give a lot of thought to your dress and
your appearance and your carriage in
advance and if you do these kind of
passively exert their influence
throughout the encounter so you can

[01:00]
throughout the encounter so you can
focus on other things
so in the beginning people don't know
much more about you besides that which
means that in these initial interactions
what you're primarily doing no matter
what you are ostensibly discussing is
teaching people how they should feel
about you
and you do this through your non-verbals
your tone your expression your body
language your eye contact
Etc
and if you're like most people you
probably want whomever you're speaking
with to come away from the interaction
with a positive impression of you I'm
going to teach you how to do that
the key to teaching people how to feel
positively about you is to imagine that
you are the world's greatest vacuum
cleaner salesman
you're gonna have to go with me on this
one okay so let's start from the
beginning first you have to understand
that when a person walks into your shop
the wind didn't just blow her in man now
not every person who enters your shop is
going to become a customer however she
wouldn't be there at all if there wasn't

[02:00]
wouldn't be there at all if there wasn't
some degree of interest on her part so
if you're having an interaction with
someone it helps to assume interest in
the other party with respect to the
interaction
second unless this person makes a b line
straight to one particular product
she doesn't yet know what she wants
she has a vague desire like she's
interested in buying something to help
her clean up around the house but she
doesn't yet know what she wants
specifically
she is as of yet at least partially
ignorant of her own needs and desires
that's where you the world's greatest
vacuum cleaner salesman come in you are
there to educate her with respect to her
needs and desires and to direct her
attention to what she should consider to
be her best option which just so happens
to be a product you sell in your store
now every great salesman knows that one
of the secrets of his success is
believing in his product 100 percent
a master salesman not only knows his

[03:01]
a master salesman not only knows his
product inside and out like he should be
able to explain in loving detail all of
the wonderful things of which his vacuum
is capable
but he also believes that his product is
the best vacuum cleaner available on the
market in this class at this Price Point
West in the Mississippi or whatever
compartmentalization he has to perform
in order to be able to authentically
arrive at this conclusion
and that total belief permeates through
the non-verbal dimensions of his
communication as he educates the
potential customer as to how this vacuum
is going to solve all of her dander
problems and make cleaning a breeze

[04:00]
endorsements so this is how I keep the
lights on can't do it without you and I
really appreciate your support
okay third
the world's greatest vacuum cleaner
salesman understands that most of his
education has little to do with the
actual specs of his product it weighs
6.2 pounds runs on 12 volts of
electricity and has a 25 foot extension
cord
but with how the customer should feel
about the specs of his product
remember the customer is ignorant
otherwise she would already have the
vacuum she needed the salesman has to
educate the customer with respect to the
fact that 6.2 pounds is light and easy
to handle
and 12 volts of electricity is energy
efficient and cost effective and a 25
foot extension cord is generous and
convenient
his manner will communicate that these
are all good and desirable things for a
vacuum to have which will help the
customer understand why this happens to
be her best option like many things in

[05:02]
be her best option like many things in
life you have to believe it to see it
now at this point you might be thinking
yeah Ryan okay that's all well and good
but the fact of the matter is is that my
vacuum is objectively not the best
vacuum on the market like my vacuum
isn't six feet tall or isn't worth a
million dollars or it's just seen better
days how am I supposed to believe in
this product of mine when it's
objectively defective relative to other
models
excellent question
the answer to this question is the
fourth understanding of the master
salesman if it's not a flaw
it's a feature
this might blow your mind but there's no
such thing as an objective flaw the flaw
or deficit actually lives in your
perception and your attitude
and the idea here is to recast your
vacuum's perceived liabilities as Assets
in reality
why would anyone want a six foot tall
vacuum that would be massive and

[06:00]
vacuum that would be massive and
ungainly this model is Nimble and
compact all the power in a fraction of
the space
or a million dollar vacuum I mean I
guess if you want something flashy and
impractical be my guest but this model
is Affordable precisely because all of
its features are focused on its
functionality leaving you more satisfied
in a fraction of the time
or finally seen better days okay don't
be ridiculous this here is a classic bit
of engineering it stood the test of time
so it's actually a safer bet
do you see the apparent flaw is an
artifact of your customers ignorance and
it's your job to gently re-educate her
with respect to how the feature in
question is not only not a liability but
is actually an asset to boot
now you might say but Orion won't the
customer know that I'm full of
and I would respond that she might but
that
is the customer's business

[07:01]
is the customer's business
you do not have to help the customer
arrive at that conclusion my friend
your business is to present your product
in the best possible light and guide the
customer in the process of making up her
mind
you have absolutely no obligation to
help her reject you
so whatever you're insecure about
whatever you think is a liability with
respect to your product's
competitiveness in the marketplace you
need to find a way to recast that in a
positive light so that you can once
again believe in your product 100
percent
and that brings us to the final piece of
advice despite your best efforts not
everyone is going to buy your vacuum
cleaner that's right
but if your sales funnel is strong you
can make a killing if just one percent
of the people who walk into your store
actually end up buying something
so there's really no reason to make a
Hard Sell
however might some of these non-buyers
complain about your product might they

[08:00]
complain about your product might they
criticize your product might they even
insult your salesmanship
indeed they might
but here's the important thing to
remember
these people aren't your customers and
this means that their opinion is
functionally worthless
like there are tons of people who are
critical of fast food but McDonald's
doesn't worry about them because they
ain't buying Big Macs do you understand
catering to that demographic would be a
terrible business plan for Mickey D's
the lesson here is to understand who
your customers actually are and practice
indifference to the opinions of those
who are not in your client base so there
you have it if you can learn the lessons
of the world's greatest vacuum cleaner
salesman you too can be confident and
poised in any interaction satisfaction
or your money back
