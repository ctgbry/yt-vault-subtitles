I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
shine brighter if you're curious about
the title of this episode it's actually
the slogan of one of my side hustles and
today I'd like to talk to you about what
that is and how it came into being
many years ago I was a professional
theater actor living in New York City
acting was fun but being an actor was
hard it's a tough way to make a living
so I decided to support my artistic
pretensions by becoming a private tutor
I started by putting up flyers in coffee
shops around Brooklyn my first statement
was a middle-aged Russian immigrant from
Canarsie who wanted to better appreciate
Shakespearean literature
over the next couple years I steadily
built up my client base and founded my
own high price Tutoring company catering
to the children of Manhattan's Elite it
was a decent life a good enough life but
there was something about it that I
didn't find entirely fulfilling

[01:00]
didn't find entirely fulfilling
after a lot of deliberation I decided to
become a psychologist
to become a psychologist I needed a
doctorate in Psychology and to do that I
needed to be accepted into a graduate
psychology program
and for that to happen I needed to apply
to a graduate psychology program and to
do that I needed to take the GRE which
in America is the test to get into most
graduate schools
the whole idea seemed Preposterous as
the only background I had in Psychology
was an intro to psych class I took in
college in which I earned a B minus I
had absolutely no experience in the
field that said I knew I could do it the
hard part was convincing other people
that I could do it
fortunately at that point I had helped
hundreds of students prepare for the GRE
despite never having taken it myself
when I did sit for the test I got a
perfect score on my first attempt and I
think that was a big part of why I was
admitted into a Top Choice program for

[02:01]
admitted into a Top Choice program for
me a professional School of Psychology
in San Francisco
at the time I was living in public
housing in Crown Heights in a couple
thousand dollars to my name
when I moved out to San Francisco I
rented a furnished room in a spinster's
house and got busy I only had enough
cash to last a couple of months so I
knew I needed to make something happen I
decided to keep tutoring this time
focusing exclusively on the GRE and
began cold calling established tutors in
the area and inviting them out for
coffee many of them graciously agreed to
meet with me and some of their advice
was invaluable to getting myself
established in a new town
in the beginning I was living month to
month but in a year I was earning enough
not only to support myself but to pay my
way through grad school
this was of course exhausting I was a
full-time student a part-time unpaid
intern a small business owner and a
researcher writing my dissertation I
worked 100 hour weeks at least for years

[03:03]
worked 100 hour weeks at least for years
it was hard
but the alternative failure was even
harder
now I'm a licensed psychologist with a
thriving Private Practice I'm living the
life that I envisioned for myself in my
late 20s and that seemed impossibly
distant at the time and it all began
with taking the GRE
the side hustle that I've been
describing is called Stellar GRE over
the past 20 years I have worked with
thousands and thousands of students to
prepare for the GRE and secure admission
into top-ranked programs around the
world
the system I teach is a complete
re-envisioning of test prep all the way
down to First principles it's the same
system I use to get my own perfect score
on the test and countless students have
used it to achieve top percentile scores
themselves I have hundreds of five star
reviews on Yelp and Google

[04:00]
reviews on Yelp and Google
the real special thing about Stellar GRE
is that to my knowledge it's the only
empirically validated test prep system
in the world
using my background and statistical
methods I collected data from hundreds
of students over the years to determine
the degree to which they improved over
two months of working with me
it turns out that Stellar's average
score improvements are greater than my
corporate competitors score guarantees
this means that the system works just
how well does it work
students improved an average of 26
percentile points on each of the three
sections of the test in just eight weeks
this is an extraordinary response for
such a short amount of time
test prep is a means to an end and that
end is to create a better life for
yourself and the society in which we
live
Stellar GRE is here to help you with
that first step

[05:00]
that first step
unfortunately until recently my services
were limited to folks who live in the
Bay Area
however I'm very happy to report that
this is no longer the case my entire
system is now available to interested
students all over the world as an online
self-study program
in this program you'll have access to my
complete prep manual which breaks down
the counter-intuitive strategies used to
dismantle every type of question on all
three sections of the test
five full-length adaptive mock tests
that mimic the actual feel of the exam
and much more
it's based on the Sea-Doo teach model
used to train medical doctors and it's
designed to raise your scores as much as
possible as quickly as possible
what's more membership starts at less
than half the cost of my corporate
competitors
it's really a fantastic product I'm very
proud of it and I think it's going to
help a lot of people
