So, I'm curious from the perspective of
men, because I know you've been talking
a lot to men on your channel recently,
Dr. Ryan, and building healthy habits.
Where should you start if you don't
really have any healthy habits at all
when it comes to relationships? Yeah,
that's a tough one cuz there's sure a
lot of people out there who don't have
healthy habits. I I was one of them in
my younger years. And I think just like
if we're talking about a different type
of healthy habit, whether you're abusing
drugs or certain types of foods or etc.,
is you have to stop doing the bad thing
first. is that you might have to stop
using the substance. You might have to
stop and and abstain consciously from
those types of relationships that you
feel most compelled to enter into. Just
like a recovering addict in those early
stages of recovery feels still very
drawn to his drug of choice. If I told
you to do 10 good things, but you were
still involved in the dysfunctional
relationships, that one thing is going
to cancel out all the the good that
might come from the 10 new habits that
you're attempting to form. So the first
thing is to stop doing what hurts you to
stop doing the bad thing as it were. And

stop doing the bad thing as it were. And
that can be very difficult especially
because if you're used to unhealthy
relationships, even if you were to say
break up with your current drama partner
and try to enter into a relationship
with somebody who's more stable or
securely attached, you're going to find
it to be very boring and unsatisfying in
the same way that addicts without their
drugs find uh life to be intolerably
dull or painful. And that could be part
of the withdrawal. Like I I don't know
if there's a way around that. That said,
it shouldn't last forever. And I think
that we can and should in most cases
expand our capacity to grow in the
direction of who we would like to
become.
