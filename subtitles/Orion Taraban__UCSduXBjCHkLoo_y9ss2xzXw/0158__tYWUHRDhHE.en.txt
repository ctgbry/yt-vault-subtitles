i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
you do not need to justify your life
now this talk will be a continuation of
a previous episode entitled the reason
why you exist so you may want to check
that one out first if you haven't done
so already
like disneyland
life is an opportunity to experience
itself
you can't screw up a day at disneyland
and in a certain sense you can't really
screw up your life
you just get to choose which rides you
go on i.e which experiences you choose
to have
so hopefully this metaphor will help to
relieve some of the pressure associated
with living correctly
that's it
sometimes i talk with folks and they
suffer from what we might call
existential uncertainty
they're not sure why they're here or
even if they should be here like whether
they deserve to exist at all

[01:01]
they deserve to exist at all
and they feel as if they have to do
something in order to justify that
existence
this could be getting married having
children getting rich becoming
successful being loved and respected
making their mark on history and or
achieving something great and impressive
i call these self-justification projects
and they're all doomed to failure
because you cannot solve an internal
problem with an external solution
however
i've got some good news for you
consider for a moment that your life is
already justified
and why might that be because you're
already here
you're already inside the park
at disneyland there are hundreds of
workers who are constantly employed in
letting in those who should be in the
park and keeping out those who shouldn't
there are fences and gates security and
guards that exist to fulfill this
purpose

[02:00]
purpose
therefore we can reasonably assume that
anyone inside the park is there because
they had a ticket maybe they're not
really aware of the ticket because who
really thinks about their ticket after
they're inside but that doesn't mean
that they're not supposed to be there
if you're inside the park it's safe to
assume that you must have a ticket
and if it's that hard to sneak into
disneyland which is just a theme park
how much harder do you think it would be
to sneak into existence
you are not an exceptional oversight
you did not break and enter your way
into being and you are not the result of
spiritual negligence
if you're here it's safe to assume that
you should be now you might not remember
buying a ticket
and that's because the ticket was likely
gifted to you
you certainly didn't earn the ticket and
you you might not have existed

[03:01]
you you might not have existed
previously and there's no need to repay
the ticket as it was given as a gift of
grace
and this is a relief because what could
you possibly do in life to repay the
debt associated with the opportunity to
exist all the accomplishments and
achievements in the world would not be
sufficient
it's not a debt that could be repaid
which is why it's not a debt that must
be repaid
i'd like you to consider that the ticket
was a gift of grace
freely given
that needn't be earned or repaid
and that you must have been gifted one
by virtue of your own existence
since only people with tickets are
allowed inside the park
so
this whole headache about proving that
you deserve to exist is totally
unnecessary imagine spending the whole
day at disneyland trying to justify that

[04:00]
day at disneyland trying to justify that
you deserve to be spending the day there
i mean i don't even know what that would
look like
if you're already in the park there's
nothing more that you need to do
though there might be plenty that you
want to experience while you're there
what do you think
