I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is men need
friends need this is non-negotiable guys
on some level men need other men in
their lives in order to be happy and
fulfilled Robin Dunbar the Oxford
psychologist who lends his name to the
dunar number of human organization has
gone so far as to claim that men need
two two guys nights a
week to maintain their mental
health the issue is that a quarter of
men a number that is likely Rising
report having no close friends at all
and that according to Dunbar men
generally are socially very
lazy there is a loneliness epidemic that
is sweeping through the world of men and
it's only getting worse millions and

[01:01]
it's only getting worse millions and
millions of men are very alone and very
isolated now you might think well what's
the problem oion can't these lonely
isolated men get together and make
friends with each other wouldn't that
kind of solve the problem and on some
level it really is that simple like to
solve the loneliness
epidemic men need to find each other and
invest in their
friendships but the solution is much
more complex in practice today I'm going
to talk about a number of social
obstacles that obstruct men's ability to
make and keep friends especially later
in life let's get to
it first I got to call guys out men you
suck at maintaining your
friendships and that's a real shame
because male friendships constitute some
of the best relationships I've had in my
entire life they tend to be supportive

[02:01]
entire life they tend to be supportive
uncomplicated and enduring but nothing
is really going to change for men unless
they start to value and prioritize these
relationships in their lives like life
is not going to go out of its way to do
that for them men have to make that
happen and in the absence of willingness
and effort they're going to have more of
the
same and I think men will have an easier
time of this if they can learn to Value
emotional connection as meaningful in
its own right like women tend to find
emotional connection to be intrinsically
valuable
men not so much guys generally need some
sort of pretext to get together you may
have heard that women tend to socialize
face to face whereas men tend to
socialize side by side it's like men
need some other activity to exist to
serve as a pretext for connection
watching a game working on an engine

[03:01]
watching a game working on an engine
taking a Jiu-Jitsu class which
functionally means that the connection
doesn't occur if no activity exists or
if the logistics of the shared activity
prove
infeasible now this isn't necessarily a
problem but one of the consequences of
this requirement is that it tends to
make male socializing less frequent even
in the case of perfectly willing
participants for the simple reason that
the logistics aren't always going to
line up
however this can be mitigated if men can
increasingly awaken to the joys and
pleasures of
connection which if they're being honest
is often what they're looking for in an
indirect and roundabout way when they
participate in shared activities this is
because connection isn't really a woman
thing it's an emotional need common to
all human beings individuals vary with
respect to the extent of this need but

[04:01]
respect to the extent of this need but
as social creatures it's something that
all of us men and women need to one
degree or another being honest with
yourself about this need will help you
get it
met in fact and this is going to sound
kind of crazy but it's this apparent
needlessness that creates a liability
for men men often think that they don't
need very much from other men in general
the more you need the more you need
other people and the more other people
are going to be in your life on the
other hand the less you need the less
you need other people and the fewer
people are going to be in your life and
let's be real the virtue of
self-sufficiency both materially and
emotionally is definitely balanced in
our culture in a gender
Direction the rugged individualist ain't
feminine the rugged individualist is

[05:01]
feminine the rugged individualist is
manly and being stoically
self-sufficient is always going to be
more masculine than say being emotional
and needy so let's not pretend that it
isn't but men do have emotions and men
do need things at least in order to
thrive if not technically to survive and
there's a big difference between just
spilling your purse out on the table
and not admitting even to yourself that
there might be things that you need and
want from others like there is a big
distance between those two extremes so
let's not fall into the Trap of
dichotomous thinking rejecting the one
extreme does not mean that you accept
the other and vice versa somewhere along
that Continuum and it might actually be
closer to the stoic side of things than
to the expressive is the optimal
position and I'd encourage men to keep
experimenting along the Spectrum until
they find it in any case it's important

[06:03]
they find it in any case it's important
to remember that if men need nothing
from nobody then they might just end up
with nobody in their lives if you're
interested in taking your understanding
to the next level I would encourage you

hope to see you
aboard to this end I think it might be
helpful for men to examine the value
proposition of their friendships like
I'd like to think that my friends don't
dislike me but I'm clearly not very
important to them think about it when
they hang out with me they don't get

[07:02]
they hang out with me they don't get
laid they don't get paid they don't help
out their wives or their kids they don't
improve their Fitness or learn a skill
or solve a problem maybe they get to
blow off some steam and have some fun
that's more of a quality of life benefit
than an essential component of their
Lifestyles I'm like the tenth most
important thing in their lives and given
the demands of the other nine it's no
real surprise that I only see my friends
once in a blue moon I'd like to see them
more but that's not ultimately up to me
you can't get blood from a
stone and let's be real men are rewarded
when they prioritize other things ahead
of their
friendships socially men are conditioned
to be workhorses to be producers of
value when they fall into that role they
are rewarded when they resist that role
they are punished and hanging out with
his friends does doesn't really benefit

[08:00]
his friends does doesn't really benefit
anyone besides the man in question it
doesn't benefit his wife or his kids or
his employer or his clients or his
community or his government it only
makes the individual Man Slightly
happier which is why it's not considered
to be very
important you're going out with the boys
again didn't you just do that a few
weeks ago I would have thought that you
have grown out of this phase by now it's
time to mature and leave those days
behind
you the source of this pressure directly
or indirectly I found is generally the
man's wife or girlfriend and the upshot
is to influence the man's behavior to be
more productive in ways from which she
might more directly
benefit and while this productivity can
lead to wealth and achievement it does
come at a cost in fact some men have
this like Stockholm syndrome
relationship with

[09:00]
relationship with
productivity they can't escape the
social expectations of being productive
or the social consequences of being
unproductive so they embrace it so
thoroughly that it becomes a part of
their identity I know so many guys my
age who spend the first half of their
day generating value for their employers
and the second half of their day
generating value for their wives and
that's their
lives now some men might find that to be
the perfect setup after all what more
does a man need besides his work and his
family however independent of the
question of whether such a life is
optimally fulfilling it is risky for men
to behave in this way a man who acts
like this who shuffles between the
office and the home and back again is a
man who makes his life smaller and
smaller and smaller he consolidates his
needs into fewer and fewer people which

[10:02]
needs into fewer and fewer people which
make those relationships far more
critical than they otherwise would
be and while this isn't necessarily a
problem if the relationships involved
are stable trustworthy and
enduring it is an enormous liability if
they turn out not to be the case to use
an extreme example there is a reason why
it is far far more common for men to
commit suicide after a divorce than it
is for women like 10 times more
likely so many men Outsource socializing
and relationships to their wives over
the course of their marriage his wife's
friends become his friends and he
socializes more and more with other
couples the wife is typically the one
who schedules and plans and coordinates
the social dimension of the
relationship and this is a problem if in
when the marriage falls apart because

[11:01]
when the marriage falls apart because
not only is the man out of practice
securing and maintaining
relationships but the woman is much more
likely than the man to keep those
relationships in the wake of a divorce
suddenly the man finds that he is now
without a social safety net that he's
neglected by that he's neglected his own
friendships and that he potentially
hasn't made a new friend since
College it's a situation like this which
is far more common for men than it is
for women that unfortunately can lead an
emotionally vulnerable person to enact a
permanent solution to a temporary
problem in any case I think it's
critically important for men to
understand that their lives are much
more than the value they can produce and
to continue to prioritize the activities
and relationships that make them happy
as individuals over and above the
expectations of their women doing so

[12:00]
expectations of their women doing so
should not only make them healthier but
should prove to be an important hedge
against a catastrophic
downside what do you think does this fit
