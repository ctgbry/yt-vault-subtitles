when I first started out I decided to
give this project enough time to succeed
so that's the first takeaway here almost
everything takes more time and effort
than you might expect and people don't
often give themselves sufficient
opportunity to achieve their goals and
what is that opportunity well my rule of
thumb is that it is due diligence time
1.5 what does this mean well in this
case I spent an hour or two researching
YouTube before I started out and I
discovered that it could take 2 years
for a channel to get any kind of
traction on the platform so I decided to
give myself 3 years to succeed right
that's the 2 years suggested by my due
diligence times 1.5 or 50% more time
than what my research suggested I
figured that if I still could make it
work at 1.5x then I would have given it
a solid effort but I would probably need
to re-evaluate my goals in my experience
I've seen too many people quit too soon
and I didn't want to be one of them this
is kind of like accounting for penalty
time in a soccer game you have to expect
that the game will not end at regulation
