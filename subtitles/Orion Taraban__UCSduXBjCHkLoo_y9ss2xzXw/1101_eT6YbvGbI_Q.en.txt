Gone with the Wind is the story of the
southernlanded gentry before and after
the American Civil War, which spoiler
alert didn't treat them very kindly. And
there's a moment about halfway through
the story when the war from which she
had mostly been protected comes to
Scarlet. Her family's mansion is burned

she must chop her own wood to keep warm.
And she must fetch her own water to
drink. And she must dig in the ground
for roots with her bare hands to keep

loss or hardship in order to attain to
some measure of maturity,
responsibility, and accountability. And
until then, like Pinocchio, they may
simply exist as silly mechanical
puppets.
