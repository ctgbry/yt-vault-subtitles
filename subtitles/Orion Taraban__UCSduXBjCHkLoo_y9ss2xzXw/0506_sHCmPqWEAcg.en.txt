the third piece of wisdom is actually
the most important and it has to do with
the final word of the poem Oh snail
climb Mount Fuji but slowly slowly the
second slowly seems kind of redundant
doesn't it now what you have to
understand here is that the poem like
many Haiku is actually an allegory in a
literal sense Mount Fuji is the highest
point in Japan but in an allegorical
sense it represents the highest goal to
which a little snail which dwarfed by
the immensity of nature represents you
or me could possibly Aspire there's no
higher point in all of Japan so if you
actually get to the top of Mount Fuji
then all that's left for you to do is to
come down there is no higher goal so the
idea here is to orient ourselves toward
the highest goal we could possibly
conceive and to spend as long as
possible in the attainment of that goal
