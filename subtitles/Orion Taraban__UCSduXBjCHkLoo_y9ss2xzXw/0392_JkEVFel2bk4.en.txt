I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the truth
about the red pill
so I think it's about time that I made
this episode I think it's an important
one and I hope that you will listen
through to the very end
first of all I think it will be helpful
to Define what I mean by the red pill
for the purposes of this conversation
because the term can mean a lot of
different things to a lot of different
folks my working definition of the red
pill is a set of knowledge and know-how
that facilitates the construction of a
world view that pertains to men's place
in society and to intersexual Dynamics
in particular
it's red pill in that this worldview
deviates in significant ways from the
dominant social narratives about those
topics
I don't think that the red pill is
equivalent to male feminism and I
definitely don't see the red pill as
anti-woman in fact I believe that many
of the understandings in that knowledge

[01:00]
of the understandings in that knowledge
set can and do substantially benefit
women in that they can enable women to
have much more satisfying relationships
with the men of their choosing so that's
my working definition of the red pill
and what I'd like to suggest is that
taking the red pill is something like a
spiritual journey in as much as once the
scales have dropped from your eyes and
you come to perceive and recognize and
understand some of the truths about
intersexual Dynamics and the way
relationships actually function
you're no longer the same person you
once were
just like Saul was Blinded By the Light
on the road to Damascus and was so
transformed by the experience that he
even changed his name so taking the red
pill can be an evolution on par with a
spiritual transformation
and within this framework I think it's
important to keep in mind two spiritual
teachings which can meaningfully inform
men's use of the red pill let's get

[02:00]
men's use of the red pill let's get
right into it
the first teaching is kind of a joke
about Enlightenment and the joke goes
like this enlightenment
better not start
having started
better finish
let's break this down because I think
that this joke contains a powerful truth
that is very applicable to the red pill
so why might it be better for some
people to not start
the process towards Enlightenment I mean
is there a better goal that we can
aspire to how could this be a bad thing
again the answer here has to do with the
fact by the time you even make some
meaningful progress toward the goal of
Enlightenment you are no longer the
person you were when you began your
journey pursuing Enlightenment will
require a complete transformation of
your personality psychology lifestyle
and relationships in short to embark on
the process of Enlightenment is to lose
everything

[03:01]
everything you once knew anyway so
that's a very high cost and it might be
better for some people to know that
price tag is very high before they get
into it and why is this because if you
start the process but don't finish it in
many respects you will be worse off than
if you had never started to begin with
because what happens when you make some
progress towards Enlightenment well
let's say that you become increasingly
dissatisfied with the world
you begin to see through the heedless
pursuit of money and fame and status and
sex and may even renounce them entirely
however because you haven't yet arrived
at full enlightenment
and you don't yet have anything better
to replace it with
maybe you've given up the bad but you
haven't yet fully replaced it with the
good
what's more you've just given up a lot
of the things that make life Pleasant
and enjoyable without having yet arrived

[04:00]
and enjoyable without having yet arrived
at real Joy or true understanding this
means that with respect to Enlightenment
it kind of gets worse before it gets
better
and if you're not committed to going all
the way to the end
then you might end up stopping at the
halfway point between who you used to be
and who you might become which is kind
of the least functional place to stop
so that's why there's this admonition to
better finish if you start
and I think this really holds true for
the red pill because I think if you're
going to take the red pill you have to
completely swallow it
otherwise don't put it in your mouth
if you swallow it halfway it's kind of
like it gets stuck in your throat
a lot of the guys I hear talking online
today it sounds like the red pill is
stuck in their throat
it's an aggravating sputtering irritant
they're basically choking on the pill

[05:00]
they're basically choking on the pill
because they haven't yet fully swallowed
it which in this metaphor means that
they haven't yet fully integrated the
knowledge set into their worldview
now before I go any further if you're

now how do you know if you fully
integrated the red pill it's very simple
you know that you fully integrated the
red pill when you are no longer upset by
the truths that it reveals
where there is anger there is not yet
understanding
and the ultimate goal of the red pill is
understanding
not an intellectual understanding that
can rattle off a host of Statistics or
esoteric terms or sex-based injustices

[06:02]
esoteric terms or sex-based injustices
but a deep emotional understanding that
is predicated on an acceptance of
reality is what it is no more no less
getting angry at reality indicates a
lack of acceptance about reality and it
is our work to conform our understanding
to reality not to work to conform
reality to what our intellectual
understanding believes it should be
so if you're going to take the red pill
make sure it doesn't get stuck in your
throat because what's the alternative I
mean you can't really spit it back up
it's already been in your system and
that means you can't unsee what you've
seen under its influence and choking on
the pills sucks men who do so are like
those who quit halfway into
Enlightenment they completely renounce
women and sometimes Society at large but
they don't really have anything better
to replace it with yet

[07:00]
to replace it with yet
now this might very well be an
inevitable stage in the process toward
true understanding and integration but
if so it is definitely a stage in that
process it is not the end goal
so if you're still angry after a while
and you can't spit that pill back up
your only real choice is to keep
swallowing until it's deep in your belly
where you can finally digest it and
eventually integrate it into who you are
and you'll know you've done this when
you're no longer angry and you begin to
navigate the world of relationships more
successfully than you used to
and this leads us to the second
spiritual teaching applicable to the red
pill maybe you've heard it before it's
before enlightenment
chop wood carry water after
Enlightenment chop wood carry water
what does that mean well among other
things I think it suggests the

[08:01]
things I think it suggests the
paradoxical truth that once you arrive
at the point of Enlightenment everything
is completely different
and yet nothing may have changed
it's a weird Paradox and difficult to
put into words but it kind of makes
sense if you think about it if you
arrive at a higher level of awareness
then the whole world changes because you
yourself have changed
despite nothing being objectively
different
so what does this have to do with the
red pill well just like your blue pill
beta simp days were probably
characterized by relationships with
women
eventually your red pill Alpha King days
will probably be characterized by
relationships with women
everything is completely different and
yet nothing has changed and this is
because accepting a very small minority
of men women are going to be a part of
our lives in one way or another and when
fully integrated the red pill allows men
to have fulfilling relationships with
women in a way that makes sense for the

[09:02]
women in a way that makes sense for the
particular individuals involved women
are not the enemy
and they are not to be feared or hated
or shunned these emotional responses
indicate a lack of acceptance and
understanding
that said I'm also not saying that men
should just get over it
many men have been significantly harmed
by women and working through their
trauma is going to be an essential stage
of their journey and I'm not saying that
the end result is supposed to look like
men and women holding hands and singing
Kumbaya for many men it is entirely
appropriate not to return to the
relationships they once had
what I am saying is women aren't going
anywhere
and the vast majority of men will
continue to relate to women in some form
or another after they swallow the red
pill
understanding women and intersexual
Dynamics more generally is kind of like
finally reading the rule game the rule

[10:00]
finally reading the rule game the rule
book to a game you have little choice
but to play imagine all the fouls and
the injuries and the violations that can
accrue by playing a game if you don't
know the rules
however knowing the rules will not only
keep you safer but should realistically
inform your strategies when playing the
game
so I hope I haven't alienated my
audience with this episode but you might
as well know where I stand sooner as
opposed to later I am not anti-woman
despite having many opportunities in my
personal story to become so
I've worked to heal my trauma
I've integrated my understanding into a
comprehensive worldview
and I enjoy fulfilling effortless
relationships with women
and I wish the same for all the other
men out there
