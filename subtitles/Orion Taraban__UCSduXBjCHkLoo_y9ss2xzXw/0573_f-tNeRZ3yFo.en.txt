the way that women typically maintain
optionality is by being visibly
attracted the real reason she's not
giving up her Instagram account with
100,000 followers is this it's a daily
and visible reminder to all involved
that thousands of men find her
attractive she may never step out of the
relationship but surrendering that
account would significantly diminish her
optionality which is a form of power and
power as previously noted is never
surrendered unless absolutely necessary
on the other hand the way men typically
maintain optionality is by being visibly
competent this is part of the reason why
women find men in uniforms of all kind
to be so attractive the uniforms signify
their owner's particular skill and
competence to the world it's also why
performing artists like actors and
musicians generally have no trouble
finding willing Partners the cheering
and Applause they receive while they are
up on stage is more than enough social
proof of their competence and
desirability
