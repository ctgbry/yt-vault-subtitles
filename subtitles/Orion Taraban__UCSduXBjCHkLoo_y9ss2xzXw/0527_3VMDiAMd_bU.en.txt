I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is
understanding emotional Detachment so I
thought this episode might be necessary
after conducting a recent consultation
with a well-spoken young man who watched
my episode How to Love Without emotional
attachment and who came away with what I
considered to be some misconceptions
about my message however I reasoned that
if this intelligent guy had these
misconceptions then probably other
people did as well and that maybe my
message wasn't entirely clear so I
thought I would make a follow-up episode
to critically examine emotional
Detachment what it is and what it isn't
emotional Detachment is an incredibly
useful skill in fact it might be the
most important emotional survival
strategy of which I am aware and I
approach the concept of emotional
Detachment through a Buddhist lens
namely through the realization that the
universe is in a NeverEnding process of

[01:01]
universe is in a NeverEnding process of
becoming everything in this world is
ephemeral even now the present moment is
changing is dying is transforming into
something else which will itself change
die and transform within this
understanding everything that we have
will eventually be taken from us so why
cling permanence is an illusion in the
world Under the Sun your property your
relationships your incarnate being
you'll lose them all in the fullness of
time so how will you respond when it
comes time to let them go will you give
back what you had with gratitude for the
time that you were allowed to spend with
it or will you cling to it with an
attachment that is as tenacious as it is
futile futile because no amount of
tenacity will succeed in holding
something a moment longer than you
possibly can on the other hand emotional
detach attachment is a skill that

[02:01]
detach attachment is a skill that
facilitates surrender and surrender is
something that we will eventually have
to do with respect to everything that we
have been given including our own lives
it's a way of holding things gently and
this is important because as I discussed
in my episode hold people like sand the
tighter you squeeze the more what you're
holding tends to slip through your
fingers now I need to be clear about
something emotional Detachment does not
mean that you have no emotions a
complete absence of emotion in my
opinion is not something we should be
striving for unfortunately many men do
succeed in functionally divorcing
themselves from their emotional
experience however I believe that such
men do so at Great cost to themselves
this is because it generally requires
some degree of self-violence in order to
amputate a component of your lived
experience of course most men cannot do
this completely so they arrive at a
place where the only emotion that they

[03:00]
place where the only emotion that they
can consistently recognize is anger long
periods of a kind of numb neutrality are
punctuated periodically with intense
episodes of anger and frustration and
that is no way to live life my friends
for me personally emotions make my life
richer more interesting more enjoyable
more complex I like having emotions but
I am also very emotionally detached
emotional Detachment does not mean that
you sort of dissociate from your
emotional experience or that you
alienate yourself from your feeling
sensitivity we do not want to become
unfeeling rocks this is an extreme
solution that said we also do not want
the Other Extreme solution which we
might call emotional
Fusion when a man is fused with his
emotions there is no space between his
felt experience and his seat of being in
Emotion Fusion the man is his emotional

[04:02]
Emotion Fusion the man is his emotional
experience if he feels something he not
only assumes that the emotion is
Justified but that he must act on the
emotion in some way this person has to
say his peace or wears his heart on his
sleeve or generally rides the honic
roller coaster he's Overjoyed when
things are going well and heartbroken
and despondent when things don't go his
way such men have no emotional
Detachment and little
self-control and and this is a terrible
way of moving through the world for many
reasons in the first place your emotions
are not always justified in as much as
the model of reality from which your
emotions arise may not be entirely
aligned with that reality and acting on
the basis of a flawed model is very
likely to create pain and suffering and
in the second place emotions change even
when they are Justified emotions are
like like the weather they're constantly

[05:01]
like like the weather they're constantly
shifting acting from a place of emotion
often leaves you with consequences that
far Outlast the emotion that originally
produced the impulse to act and that's a
very dangerous asymmetry like you can
make a decision in anger or fear or
hopelessness once that will permanently
change the rest of your life it's not
fair but that's the way it is now before
I go any further if you're liking what

benefit from its message because it's
Word of Mouth referrals like this that
really help to make the channel grow you
can also hit the thanks button and tip
me in proportion to the value you feel
you've derived from this message it's
your support that makes all of this
possible I don't do corporate
sponsorships or product placements so I
really do rely on you guys to help me
make all this happen and I really do
appreciate their support thank
you now what should we do

[06:00]
you now what should we do
instead it's a better idea to find some
middle path between these two dangerous
extremes and that middle path is
emotional Detachment to begin with it
helps to not treat your emotions like
they're precious I discussed this in
Greater detail in my episode emotions
are impersonal people think emotions are
personal because only they get to feel
them however behind every emotion is a
thought and the thoughts that
consistently create those emotions are
impersonal if I were to think the same
thoughts and believe them to be true
then the same emotion would arise in me
as well so we don't have to consider
emotions to be these inherently valuable
jewels that are more meaningful or
significant than other aspects of our
experience in my opinion it's better to
hold our emotions gently and to consider
them in light of multiple sources of
information our reason our senses to
decrease the likelihood that we're being

[07:00]
decrease the likelihood that we're being
misled in this way we can consider
emotions to be a source of information
among many other sources of information
and we can do this more easily by kind
of observing our emotions at some remove
like you can remain still and unmoving
in the seat of your being while
simultaneously watching your emotions
circulate through your body that's what
I mean by emotional Detachment it's like
experiencing your emotions at arms
length and this allows you to consider
the information or even wisdom contained
within them without allowing them to
permeate your entire Consciousness if
emotional Fusion is like drowning and
emotional amputation is like staying as
far away from water as possible then
emotional attachment is like swimming
you're in the water but you're not of
the
water and this is useful because our

[08:00]
water and this is useful because our
emotions are actually really important
sources of information for us we
typically need our emotions in order to
make good decisions here's something you
might find interesting it's sometimes
the case usually as a consequence of
some tumor or growth that a person's
lyic system the portion of the brain
responsible for emotional processing in
mammals must be surgically removed as
might be expected these people don't
experience emotions after these
procedures but perhaps more unexpected
they also develop a terrible time making
decisions like if you were to put one of
these people in the cereal aisle of a
grocery store they would spend hours
debating what box of cereal to buy
they'll think okay this box is $4.25 and
has a net weight of 22 grams now this
one's a bit less expensive but it's net
weight is proportionally lower so the
cost per gram is actually 2 cents higher
that said it also has more niin per

[09:01]
that said it also has more niin per
serving so the two cent per gram Savings
in the one case might be more than
offset by the relative deficiency in
nasin and so on and so on and so on do
you see what I'm getting at in the
absence of emotion there is only factual
information and the human mind is
actually not great at keeping a lot of
factual information in its working
memory at any one time this creates
information overload which in turn leads
to analysis Paralysis on the other hand
a normal person just walks down the
serial aisle and says ooo Lucky Charms
and throws it in his cart and keeps on
moving people have to make like 10,000
decisions a day and most of these
decisions don't really matter this is
where emotions come in one of the
primary functions of emotions is to
serve as heuristics in decisionmaking
allowing us to navigate the World by
expending fewer cognitive resources
people who don't have access to their
emotions struggle to make decisions
and that's because decision is an act of

[10:02]
and that's because decision is an act of
the will and has more to do with emotion
than thought so that's emotional
Detachment the ability to observe your
emotional experience at some remove this
will allow you to access the information
contained within your emotions without
necessarily acting upon them you can
feel the emotional impulse to act
without relenting to it this requires
some measure of self-discipline but like
any other virtue you strengthen it by
practicing it by not clinging to your
own emotional experience you will
increasingly learn to allow things to
come and go which in turn will help you
to be more present more grateful and
ultimately more loving in your
relationships hopefully that clears a
few things up what do you think does
