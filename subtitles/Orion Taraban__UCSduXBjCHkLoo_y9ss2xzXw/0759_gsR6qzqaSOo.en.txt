I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the two
relationships once you understand this
concept you'll have a much easier time
navigating inter seexual relationships
fail to understand it or insist that it
should be otherwise and you'll wind up
feeling bewildered frustrated and
disappointed it kind of goes like this
every relationship is actually two
relationships that is the relationship
actually exists on two different levels
simultaneously once you perceive these
two levels and understand the
differences between them you'll be able
to get more of what you want more easily
from others so what are these two levels
the first we can call the level of the
label this has to do with the explicitly
negot iated structure of a relationship

[01:02]
negot iated structure of a relationship
and as we'll see this is the more
superficial level of the two for example
when people say this is my boyfriend or
this is my wife they're actually abiding
at the level of the label this is the
relationship the individuals have
consciously decided to enter into and
it's upheld by rules and contracts and
boundaries and things like that now the
important thing to to appreciate here is
that there is nothing emotional about
the structure of a relationship this is
the level of negotiated self-interest of
Privileges and responsibilities of roles
and expectations this is what you get
after you sign the contract or Define
the
relationship however there's another
level to every relationship it's
actually a deeper level a more vital
level it's also a more chaotic and

[02:02]
level it's also a more chaotic and
uncertain level which is why so many
people prefer to reside at the level of
the label and to use that as a proxy for
the deeper relationship we can call this
second level the level of the bond or
the felt connection to another
person as cannot be repeated enough
these two things are not the same
millions of people
are married to those they don't really
feel much for and millions more feel a
lot for people they're not married to do
you understand of course ideally you
have both at more or less equal
intensity you have a vital emotional
connection with another human being that
is like protected and supported by the
structure and boundaries of the
relationship or on the other hand you
have a non-existent relationship with
someone you feel nothing for in both

[03:01]
someone you feel nothing for in both
cases the structure of the relationship
is elaborated to match the intensity of
the bond however life is far from ideal
in my experience it's far more common
for these two levels to be out of
balance in any given relationship there
are a lot of people walking around today
who believe that just because they have
a girlfriend or a
husband that is just because they have a
relationship with a label that they are
naturally and perpetually entitled to
all the benefits and privileges that
come with the emotional connection this
is not true for better or worse for
example you do not need to love your
spouse to get
married you
don't happens every day but you do have
to sign the marriage l license to get

[04:01]
to sign the marriage l license to get
married the problems arise when people
expect that having signed the marriage
license that they are now entitled to
love or conversely that having loved
that they are now entitled to the
marriage
license two very different things when
the commitment serves as a proxy for the
bond then the felt connection suffocates
and dies and this will either cause your
relation ship to fall apart or even
worse to become your prison the joyless
discharg of Duty for which death is the
only
release the reason why this doesn't work
as I've said is that every relationship
is actually two relationships entering
into the one entitles you to the other
about as much as entering into a
professional relationship with a
business partner intitled you to a new

[05:00]
business partner intitled you to a new
best friend if the two coincide it's
more of a fortunate accident than a
foregone conclusion as a result it's
much safer to consider the two as the
exist in reality functionally
independent of each
other if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available an ebook audio book and
paperback formats the links are in the
description

[06:00]
again ideally you have both levels in
equal proportion however if you had to
prioritize one level over another as is
often the case in real world
relationships it's a much better idea to
prioritize the felt emotional connection
with another person and to forgo the
label why because it's feeling that
motivates action people do all kinds of
things and make all kinds of sacrifices
for the people they love irrespective of
whether those actions are reciprocated
irrespective of whether they're even in
a relationship with the person in
question if a man runs into a burning
building to save his wife it's because
he loves her and she just happens to be
his wife it's not the duty of the label
that motivates action he would do the
same if he loved her and he wasn't

[07:00]
same if he loved her and he wasn't
married to her hell she could even be
married to someone else and he'll still
do it that's the Power of Love by the
same token a woman is much more likely
to stay loyal to the man she loves
whether or not that's her
husband this is because as I discuss in
my book things like loyalty and love are
non-trans actable Goods they cannot be
bought or earned and they laugh in the
face of boundaries and restrictions this
is why they have nothing to do with the
label they have no place in the
explicitly negotiated dimension of the
relationship if you want things like
love and loyalty and dedication and
enthusiasm then you will get more of
what you want by prioritizing the level
of the bond in any given relationship so
why don't more people do so because the
felt emotional connection is unstable
it's the weather always changing always

[08:03]
it's the weather always changing always
fluctuating unlike a commitment which
can be made once and for all it never
doesn't require effort and attention so
it can be expensive and exhausting to
Monitor and maintain over time as a
result as a relationship progresses
people tend to lean more and more on the
structure you can kind of think of it as
a cost-saving heuristic it requires much
less time and effort and attention to
preserve a structure than to nurture a
living changing
Bond however one of the liabilities of
the overuse of this juristic is that
people end up policing their boundaries
at the expense of cultivating the
connection husband shouldn't do that
this is how a girlfriend should act do
you understand on the other hand if
these people were to prioritize the felt
emotional connection if their husbands

[09:00]
emotional connection if their husbands
and girlfriends felt a lot of love for
them then they probably wouldn't need to
lecture their partners with respect to
what they should or should not be
doing in so doing they turn into parents
or detectives or wardens and they often
feel hurt and betrayed when their
Partners often eventually decide to
follow their emotions right out of that
relationship in spite of their explicit
agreements
those who don't want to put in the
effort to Kindle and maintain that
emotional connection often lose by
getting what they want the label
consider the extreme example an absence
of emotion but complete obedience to the
structure of the
relationship this is a robot like a
drone discharging a joyless obligation
who could possibly be happy about having
a partner like that like even the step
wives needed to be programmed to convey

[10:01]
wives needed to be programmed to convey
emotion you know what I'm saying
believing that a relationship on one
level entitles you to a relationship on
the other is actually an abnegation of
responsibility on the other hand those
who attend to that emotional Dimension
generally don't have to worry about the
label this is because people are going
to be loyal and devoted to the people
that they love their behavior more or
less follows their heart like people can
resist their hearts but they can't
resist it without doing some degree of
violence to themselves they're either
going to resist until they can't or
they're going to have to anesthetize or
remove that part of themselves and that
kind of surgery is going to come with
other consequences for a person's
emotional economy as well take care of
the felt emotional connection and the
structure often takes care of itself but
generally not the other way around

[11:00]
generally not the other way around
