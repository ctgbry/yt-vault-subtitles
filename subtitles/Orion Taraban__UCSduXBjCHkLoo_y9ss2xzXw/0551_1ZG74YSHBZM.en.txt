I'm Dr Orion terband and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
servant takes the money in this episode
I'm going to be talking about one of the
most underappreciated consequences of
female hypergamy as you know female
hypergamy is the tendency in women to
mate and date up status hierarchies
basically women look for men who are
bigger taller stronger older higher
status more successful higher earning
Etc essentially they are looking for men
who can improve their quality of life
which functionally allows women to mate
and date for gain since women treat men
the way men treat jobs they will select
the man who represents the best overall
offer however they choose to understand
that from among all the opportunities
open to them on the other hand men more
or less have to resign themselves to
mate and date for acceptable loss if you
are a man who wants a woman in your life

[01:00]
are a man who wants a woman in your life
you will have to pay in some way and
it's not always with money in fact
transacting purely with money is one of
the cheapest ways of securing access to
women men have to pay to play and the
value they give up is generally greater
than the value they receive in return
and it kind of has to be that way
otherwise women couldn't mate or date
for gain that's just simple economics
now it's for each man to decide for
himself what constitutes except
acceptable versus unacceptable loss with
respects to his intentions and
overarching purpose in life some women
and relationships will be within that
band of acceptable loss and many will
not but that's just the way it is now
women generally don't get upset when I
talk about their dating behavior in this
way they think I'm young I'm beautiful
and I won't have this chance forever so
why shouldn't I try to get as much as I
can for as long as I can and it's hard
to disagree with them on some level they

[02:02]
to disagree with them on some level they
are behaving rationally within the
system of incentives that constitutes
the game of dating as it exists in the
sexual Marketplace today if I were a
woman I might do the exact same thing so
I'm not judging them for this it's like
go get that bread but there is a flip
side to this situation that a lot of
women fail to appreciate I alluded to it
in the title of this episode in every
culture that has ever existed on this
planet it is the servant that takes the
money it is the servant who gets paid so
if in the vast majority of relationships
the net flow of resources moves from the
man to the woman then in the vast
majority of relationships we should
expect the woman to serve the man and
this of course has been the case
historically and my point here is that
women's his hisorical service to men has

[03:02]
women's his hisorical service to men has
more to do with this basic economic
principle which is a consequence of
hypergamy than with let's say
patriarchal oppression and this is where
women tend to get really quiet they like
the idea of
gain but if they're getting paid then
they're not the employer are they so you
have a choice ladies you can either be
the boss or you can get a paycheck but
you can't have it both ways
relationships are the medium in which
value is transacted and in the sexual
Marketplace men attempt to use resources
to secure sexual opportunity and women
attempt to use sexual opportunity to
secure resources however this is usually
not an equal transaction due to
hypergamy women tend to benefit more
from this exchange than men do this
creates a kind of
indebtedness that has historically been
paid off in various ways it is this
service that women have rendered to men

[04:01]
service that women have rendered to men
that balanced the scales of the
transaction between men and women it's
what made hypergamous relationships a
fair trade modern women however tend to
bulk at this service and yet they still
maintain their hypergamy they continue
to mate and date for gain this means
that the net flow of resources continues
to pass from the man to the woman which
functionally means that the man is just
paying to access the sexual
opportunity this basically means that a
lot of modern relationships are really
just forms of prostitution with extra
steps this might ruffle some feathers
however I honestly don't know what else
to call an arrangement in which
resources are exchanged for sexual
opportunity now before I go any further

rely on your support to keep all of this
going I really appreciate it thank you
very
much again the way out of this situation
has historically been for the woman to
provide other forms of service to the
man that were of use and interest to him
this created a fair trade in a pergamus
relationship in which unequal Goods of
comparable value were transacted the
issue is that no one really likes to be
the servant even if that is what creates
the basis of a fair transaction early
feminists understood that it was the net
flow of resources from the man to the
woman that kept women in the service
capacity this is why say Virginia wolf
spoke on the importance of money and A
Room of One's Own without both she

[06:00]
Room of One's Own without both she
argued a woman could not be
self-determined and you know what she's
right if you want to call the tune you
have to pay the piper and that's why so
much of second wve feminism focused on
improving women's material conditions
without their own money women would
likely forever remain in the servant
role and for the record I don't have any
problem with this I can sympathize I
wouldn't want to be the servant
indefinitely but I also pay my
debts and service is the pathway out of
indebtedness for a man or a woman now
fast forward a 100 years from M wolf
women have their own money and they have
their own room actually in most cases
they have the whole house however they
still date
hypergamous they still mate and date up
status hierarchies though it's becoming
harder and harder for them to do so and
this means the net flow resources still

[07:00]
this means the net flow resources still
moves from the man to the woman the
issue of course is that women bulk at
the service that they have historically
performed in order to absolve this
relative debt they want to be the boss
and they want to collect a paycheck
which doesn't work this is the economic
explanation for why men are dissatisfied
with modern relationships why they say
that relationships with women are too
expensive and why the juice isn't worth
the squeeze because of women's
hypergamous Tendencies and their
unwillingness to serve relationships are
a net benefit to women the only way
women can escape the servant role in an
economically Justified way is to enter
into relationships with men of
comparable status and lifestyle and this
is difficult for two main reasons in the
first place this is difficult because
hypergamy runs deep

[08:00]
hypergamy runs deep
it is hard to give up the desire to get
paid and this is because there is likely
a biological component to hypergamy that
cannot simply be overridden with
cultural programming ultimately women
are going to want what they want not
what a given ideology tells them they
should want in a certain historical
moment however it's really one or the
other give up the paycheck or provide a
service desired by the other party of
comparable value and in the second place
it is difficult for women to enter into
relationships with men of comparable
status because the passage of time tends
to affect men and women's status
differently For Better or Worse men's
status tends to increase and women's
status tends to decrease as a function
of time this means that an equal trade
at say 30 will likely not remain an
equal trade at 50 What Might Have Been a
fair exchange to begin with with becomes

[09:00]
fair exchange to begin with with becomes
increasingly unfair as the years pass
which if uncorrected is subject to
creating all kinds of difficulty in the
relationship what do you think does this
