I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is never
meet halfway so I'm going to be talking
about this in the context of the game of
mating and dating so let's say that the
two of you matched or you've been
hitting each other up and it's time to
set up that first date you live here and
she lives there so where are you gonna
meet well as the title of this episode
makes clear you're absolutely not going
to meet halfway and I'm going to explain
to you why this is the case first and
foremost we have to understand what a
date is here it is a date is connection
plus sexual
possibility that's the definition of a
date connection plus sexual possibility
a date with sexual possibility but no
connection is not a date it's a hookup

[01:00]
connection is not a date it's a hookup
likewise a date with connection but no
sexual possibility is also not a date
it's an
interview a date is connection plus
sexual possibility note I'm not saying
connection plus sex like the sex is
guaranteed it's not but for a date to be
a date the possibility that the
connection becomes sexual must exist and
this my friends is what makes the date
God God's perfect creation because when
everything goes right both the man and
the woman get what they want the woman
gets her connection she gets her
attention and her emotional engagement
and her validation she feels heard she
feels cared for she feels safe and since
the connection comes first it gives the
woman time and opportunity to have her
arousal cultivated which is important
because woman's arousal is typically
more reactive less spontaneous than

[02:01]
more reactive less spontaneous than
man's and when everything goes right the
man actualizes that sexual possibility
with a sexual encounter which is pretty
self-explanatory ideally both parties
are satisfied as each has given the
other what they wanted
Perfection So within this context it
should be clear why meeting halfway on a
date is not a good idea if you meet
halfway it becomes increasingly
difficult to realize the sexual
opportunity where are you going to go
you're you're just as far from her place
as you are from your place are you going
to get on the subway are you going to
drive your separate cars in One
Direction or another it's silly because
it doesn't make logistical sense and if
it doesn't make logistical sense it's
much less likely to happen to facilitate
a sexual encounter there should be as
few obstacles in the path of that

[03:00]
few obstacles in the path of that
trajectory as possible and this my dudes
is your job because as the man you will
be expected to plan the date and you
will be expected to move the
relationship in the direction of a
sexual encounter women rarely do either
in fact if you leave it up to them what
is the date that most women
propose let's meet for a coffee
somewhere in the
middle the
impracticality of a sexual opportunity
in this idea is no accident it's by
Design as I've discussed in the
negotiation phase women are attempting
to secure as many resources for as
little sexual opportunity as possible
while men are attempting to secure as
much sexual opportunity for as few
resources as possible and anchoring at
this point in an initial interaction all
but
ensures a less satisfying relationship
for the man

[04:00]
for the man
this might make some women feel safer
because there are few things less
conducive to a sexual encounter than
drinking caffeine in a brightly lit Cafe
in the middle of the day Far From Any
bedrooms however It suffers from one
fatal
flaw it's not a date this is because
there is no sexual possibility here this
is a screening interview which is
ironic because as I've discussed it's
the men who do the hiring meeting for
coffee halfway is the female equivalent
to just coming over for sex which women
typically don't do so take a page from
the ladies Playbook gentlemen and don't
agree to courtship interactions in which
sexual opportunity doesn't exist it's
one side getting What It Wants

everything I just discussed in the
description below okay let's get back to
it from a logistical standpoint in order
to facilitate a sexual opportunity you
need a place to easily go back to the
more difficult it is to do this the less
likely the opportunity will actualize
this means that the date can either be
planned close to your place or close to
her place

[06:00]
her place
which means that it should be close to
your place why because you can't invite
yourself over to someone else's place
and the vast majority of women are not
going to be initiating the sexual
dimension of the relationship she's not
going to lean in for the kiss she's not
going to suggest you go someplace
quieter do you understand if she's
interested she's going to follow your
lead and it's much harder to lead
someone into an environment that you
have no access or control over
she also might not have cleaned the
place or prepared the place for guests
or she may have roommates or live with
her
family a woman might be ready to have
sex with you but she might not be ready
for other people she knows to know that
she has sex with you to the extent that
you can provide a clean safe private and
easily accessible environment you will
be more likely to consummate the sexual
opportunity given all this the only

[07:00]
opportunity given all this the only
rational conclusion is that dates should
be planned close to the man's place any
woman who bulks at this wants the
connection and resources without the
sexual opportunity which as we discussed
is not a date it's an interview some
women don't like this in fact when I've
politely turned down offers to meet
halfway I invariably receive anger and
criticism and this by the way is also
what makes this an excellent test of
female character it reveals as quickly
and cheaply as possible how a particular
woman responds to the prospect of not
getting exactly what she wants in any
case I've been told that this is selfish
and disrespectful and unfair I've been
told that she expected that I would make
more of an effort I generally respond to
these by reminding the woman in question
that I'll be planning the date and
paying for everything so if the date is
also logistically convenient for her
then what effort would she be making

[08:00]
then what effort would she be making
everything would be on her terms which
is not the basis of a give and take
relationship so why would I even bother
like it's important for women to have
some skin in the game to my mind showing
up to an invitation is already kind of
the minimum effort a person could
possibly make and if she bulks at that
then her interest is likely too low for
it to be worth my time and money so this
can also be a test of women's interest
levels
finally it sets up the expectation from
the very beginning of the courtship
process this is very important that the
woman is rewarded that she gets what she
wants by making an effort and entering
your frame not the other way around so
let's recap since a date is connection
plus sexual
possibility since sexual possibility is
more easily actualized in a private
accessible location and since men are
expected to initiate and direct the

[09:00]
expected to initiate and direct the
sexual dimension of the relationship
then men should plan dates in their
immediate vicinity failing to do so
functionally eliminates the sexual
possibility which given the fact that
men transact resources for sexual
opportunity and women transact sexual
opportunity for resources in the sexual
Marketplace makes it more likely that
the woman will get more of what she
wants and the man will get less of what
he wants from the onset and over the
course of the relationship so you've
been warned gentlemen if you allow this
to occur then it's your own damn fault
