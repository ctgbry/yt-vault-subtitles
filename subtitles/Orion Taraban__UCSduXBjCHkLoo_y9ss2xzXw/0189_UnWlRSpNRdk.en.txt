i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to let go of someone
the ability to let go of someone is an
emotional survival technique
i remember that i was in the wake of a
significant heartbreak many years ago
the relationship ended poorly and i was
experiencing a whole host of emotions a
lot of hard feelings mixed up in my
longing and desire it was complex
and for this reason it was very
difficult for me to emotionally
disentangle myself from the memory of
this person
and i remember going to a good friend
and mentor and disclosing what i was
going through
and he told me something that has stuck
with me ever since
he told me that the only way to let go
of someone
is with love
and i
really
didn't like hearing that
and i'll i'll tell you why there was a
part of me that was still very much

[01:01]
part of me that was still very much
bound up with the hurt and the pain of
that relationship and i didn't love the
fact that the relationship was over and
that it had ended the way that it did
but the more i considered what my mentor
told me the more i realized that he
might actually be right
negative emotions kind of cause us to
emotionally clench
around the idea or the memory of a
person
and you can't let go of something that
you're simultaneously clinging to
the way to let go is to soften
and relax
this entails cultivating an attitude of
love and compassion relative to the lost
object
regardless of how he or she may have
treated you
regardless of how he or she may have
hurt you and regardless of how he or she
may have ended things
the practice is to cultivate gratitude
for what good was in the relationship
and to begin slowly over time to

[02:00]
and to begin slowly over time to
approach the idea
of wishing this person well
of wanting this person to heal
of hoping this person does not suffer
just as you might wish and want and hope
those things for yourself or even all
living things in buddhism this is called
a loving kindness meditation
this is not the same thing as condoning
what happened the idea is to completely
divest yourself of the negative emotions
that cause you to cling to the lost
object
gentleness is what facilitates
unclenching it's the soft positive
emotions like gratitude compassion and
love that allow you to unclench to
actually let go
and i'm not saying that it's easy
it's not easy to do that
but it's also not easy to live in
personal misery as a result of your
clinging so it's kind of pick your
poison
and this one at least gives you the

[03:00]
and this one at least gives you the
chance of potentially saving what's left
of your life that's what i have to share
with you
