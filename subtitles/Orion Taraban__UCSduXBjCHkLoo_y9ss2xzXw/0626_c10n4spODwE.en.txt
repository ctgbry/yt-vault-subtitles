you actually have an interesting quote
here um so you say all men pay but the
more attracted they are to you the
bigger the discount you get Yeah the
more women like you the greater the
discount correct like I said earlier men
generally are trying to transact
resources for the sexual opportunity
when a woman is attracted to a man when
she wants that particular man to access
her in that way she will remove as many
obstacles or obstructions to that
relationship as possible which basically
means she's going to be available she's
not going to be difficult she's going to
work with the logistics that work for
him she's going to come to him on his
time like she's going to do as much as
she can to make it easy for her to fit
into that man's life so that on the
whole makes that relationship less
expensive for that man because he's not
going out of his way he's not paying
more than he needs to in terms of time
and effort etc etc which also on the
whole makes it more likely that he will
move forward with that relationship
because no one man or woman will want to
pay more for the same good than they
absolutely have to
