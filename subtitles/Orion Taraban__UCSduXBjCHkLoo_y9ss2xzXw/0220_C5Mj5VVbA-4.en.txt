vanessa mcbride asks do attachment
problems have levels of severity and
what causes them absolutely
we are moved away from a
categorical definition of mental illness
and more towards a continuum model we
now believe that pretty much all
problems that people encounter are
they're not really binary it's not like
you're either depressed or you're not
depressed
but there's a continuum of depression
from mild to moderate to severe etc and
the same is certainly true for
attachment problems
where do they come from
almost all attachment problems
derive from some sort of failure rupture
or trauma within a primary attachment
relationship which is generally between
the child and at least one of his or her
parents
at um at a young age
this isn't 100
across the board but i would say it's at
least 90 percent
