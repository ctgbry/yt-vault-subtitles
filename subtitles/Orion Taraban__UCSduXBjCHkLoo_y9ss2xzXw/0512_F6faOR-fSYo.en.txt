I'm looking for a committed relationship
if you are not prepared to give me what
I want then please do not waste my time
I've got no time for games sound
familiar now I can appreciate where this
is coming from the women who do this
generally believe that by doing so they
are dating intentionally and just for
the record there is no problem with
dating intentionally it's a good
strategy for a lot of women the problem
is going about dating intentionally so
stupidly and inelegantly that it's
functionally impossible to generate the
desired result women telling a man that
you want a relationship and you don't
want to play games works just as well as
a man telling you that he just wants to
you casually and he doesn't want to play
games like those two statements are
gendered equivalents of each other men
learn from a very young age that that
doesn't work which is why men lie to you
by the same token men especially men
that you have no emotional buying with
are not just going to give you what you
want if you ask for it like that
