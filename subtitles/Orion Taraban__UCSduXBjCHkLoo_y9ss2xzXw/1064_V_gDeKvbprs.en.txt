How do you think the people that we're
attracted to, even the way we show up in
the world changes as we begin to heal?
Particularly the relationships that we
have with ourselves and even our
parents. For example, I would say I'm
particularly around that topic of having
a very close relationship with my mom
and my dad not really being in, you
know, a core part of our family, right?
I I don't think I particularly a nice
guy by any means, but had friends, let's
say, that went through therapy and
they've healed the rel relationship with
their parents, uh, and then they got
divorced because they realize they're
not no longer attracted to that person
after healing part of themselves,
including the relationships with their
parents. Do you think that can change as
we become even adults, as we start to
heal certain parts of ourselves and
relationships with our parents? And it
may change who we're attracted to even.
&gt;&gt; Oh, certainly. Yeah, that's happened to
me personally. It's kind of been long
known that the fastest way to accelerate

[01:00]
known that the fastest way to accelerate
a divorce is for one partner to start
therapy. And that kind of fits with what
you just described because if one person
starts to heal or one person enters into
a a phase of personal development more
generally, say, and the other person
doesn't, it's going to widen the gap
between felt compatibility. I'm on one
track, you're on another, and it feels
like the distance between us is just
getting greater and greater. Maybe we
work out some sort of like roommate or
co-parent agreement, but maybe also
there's still a lot of life left and
there's better, more satisfying
relationships that each one of us could
enter into. So maybe we get divorced.
