i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is navigating no win conversations
not very pleasant to have no win
conversations
can't really win by definition so let's
start off by talking about how to
recognize when you've fallen into one of
these conversational traps
basically you know that you're in a
no-win conversation with someone
because this person brings you a problem
or complaint
and after offering a potential solution
the problem or complaint suddenly shifts
to target the potential solution
and if you were then to offer a solution
to the problem with the solution to the
problem
guess what the locus of the complaint
shifts again and around and around we go
if a person keeps moving a goal post
like this
then it's safe to assume that they're
not engaging in the conversation in good
faith
rather for whatever reason they're
committed to making things difficult

[01:01]
committed to making things difficult
they don't want to have the problem
solved they want to make the situation
uncomfortable for you makes sense so
how do you navigate this moment
successfully well first and foremost
i'm going to tell you what not to do
first stop
offering solutions why because the
identified problem
isn't really the problem if it were the
conversation would have moved in a
constructed direction
provided your proposed solution was
acceptable so stop offering solutions
and second don't get defensive
this is especially important when the
problem ostensibly has to do with you
or your behavior it doesn't really like
i just said in these cases the problem
isn't really the problem
and if that person succeeds in getting
your ego involved
you're likely going to get defensive
which on some level validates that there
is some truth to the complaint
so don't defend yourself either so what
do you do
so you do something called emotional
reflection which is a

[02:01]
reflection which is a
really useful therapeutic skill first
for the time being try to make your ego
as invisible as possible
and just be a warm objective mirror to
the expressed emotion
it's easy to say but it takes some
practice to get good at so for example
let's say you're in a close relationship
with someone who is feeling hurt for
some reason
and this person comes to you with an
accusation you don't love me
it can be very difficult to hear a
accusation like that
and most people they'll get defensive
and start offering a bunch of counter
examples that rationally disprove such
an accusation
they'll start listing all the things
they've done in the past to communicate
their care and affection
and others might move right into problem
solving right away
saying something like well if you didn't
do x then maybe you wouldn't feel this
way
see what i mean rather than doing either
both of which are likely to make your
situation worse than it already is
try simply reflecting the emotion in
this case

[03:00]
this case
that would look something like you feel
like i don't love you
and stop there don't say anything more
than that
and wait for them to continue then this
person might say something like
yeah you care more about your job than
you do about me another difficult thing
to hear
and the emotional reflection to that
statement could be something like
you think i care more about my work than
you stop
again don't say anything more and wait
for them to continue
often you'll only have to deal with a
few more statements like this
before the conversation takes a turn for
the better why
because when people feel seen and heard
they tend to calm down
and once they return to a more rational
frame of mind
you can begin to move in the direction
of problem solving
however it's just not possible to do
when a person is too emotional they
perceive problem solving as
invalidating which provokes an
escalation
in the expressed emotion this is call
center etiquette 101
first acknowledge the customer's

[04:00]
first acknowledge the customer's
frustration before moving into proposed
solutions
the hard part is that in the moment when
you're on the receiving end of this
energy
it can seem pointless to practice this
technique after all you want to get out
of the hot seat as quickly as possible
but i'm here to tell you
that counter-intuitively this strategy
will help you do just that
try to take a shortcut and you may end
up going the long way around
remember that this uncomfortable moment
won't last
and use your communication techniques as
skillfully as possible
so good luck with that dear listeners if
you have a topic you'd like discussed in
a future episode or would like to
