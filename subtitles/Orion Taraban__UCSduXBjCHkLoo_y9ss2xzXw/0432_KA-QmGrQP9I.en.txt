how do men blow the first date simple
they show up on the first date and they
try to impress the woman
and they generally do this because a
little knowledge is a dangerous thing
they do this because they watch some
YouTube videos about what women want and
they learned about hypergamy and they
think women are attracted to money
status and Power
no problem I'll make sure they know how
much money I have how much status I
enjoy and how much power I yield
basically they just need to know that
I'm a high value man and they'll be
begging for it now this is not entirely
wrong but in terms of seducing a
particular woman it is mostly wrong
especially given the fact that men tend
to go about demonstrating their value in
such inelegant and ham-fisted ways too
many men think that bragging about their
professional exploits or their lifestyle
for an hour or two will get them laid
