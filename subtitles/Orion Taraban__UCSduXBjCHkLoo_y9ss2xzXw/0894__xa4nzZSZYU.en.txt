Talking a little bit more about the
mechanical parts of dating. I think
people don't talk about how a lot of
relationship and dating is actually a
skill set. Totally. How can men improve
their dating skills? By dating. Like
there's no way to improve a skill except
by doing it. You can't read books
though. I'm sure dating coaches and
programs are a multi-billion dollar
industry, right? They don't. And this is
part of why so many people I think
rightly find pickup to be cheesy or
sleazy is that when it's misapplied it's

protocol for escalation with respect to
touch and everything becomes like this
protocol and systematized and that one

is going to work for me. We're different
men and we have different strengths and
what works for me today might not have
worked for me even a year or so ago,
right? and might not work for me a year
or so from now. And it certainly doesn't

master key to just unlock any woman's
secrets and mysteries as it were. You
get better by talking to women, going
out with women, practicing escalation
under different circumstances, being
willing and able to seduce confidently
when the moment is right. And then also,
if you want to have longerterm
relationships, what it's like to
actually relate to somebody and keep the
interest alive after the honeymoon has
worn us.
