uh I do a chapter on maintaining
relationship okay and in particular I
discussed the three most common crises
that pretty much every couple has to
expect to negotiate over the course of
their relationship and the second crisis
is the attempted Mutiny which is at some
point in the middle of the ocean the
passenger goes up to the helm and says
hey I know that we discussed that we
were going here before but turns out
I've changed my mind I'd really like to
go someplace else instead and so this is
a crisis of power because we're starting
to understand who actually drives the
ship is it the captain who drives the
ship or is it the passenger who drives
the ship through the cap and at this
point it can become very expensive
because this passenger may have
insinuated herself into the Ecology of
that ship very considerably it now might
be very inconvenient if not expensive to
extricate her and to replace her and so
she's waiting to make the attempted
Mutiny attempt after that insinuation
has occurred so it becomes more
expensive to keep a woman over time
typically especially if you're a
successful high value man and you more
than man of course okay yeah absolutely
