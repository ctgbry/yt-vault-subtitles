i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
no
is sufficient
so this is something that i encourage
people to keep in mind whenever they're
in a negotiating posture relative to a
romantic partner an employer or even a
friend or family member
and there is on the table a request that
for whatever reason you don't want to do
the vast majority of folks when put in
the situation will attempt to identify
several plausible reasons
why fulfilling the request would be
impractical or inconvenient or unlikely
to succeed etc
and they base their rejection of the
request on a constructed scaffold of
reasons
and i generally discourage folks from
doing that
the fact of the matter is that those
reasons are almost always more like
rationalizations how can you tell
well if you really wanted to accept the
request then you would likely do so in

[01:01]
request then you would likely do so in
spite of the difficulties involved
so
they're not
they're really not the reasons why you
don't want to do something
the reason why you don't want to do
something in the vast majority of cases
is that you don't want to do it
and my argument is that that's
sufficient
you're not wanting to do something is
sufficient grounds for not doing that
something
you're wanting to do something is
sufficient grounds for doing that
something
the more we come up with reasons why we
either do or do not want to do something
the more we inadvertently devalue the
currency of our own wills and desires
on some level we're communicating that
even we don't believe it's enough that
we don't want to do something
that our reasons are more valid than our
desires
and this is how people over time can
come to undermine the legitimacy of
their own experience
overall i think it's better to see our
agencies in our wills
than it is to make our agencies

[02:00]
than it is to make our agencies
contingent on more circumstantial
factors
and this is important to consider with
respect to negotiation as well because
if you reject an offer and you provide a
bunch of reasons why you're turning it
down well that actually leaves the door
open for counter offers in future
discussions
because if the other person is taking
your rejection at face value they think
okay this person has an issue with x y
and z which means that if i address
issues x y and z then the basis of the
rejection disappears and i can expect to
transform this rejection into an
acceptance when the fact of the matter
is that if you really don't want to do
something it won't really matter whether
that person addresses issues x y and z
you're still not going to want to do it
the danger here is that the other person
will take the time to address your
stated concerns which kind of puts you
between a rock and a hard place
either you're gonna have to admit that
those really weren't the reasons for
your rejection or to create even more
reasons for your continued rejection

[03:00]
reasons for your continued rejection
or you're gonna go along with something
you really don't want to go along with
in order to save face
most likely you'll reject the amended
offer anyway and then everyone's going
to kind of feel a little resentful
because their time was wasted
it's much better to just say that you
don't want to do it from the outset why
because i don't really want to do it
that's the end of the conversation
your no is sufficient
so that's what i have to say on the
matter if you have a topic you'd like to
have discussed in a future episode or
would like to schedule a consultation
