I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is I
have plenty of time
this is an episode for the ladies so
guys please forward this on to your
sisters and daughters they need to hear
this
so this phrase I have plenty of time is
one that I've heard from many many women
over the course of my dating history
however this isn't really the case the
truth is is that many women have been
lied to or at least they haven't been
told the whole truth or perhaps they
haven't been told the whole truth in a
way that they were able to hear and I
hope to be able to do that today
I dislike being the bearer of bad news
but if you're a woman and you haven't
yet locked down a long-term relationship
by the time that you are 30. you are at
a disadvantage and that disadvantage
increases with each passing year
it's not a coincidence that the average

[01:00]
it's not a coincidence that the average
age at first marriage in this country is
right before the moment when the average
man's sexual Marketplace value begins to
exceed the average woman's sexual
Marketplace value for the very first
time
I talk about that more in my episode why
people get married when they do
the point is that the game changes
significantly at 30. men will continue
to sleep with women in their 30s but
they won't consider them for marriage
and long-term Partnerships as frequently
Every Woman seems to believe that she's
the exception to this rule
she almost certainly is not
and the thing is that this doesn't
technically have to do with
attractiveness
yes physical attractiveness tends to
diminish as a function of time but many
women are still physically attractive in
their 30s however even for these women
their odds of securing a high value man
decrease with each passing year through

[02:01]
decrease with each passing year through
their 30s why well
those attractive women often justifiably
believe that they're entitled to high
value men
and these same high-value men enjoy
incredible optionality many of them
aren't going to be interested in
settling down anytime soon and those who
are are significantly more likely to
choose a woman who all other things
being equal offers a better reproductive
opportunity
if he has a choice between a beautiful
24 year old and a beautiful 34 year old
most men with optionality looking to
start a family will choose the 24 year
old so you might still be beautiful at
34. but you're likely not as beautiful
as you were at 24 and it will be harder
and harder to compete against those 24
year olds for the same man's attention
just keeping it real
next we need to face some unpleasant
facts
a lot of women have misconceptions about

[03:01]
a lot of women have misconceptions about
Reproductive Medicine
they've seen celebrities have children
at 40 and maybe they even know someone
who has had a child using IVF in vitro
fertilization
so they believe they can kind of just
throw some money at the issue and poof
have science take care of the rest and
I'm here to tell you that this is not
how it works
I've worked with many men who have
accompanied their women through several
unsuccessful rounds of IVF
their attempts cost hundreds of
thousands of dollars and their ultimate
failure to conceive was heartbreaking
about half ended up getting divorced as
a result
so why is it so difficult
well according to the American Society
for Reproductive Medicine the chance of
getting pregnant each month at 40 is
four percent
and at 40 on average
80 percent of a woman's remaining eggs
are genetically abnormal

[04:00]
are genetically abnormal
so even if you plan conscientiously and
make vigorous attempts during ovulation
women have a less than one in 20 chance
of conceiving at 40 each month of her
cycle and the pregnancy is quite likely
to experience complications of all kinds
many of which can result in congenital
defects
they will also tell you if you go into a
Reproductive Clinic that it is
significantly easier to get pregnant
later using IVF if you freeze an embryo
which is a fertilized egg as opposed to
a female gamete the egg itself
it's really difficult to get pregnant at
40 at least using your own eggs these
are facts that many women just don't
know

now
I've gone out with many women in my time
many of them were beautiful and
intelligent and accomplished
a while back I was chatting with this
attractive South Asian doctor
I think at the time she was 32 years old
over the course of the conversation I
asked her about her views on children
and she told me that she wasn't really
thinking about starting a family
when I expressed my surprise she replied
that she wasn't worried because she had
eight years to figure it out
and when she said that my surprise
turned into shock
now I don't remember what kind of doctor
she was but she was obviously not a
fertility doctor
my point here is that if an intelligent
medically trained professional woman
thinks that at 32 years old she has
eight years to figure out marriage and

[06:02]
eight years to figure out marriage and
kids
then just think what the average woman
is up against
so let's do some very basic math shall
we
let's say that you want to have a family
with two kids and as we've seen 40 is a
pretty hard Line in the Sand with
respect to pregnancy
that would mean that you would kind of
need to have your second child by the
time you were 40. which means that we
need to get pregnant with that second
child at 39. which means that you would
have to have your first one at 38 which
means that you would have to get
pregnant with that one at 37. which
means you kind of have to get married at
36 which means you kind of have to get
proposed to at 35 which means you
probably have to meet the guy at 33 34
at the latest
if this woman wanted to have two kids
she didn't have years to figure it out
she had months
now obviously things don't necessarily

[07:00]
now obviously things don't necessarily
have to progress the way I just
described but if they don't
that time has got to come out of
somewhere
so what does that mean
well that means potentially getting
engaged to someone you've dated less
than a year in my opinion not a very
good idea
or that means that you're not going to
have a big wedding because you'll only
have a few months to prepare
that doesn't actually sound so bad you
could save a lot of money that way or it
might mean getting pregnant before
you're married that's a bit riskier or
it could mean that you have Irish twins
and conceive as soon after the birth of
the first child as it's physiologically
viable to do so or it could mean only
having one child
Etc
you can delay the decision on the front
end but the time has got to come out of
somewhere and taking time out of the
back end can often be more problematic
than taking the time out of the front
so this is the situation that a lot of
women find themselves in they've been
lied to by feminism they have incomplete
knowledge of their own reproductive
biology and they don't understand how

[08:01]
biology and they don't understand how
men select for long-term Partners
especially at the highest levels
men choose youth not only because they
are generally more physically attracted
to younger women but because youth is
typically a marker of fertility and
health
put yourself into the shoes of a
handsome rich man with options
if he has it all except a family
How likely is it that he is going to
wife up a woman who's only got a couple
years of real fertility left and whose
most most of whose eggs are already
genetically abnormal
like why would he do that especially if
he has Alternatives this is a hard
reality that women have to face
the other day my friend Sean T Smith
told me that feminism has lied to women
because it has told women that they can
be anything which is functionally true
but it left out that they can't beat
everything

[09:00]
everything
because no one can
everything is a trade-off on some level
the cost of being anything is giving up
the chance to be everything else
and women acting as though they have
until 40 to figure this particular thing
out has significant Downstream
consequences
so hopefully I was able to present this
issue in a way that women could hear it
non-defensively in any case I don't make
the news I just report it so don't shoot
the messenger
