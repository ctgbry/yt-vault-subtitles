I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the way
it all ends
so this is a long one but it's an
important one it's also one for the
ladies so guys forward this on to your
sisters and daughters they need to hear
this
all right let's start by taking a high
level look at the state of the sexual
Marketplace in the present day shall we
fewer people are getting married
entering into relationships or even
hooking up than ever before all three of
these things are at historically
unprecedented lows and there are many
many reasons for this however one of the
primary drivers of this phenomenon as
discussed in the previous episode is
female hypergamy
coupled with the reality that in the
west young women are doing very well
childless women under 30 are
outperforming men in that demographic in
almost every quantifiable metric and

[01:02]
almost every quantifiable metric and
most notably in education and earning
yay women
that said if women retain their tendency
to mate and date up and if young men are
underperforming relative to young women
then there will simply be a smaller and
smaller pool from which most women would
be willing to select a partner and since
women are The Gatekeepers of sex and Men
Are The Gatekeepers of commitment and
since sex precedes commitment in the
west we see the trickle-down effect
mentioned before less sex leads to fewer
relationships leads to fewer marriages
now this would actually be a much easier
problem to solve were it not for one
little thing namely women despite all
their modern ideas about gender sex and
power are still waiting for the offer
as discussed previously across all

[02:01]
as discussed previously across all
cultures and throughout history the man
has been expected to proposition the
woman
this proposition can range from you up
to can I buy you a drink sometime to
will you marry me but it is always the
man who makes the offer to the woman
and this is peculiar because there
doesn't seem to be like a necessary
reason for this like if we can
collectively question the necessity of
pretty much every other traditional
gender role I'm not sure why this one
has survived to the present day and just
for the record I would love to be taken
out to dinner like if you want to make
all the plans and pay for everything or
if you want to invite me over for a
home-cooked meal I would be thrilled to
show up and look pretty
provided of course you are sufficiently
attractive you meet all of my criteria
and you don't assume I'm just going to
sleep with you because that would be

[03:00]
sleep with you because that would be
creepy and my eyes are up here
in any case and for whatever reason
women don't seem interested in occupying
this traditionally male role in the
courtship process at all ages and at all
levels of commitment they are still
waiting for the offer now on the surface
this doesn't seem to cause too many
problems for women in their 20s the
offers might be coming in hard and fast
and it may reasonably seem like it's
only a matter of time before an even
better offer comes in and they'll accept
when they're ready however this attitude
while understandable leads to a number
of Fairly predictable Downstream
consequences this is because the game
changes at 30.
previously discussed 30 is the age at
which the average male sexual
Marketplace value exceeds the average
woman's sexual Marketplace value for the
very first time

[04:00]
very first time
and since men are presumably expected to
make the same ultimate offer namely
marriage or a lifetime of commitment
protection and provision to a woman in
her 20s as to a woman in her 30s or
Beyond
and since women's sexual Marketplace
value decreases across the same timeline
all other things being equal the same
offer becomes increasingly expensive as
the woman ages
I'll say that again in a slightly
different way since the offer is the
same but a woman's sexual Marketplace
value decreases as she ages the same
offer becomes increasingly expensive as
a function of time
what this generally means is that if
women don't adapt to changing conditions
they may find themselves priced out of
the market especially since they seem
hell-bent against making the offer this
is why Mick Jagger crooned that time was
on his side
yes it is

[05:00]
yes it is
now before I go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing please

because it's Word of Mouth referrals
like this that really help to make the
channel grow you can also hit the super
thanks button it's the three little dots
in the lower right hand corner and tip
me in proportion to the value you feel
you've derived from this message
all of this is made possible through
your support and I couldn't do this
without you so I'm really appreciative
of what you can do thank you very much
all right let's try to put this all
together shall we given all the factors
that we've discussed thus far female
hypergamy young women's success relative
to young men changing smv as a function
of time and the fact that women aren't
making offers to men there are actually
only a few different ways this can
possibly turn out in fact if we play the
chess out 20 moves we see that there are
only five possible end games here for
women
can't give the exact odd ratios but some
are much more plausible than others
let's briefly walk through all five

[06:01]
let's briefly walk through all five
scenarios
remember
High performing attractive young women
set an extremely high barrier to entry
their success coupled with their
hypergamy means that there are fewer
potential mating and dating options for
them their price tags the value required
to overcome their entry barriers to a
sexual relationship are very very high
and since the majority of women are
gunning for the same top 10 percent of
men the intersexual competition is
astounding
now on the other hand while women are
doing very well the men to whom they are
hypergamously attracted are by
definition doing even better
these 10 percent of men have incredible
optionality and they may understandably
be reticent to forego the buffet for the
same meal for the rest of their lives
this creates the ironic Paradox that the

[07:00]
this creates the ironic Paradox that the
men who have what women want are the
least likely to give it to them
let me say that again the men who have
what women want are the least likely to
give it to them from their perspective
the women's demands are too expensive
and they only become more expensive as a
function of time
and this phenomenon will intensify as
the trends we've discussed continue
what this means is that given the
assumptions I've already mentioned there
are only five end games for women as
you'll see they logically cover all
possible outcomes here they are
a women keep their price tags High beat
out the intersexual competition and
secure the high value man
B women lower their price tags in order
to beat out the intersexual competition
and secure the high value man
C women keep their price tags High fail

[08:01]
C women keep their price tags High fail
to beat out the intersexual competition
and settle for a lower value man
D women lower their price tags still
fail to beat out the intersexual
competition and settle for a low value
man
and E women neither secure nor settle
and end up unpartnered there are
literally no other ways for the game to
end
so which outcome is most likely
feel free to pause the episode and take
a guess
now since we're talking about behavioral
economics and the exchange of value the
easiest way to approach an answer to
this question is to consider what you a
woman would do if you were shopping
to that end would you ever ever buy the
exact same product from one vendor if
you could get it more cheaply and easily
somewhere else
of course not
and that's why though this is going to
be hard for some women to appreciate the

[09:00]
be hard for some women to appreciate the
most unlikely outcome by far
is scenario a
keeping your price tag high with men who
are Awash in optionality ain't gonna
lead to a sale
that's it do you sometimes pay much more
for a product from one vendor even
though you could get a similar product
more cheaply and easily elsewhere
you do
almost every woman I know owns a
designer bag which is a sack to hold
things
you don't need to spend thousands of
dollars on a sack but you do need to
spend thousands of dollars on a Versace
sack now Versace can charge thousands of
dollars for a sack because they have
demonstrated proof that women will pay
thousands of dollars they can beat out
all the other sacks they are the one
percent of sacks and a woman needs to be
a one percent woman
to have a Versace price tag By

[10:01]
to have a Versace price tag By
definition most women are not one
percent women
they will lose to the intersexual
competition for the top 10 percent of
men
if they keep their price tags High
this is not because these men can't
afford the price tag but because like
you they are not going to spend more
than they need to for the exact same
product so scenario a is the least
likely it only happens about one percent
of the time
next appreciate the fact that even if
every one of these top 10 percent of men
wanted to get married and settle down
and they definitely don't that would
mean by definition a maximum of only 10
percent of women could possibly end up
with one of these high value men and
since one percent of women end up in
scenario a and since roughly one-third
of the remaining men in this category by
a conservative estimation will be

[11:00]
a conservative estimation will be
uninterested in settling down at any one
time this means that about six percent
of women can possibly end up in scenario
B making it the second least likely
outcome
and of course the cost of securing this
outcome is women lowering their price
tags women are you more likely to buy
the Versace sack at full retail or when
it's on sale even if you could afford
the full retail wouldn't you be more
motivated to act by the discount
of course you would because that's
rational and if Versace wants to reach a
clientele that would otherwise be priced
out of its regular product that is
exactly what Versace needs to do
excellent we've covered the first two
options and there are still 93 percent
of women left unaccounted for where are
they going to go
well since we know that 25 percent of
women are unmarried at 40. a figure
that's increased a whopping 25 in just

[12:00]
that's increased a whopping 25 in just
the last 10 years and seven percent of
women end up in the first two categories
that means that about two-thirds of
women will face endgames C and D
and since my impression is that women
reproductive window notwithstanding
would genuinely and understandably
prefer to remain unpartnered than resign
themselves to a less desirable
relationship with a lower value man I
don't think there's an equal split here
that said the desire for children and
commitment can be very powerful in women
especially as they age so there is a
split to be made
my hunch is that about 15 percent of
women end up in scenario D they lower
their price tags still fail to beat out
the intersexual competition and settle
for a lower value man making it the
third least likely outcome
and these women typically end up here
out of pressure necessity
women would you ever pay twenty dollars

[13:00]
women would you ever pay twenty dollars
for a mediocre sandwich probably if you
were at the airport and you didn't plan
properly
in this scenario the prospect of going
12 hours without food is more
distasteful than being gouged for a
disappointing meal you will be willing
to pay more for less if the prospect of
going entirely without is more painful
seen from the opposite perspective this
is why producers who create on a regular
Cadence everyone from car manufacturers
to fashion designers to local bakeries
radically discount their products right
before the newer fresher products are
released
this is designed to capture customers
who for whatever reason are unwilling or
unable to wait just a little bit longer
for a better option hence pressured
necessity if you need the sale and your
product is expiring this is how you
motivate action

[14:01]
motivate action
now next up is scenario e
these are women who are unable to secure
and unwilling to settle and they
constitute a rapidly growing proportion
of the population as of right now about
one in Four Women will face this end
game and I think it will soon become one
in three making it the second most
likely outcome
it's too harsh to say that these women
end up alone after all there are people
everywhere with whom you can have
satisfying relationships but they end up
unpartnered and childless
in 2020 nearly 60 percent of women under
30 in the U.S were childless and frankly
this doesn't seem to bother most women
in this demographic many of them are
thriving making good money traveling the
world prioritizing their friends and
their interests and receiving lots of
offers however as I can apparently never
say enough the game changes at 30. just
like a lot changes between the ages of

[15:02]
like a lot changes between the ages of
19 and 29 A lot changes between the ages
of 29 and 39.
Windows shorten clocks wind down and the
fear of missing out rears its ugly head
failing to plan is planning to fail
according to a 2010 meta-analysis only
10 percent of ultimately childless women
actively chose not to become mothers and
about 10 percent of the remaining women
could not become mothers due to medical
reasons that means about 80 percent of
women who never have children arrived at
this outcome unintentionally
and this is not an even distribution
across all women the proportion of
unintentionally childless women is
significantly the highest among
high-earning women
with Advanced degrees
namely
with the women who were performing so

[16:00]
with the women who were performing so
well in their 20s
men are typically not as interested in
making offers to these women not as is
commonly believed because they are
intimidated by successful women that is
a cope for the women in question but
because these successful women are older
it takes time to get an advanced degree
and build a career and as we've seen all
other things being equal the same offer
becomes more expensive as a function of
time
these women are also the least likely to
surrender their hypergamous Tendencies
after all they've worked very hard to
get to where they are so why would or
should they settle
it's an excellent question however the
upshot here is that these women tend to
price themselves out of the market more
frequently than their less educated
lower earning and younger competition
and that leaves scenario C since these

[17:01]
and that leaves scenario C since these
five end games cover all the mutually
exclusive outcomes we can estimate that
53 percent or roughly half of all women
will end up with lower value men willing
to pay a higher price tag
while a high value man with lots of
options may not be willing to offer say
sexual exclusivity or a lifetime
commitment a lower value man who might
not be able to access the same sexual
opportunity otherwise might
these men must offer more to compensate
for their lower attractiveness this
means that most women end up with the
relationship they want but not with the
man they would prefer
and this is what leads to a lot of
low-grade marital dysfunction as Chris
Rock put it the number one reason why
your woman's always mad is because you
ain't her first choice
link below
not all women can afford a Versace sack
but that typically doesn't stop them

[18:01]
but that typically doesn't stop them
from wanting one and this can make them
envious and unhappy especially if
they're scrolling
on the other hand some women can
successfully resolve this dissonance by
making a virtue out of a necessity which
all things being equal is actually a
very useful reframe that is rather than
focus on the sack they wanted but
couldn't afford they recast the knockoff
they bought at a significant discount as
just as good after all the knockoff sack
can hold at least as much as the Versace
sack and it may even be the more
practical accessory for most occasions
so what's the upshot at the end of the
day most women will end up with a
perfectly serviceable option so there's
no need to give in to Panic or dread
so this is the approximate distribution
of endgame likelihood when we look 20
moves ahead and this distribution hinges
on women's continued reticence to make
the offer whether it's for a date or for
a lifetime of provision the game will

[19:01]
a lifetime of provision the game will
change significantly if and when they
cross that threshold but this is how it
roughly looks under the current state of
play
just keep in mind that these are kind of
Ideal odds ratios they skew more
disadvantageously to the women as the
years go by
for most women they will never have a
better chance of securing the
relationship they want with the man they
prefer
than today
