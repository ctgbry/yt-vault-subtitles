on my recent short our parents and
grandparents weren't like this what
happened
subspace scout asks me what are your
predictions for the upcoming relations
between humanity and ai well there's a
lot of things i could say however one of
them is i believe that we will see
more and more relationships like
emotional or sexual relationships
between human beings and
machines
this is already occurring to a certain
degree in japan which is slightly more
technologically advanced than the united
states and most of europe and i found
that kind of with respect to technology
as japan leads the rest of the world
tends to follow
i think it will be
come increasingly socially acceptable
for it to happen
and that's going to have all kinds of
ramifications for the foundations of
society
the family system and sexual relations
between men and women
