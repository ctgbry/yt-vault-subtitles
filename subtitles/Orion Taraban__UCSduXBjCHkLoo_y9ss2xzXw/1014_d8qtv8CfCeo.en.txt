This is part two of a discussion in
which we unpack Oscar Wild's apocryphal
quote that everything is about sex
except sex, sex is about power. In the
first episode, everything is about sex,
I tackled the first claim in the quote
and discussed that most productive
output is actually sublimated sexual
impulse that cannot find a socially
acceptable outlet. Now, the second part
of this quote that sex is really about
power is also food for thought. Outside
of like singlear armed combat, sexual
selection is one of the clearest methods
of determining men's relative power
rankings. No woman is attracted to
weakness. The more powerful the man, not
only in terms of physical strength, but
in terms of social strength as well, the
more he has access to more and more
attractive women. So much so that the
attractiveness of a particular woman is

often used to gauge the social power of
the man that she's with. The fact that
sex might really be about power explains
something that might otherwise be rather
disconcerting, namely the transgressive
nature of most male pornography. Like
there are some disturbing themes in this
technology. But despite the prevalence
of such content, we haven't seen a
dramatic uptick in the type of behavior
that it depicts. This is because
pornography serves a kind of wish
fulfillment function. And the wish that
most men, consciously or not, want
fulfilled is power. Which makes sense as
the average man is and is becoming
increasingly powerless.
