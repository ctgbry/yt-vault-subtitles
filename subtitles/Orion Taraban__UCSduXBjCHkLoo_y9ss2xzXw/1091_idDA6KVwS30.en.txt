Here's another thing to keep in mind.
Since chasing always puts a player in a
more disadvantaged position, we can
understand that pursuit is always the
necessity of the less powerful player.
Pursuit is an aggressive tactic. It's
offensive. Consider a game of soccer. A
team that is down on points must become
more aggressive as the game goes on. If
they aren't to resign themselves to
losing, the team that is up on points
can adopt a more defensive position.
It's their game to lose. It's the
trailing team's game to win. So, we can
see that the decision to chase or not is
not actually a gendered one. It's not
that women inherently don't have to
chase or even more insidiously shouldn't
have to chase. Pursuit becomes the
necessity of the side that is down on
points. The more attractive does not
move to the less attractive. Period. And
in the context of any given interaction,
one party is going to be more attractive
than the other. Adopting a don't chase

than the other. Adopting a don't chase
policy when dealing with more attractive
and more powerful players isn't going to
work. It is what it is.
