I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is
psychak's Better Living Through
psychology and the topic of today's
short talk is How To Love Yourself
loving yourself is extremely important
and this is because wherever you go
there you are
what does that mean
everything that you experience you
experience within your Consciousness
it's not possible for you to experience
anything outside of your Consciousness
and within that Consciousness will be
yourself or more precisely that
Consciousness is yourself that self is
sort of like a die that saturates
throughout a liquid it will color and
flavor all the other contents in that
solution
this means for example that if you are
cruel and self-loathing even if the
other contents of your Consciousness are
the most Pleasant and delightful
possible that cruel self-loathing self
will permeate these other contents and

[01:03]
will permeate these other contents and
spoil whatever goodness pleasure or
happiness you might otherwise have
experienced by the same token a self
that is clean and loved will make it
much easier to experience even
unpleasant painful and difficult content
without suffering in this way attending
exclusively to your external
circumstances without paying attention
to your internal environment is likely
to prove self-defeating consequently we
need to learn how to love ourselves so
that wherever we go we can be assured of
good company
now if you were raised in a securely
attached loving family this will likely
be easier for you to do than if you are
raised in a chaotic and conflict-ridden
environment however no matter your
circumstances I'm here to give you three
actionable things that you can start

[02:00]
actionable things that you can start
doing today in order to accelerate your
progress in the direction of self-love
here we go
first and foremost make a commitment
starting now
not to speak to yourself in a way that
you wouldn't speak to a close friend
though I've been a therapist for over 10
years I am still shocked from time to
time at just how negatively some people
speak to themselves every mistake they
make is painfully Amplified and
everything they do well is grossly
minimized by this horribly negative
critical inner voice
so the first step to loving yourself is
to stop speaking to yourself in that way
if you wouldn't say something out loud
to someone that you cared about then
don't say it to yourself
even if you don't care about yourself
yet you have to begin to act as if you
did
this is so important because if you

[03:01]
this is so important because if you
denigrate someone over time it's so much
easier to hate them
this is like an initial step in all
totalitarian regimes towards pogroms and
genocide to justify the violence against
a hated group you must first denigrate
them
if the denigration does not occur it's
much harder to see the targets as in
human and therefore much more difficult
to justify the atrocious Behavior by the
same token self-denegration justifies
self-hatred and self-violence of all
kinds so stop doing it now
now how do you respond to your critical
inner voice when it invariably arises
well as soon as you become aware that it
is active you implement the block and
replace technique first you block it hey
that's not true or hey we don't talk to
ourselves that way anymore
and then you replace that thought with

[04:00]
and then you replace that thought with
the least pathologizing interpretation
of reality that still fits the facts of
the case
this could look something like no it's
not true that I'm a complete piece of
I just suffered a setback and I'm going
to continue to work through this
difficult moment or no I'm not Unworthy
of love
if one person isn't interested in a
relationship with me that doesn't mean
someone else won't be something like
that
now before I go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this video to someone
who might benefit from its message
because it's Word of Mouth referrals
like this that really help to make the
channel grow
and you can also hit the super thanks
button it's and there's three little
dots in the lower right hand corner
beneath the video and tip me in
proportion to the value you feel you
derived from this episode
I really appreciate your support it
makes all this happen
okay so once you've made a commitment to
stop talking to yourself in a way you

[05:00]
stop talking to yourself in a way you
wouldn't talk to somebody else that you
cared about the next step is to begin to
talk positively to yourself
what does that look like
basically you want to speak to yourself
like you're a supportive coach or a good
friend or for some of you a loving
parent
this is likely going to feel really
weird in the beginning but trust me it's
super necessary to the process just keep
in mind that a supportive coach or a
good friend isn't going to ignore your
mistakes or fluff up your ego they
address what needs to be addressed and
they praise what deserves to be praised
what characterizes these roles is their
Unapologetic and unwavering support and
commitment like these folks will be in
your corner until the end
what I'm talking about here is the same
degree of support and commitment for
your own success and well-being

[06:00]
your own success and well-being
so what does this look like well it can
actually be a little cheesy
it could sound something like hey you
worked really hard today it wasn't
always easy but you did your best and
things seemed to turn out all right good
job
or
hey you were afraid to do that but you
did it anyway that was courageous I'm
proud of you
the idea here is to accurately reflect
the good that you do in your day-to-day
life just like an Engaged and supportive
Parenthood
over time this kind of self-talk slowly
develops into a sustainable self-love
notice again that we're not catering to
our egos with hyperbolic positive
language all this does is reinforce the
fragile narcissistic self that is the
steward of the Wounded self-loathing
self in reality these two are two sides
of the same coin which means that
strengthening one will actually only

[07:01]
strengthening one will actually only
serve to strengthen the other
we're interested in grounding our
self-worth in something real and active
not something illusory and reactive
so resist the urge to assuage your pain
with love food that may taste sweet but
is ultimately not nutritious
now if you stop the negative self-talk
and you begin to speak positively to
yourself in the sense of providing
accurate Reflections on the good that
you do throughout the day
then you're actually pretty far along
the road towards loving yourself
the third thing that you can do to
accelerate this process is to act in a
way that you would find easier to love
in someone else
my first video on this channel was
entitled be the person you can love
the production values have improved
since then but the message is as good as
ever
how are you going to love yourself if

[08:00]
how are you going to love yourself if
you continue to act in unlovable ways
like it's much easier to love other
people when they're lovable isn't it
well it's theoretically possible to love
anyone some people are much much harder
to love than others
this could be because they are critical
or unpredictable or unreliable or
untrustworthy or touchy or demanding Etc
these people are like the double black
diamonds of interpersonal relationships
for experts only
on the other hand
it's easy to love people who are
supportive and even tempered and
reliable and trustworthy and easy going
and appreciative
Etc
and if it's easier to love people with
those qualities
you are not the exception
develop those qualities in yourself and
it will also be easier to love yourself
and of course the less you criticize

[09:01]
and of course the less you criticize
yourself and the more you accurately
acknowledge the good that you do the
easier it will be to develop these
qualities which creates a virtuous cycle
and like all virtuous Cycles this can be
hard to get going you may have to put in
a lot of effort for longer than you
anticipated before you see any
appreciable movement it's kind of like
moving this enormous Rock You may have
to expend an enormous effort to get it
to budge an inch
but once that rock starts to move
momentum begins to kick in and further
efforts see increasingly better results
so if you follow these steps it still
might take a while before you begin to
love yourself however if it might take a
while
then you may as well get started
especially given the fact that it will
never be easier than it is today
