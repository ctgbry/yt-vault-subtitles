people are making a fundamental mistake
when it comes to dating and attraction
most people are not conscious of this
mistake but as soon as I bring it to
your attention you will likely see it in
operation in your own life the mistake
is that folks generally treat the people
they are attracted to differently from
the people they are not attracted to and
why is this a mistake well think about
it whatever you're doing with respect to
the people you are not attracted to is
working those are the people who are
actually pursuing you and are trying to
enter into a relationship with you
whatever you're doing there is working
however there's this belief that
whatever you're doing wouldn't or
shouldn't work on the hotter women or
the men that you really want to get
married to and that's not true and this
is because the men or women that you are
attracted to are not different from the
men and the women you are not attracted
to why because that attraction exists
only in your own head
