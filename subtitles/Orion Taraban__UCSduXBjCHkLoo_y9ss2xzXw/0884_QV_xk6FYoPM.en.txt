Smart women use carrots to motivate
behavior in their partners as well. They
not only acknowledge and appreciate and
respect their men's sacrifices in the
service of their sexual exclusivity,
they go a step further. Women, you hate
when men cheat on you, but what reward
do you offer for being loyal to you?
That's just doing your job, which
invalidates the man's efforts. So,
here's my crazy idea of how women can
reduce the likelihood that men will
cheat on them. Gify the process. Give
him some carrots. Give him something he
could look forward to as a consequence
of the good action you would like him to
perform. Men are mostly rational. If
they understand that they will get more
out of being loyal than they would by
not being loyal, they are much more
likely to honor their commitments. And
women are largely in control of those
contingencies. Now, obviously, women are
going to have different comfort levels
with respect to the enticements they
will be willing to offer in exchange for
continued loyalty. But offering some
enticement is a no-brainer. And the

enticement is a no-brainer. And the
creamier the enticement, the more
effective it's likely to be. In general,
it's a good idea to reward the behaviors
in your partner that you want to see
more of. And this is no exception.
