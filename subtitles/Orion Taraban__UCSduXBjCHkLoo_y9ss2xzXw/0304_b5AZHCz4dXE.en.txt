I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the truth
about romance solipsism
this is another one that's probably been
staring you in the face the entire time
romance is fundamentally solipsistic and
because this might be a unfamiliar term
for some of you let me first Define what
that is solipsism is the belief that
nothing exists outside of the self
consequently we could also probably say
that romance is narcissistic but that
carries a whole host of other
associations that I don't want to get
into today now before I explain why
romance is solipsistic please remember

in my mission to deliver free high
quality content to the world thank you
for your help
like I've done in previous installments
in this series I'm going to help you
understand what I mean by directing you
to a song in the pinned comment below I

[01:01]
to a song in the pinned comment below I
put a link to one of my favorite modern
Romance songs Chasing Cars by Snow
Patrol I love this song it's a great
song it has this delicious musicality
that starts simple and build to this
glorious triumphant Crescendo which is
meant to represent the experience of
merging with the love object
you can definitely get wrapped up in
this song and you can also clearly see
the solipsistic nature of love in its
lyrics
as I argued in a previous episode
romances for men romantic love was
really invented by lower status men for
lower status men so that they might be
able to compete with higher status men
in the sexual Marketplace for women
because they didn't have the resources
and the status and the opportunity that
most women are looking for in their
Partners they invented an intangible
romantic love that they argued was even
more special and valuable than all of
that mere stuff

[02:00]
that mere stuff
it's kind of a spell that romantic
lovers attempt to cast over their love
objects however it's a tenuous fragile
spell that can really be broken at any
time
so romantic love actually works only to
the extent that the Romantic lover
succeeds in drawing the love object away
from anything that would remind her
essentially that the emperor has no
clothes
listen to the lyrics of this song
will do it all on our own we don't need
anything or anyone would you lie with me
and just forget the world
forget what we're told let's waste time
Etc
I mean there are so many lyrics in this
song that suggests that the singer the
Romantic protagonist is sort of
attempting to draw the woman away from
the world into this little Universe of
two where everything that we need is in

[03:02]
two where everything that we need is in
each other's eyes forget about
everything else look only at me
it's a hypnotic spell
whose objective is to lure the love
object away from anything that could
break the spell
and the music helps that objective
immensely however the spell is
completely broken if you just read the
lyrics matter of factly divorced from
the smoke and mirrors that make them
feel emotionally true
here's a question for you if you were
living a great life if you had a lot of
meaningful relationships and fulfilling
work and an enjoyable lifestyle
if you were successful in the broadest
possible sense of the word
would you want to forget the world and
leave it all behind
of course not and the people who have
those things as a general rule don't
want to forego the lives that they've
built and that's also why they dispense
with romance they have tangible things
that people
culturally want

[04:01]
culturally want
so they don't need intangible things
that they need to convince people they
want
this is why romance is generally a
strategy for those who can't compete
successfully in the world yet
a group that is overpopulated by young
men
it's very very hard to be a young man in
this world let me tell you they're
incompetent and inexperienced so men
can't do anything with them and they're
poor and low status so women don't want
anything with them no young man is the
king
and if they can't rule in the real world
one of their sexual strategies is to
kind of hypnotize women with the fantasy
of romantic love into following them out
of the real world and into the universe
of two
where he can be king do you understand
now the goal of romance is solipsism
because it's only in a universe of two

[05:00]
because it's only in a universe of two
that is a universe without competition
where the lower where the lover popper
can be king
let that sink in
