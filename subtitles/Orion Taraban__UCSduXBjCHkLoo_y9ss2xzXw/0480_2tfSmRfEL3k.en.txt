how does one resolve impostor syndrome I
think the way to resolve this feeling is
to understand it for what it really is
namely a bid for reassurance when we
enter into a new role or a new position
of responsibility the vast majority of
people reasonably want to know whether
they are meeting expectations they lack
an internal capacity to evaluate their
own performance and often times in the
beginning external feedback isn't
necessarily forthcoming on some level
it's entirely reasonable to seek out
reassurance especially when you haven't
yet internalized the standards or
expectations of that position however
the liability inherent in reassurance
seeking is that it tends to cultivate
dependence which frustrates the
development of authentic confidence the
way to navigate this is to establish as
quickly as possible and as objectively
as possible these standards of
performance try to make these standards
objective and behavioral as opposed to
subjective and psychological
