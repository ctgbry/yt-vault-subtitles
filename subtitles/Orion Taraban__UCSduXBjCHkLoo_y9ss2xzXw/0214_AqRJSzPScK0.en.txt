in my video the balance of the
attraction victor asks is it better for
one gender to be the adored
this is a touchy question i think it's
completely appropriate and reasonable
for both men and women to occupy both
positions the adored and the adorer that
said in general i think women are more
comfortable in the position of the
adorer
why is that because as you recall from
our discussion the person that
positioned the adorer has more of an
emotional experience he or she has more
intense and frequent emotions
especially compared with the adored who
generally has a more stable equilibrated
experience and what i've found though of
course there are individual differences
women tend to enjoy being within their
emotions
more than men and i found it that women
generally find it more difficult to
abide in a relationship if they don't
have that emotional experience
