The man asks, "What do you want to have
for dinner, sweetie?" And the woman
responds, "hm, I don't know. What do you
want to have for dinner?" Now, the man
being a man takes this question at face
value and typically begins to list off
places that he wouldn't mind eating at.
That's what she asked him, right? But no
matter what he comes up with, it seems
the woman finds a reason to reject his
suggestion. And this of course tends to
make the man frustrated as from his
perspective, not only is the woman being
of no help whatsoever, she is actively
being a hindrance in the service of his
goal until finally the man out of
options and increasingly exasperated
might suggest a restaurant he thinks the
woman might want to eat at. At which
point she will respond, "Well, if that's
where you want to go, let's do it." All
of this is to say that the optimal
outcome in the woman's mind is that you
have deployed sufficient resources to

have deployed sufficient resources to
accurately predict what she wants to
have for dinner. And that this
prediction is presented as being
isomorphic with your own desires, which
increases her pleasure and relieves her
of reciprocity. Now, this might not be
entirely conscious, but my point is that
the women are right. All of this is
better than simply getting what you ask
for.
