What are your thoughts on monogamy? This
conversation around how
men were men and women weren't
necessarily monogamous when before the
idea of marriage and all these things
were created. What What are your
thoughts on monogamy as a concept?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it doesn't seem like very many
people, men or women, are really
programmed to be strictly monogamous.
Monogamy does seem to be more of a
cultural invention. We don't see it
practiced among more primitive tribes.
that still exist in like Papa New Guinea
or the Amazon rain basin. There's a
really great book that explores a lot of
this further called Sex at Dawn that I
would highly recommend if people are
interested in this. If I remember
correctly, according to the
anthropologists, our two closest primate
ancestors are chimpanzees and bonobos.
And we're kind of like more or less
halfway in between these two species.
And these two species can't be more
different with respect to their sexual
practices. Chimps are very hierarchical.
They're super aggressive. They often are

They're super aggressive. They often are
territorial,
do a lot of mate guarding, and because
they're very hierarchical, few high
status ma males control the vast
majority of the females. And so only a
few different males get to reproduce on
some level. Bonobos are totally
opposite. They they have like they don't
have a hierarchal society. They have a
horizontal society. And they all the
time. It's like they have sex to say hi.
They have sex to say bye. They have sex
to say I'm sorry. It's like it's a form
of communication that exists in this
species and it serves a lot of different
functions besides reproduction. In
particular, it serves the function of
like cementing bonds in the relationship
network of that uh community. And humans
are kind of halfway between these two.
So, we're kind of halfway between kind
of like free love and very organized
limited sexual practices. Let's put it
that way. I think I got this right.
