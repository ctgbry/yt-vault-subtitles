I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycats
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the part
that women always leave out so what is
this referring to this is referring to
women's answers to the question
what are you looking for in a man
I've listened to a lot of these
responses in my life and what do they
typically sound like I want somebody
kind somebody who makes me feel safe
somebody who's emotionally supportive
somebody who wants a family somebody
honest and loyal and committed
Etc
leaving aside the fact that and is
expensive all this sounds reasonable
enough right however it turns out that
this response will like really messes
with men's Minds
but before I back up that claim please
take a moment to like this video And
subscribe to this channel thanks less
than a second cost you nothing and
probably Burns a calorie here too so do
the thing
the fact of the matter is that there's

[01:00]
the fact of the matter is that there's
an important part that women always
leave out when they answer this question
and this emission really confuses men
because if you're a man and you listen
to this answer sincerely you might think
well geez
I'm loyal
and I'm caring and I'm honest and I want
a family
aren't I what women are looking for
and of course these men typically are
not what women are looking for because
they're the ones asking what women are
looking for however they could be right
about all the other stuff they could
actually embody the traits listed by
these women
so what's the issue
here's part that women leave out the
part that is really important for men to
hear women do
want all of those things but they want
them from the men they are already
attracted to
sounds obvious but the inclusion kind of
makes a big difference women are not

[02:01]
makes a big difference women are not
listing the factors that cause them to
be attracted to some men over others
they are listing the criteria that
motivate them to choose some attractive
men and not other
attractive men
they assume attraction and maybe believe
it socially unacceptable to say so
explicitly but there it is
and this understanding has two really
important consequences first it should
drive home that female attraction is not
based on the things that women
explicitly list as criteria in partner
selection remember they want these
things from men they're already
attracted to which means that the
attraction comes first
before they know whether the men in
question possess these sought after
traits
almost every woman has had a sexual
relationship with at least one man who
has not been loyal
or kind or emotionally supportive or

[03:00]
or kind or emotionally supportive or
family oriented or any of the things
that they claim that they're looking for
because they made the decision based on
their attraction which logically could
not be based on traits that were not
present
and here's the second consequence men
with this understanding your Prime
objective
should be to become attractive
to become a man that women are attracted
that's how you get your foot in the door
and the good news is it's really good
news that most of the things that
actually relate to female attraction are
things that you can learn and develop
these are things like being physically
fit knowing how to dress learning the
art of charming conversation choosing a
life mission attaining success and
picking up some game
these are things that women respond to
and these are also all skills that you
can learn and they all benefit you
directly with the indirect benefit of

[04:02]
directly with the indirect benefit of
making you more attractive to women so
