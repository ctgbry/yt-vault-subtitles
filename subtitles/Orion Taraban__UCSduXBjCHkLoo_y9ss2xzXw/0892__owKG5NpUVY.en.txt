The part that women always leave out is
you ask women what they want. They say
they want a kind man. They want a loyal
man. They want a man to treat her like a
queen to adore her. But the part they
leave out is they want all of those
things from a man they're already
attracted to. And they've already
decided to be attracted to that man
without knowing yet whether he's kind or
loyal or devoted. So attraction isn't
actually predicated on those things.
It's predicated on other things. And so
as a man, we need to say that part out
loud to other men and say, "You need to
work on becoming an attractive man." and
the other stuff can come later because
if you prioritize the one ahead of the
other, you're not going to get anywhere.
But what I do find is men are quite
delusional about that. They like, I
think she's really into me. I can just
tell, right? They want to believe a
woman is far more attracted to him than
she truly is. And they will ignore all
the signs and take take the tiny tiny
glimpses of hope that she's attracted to
him. And I think that's a recipe for
disaster for men when they misread a
woman's signals of attraction. Well,
sure, if you're used to not eating at
all, even crumbs taste delicious, right?
