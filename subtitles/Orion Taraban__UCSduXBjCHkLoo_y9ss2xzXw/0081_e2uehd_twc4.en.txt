i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
if you're going to cheat
indulge
so we often have these very high
standards for ourselves
standards that are almost always
bolstered by some kind of should based
belief i should work out more i should
work on my side hustle i should go out
more etc
and ultimately over a long enough
timeline the vast majority of us are
going to experience some lapses
when for whatever reason
we didn't quite rise to the level of our
self-imposed standards of behavior if
we're on a diet we cheat therefore in an
exercise regimen we sleep in if we're
building a business we play video games
and so on and there's nothing inherently
wrong with any of these behaviors
however it's generally the case that
when we suffer these lapses we tend to
feel guilty and to beat ourselves up
and this sort of puts us in a no-win
situation
if we do what we should do well we

[01:00]
if we do what we should do well we
typically don't derive much pleasure
from doing so we were just doing what we
were supposed to do and no one gets a
gold star for doing what they're
supposed to do
so in this case we generally don't
secure a positive as much as we avoid a
negative that is when we do what we
should do we can avoid feeling guilty
which let's be honest isn't very
compelling
and of course if we don't do what we
should then we feel bad as a result
and this robs us of any pleasure we
might experience from the laps so it's
kind of the worst of both worlds i mean
what's the point of cheating on a diet
with some chocolate cake if you don't
even get to enjoy the dessert
so this is what i'm getting at if you're
gonna cheat indulge
take pleasure in your cheating luxuriate
in your laziness enjoy your
procrastination
or else you're robbing yourself of the
one benefit associated with your
ineffective behavior
and if you think that you won't be able
to allow yourself to indulge or if the
temporary pleasure isn't worth the

[02:01]
temporary pleasure isn't worth the
long-term consequences
then don't cheat
or else you're robbing yourself the
goal-oriented benefits of your effective
behavior
refrain and pat yourself on the back
or indulge and revel in the satisfaction
but don't cheat and feel bad about it
where's the fun of that
i mean the pleasure is pretty much the
only thing that makes the cheating
worthwhile without it you're just
self-sabotaging
and if you're gonna do that you might as
well get something out of it no matter
how ephemeral and disappointing that
something might be
so if you're gonna lapse give yourself
permission to shamelessly and
guiltlessly enjoy what you're doing and
if you can't do that don't do it
