I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why most
relationships don't last
this episode is specifically directed to
folks out there who are looking for a
long-term relationship but seem to be
having trouble getting past the six
month Mark you get involved with someone
you like things seem to be going well
but then a few months in the
relationship Peters out you go your
separate ways why might this be the case

the reason why most relationships don't
last why most relationships do not get
past the sixth month mark
is the crisis of disillusionment
let me explain what this is
in the beginning
all relationships are fundamentally

[01:01]
all relationships are fundamentally
projected fantasy in the vast majority
of cases you don't actually know who
this other person is you've spent a few
days or even just a few hours together
gleaned a little information and filled
the gaps in your knowledge base in with
what you would like to find there and
this is true almost in direct proportion
to the degree to which you are attracted
to the other person the more attracted
you are the more likely you're going to
fill in the gaps in your knowledge base
with positive attributes this is called
the halo effect
this means that if you think she's
really hot you're off and you have no
other evidence to the contrary you're
also liable to believe that she's kind
and smart and sexy and interested in you
and all the things that you would like
to see in this other person and if you
think he's really handsome you're liable
to filling the gaps in your knowledge
base with the projection that he's also
committed and kind and family oriented

[02:02]
committed and kind and family oriented
and exciting and generous and all the
things that you might be looking for in
a partner you understand
now in the first few months while people
are generally still projecting their
fantasies they will also work to protect
their fantasies
they see signs that things might not be
what they appear to be but because they
prefer the fantasy to which they are
attracted they tend to rationalize and
minimize these signs early on in the
courtship this is why people will so
often ignore even obvious red flags when
they are very attracted to another
person
but here's the thing
it eventually happens that a
preponderance of evidence accumulates or
an unavoidable manifestation of evidence
to the contrary presents itself
and the projected fantasy can no longer
sustain the assault of reality
this is the crisis of disillusionment at

[03:02]
this is the crisis of disillusionment at
this point the fantasy is shattered the
spell is broken and you begin to see
with Clear Eyes the person who's
actually standing in front of you now
this probably doesn't mean that this
person is bad or evil or that this
person wouldn't be a good partner for
you all things considered but it is a
kind of fall because no one will be able
to live up to your projected fantasy of
an ideal partner
and this can be very disappointing and
demoralizing for folks especially those
who are most interested in limerence the
feeling of being in love
and who are chasing the Romantic ideal
of love and partnership
these folks really can't sustain this
crisis but all relationships have to
pass through the crisis of
disillusionment at some point or another
and the question at this point becomes
okay now that we kind of know more about

[04:00]
okay now that we kind of know more about
who we actually are and what we're
actually dealing with
is there enough left for us to build a
relationship upon in reality and there
might be and there might not be but this
is when the work of building a shared
vision of the future actually begins
everything up to the crisis of
disillusionment is really just a Prelude
to the actual relationship
