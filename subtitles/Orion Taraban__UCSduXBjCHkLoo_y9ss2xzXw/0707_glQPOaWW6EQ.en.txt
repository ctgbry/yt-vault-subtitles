I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
privilege of losing you might have done
a double take at this title after all
isn't privilege a good thing and isn't
losing a bad thing like how could it be
good to lose I'm so glad you asked it
turns out that there are actually a host
of secondary gains associated with
losing that can actually make it rather
difficult for certain people to succeed
and I'm going to be talking about some
of those gains today let's get to it the
fact the matter is that anyone who is
interested in actually winning in life
and attaining their goals and achieving
success must be willing to pay the costs
associated with doing so as I've
discussed in a previous episode one of
these costs is overpaying basically in
order to win you typically have to pay
more more in terms of time energy money

[01:02]
more more in terms of time energy money
effort and sacrifice than your
competition either can or will as a
consequence you will likely go above and
beyond the value of whatever you hope to
secure but there might not be a way
around that overpaying is the cost of
winning and the more competitive the
field the more you will likely have to
overpay however there is another cost
that must be paid in order to win on
some level the cost of winning is the
the willingness to sacrifice the
privilege of losing and many people who
have yet to achieve success often are in
their situation because consciously or
not they are not yet willing to
sacrifice this privilege and there are
actually many dimensions of this
privilege first and foremost the
privilege of losing is sympathy in
particular and emotional support in
general winners might get the money and

[02:00]
general winners might get the money and
the women and the fame but it's the
losers who get the sympathy and the
support and the compassion it takes a
lot to win winning is generally
associated with a great deal of pain and
struggle and sacrifice now you might
think something like well boo [ __ ]
who like those athletes and celebrities
and executives are certainly compensated
enough for their troubles I don't want
to hear their SOB stories about how hard
their lives are and I would say thank
you for proving my Point that's exactly
right once you become a winner for
better or worse you cannot reasonably
expect sympathy or understanding for
your suffering and sacrifices and this
is because whether it's true or not
people believe your success should be
sufficient
compensation now as a therapist I
understand that these two things are
almost completely independent of each
other like there are successful people
in mental anguish and unsuccess
uccessful people in mental anguish and

[03:01]
uccessful people in mental anguish and
there are successful people who are
peaceful and happy and unsuccessful
people who are peaceful and happy but
this is not the general comprehension
and this is why winning can be a lonely
and isolating place as they say misery
loves company and this is because
suffering is functionally universal
whereas success is not many people can't
sympathize with success even if they
wanted to because they haven't yet
experienced it
and even more are prevented by their
Envy from even making the attempt and
many people would rather suffer in
company then succeed all on their own
which is why many people actually
sabotage their own progress so that they
don't outgrow their current
relationships winners also generally
have to relinquish emotional support
winners are celebrated at the moment of
winning but from that point forward most
people are going to be rooting for the

[04:00]
people are going to be rooting for the
Challenger like only a very small
contingent of fans in Kansas city is
interested in seeing the chiefs with
their third straight Super Bowl the
longer you're on top the more attractive
the underdog becomes the underdog who
remains the underdog as long as he
doesn't win is always the more romantic
cause it's not necessarily the more just
or virtuous cause but it's certainly the
more romantic cause
because and it then becomes increasingly
associated with the Positive attributes
of that projection this means that
winning actually means the willingness
to forgo those romantic associations and
being the option that works is generally
not as attractive as the option that
should
work if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book The value of others over the course

[05:01]
book The value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback format
the links are in the
description another privilege of losing
is the ability to focus hopefully on a
future goal that has yet to be attained
once you win however your focus
generally shifts from attaining to
maintaining which isn't nearly as
exciting or emotionally compelling like
once you're the champion there's kind of
nowhere to go from there there is a
limited upside and a very significant
downside and this can be boring on the

[06:02]
downside and this can be boring on the
one hand and terrifying on the other
it's actually hard for people to
tolerate these emotional realities on
the other hand if you're the loser or at
least if you haven't yet won you have a
limited downside and a very significant
upside striving toward that goal can
provide meaning and purpose and
fulfillment you can also successfully
delude yourself into thinking that
you'll somehow be happy or complete or
Justified when you achieve that goal on
the other hand those who have achieved
their goals only to discover that they
after some time are just as unhappy
incomplete and unjustified as they were
before may not have recourse to a hope
that may protect them from that
experience and this is precisely when a
lot of successful people start to go off
the rails they can no longer believe
that their happiness is on the other
side of their success and since they
know no other place to look come to

[07:02]
know no other place to look come to
believe that life must be devoid of the
possibility of happiness and
increasingly act in line with that
belief once more winning is associated
with a good deal of pressure and
responsibility and
accountability few people hold losers
accountable we kind of think that
they've suffered enough as if
accountability is somehow throwing salt
in their wounds SP spoiler alert it's
not and losers who avoid accountability
are often maintained in their
difficulties longer than necessary as a
consequence of these good intentioned
sympathizers those who have not yet
attained success can also more easily
delude themselves into thinking that
they could handle the pressures and
responsibilities of success better than
those who actually won the world is full
of armchair quarterbacks who know
exactly how they would handle being in
the pocket which is doubtful at

[08:02]
the pocket which is doubtful at
best finally winning can completely
destabilize your life this is often why
people self-sabotage when they are on
the verge of success the prospect of
attaining that reality becomes too
vertiginous and disruptive their
Lifestyles their relationships even
their self-concepts might be completely
upended if they were to suddenly emerge
into a higher Social stratum so they
consciously choose to snatch defeat from
the jaws of success preferring instead
to abide in the hope of winning in the
future rather than navigate the reality
of winning in the present this also
allows them to believe that they could
have won if they really wanted to and to
comfort themselves with the sympathy and
condolences of those around them many of
whom are secretly relieved or even
satisfied to have seen them
fail my point is that there are actually
any privileges to losing and in order to

[09:02]
any privileges to losing and in order to
win people must typically make a
conscious sacrifice of these privileges
but in my opinion it just might be worth
doing so why not explore the limits of
that which you are truly
capable what do you think does this fit
