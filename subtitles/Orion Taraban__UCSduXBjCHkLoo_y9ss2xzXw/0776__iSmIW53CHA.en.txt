so the more needless that you are the
more that I think you can indulge in
love the issue is that like I talk about
in the book people functionally enter
into relationships to exchange things
that they need and the less you need the
more relationships become kind of a
luxury like it's based on uh a desire
you don't you could kind of take them or
leave them which generally means that
you will transact fewer of those
relationships because they certainly
involve some sort of expense or
opportunity cost so most people who are
needless say if it happens it happens
and if not I'll be fine right so I think
that's part of why we see fewer
relationships being transacted is that
people are actually doing better in
industrialized world and we don't need
each other quite as much as we used to
now let's say that even in this relative
needlessness you're able to meet another
person and you form an authentic
emotional connection with them that over
time blossoms into love well now you
kind of do need them you kind of do need
them because it's going to sound weird
but you can get addicted to good things
