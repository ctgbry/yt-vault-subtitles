I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is your
money's no good here this is an episode
specifically for very successful men
time and again in my practice I've seen
them run into this issue further down
the line in their relationships it has
to do with maintaining a woman's
interest longterm which can be very
difficult to do and very risky too given
the fact that women tend to be loyal to
their feelings not to their duties let's
get into it as I've previously discussed
when it comes to women the past is
prologue For Better or Worse everything
you have given a woman already no longer
matters if she walks today she takes
with her everything that you've already
given her the only thing that she can't
take with her is that which she wants
from you and doesn't yet have this means

[01:02]
from you and doesn't yet have this means
that on some level the secret to
long-term relationships and this is
actually true for both men and women is
to keep coming up with new things that
the other person wants or needs that you
have some measure of control over
providing the game is never ending and
it doesn't run on gratitude it is what
it is the issue is that this requires
some tact and strategy if you dangle a
carrot for too long people will
eventually become frustrated and leave
so you kind of do have to eventually
give what the other person desires that
is if you have any Integrity whatsoever
if you withhold it past a certain point
you're not going to be able to continue
to do business with each other on the
other hand if you just give the other
person everything that he or she wants
then you succeed in making yourself

[02:01]
then you succeed in making yourself
irrelevant and obsolete very very
quickly your business is concluded and
no one continues to pay the
plumber now as a man the more successful
you are the more you can afford to give
and this means that you can kind of
stretch out the relationship longer than
a less successful man and this is a huge
relief to successful men because what do
successful men have a lot of they have a
lot of money but they don't have a lot
of time or bandwidth so securing a
relationship with a woman with things
that can be bought is kind of a
successful man's fantasy all he has to
do is write a check or put his credit
card down the transaction takes a little
off the top of the resource he has in
most abundance so he's very happy to do
so he might not even notice the
expense but here's the thing well there

[03:00]
expense but here's the thing well there
are many things that women want that can
be bought there aren't an endless supply
of these things and these things become
less valuable to a woman the more she
has them this means that
eventually men run out of things to buy
like there are only so many beach
bungalows you can go to there are only
so many Michelin star restaurants you
can dine at there are only so many
handbags you can own and each of these
things becomes less valuable to a woman
in direct proportion to the degree to
which she already has them and she might
already have them because you gave them
to
her this means that you devalue any
particular resource the more you provide
it which is why what works with women is
diversity of
experience if you just keep providing
the same thing over and over and over
again it lose its value this is the law

[04:02]
again it lose its value this is the law
of marginal utility applied to
intersexual relationships for instance
irrespective of her professed
materialism a woman is much more likely
to value a designer handbag if she
hasn't got one than if she has 50 like
if she already has 50 the 50 First isn't
going to matter all that much the need
or desire Satisfied by the first 50
handbags reduces the perceived value of
the 50 first regardless of its price tag
make
sense in any case the issue that very
successful men encounter in their
long-term relationships is that they run
out of things to buy and if they're not
careful at this point the woman will
take the last thing from him that he's
in a position to give namely a severance
package to prevent this outcome the man
has to continue to offer things that the
woman desires and doesn't yet have and
and this is possible but it's only

[05:02]
and this is possible but it's only
possible through
affection if you appreciate the insights
on this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description so what is affection
affection is something that all women
want from the men they want it from and
it technically doesn't cost any money to
give that said while it doesn't cost

[06:01]
give that said while it doesn't cost
money affection absolutely costs time
effort and attention or to put it
another way it costs the resources that
successful men have in greatest scarcity
and this is both why women tend to Value
affection so much and why men are so
loath to give it they would much prefer
to just throw some money at the problem
but as we'll see this isn't really
possible
here affection is the effective
evocation of emotional
experience having money will facilitate
your ability to do this but it isn't
technically
required the issue is that evoking an
emotion is generally a very personal
process what will emotionally resonate
with any particular woman tends to
depend on her specific personality and
interests and preferences when it comes
to affection nothing works on everyone
and figuring out what works on a
particular woman requires Ires time and

[07:01]
particular woman requires Ires time and
attention as a man you kind of have to
play detective you have to spend time
with her and listen to her yes but even
more you have to look for Clues
affection requires you to read between
the lines to listen to what is not said
and make reasonable inferences which is
why it's a huge pain in the ass some of
you out there will conclude that it's
not [ __ ] worth it and that's your
right it might not be worth it in your
particular case but there's no way
around it if you want to provide
affection you're going to have to put in
the time and
energy the idea here is to use her words
and interests and preferences to deduce
how best to cultivate a relevant
emotional experience for instance
tracking down a beloved childhood toy
that she mentioned in passing over
dinner 6 months ago might actually be
more valuable to her than a diamond BR
the toy might only cost a couple of
bucks but if you're right she will value

[08:01]
bucks but if you're right she will value
it more than the jewelry something like
that will resonate with her emotionally
because it demonstrates that you're
paying attention and women think that
means you care of course it doesn't
necessarily mean that but they think it
means that and you kind of have to pay
in the coin of the realm in fact this
isn't really unique to women all people
men and women tend to Value what they
can't buy as their possessions increase
that's kind of why citizen Cain wants
his childhood sled at the end of his
life sorry to spoil it but you should
have seen it by now people who can buy
anything no longer want the things that
money can buy they want the experience
of Joy they want the experience of
Freedom they want the experience of
Simplicity they want the experience of
Wonder they want the experience of
Innocence they want the experience of
peace they want the experience of
Mystery they want the experience of

[09:00]
Mystery they want the experience of
danger and there are different ways to
cultivate these experiences based on the
particular individual individual you
happen to be dealing with but figuring
out the specific way to do this will
require time attention and
effort in any case it's through the
provision of affection that men can
continue to maintain a woman's attention
and loyalty long term even after he's
bought her everything she could possibly
desire that can be bought what do you
