I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to be
impeccable with your word
so it's very important to learn how to
Marshal your language cleanly clearly
and effectively ultimately you can
arrive at a place of impeccability with
your word it's pristine it's true and
it's binding
now there are two easy ways to get
started on the path towards
impeccability I practice these myself
and have been doing so for years
first practice is to never say something
about somebody else that you wouldn't be
willing to say to their face
let's be honest we talk about other
people we talk about our friends we talk
about our family we talk about
celebrities we talk about all kinds of
people when they're not around
and if you're talking to somebody
you're talking about somebody in a way
that you wouldn't have the courage to
talk about them looking them dead in the
eye
you shouldn't be flapping your gums my

[01:01]
you shouldn't be flapping your gums my
friend
even if you think you'll never meet them
even if they're already dead and gone
just don't do it if you're not willing
to say it to their face
then whatever you're about to say is
either not your real opinion or it does
not carry the strength of conviction
which means you're not really in
alignment with yourself when you talk
like that
so anytime I find myself speaking about
somebody else a third party who's not
present I imagine that they're actually
sitting right next to the person that
I'm talking to
and this is useful because generally
what I do say about other people behind
their backs tends to get back to them
and I might eventually be in a situation
where I will have to be willing to
repeat my comments to their face
now keep in mind that I'm not saying
that you have to say nice things about
everybody certain people I would have no
problem telling off
but I have to make that decision
consciously and if I do say something
about somebody else I have to sort of

[02:00]
about somebody else I have to sort of
expect that it will eventually get back
to them okay so that's the first
practice
the second practice to help you towards
impeccability is to never say something
that you wouldn't want quoted in the
newspaper
don't use words don't use phrases don't
use language that if it were quoted in
the newspaper or put on the 10 o'clock
news or released for the entire world to
see on the internet that you would feel
embarrassed that people knew that you
spoke that way and I don't mean just
people in general I mean your third
grade teacher your priest your
grandmother would these people be
embarrassed on your behalf to learn
that's how you speak in private
in this practice you move toward an
ethical way of speaking by reducing the
difference between your public and
private speech this cultivates Integrity
now again this doesn't mean that you
have to be nice all the time but it does
kind of force you to speak more

[03:00]
kind of force you to speak more
intentionally because by saying anything
at all you run the risk of disagreement
offense and conflict
and if you're voicing opinions that you
would subsequently retract under social
pressure
then you really had no business voicing
those opinions in the first place did
you
by standing with your word you may need
to make a stand further down the road
so don't talk in a way that will
embarrass yourself if your words were
universally known
okay so those are my two tricks to get
started towards impeccability never say
something about somebody else that you
wouldn't be willing to say to their face
and never say something that you
wouldn't want quoted in the newspaper
