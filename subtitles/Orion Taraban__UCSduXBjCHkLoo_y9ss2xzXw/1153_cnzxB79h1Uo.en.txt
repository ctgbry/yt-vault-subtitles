Your question is why do people continue
to invest in dysfunction relationships?
&gt;&gt; Bad investments, broken relationships.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I think there's a couple of
reasons. One is one that I think that
Adam was mentioning earlier is that
people can become addicted to even
dysfunctional relationships. In fact, it
might be easier to become addicted to
dysfunctional relationships on some
level. And that disregulation that
occurs in the withdrawal and the
satisfaction of that craving creates a
very powerful bond between two people.
We commonly call that a trauma bond.

sunken cost fallacy. People think of all
of the time and energy that they've put
into this one relationship. They've
built a story together such as it is.

idea of starting over at that stage of
life with the available suitors in the
sexual marketplace might be more
distasteful than the current
relationship they find themselves in.
You know, it might be a dysfunctional
relationship, but it's their
dysfunctional relationship.
