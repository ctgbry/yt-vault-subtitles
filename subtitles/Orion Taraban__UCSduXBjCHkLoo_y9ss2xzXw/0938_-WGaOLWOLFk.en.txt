To the human animal, pure freedom is
isolating and vertigenous. That's why in
Nichzche's thus spake zerahustra, the
protagonist lives in a cave at the top
of a mountain. At such heights, the air
is clean and bracing, but life is cold
and stark at elevation, which is why
most people don't live there. They live

structure is to resist adopting an
externally imposed one long enough to go
through the difficulty and expense of
building such a structure for yourself.

building such a structure for yourself.
And most people, for a variety of
reasons, are unwilling to do this. The
majority of men are not going to have
the patience, the discipline, the

own internally extrapolated structures.
And since all men cannot long tolerate
freedom, this means that these men will
need to adopt an externally imposed
structure or risk being annihilated one
way or another. In this way, I think we
can consider that marriage is actually
useful to a lot of men in precisely the
same way that the army is actually
useful to a lot of men. It's kind of
strange to equate the two, but they're
more similar than we might
