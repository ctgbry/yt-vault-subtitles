probably for the first time in human
history in most western societies
childless women under 30 are earning
more than childless men under 30 all
this success does come with an
unintended consequence with respect to
the dating market and before the women
complain well who cares about dating let
me just say that you should care about
dating Because unless you want to go
back to your father choosing your
husband for you this is pretty much the
only Pathway to long-term relationships
marriage and children so what is the
unintended consequence in order to
understand it you first have to
appreciate that women tend to date
hypergamous women tend to marry men who
are older taller stronger higher status
and higher earning and here's the rub if
women are outperforming most men and
women continue to date hypergamous then
voila you have an increasingly shrinking
pool of men that the majority of women
would even consider as candidates for
dating and May
