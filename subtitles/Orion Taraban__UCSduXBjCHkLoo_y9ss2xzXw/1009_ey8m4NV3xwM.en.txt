Like it or not, when a man is
involuntarily celibate, what is he
necessarily doing? Well, among other

respecting the foundations of civil
society. He is choosing to frustrate his
will rather than impose it on another.
and we're like collectively agreeing
that that is something to be mocked and
derided because that is the real

does not come down to those who are
rebuffed and those who aren't. As I've

those who aren't. Like if there has ever
been a man who has never been an incel,
