i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
persona 5 and social stats
so this is going to be another pop
psychology episode in which we turn our
attention to the very excellent video
game persona 5. this game is so good and
so psychological that we could probably
get hundreds of hours of content
analysis out of it
i played it for the first time earlier
this year and i can safely say that it's
one of the best role-playing games i've
played in my entire life highly
recommended
now the persona series does so many
things uniquely within the context of
the genre of role-playing games
and today i'd like to talk about one
such unique element and its significance
for real life
now in all role-playing games your
characters have stats
however these are usually very basic
stats and related to combat things like
hit points and strength and vitality etc

[01:00]
hit points and strength and vitality etc
now persona 5 has those basic stats but
it also has social stats which pertain
to your social competence in the real
world of human relationships
specifically persona 5 has five social
stats knowledge
guts
proficiency
kindness and charm
and i think they're fairly orthogonal
for example having a lot of knowledge
wouldn't necessarily make you very kind
and vice versa
now as you move through the world of the
game
your character encounters social stat
gatekeeping
which basically means that if your
relevant stats aren't high enough you
can't do certain things like work
particular jobs or enter into specific
relationships with people and this is
absolutely the case in real life
you can't be a cowardly oaf and
successfully ask out the popular girl
you can't be an incompetent idiot and
get into medical school it's just not

[02:00]
get into medical school it's just not
possible to seize certain opportunities
if your social stats aren't high enough
now in the game your character's social
stats all start at level one which i
think is also fairly true to life
while there is some room for individual
difference
we all more or less start life as
charmless selfish incompetent cowardly
idiots
so for you younger listeners out there
take heart you're not alone we all
basically enter into society at level
one
however with sufficient effort and
experience we can eventually become wise
brave
capable compassionate and charming
individuals
and how do we do that
well like in the game
it largely depends on how you choose to
spend your time
certain activities among other more
tangible rewards will increase specific
social stats
while other activities will just cause

[03:00]
while other activities will just cause
the time to pass
which stats you increase will depend on
the activity and no activity will raise
all the stats simultaneously
this means just like life
you need to make choices about your
priorities about the aspects of your
personality that are relatively more
important to develop
now in the game there are many
activities that will raise your social
stats and these also mirror real life
however two primary ways to raise your
stats are by consuming art like reading
books or watching movies and by working
part-time jobs which require you to
serve other people in some capacity
hanging out with your friends and having
new experiences can also do the trick
basically the way that you spend your
time will impact your social stat
development
and as your social stats increase you
will gain access to more and better
opportunities more and better jobs and
more and better relationships
so this is something we can examine in

[04:00]
so this is something we can examine in
our own lives how are we spending our
time
are we using our time to level up to
intentionally develop certain attributes
or are we simply allowing the time to
pass
without a doubt
time in persona 5 like life
is by far
our most precious and limited resource
so let's make sure that we're spending
it wisely
i hope you enjoyed this talk in the
