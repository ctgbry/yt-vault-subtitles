I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
all men pay
now as we'll see how much they pay
depends on a few different factors
however when it comes to women
all men pay one way or another
there's this fantastic scene in the
movie Jack Reacher where Jack played by
Tom Cruise is approached by a very
attractive young woman in a bar I'll put
a link to the scene in the description
below she makes it very clear that she
would like to leave with him and he
replies that he can't afford her
when she indignantly responds that she's
not a hooker he replies that well then
he really can't afford her
and this exchange makes people laugh
because like all good jokes there's some
truth to it
in general when it comes to women the
more transactional the relationship
the less you actually pay
this is because like if we're talking

[01:01]
this is because like if we're talking
about literal prostitution men in these
situations only pay with money
on the other hand if you're dating for a
committed relationship you're generally
paying with time with attention with
exclusivity with compromise
and with money
and there is never any guarantee of sex
so while you technically might be
spending less money on a date than you
would on a prostitute the value of all
the other things you could be
surrendering for seeking sex in a
relationship is likely collectively
greater than the difference in the
financial transactions
the upshot is if you're a man you will
have to pay to access the opportunity
for sex one way or another and that's
just the way it is
however there is a silver lining here
which is that the price of that access
is inversely proportional to the
particular woman's interest and

[02:01]
particular woman's interest and
attraction
this means that the more she likes you
the greater the discount you will
receive though it will never be entirely
free
a woman who is very very attracted to
you will make it cheap and easy to
access her time and will clear the way
to access the sexual opportunity
the flip side of this is that the men
who pay the most
are the ones that women are interested
in the least
let me say that again The Men Who pay
the most are the ones that women are
interested in the least
and to the extent that men want to be
with women who want to be with them
this means that the higher the price the
lower the rational basis for paying it
this is because the more you pay the
less you get what you want

[03:00]
less you get what you want
and though this is sad it kind of makes
sense if a woman isn't authentically
interested in a man if she's not very
attracted to him then she will need to
be compensated in other ways in order to
stick around
as I've previously explained women treat
men the way men treat jobs
if the compensation at a certain company
is not the highest which all of the
things being equal make it an
unattractive option for a potential
employee
then this company will generally have to
provide a number of other perks and
privileges to compensate for that lower
salary
maybe they offer work from home or
unlimited PTO or on-site training or
exposure opportunities or health
insurance
Etc whatever it is they will have to
give more to compensate for their lower
salary
and all of those perks are actual costs
for the potential employer by the same
token men who are not as attractive to a

[04:01]
token men who are not as attractive to a
specific woman end up paying more in
terms of indirect costs and intangibles
in order to secure the same opportunity
does that make sense
this means that as a man if you want to
have more affordable access to women
your primary consideration should be
increasing your overall attractiveness
this is because attractiveness allows
men to access the same sexual
opportunity at a discount
this will likely mean investing time and
money into cultivating this dimension of
your presentation however you're going
to be paying either way and if this is
true it makes more sense to pay into
self-investment than into any given
sexual opportunity
now before I go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this video to someone
who might benefit from its message it's
Word of Mouth referrals like this that
really help to make the channel grow you
can also hit the super thanks button
it's the three little dots in the lower
right hand corner and tip me in
proportion to the value you feel you

[05:01]
proportion to the value you feel you
derive from this episode because it's
those donations that make all of this
possible I really appreciate your
support
now this perspective can be difficult
for some men to understand because a lot
of men have this belief that all women
want relationships
this belief is less true than the
complementary belief that all men want
sex which is not entirely true but is
mostly true
it's going to sound strange to some
women out there but a lot of men believe
that a you want a relationship with
every man you sleep with
and B that you only sleep with men with
whom you're in a relationship
and neither of these things is true
however these beliefs are a big part of
why a men you're not sleeping with are
trying to get you into a relationship
because they think they are giving you
what you want in exchange for what they

[06:01]
what you want in exchange for what they
want I.E sex and B men you do sleep with
ghosts you after you sleep with them
because they think that you'll want to
tie them down forever if they ever see
you again
the belief that men just want sex isn't
true because
despite the fact that men's standards
are generally pretty low they do still
have standards this means they are going
there's going to be a lot of women that
they're legitimately not going to be
interested in sexually
it's also true that the women that men
would be interested in having a
relationship with are a subset of the
women that men are interested in
sleeping with
similarly the belief that women just
want a relationship isn't true because
in general women have extremely high
standards for their relationships
and this is true God help me
even if they are not the most attractive

[07:01]
even if they are not the most attractive
women like I've met sixes with higher
standards than nines
which just like a local bakery with high
prices and mediocre pastries makes me
wonder how they stay in business
in any case it's also true that the men
that women are interested in having a
relationship with are a subset of the
men that women are interested in
sleeping with
despite men's beliefs of the contrary
women do not just want a relationship
with anyone and everyone and every woman
is not actually trying to lock you into
a relationship
by default
all things being equal whether a woman
desires sex and or a relationship from
any given man depends on two factors his
value and his attractiveness
value means things like his net worth
his social status and his lifestyle
attractiveness means his physicality his
sexiness and his Swagger

[08:02]
sexiness and his Swagger
we can visualize these in a two by two
Punnett square like so
as you can see if you're an attractive
high value man women will likely desire
a relationship with you but if you don't
want one they'd be willing to offer you
sex
on the other hand if you are an
attractive low value man they'd be open
to a sexual relationship and if you're
an unattractive high value man they will
be open to the possibility of a
relationship but sex will likely be an
infrequent occurrence and of course men
who are neither get nada
make sense
the point here is that as a man it is
entirely possible to secure sexual
opportunities with women without paying
all the direct and indirect costs
associated with a relationship however
you still will have to pay something and

[09:02]
you still will have to pay something and
you will need to be attractive
