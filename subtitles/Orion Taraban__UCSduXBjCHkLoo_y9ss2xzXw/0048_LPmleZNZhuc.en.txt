i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
never reject yourself always force other
people to reject you this is extremely
important
a lot of people miss out on all kinds of
interesting and rewarding opportunities
whether they're romantic or professional
because of the lack of self-confidence
in their ability to perform
it is not for you to decide what is
valuable to somebody else
it's not even for you to decide what
would be sufficient or adequate for
somebody else
when you reject yourself you're
basically saying i already know what
works and what doesn't work for you
and i've judged myself negatively
relative to those projected standards
consequently i'm either going to drop
out entirely or volunteer the
information that will allow you to
evaluate me as negatively as i evaluate

[01:02]
evaluate me as negatively as i evaluate
myself
secretly of course the hope is that the
other will accept me anyway
and i will be able to secure the
opportunity with a clean conscience and
a divestiture of responsibility
for instance i might have a hunch that
i'm not exactly what an employer is
looking for in an employee
maybe i don't have exactly the
experience the company is looking for
however if i say that in a job interview
and i'm accepted anyway
it's kind of the company's fault if i
don't perform on par with expectations
my conscience is clean because i didn't
lead anybody on of course saying
something along those lines in a job
interview is an excellent way to be
rejected for a position
and i could very well have been mostly
what the company was looking for
but because of my self-rejecting
disclosures everyone kind of loses as a
result
it's kind of like poker man
you see your cards

[02:01]
you see your cards
nobody else does
you could be looking at your hand and
you have a 2-7 man i got a handful of
nothing but if you fold your hand out of
your own hopelessness without anybody
calling or raising then you've
completely eliminated the chances of a
successful outcome however slim you
perceive such an outcome to be
maybe the situation will change on the
flop
maybe the situation will change because
other people will see that you've hung
on that long and they'll begin to doubt
their own hands as a result like man he
must have something or else he would
have given up by now
you don't need to have pocket aces to
win a poker hand you just need a better
hand than everybody else at showdown and
most hands never even get to that point
a high card can win a poker hand so you
don't have to optimize you don't have to
be the best and you certainly don't have
to fold your own hand even if there's a
low chance of success very

[03:00]
low chance of success very
very important to keep in mind
don't ever undercut yourself don't ever
reject yourself
always force other people to expend the
energy to reject you
and if that's not happening if you're
not being actively rejected assume that
you're good enough
assume that you're good enough until you
receive feedback to the contrary
