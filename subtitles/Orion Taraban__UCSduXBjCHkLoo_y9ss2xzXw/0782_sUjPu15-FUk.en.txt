I'm here to tell you that things like
peace and contentment and
self-actualization and love require a
significant effort from us to attain
this is what I call wrestling with the
angel the angel as a symbol being the
benefactor of real goodness and value to
humanity there's a story in the Bible
about Jacob he meets an angel who starts
to fly off to heaven and before he can
get away Jacob grabs him tightly and
says to him I'm not letting go unless
you bless me and does the angel bless
him F no this is because the Divine is
not Santa Claus and it's a good thing
that's not the way reality works I
shudder to think how decadent and
degraded the human race would become if
everything of value were available on
demand in any case the angel tries to
shake Jacob off the two are wrestling in
midair which at this point has become
Mortal Combat since Jacob would not
survive a fall from that height however
it's precisely this willingness to go
all in that gets results
