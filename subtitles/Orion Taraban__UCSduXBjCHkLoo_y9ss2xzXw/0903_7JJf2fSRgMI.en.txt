There was a good book written by Sodto
Beck called nothing special which I
think is at the heart of Zen because on
some level if nothing is special then
everything can be but if some things are
special then clearly some things are
not. Walking on water is miraculous but
the fact that watering exists at all is
not that's just water. It's like really
you don't find water miraculous well no
it's just hydrogen and oxygen molecules.
How the those things exist? And why do
they form that particular covealent bond
at that angle which causes ice to float
instead of sink even though it becomes
more dense? Like there's so many things
we we just take for granted because
they've they've always been a part of
our conscious experience that we think
that they are the same as consciousness.
I feel like it it's like we have been in
this constant process of stripping the
magic out of the world by giving
everything names and we think we
understand it, right? So, so for
example, the placebo effect is basically
magic. You have this person who has some

magic. You have this person who has some
insane burning nerve pain. They say,
"Oh, my pain is at a seven out of 10."
They give him a substance. There's
nothing in it, just sugar water or
something. They say it's a very powerful
anesthetic. And then he says, "Oh, that
really worked. My pain's at a two out of
10." And they look at his brain and and
it actually reflects someone who, you
know, he they took a brain scan before
and after and he's literally has less
pain. But then we say, "Oh yeah, that's
a placebo effect. It's not magic.
