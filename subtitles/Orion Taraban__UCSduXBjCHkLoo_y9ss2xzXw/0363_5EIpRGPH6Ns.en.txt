means different things to men and women

today I'll be putting the concept of
loyalty through the same treatment turns
out that men and women can both be very
loyal though in very very different ways
but before I get into it please remember

plans all right so how is loyalty
different between men and women well one
is about as loyal as another though to

[01:01]
is about as loyal as another though to
different things
the thing to understand about woman's
loyalty that men often fail to
appreciate is that women are loyal to
their feelings
for instance if a woman is completely in
love with a guy if she is 11 out of 10
attracted to him then her loyalty is
impressive indeed and she will remain
loyal as long as those feelings remain
in her heart
a woman who is extremely attracted to a
man will move across the world for him
we'll change her religion for him we'll
break with her family for him will I
cheat and steal for him and will help
bury the body with him if necessary
a woman at that level of attraction is
ride or die and she will do absolutely
crazy irrational and life-altering
things for a man to keep him in her life
it's both impressive and terrifying how
loyal a woman can be under the right

[02:00]
loyal a woman can be under the right
conditions
of course the caveat is that when that
feeling shifts when the attraction dips
when the love disappears then so does
the Loyalty so if you're in a
relationship with a woman
and you want to enjoy her continued
loyalty you have to approach her
differently than you would another man
that is well the best way to secure
loyalty from a man is through a solemn
and honorable agreement or understanding
the best way to secure loyalty from a
woman is to continually do the things
that encourage her desire and attraction
to remain at a very high level
you get loyalty from women indirectly
through attraction
but if you succeed in doing so the
results are significant and reliable so
what about men
the thing to understand about men's
loyalty that women often fail to
appreciate is that men are loyal to
their duties

[03:01]
their duties
that is men understand that loyalty is
The Honorable fulfillment of a solemn
oath
these Concepts Duty oath honor are not
feminine Concepts I've personally never
heard a woman talk about her Duty ever
I'm sure that such women exist somewhere
but my hunch is that where they do
they're probably in very masculinized
environments like the military
Duty Oaths honor these are masculine
Concepts they don't really exist in the
feminine world
and within the construct of Duty and
honor feelings are absolutely irrelevant
you do your duty regardless of how you
feel if you took an oath to hold the
line you are not allowed to run away
just because you now feel afraid such a
man would be branded a traitor and a
coward and would be dealt with very

[04:00]
coward and would be dealt with very
harshly in masculinized environments and
the thing about Oaths is that you only
have to take an oath once
it's like a contract it's signed once
and then remains in force indefinitely
until such day that the contract is
amended through mutual consent of both
parties
as a result of the oath men reasonably
assume that no further action is
required in order to expect the faithful
execution of Duty and this is how men
tend to approach their relationship
commitments with women it's like
I said I do at the altar what more do
you want or what do you mean you can't
break out of our oath just because your
feelings have changed and the liability
with this approach for men is that they
can often end up in relationships where
really all they have left is their Duty
and they spend the remainder of their
lives with someone they don't love or
with someone who stopped loving them

[05:01]
with someone who stopped loving them
long ago in those situations it's like
the only thing these men have left is
the fact that they never broke their
commitment which is a pretty dry and
empty Victory kind of like fighting for
a country that no longer exists this is
certainly not what we should be striving
for in our personal relationships so
what's the upshot well we should now be
able to appreciate that folks get into
trouble when they unreasonably believe
that the other sex should adopt their
own Sexes conceptualization of loyalty
this is tantamount to thinking that
women should be men and men should be
they aren't and I see no good evidence
to justify the belief that they should
be
men and women are different and Viva la
deferrals
on the other hand appreciating those
differences should allow both men and
women to have more harmonious and
satisfying relationships with one
another
finally we can see that women have an

[06:02]
finally we can see that women have an
opportunity to learn from men and men
have an opportunity to learn from women
so what can women learn from men well
women can learn to honor their
commitments irrespective of their
emotions that's important
and what can men learn from women well
men can learn to find more joy and
pleasure in discharging their
commitments which is also important the
union of those two things the joyful
execution of our duty is actually the
ideal situation
and I contend that that is what we
should all be striving toward
what do you think what does loyalty mean
