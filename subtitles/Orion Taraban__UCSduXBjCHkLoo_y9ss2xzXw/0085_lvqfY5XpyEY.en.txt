i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the importance of small wins
sometimes we're subject to passing
through difficult moments
when it feels like we're being hammered
on all sides
our relationships aren't going well our
job is on the rocks our friends and
family seem to be distant or conflictual
nothing really seems to be going our way
and it's moments like these when
protracted that can lead people into
increasingly hopeless and despairing
states
in these situations it's very very
important to maintain a humble
perspective
to look for your wins at a lower
advantage than you typically do
this means temporarily lowering your
standards with respect to what
constitutes a victory
for example sometimes it's a victory to
just get through the day
just to survive one more day without
killing yourself i mean let's be real

killing yourself i mean let's be real
sometimes that's how it is
sometimes the victory is that you got
out of bed
sometimes a victory is that you
fulfilled your minimum requirements you
don't always have to exceed expectations
sometimes just meeting expectations is a
win
sometimes it's the ability to enjoy a
simple pleasure like eating your
favorite food or playing a video game
without beating yourself up about it
these small wins are important
they're like the stars in the night sky
they don't provide a lot of light but it
would be really dark without them
the key to appreciating small wins is to
resist the critical voice in your head
that will judge you contemptuously for
temporarily lowering your standards
that voice is not your friend and is not
aligned with your best interests in fact
it may simply be a manifestation of
certain depressive elements and should
be treated as such
so
look for small winds
keep your eyes down
maintain a humble posture and focus on
the stars they provide at least some
