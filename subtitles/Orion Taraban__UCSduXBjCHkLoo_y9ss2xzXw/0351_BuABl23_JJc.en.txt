approaching women is like getting into a
cold pool why is that well when you're
at the edge of a cold pool
every cell in your body
resists what you are about to do you
don't want to get in that pool it's
going to be painful it's going to be
uncomfortable no part of you that's warm
and dry wants to get into that pool and
then you jump in you override that
reluctance and it's uncomfortable it's
maybe distressing
and if you can hang in there for about a
minute you get used to it it's okay
approaching women is the same thing on
the verge of going up to her you're
going to feel a lot of reluctance and
resistance and anxiety and you're going
to override that with your will
and in that first minute you might say
some awkward things it might be
self-conscious it might be painful it
might be a rocky back and forth but if
you can hang in there for about a minute
if you can have a few back and forth
with a woman
things tend to feel much better
