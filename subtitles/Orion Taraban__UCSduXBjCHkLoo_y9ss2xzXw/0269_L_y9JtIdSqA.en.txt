i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychs
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is humanity
changes slowly if at all
this is something that is useful to keep
in mind in the modern age when social
and technological changes have swept
across the world and is at an
historically unprecedented rate
it can sometimes feel as though humanity
as we know it is becoming increasingly
unrecognizable with each passing year
however this isn't actually the case and
before i explain why please remember to

there are many new ideas circulating
about how human beings should live and
how they should organize themselves and
these new ideas are facilitated by an
almost miraculous global technological
apparatus which accelerates the whole
process dramatically

[01:01]
process dramatically
however as complex as modern society
seems to be it is still a collection of
relationships between and among
individuals so much of what is true
about relationships remains true about
society
now it's sometimes the case that folks
can get into really passionate hot and
heavy relationships in a matter of weeks
they're declaring their undying love for
each other and naming all of their
unborn children and just when it seems
as though they're on the cusp of some
great and perfect union a few weeks
later passion burns out
usually in some spectacular
conflagration
in relationships it's easy come easy go
the ones that burn the hottest and
brightest are often the ones that burn
for shorter amounts of time
by the same token belief systems can
sometimes be pre-potent and predominant
in a short amount of time but like their
passionate romantic counterparts they
often don't last for very long
maybe a few years maybe a few decades

[02:01]
maybe a few years maybe a few decades
the soviet experiment for example lasted
69 years a blink of an eye in the
history of humanity which is hundreds of
thousands of years old in its most
mature evolutionary state
to be sure these passionate political
flames can burn fiercely and create a
great deal of destruction but they can't
sustain themselves by virtue of their
very intensity
there seem to be limits on how quickly
humanity can change
the fact of the matter is that humanity
changes slowly if at all
and this is largely due to the fact that
some problems of existence cannot be
solved and therefore will always demand
much of our time energy and attention
these includes the imperatives of
biology and the necessities of survival
the criteria for emotional well-being
and spiritual fulfillment also don't
really change from year to year
as they are deeply connected to the
human organism
these things cannot be dispensed with in
favor of ideology for it to preserve

[03:01]
favor of ideology for it to preserve
ideology must accommodate itself to
these realities
for example
the human race is always at most 50
years away from extinction
if no further children were born today
humanity would be functionally extinct
in 50 years and that's a maximum
projection
keep in mind that the bloodiest and most
destructive conflict in the history of
the world happened only 75 years ago
that there are people who are alive
today who still remember what that was
like
we are not an enlightened race
our institutions our social cultural and
political institutions are not as
permanent as they appear
but the problems that they albeit
imperfectly attempt to solve
are
issues of survival aggression scarcity
well-being are always with us and always
will be with us
acknowledging these realities might
spare some of the devastation wrought by

[04:00]
spare some of the devastation wrought by
the passion for change
but if they don't remember that they too
will burn themselves out
oh snail
climb mount fuji
but slowly
slowly
hopefully that makes sense did you
