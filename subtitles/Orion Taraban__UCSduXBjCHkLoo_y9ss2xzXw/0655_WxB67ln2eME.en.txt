many years ago a mentor of mine was
consoling me after a heartbreak he he
told me Orion a woman is like a tsunami
when she leaves she takes everything
with her I can't remember if I laughed
or not because uh it might still have
been a little too close to home but the
man had a point women are generally the
ones to leave they disproportionately
initiate breakups and divorces and when
they leave they can take a lot with them
and this means like a responsible
Gambler you can't ever give them more
than you can afford to lose I don't just
mean this from the perspective of
resources though that is certainly
important but I also mean this from the
perspective of your emotional investment
it's important to protect your heart if
you go all in emotionally then you're
going to be completely devastated when
that relationship ends and trust me you
don't have unlimited emotional resources
it's very difficult if not functionally
impossible to go all in emotionally more
than a few times in your life
