I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is divide
and conquer
so this episode will be a little
different because this is a sponsored
episode I will be reading an email that
I received from one of my listeners and
then I will be sort of riffing off the
cuff on my ideas pertaining to this
topic so this email comes from Blair d
and his email in part at somewhat long
but I'll keep all the important parts in
um reads my name is Blair I'm in Seattle
I am 100 on board with your Channel's
mission to reduce the amount of
unnecessary suffering in the world
one of the ingredients for doing so that
I find compelling involves building
Greater support within institutions
governments non-profits philanthropy
Academia for tackling problems that boys
and men disproportionately struggle with
I believe there is great need for that

[01:00]
I believe there is great need for that
work and I'd like to see it carried out
with an attitude of compassion and
empathy for males as opposed to the
blaming and shaming we too often see I
understand you accept episode
sponsorships might you be interested in
doing an episode on the need for
institutions which have explicitly been
empowering women and girls for decades
to add to their purview some work on
improving the well-being of boys and men
uh okay uh so yeah I'm gonna do this
episode right now
um Blair also provided a few other
pieces
um of uh let's say evidence one of them
was a link to Washington State House
Bill one two seven zero
which he says that he is the person
behind and which has garnered
sponsorship from three Democrats and
four Republicans I assume that means in
the uh I don't know which house but the
state legislature of Washington

[02:00]
state legislature of Washington
um so it has some bipartisan support for
this bill and this bill is basically
advocating for the creation of a
commission in that state to
um research study and inform other
governmental institutions about some of
the issues faced by boys and men
as far as I can tell from reading the
bill it
in terms of the nuts and bolts it
Advocates the establishment of one
full-time
salaried position in the state
government to do this there will be a
budget that's applied by the government
approved by the legislature and also it
can Garner its own funding in other ways
this is also in
a larger commission environment that
includes a woman's commission an lgbtq
commission a human's Rights Commission
and other commissions he didn't and the
bill doesn't go into the other ones but
apparently there are many many
commissions that do something similar

[03:01]
commissions that do something similar
with respect to identified populations
uh attached to the email was a
PowerPoint presentation talking about
some of the issues that men and boys
disproportionately suffer with
I don't want to get too far into the
weeds but there's many of them
the vast majority of homeless people are
men probably a two to one ratio that
goes up if they are unsheltered homeless
19 out of 20 imprisoned people are men
nine out of 10 jailed people are men
nine out of ten of the youth in juvenile
Rehabilitation are boys uh then boys
drop out of high school twice as often
as girls uh
four out of five youth victims of
suicide are boys nearly that much and
adults are are men
um most missing persons are men most

[04:00]
um most missing persons are men most
victims of violent crime are men most
homicide victims are men
um most death from overdoses of all
types are men
um especially alcohol and opioid
overdose overdoses
um
they are disproportionately affected by
the people hurt and killed on the job or
in military deployment
um and a lot of the research suggests
that
boys Fair far worse in single-parent
households than girls do
which is something that's interesting
this is also in conjunction with the
fact that everyone knows is that on
average men die six years sooner than
women do what's up with that
um
and since a lot of these are
psychosocial issues you might expect
there to be a psychosocial intervention
but the vast majority of social workers

[05:02]
but the vast majority of social workers
and mental health workers and
psychologists are female in my own
personal training when I was in grad
school I think about 85 percent of my
cohort was female
um and I think about 80 of the
counselors in the Bay Area are women
um it's one of the reasons why I decided
to focus on um a male population for my
clinical work when I went into private
practice six years ago
um I think that
just like there are some issues that
women understandably would feel more
comfortable talking to other women about
there are many issues especially with
respect to anger sex power
shame
vulnerability that men might be more
comfortable speaking to other men about
I certainly find that to be the case
personally
um so there's a lot of issues that men

[06:01]
um so there's a lot of issues that men
face and
this person was has attempted to push
through this bill to establish this
Commission on men and boys it was
endorsed among other people
uh by who is it Richard Reeves Richard
Reeves has garnered some publicity
recently he's on the book circuit
podcast circuit because he wrote a book
called of boys and men
which basically approaches the idea that
the reason why
addressing men's issues in our society
seems so fraught is because it seems
like there is this General assumption
that these things are a zero-sum game
and if we take money and if we give
money and attention to men's problems it
means taking money and attention away
from women's problems and the whole
thesis of that book is that's not
necessarily true anyway uh he also
linked me to a Blog which informed me

[07:00]
linked me to a Blog which informed me
that for the second year in a row uh
this house bill would not be heard on
the floor or the legislature so I don't
think it was even put up for a vote for
the second year in a row and apparently
there was no reason offered as to why
that is despite bipartisan
um support and the two lead authors
being women
so that's sort of the that was a kind of
a long
intro to to this talk so I'll I'll be
brief
um
what do I think about all this well I'm
not surprised
um honestly I I don't think that men's
issues do Garner a lot of sympathy and
support and
in many respects that's why I don't talk
about them very much I don't know if
that's a silencing principle but it
seems to be like just sort of barking up
the wrong tree is that the way it should
be probably not is that the way the
world kind of operates right now

[08:00]
world kind of operates right now
absolutely
now why do I think that is that's why I
named this episode divide and conquer
because in thinking about my response to
this I was reminded about
some of the ways in which
[Music]
um
divide and conquer in a social
population is used as an instrument of
social control
I think I was first introduced to this
idea in high school when I read Howard
zinn's people's History of the United
States
where he talked about a lot of the
racism in particular in this country is
not so much racism as it is disguised
classism
and he gave a lot of examples of how a
lot of the the pre-existing power
structures throughout American history
have fomented racial hatred especially
between poor whites and poor blacks and
the reason for that is if those poor
folks could see that they had more in
common than not than their sheer numbers
might be a threat to the prevailing

[09:02]
might be a threat to the prevailing
power base of that society and so
they fomented racial hatred so that
these two folks who again might have
more in common than not didn't join
forces to disrupt the pre-existing power
structure and I think uh
what's going on more often in today's
day and age is a divide and conquer
strategy with respect to men and women
and I think that in general women are
seeing men more and more as the enemy
and increasingly men are seeing women
more and more as the enemy and I think
that this prevents people humans who
might have way more in common than you
might think from joining forces and
examining where is this really coming
from who benefits from turning men and
women against each other who benefits
from

[10:00]
from
um men being weakened on a social level
and
I don't think it's women
like women maybe benefit that from that
in a in the most immediate or
superficial way but in the long run that
can't possibly benefit women
for for men to be weakened
um that reduces
very you know in the medium term they're
they're dating and mating prospects
which has important long Downstream
consequences for society and I think
that also changes when a lot of women
become mothers especially mothers to
Sons
um so I think that a lot of this
uh disregard for for males issues is
part and parcel to a divide and conquer
strategy to turn women and men against
each other
that will maintain the pre-existing
power structure in important ways
so that's kind of my response to this

[11:02]
so that's kind of my response to this
um
if you like what you heard then you
might
consider sending this episode to someone
who might benefit from its message
because it's Word of Mouth referrals
like this that really help to grow the
channel and if you've listened thus far
