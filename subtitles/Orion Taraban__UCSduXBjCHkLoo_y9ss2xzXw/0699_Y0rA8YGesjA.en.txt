I'm Dr Orion terband and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is saying
the quiet part loud in this talk I'm
going to explain why many of my ideas
about relationships tend to rub people
the wrong way there is a rule concerning
relationships and this is true
irrespective of the type of relationship
under consideration and the rule is that
the core transaction at the heart of the
relationship ship should not be
explicitly discussed and while there are
some reasons why this might be the case
this prohibition gives rise to a lot of
the difficulty and the confusion that
people are subject to encountering in
relationships of all kinds this is
especially true for sexual relationships
there is more euphemism and indirectness
and deceit in this type of relationship
than in any other kind of relationship

[01:01]
than in any other kind of relationship
between human beings like we're not even
supposed to say sexual relationship
we're supposed to say romantic
relationship as if every couple that
does so after a candle it dinner
in any case it might be too much to
start with sexual relationships so I'm
going to start with a type of
relationship that people are more
comfortable discussing professional
relationships and work over to sexual
relationships once I've laid down the
analogy all right let's get to it in a
professional relationship the core
transaction at the heart of the
relationship is the exchange of labor
for
money if that exchange occurs you have a
professional relationship if that
exchange does not occur you do not have
a professional relationship the exchange
of labor for money is both necessary and
sufficient for a professional
relationship that said even though every
single person watching video understands

[02:01]
single person watching video understands
that people go to work in the morning
because they want to get paid in the
culture of
professionalism this is not something
that anyone is supposed to draw a lot of
attention to and the reason for this
rule is simple it's designed to protect
the Dignity of those
involved let's say that you're a
prospective employee who sits down with
a corporate executive for a job
interview even though you both know that
you are attemp to exchange your labor
for money if that executive were to
start that interview by saying look we
both know why you're here you just want
to get paid how would you respond like
it's actually a fairly awkward situation
you might say something like
well I mean yeah but you know that's not
the only reason why I'm here like of
course a paycheck sounds really nice um
but I was attracted to your mission and

[03:04]
but I was attracted to your mission and
your
culture and I have a lot of passion for
this line of work so I would say yeah no
[Music]
yeah and of course if the roles were
reversed and you the applicant came
right right out of the gate with so how
much does this position pay best of luck
to you like you didn't play the game and
kiss the ring it may even offend the
Dignity of the executive who might
prefer not to think of himself as buying
an often substantial portion of a human
being's life to increase the
profitability of his
organization the rule governing
professional relationships functionally
dictates that the exchange of money
should be the last thing on the minds of
two people who are only talking to each
other out of their mutual interest in
exchanging money for labor I mean many
job openings won't even publish the

[04:01]
job openings won't even publish the
compensation along with their
application requirements which is
actually pretty wild if you think about
it now here's the thing because we're
not really allowed to talk too much and
too directly about the core transaction
at the heart of professional
relationships we tend to give a lot of
attention to other things that sound
professional is in order to cover over
the fundamental exchange things like
managerial impact and organizational
culture and team building and quality of
life perks and leadership styles etc etc
it's not like these things aren't useful
or impactful in professional
relationships in their own right it's
just that they're not nearly as useful
or impactful in professional
relationships as labor or
money now what can unfortunately occur
as a consequence of our Collective
refusal to say the quiet part loud is
that people can actually start to

[05:00]
that people can actually start to
believe that the professional
that is used to protect the Dignity of
the people involved and of which we hear
so much is really important and that the
core exchange at the heart of the
relationship of which we hear very
little isn't or shouldn't be very
important at
all now this is kind of harmless and
ineffective when prospective employees
fall for this they just tend to get
passed over for the position however
it's completely ton deaf when the
executives buy their own we
heard this a few years ago during the
hiring difficulties following the
shutdowns I don't understand why no one
wants to come back to work we have bean
bag chairs and we have a welcoming and
inclusive corporate culture and we have
a family-like environment and we love
and believe in our teams I I just don't
get it and of course the question is

[06:01]
get it and of course the question is
what were you
paying especially in light of inflation
and the relative success of work from
home were you offering less money for
more effort could
that possibly be the issue I don't know
maybe like I understand that paying
people more money doesn't solve all
employment problems but it will solve a
lot of employment problems and that's
because this strategy relates not to the
but to the core transaction at the heart
of the
relationship if you appreciate the
insights on this channel I would highly
encourage you to get your hands on a
copy of my book the value of others over
the course of 432 pages I delve deep
into my economic model of relationships
and explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice

[07:00]
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description great now let's segue over
to sexual relationships hopefully the
digression into professional
relationships will make this fairly
simple in a sexual relation ship the
core transaction at the heart of the
relationship is the exchange of sex for
resources this is why people don't just
have sex indiscriminately they have sex
with those who can give them more of
what they want if that exchange occurs
you have a sexual relationship if that
exchange does not occur you do not have
a sexual relationship the exchange of
resources for sex is both necessary and
sufficient for a sexual relationship

[08:00]
sufficient for a sexual relationship
that said even though every single
person watching this video understands
that people go on dates because they
want to get laid in the culture of
courtship that is not something that
anyone is supposed to draw a lot of
attention to and the reason for this
rule is simple it's designed to protect
the Dignity of those
involved let's say that you're a man who
goes out with a woman on a date even
though you both know that you are
attempting to exchange resources for sex
if the woman were to start the date by
saying look we both know why you're here
you just want to get
laid how would you respond it's actually
a fairly awkward situation you might say
something like
well um I mean
yeah but you know that's not the only
the only reason I'm here like of course
I would like to

[09:00]
I would like to
make love when I when the time is right
I mean uh obviously uh but I'm also
attracted to your personality and your
intelligence and I'm looking to find a
true partner with a real connection so I
would
say yeah no
yeah yeah and of course if the roles
were reversed and you the man came right
out of the gate with so how
much best of luck to you you didn't play
the game and you didn't kiss the ring it
almost certainly would offend the
Dignity of the woman who might prefer
not to think of herself as selling
access to her body as a means of
securing commitment provision and
resources from a man the rule governing
sexual relationships functionally
dictates that sex should be the last
thing on the minds of two people who are
only talking to each other out of their
mutual interest in exchanging sex for
resources which is actually pretty wild

[10:02]
resources which is actually pretty wild
if you think about it now here's the
thing because we're not really allowed
to talk too much and too directly about
the core transaction at the heart of
sexual relationships we tend to give a
lot of attention to other things that
sound
relationshippy in order to cover over
the fundamental exchange things like
Love Languages and attachment Styles and
emotional vulnerability and shared
interests Etc ET Etc it's not like these
things aren't useful or impactful in
sexual relationships in their own right
it's just that they're not nearly as
useful or impactful in sexual
relationships as sex and
resources now what can unfortunately
occur as a consequence of our Collective
refusal to say the quiet part loud is
that people can actually start to
believe that the relationshipy
that is used to protect the Dignity of
the people involved and of which we hear
so much is really important and that the

[11:03]
so much is really important and that the
core exchange at the heart of the
relationship of which we hear very
little isn't or shouldn't be very
important at all when we refuse to talk
about the exchange of sex for resources
at the heart of sexual
relationships and instead insist on
talking about the exchange of love in
romantic relationships then really the
only possible remedy for relationship
issues is to love more or love better
good luck with that now this is kind of
harmless and ineffective when men fall
for this they just tend to get passed
over however it's completely ton deaf
when women buy their own
I don't understand why I'm
having trouble meeting men I mean I'm
offering a genuine emotional connection
I'm a success F and independent woman

[12:01]
I'm a success F and independent woman
I've been to therapy I'm an effective
Communicator I'm ready to find my person
and go on my last first date I think I'm
catch I just don't get
it and of course the question is how
attractive is your sexual
opportunity could that possibly be the
issue I don't know
maybe like I understand that giving men
access to more and more attractive
sexual opportunities doesn't solve all
dating problems but it will solve a lot
of dating problems and that's because
this strategy relates not to the
but to the core transaction at
the heart of the
relationship when we only talk about the
designed to protect people's
dignity we lose sight of what's really
bringing people together and what brings
people together is ordinarily not very
Noble or high-minded and this actually
creates a lot of opportunities for

[13:00]
creates a lot of opportunities for
undignified behavior in the sexual
Marketplace because you can't solve core
problems with Solutions you can
only solve core problems with core
Solutions so if you're having issues in
your relationship you might want to look
at the fundamental value proposition the
fundamental transaction in almost every
case the dissatisfied partner believes
that he or she is giving more than he or
she is getting why would that be the
case if relationships weren't
transactional check it out for yourself
