I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why nice
guys finish last so this will be a
continuation of my previous episode
entitled women want it all so if you
haven't watched that already you should
start there in that episode I discussed
how according to the research while
attractive women want everything they
don't want everything equally and
apparently among the attributes they are
most willing to dispense with in their
potential partners are intelligence
loyalty and kindness today I'm going to
explain why nice guys smart loyal and
kind guys finish last or which is really
just the other side of the same coin why
women love now it's not
actually true that women love
but I'm going to explain how this belief
originated using conclusions from the
research but before I do so please

world so really thanks for your help
so
guys I'm gonna help you understand why
it's not actually true that women love
to do this let's entertain a
little thought experiment let's say you
could work at two different companies
okay at one company you would have this
really awesome boss
like the boss really cares about you
supports your goals invests in advancing
your career understands when you need to
take time off and values your
perspective I mean this boss has all the
best intangibles okay so that's one
possibility
however at the other company
you would have a boss who frankly
doesn't give a about your dreams
and your goals and is really just
interested in using you for the labor
that you can provide

[02:00]
that you can provide
but he pays you three times as much
gives you unlimited time off and offers
an amazing benefit package
which company are you going to work for
the vast majority of folks are going to
be willing to put up with this boss not
caring about them if they got everything
else they wanted for the job
they're not choosing the job because the
boss is an
they're choosing the job because the
salary and benefits are best
the fact the boss there just happens to
be an is incidental
I hope this is starting to make sense
okay so by their own admission women are
not prioritizing kindness loyalty and
intelligence in their search for a
partner just like you're probably not
going to prioritize say a company's
mission statement in your search for the
job it would be great
if you aligned in that respect but it's
not going to be your highest or even one

[03:00]
not going to be your highest or even one
of your highest priorities
women are going to go with the most
attractive compensation package and it's
for them to decide what constitutes the
most attractive compensation packages
ultimately this means they typically end
up at the high paying second company
and what happens to the bosses at the
first companies around the world these
bosses can't offer a competitive package
based on what women actually value this
means they can't compete in the looks
department they can't compete in the
income department they can't compete in
the provision department they can't
compete in the emotional connection
Department
so what do they do they focus on the few
departments in which they can compete
successfully with the second boss in an
effort to feel superior to the men that
the women actually choose as a means of
assuaging their egos
and what are some of these departments I
don't know maybe

[04:00]
don't know maybe
kindness intelligence and loyalty
you know nice guy traits
however if we actually take the results
of this study at face value women don't
care about these things nearly as much
as they care about other things my dude
it is what it is the idea that women are
choosing men who are is really
a consequence of an unwillingness to
look at why women actually choose men
without judgment or moralizing they're
not choosing my friend they're
choosing good looking High earning
interesting and exciting lifestyle
providers
and if they happen to be loyal and
intelligent even better but they're not
actually sorting for those things
primarily do you understand fighting
against this constitutes a failure to
look at the way things actually are when
people do this they move further and
further away from reality making it less

[05:02]
further away from reality making it less
likely that they're going to get what
they want hopefully that clears a few
things up
