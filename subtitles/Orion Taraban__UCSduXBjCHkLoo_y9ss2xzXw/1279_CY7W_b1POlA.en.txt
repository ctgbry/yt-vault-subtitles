I had an episode on this a long time
ago. I think it's called the truth about
rejection. And I talk about how people
generally have a very incorrect view of
rejection in general. They think it's
painful. They think it's personal. They
think it's permanent. I call it the
three Ps. And it's actually none of
those things. Uh rejection is just
information. And the more that you can
think of it almost like binary code
where a yes is a one and a no is a zero.
you're just getting data from the
environment and that data can actually
help you improve your chances of getting
incrementally closer to the one to the
yes then you can you can treat this like
a game people often don't like it when I
talk about relationships being games but
also games are fun um games are people
play all kinds of games for fun they
generally make our days livable and and
worthwhile and when people approach
things as a game they can have fun they
can relax then it's often easier for
them to get good at it. People can get
very good at games

very good at games
&gt;&gt; with with the rejection thing. It it
does seem so hard uh to face rejection.
What do you think are anything else to
consider when getting used to facing
rejection?
&gt;&gt; You just do it. I mean like it was
brutal as an actor. I was a sensitive
young man. And when you're acting,
you're constantly auditioning for roles
and the product that you're selling is
functionally yourself. It's how you
look. It's how you sound. Like an author
can have his book rejected. A painter
can have his painting rejected. An actor
is rejected, you And that's why so many
performers actually have stage names to
try to create some sort of psychological
distance between themselves and like the
commodity that they're selling that just
happens to look exactly like them, Hey.
