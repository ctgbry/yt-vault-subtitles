Love for me is, as I talk about in the
book, it's the humiliated self-exaltant.
For me, love is sacrifice in the service
of the loved one. And it's like blind to
self and cares only for the good of the
other. And that's extremely difficult. I
think it's kind of interesting that one
of humanity's greatest models for that,
like the person of Jesus, he only really
lived for about 3 years from 30 to 33
preaching love. And he was in the
Christian mythology. God like God could
love for 3 years and that was as much as
he could eat and he made the ultimate
sacrifice, right? [laughter] Like it's
very very hard to love. This is why it's
very to me ironic when people say that
they're looking for love. Like love is a
hard thing.
&gt;&gt; It's so worth it though.
&gt;&gt; Well, sure. Like it helped me grow up.
It helped me to mature. It helped me to
have a deeper, richer experience of self
and other and life. I'm glad I did it,
but I'm also glad to get what I want.

but I'm also glad to get what I want.
Love exists in relationships, but it's
almost like a serendipitous overlay on
top of it. And the relationships
typically aren't formed or certainly
can't sustain themselves through love
alone.
