I mean, there's lots of ways to
manipulate people. You have to be
somewhat unpredictable. You can't be
completely stochastic and random because
then it's hard to create any kind of
emotional expectation. So, manipulators,
and you can see this in the movies, you
can see this in popular literature, they
build an expectation or a pattern and
then they break it. And there's lots of
ways to do that. You can do that through
pattern disrupts which have to do a lot
of hypnotists and mentalists use these
sorts of communication techniques where
you kind of have a steady cadence or an
atonal presentation and then you break
it very quickly that inspires an
emotional reaction in people and when
you get people to start to feel they
stop critically thinking. I mean this is
something that advertisers have figured

difficult to get what you want through
direct appeal to people's logic and
reason. Advertisers used to do that

ads, they're they're horrible by today's
standards in the sense that they give
like an essay that's a reasoned argument
for why their product is superior and
explains all the great specs and
characteristics of what you might buy.
And that doesn't sell nearly as well as
some sort of emotional story that just
happens to be associated with the
product that they have on offer. Right?
You stop thinking because people don't
actually buy the product, right? They
don't buy Coke. By joy and connection.
