marriage in today's day and age is a
completely atwi relationship it does not
provide nearly the amount of security
that people somehow still believe that
it does and the default Arrangement
barring severe and documented abuse
neglect or incompetence irrespective of
the reasons behind the divorce is that
the woman receives at least half custody
of the children at least and however
that person chooses to parent the kids
when she has custody including involving
a stepfather father as long as it's not
illegal and not in violation of the
agreement is kind of none of your
business and trying to make it your
business will likely create a power
struggle that would be very difficult to
win I'd like to submit that every man
should understand that this is one of
the possible outcomes that he could face
if he decides to have children with his
wife he needs to accept the possibility
not only that this could occur but that
there is functionally nothing he could
do to prevent it should his wife one day
have a mind to behave this way
