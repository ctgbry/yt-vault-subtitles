So most of my episodes, for example, are
inspired by consultations that I do with
my patients. If I see people and the
same problem comes up over and over
again, I can assume that this is more or
less a common problem in today's day and
age. If these five people have it, the
chances are there's 50 million people
out there that are dealing with this or
a similar problem. And if the
intervention that works for these
individuals work for these five, it
might also work for a substantial
portion of that 50 million as well.
But what helps people is not factual
evidence. What helps people is not
theory divorced from practice. So the
guidelines I give are actually very
actionable. They're not theoretical.
They're not based on what should be the
case. They're based on what can actually
move the needle. And this is something
I've discovered in my own life and in
the lives of those that I've worked with
and substantiated by a lot of the
evidence base in the literature. But
rather than go down that road, I keep
things fairly conversational. I
generally riff an idea to myself,
transcribe that using AI into a

transcribe that using AI into a
document, and then spend some time
polishing the idea into a script, which
I can then present in one of my
episodes. And I think that keeps things
down to earth because it's rooted in a
dialogue that was based in real human
suffering and a desire to get out of
that and or to meet some sort of desired
outcome.
