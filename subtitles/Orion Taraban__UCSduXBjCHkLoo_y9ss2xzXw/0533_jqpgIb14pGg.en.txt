if you want to Target a certain behavior
for extinction if you want a certain
Behavior to go away you need to stop
rewarding it in the experiment the
scientists had to stop giving the rat
the food pellet in order to motivate him
to change his lever pushing Behavior
it's not functionally possible to get
rid of a behavior that you are still
reinforcing sounds obvious right but
you'd be surprised what might be less
obvious however is the method of
reinforcement not all reinforced is as
clear and explicit as a food pellet is
and if you're in a dysfunctional Dynamic
chances are good that you have been
inadvertently reinforcing the target
behavior in ways that you didn't fully
realize common types of reinforcement
that are often unappreciated are
attention interest emotion concession
time and of course giving people what
they want so that's lesson one to get a
behavior to disappear you first have to
stop reinforcing it
