I was really frustrated by this sort of
unspoken law among therapists that you
should never be directive. And I was
working with some folks who had serious
dysfunction. And it just felt so
ineffective to not be directive from
time to time. It's like the person could
have their hand on a hot stove and the
skin is searing off and a traditional
therapist be like, "For your
consideration, I wonder if you're
feeling an impulse inside of you to
potentially move your hand." The most
empathic thing to do in the real world
would be to smack that person's hand off
the stove as quickly as possible. And
that from a therapeutic perspective
might be a violation of the autonomy of
the patient. You know what I'm saying?
So I understand that it's not a black
and white issue, but I felt that if I
was waiting for the client to come to
the insight or awareness him or herself
organically, we're going to be here
three or five times longer than we need
to. And actually, is that ethical?
Especially if if I believe that there's
a more direct path to to patient

a more direct path to to patient
improvement, why not take it? says
there's enough uh disordered folks in
the world.
