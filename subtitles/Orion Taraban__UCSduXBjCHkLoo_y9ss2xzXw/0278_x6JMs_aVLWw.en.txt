in my recent short doesn't this also
apply to friendships aligned asks
basically how do you navigate one person
wanting a legal marriage and the other
wanting a life partner status and it
seemed like
you aligned were the uh one wanting a
legal marriage because you believed that
the life partner status was too vague
and open
um you also talked about raising your
children together from pre-existing
marriages so i'm just going to be kind
of real with you
personally i would not marry somebody
who was divorced
because on some level that person has
demonstrated that they were unwilling or
unable to abide by the lifelong
commitment that they made to another
person for whatever reason
so bulking at the commitment a lower
commitment when
you already were unable to reach a
higher commitment seems a little
disingenuous
