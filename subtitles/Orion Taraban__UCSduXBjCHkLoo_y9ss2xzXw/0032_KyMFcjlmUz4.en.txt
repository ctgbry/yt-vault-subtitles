I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is the
block and replace technique block and
replace is the fundamental skill in the
process of cognitive restructuring which
is a core component of cognitive
behavioral therapy it's like wax on wax
off it's the most basic technique that
undergirds the entire process of
cognitive change so what is it it's very
simple it has to be simple to be so
foundational we are subject to all kinds
of cognitions and among these are some
that are very negative and these
negative cognitions are generally
judgments about ourselves other people
in the world some of these judgments can
be automatic seemingly instantaneous and
they can occur hundreds if not thousands
of times a
day the problem with that is that while
we're free to think whatever we want
we're not free to feel however we want

[01:02]
we're not free to feel however we want
as a consequence of what we choose to
think so if our Consciousness is
inundated with negative judgments and
evaluations about ourselves in the world
how are we not going to feel negatively
in some way shape or form whether it's
Envy or despair or
outrage of course we're going to feel in
alignment with what we choose to believe
is
true so once we begin to be more
mindfully aware of the negative
judgments we're subject to experienc in
our Consciousness and we're ready to
make a change we take advantage of the
block and replace technique to do so the
first step is to block that thought to
actually say no to it either in the priv
of your own mind or even more
effectively out loud say no I don't want
to think that thought right now no
that's not
true sometimes we have to stand up to
bullies and many of our biggest bullies
may exist within our own minds remember
that our thoughts are not always our

[02:00]
that our thoughts are not always our
friends so no that's not true I'm not a
piece of I'm not unlovable I'm not
incompetent it's not true that nothing
good ever happens to me or whatever
happens to be the bent of your
particular bully okay so far so good the
second step is to replace that thought
in changing any habit you're only going
to get so far if all you're trying to do
is to not do what you don't want to do a
better strategy is to not do what you
don't want to do and replace that
behavior with something you do want to
do and the key here with respect to
cognitive restructuring is not to
replace the negative judgment with the
unrealistic positive alternative we
don't replace I'm a piece of with
I'm God's gift to humanity because let's
face it that's that's also not true but
to replace the negative judgment with
the least pathologizing explanation that
still fits the facts of reality I'll say
that again we replace the negative
judgment with the least pathologizing

[03:02]
judgment with the least pathologizing
explanation that still fits the facts of
reality so we're not going to bury our
heads in the sand and be polyana is our
explanations need to fit reality but
they need to be the least pathologizing
interpretations of that
reality and we'll know we've done this
correctly if our replacement
successfully mitigates our emotional
response reality is neutral it just is
it doesn't contain desire or reversion
approach or avoid those things live in
US reality just is what it is so we know
that we're closer to that objective
barebones reality if our models of
reality don't provoke much of an
emotional reaction One Way or Another so
for example I could say no I'm not a
worthless human being while it's true
that I've made some mistakes in the past
I'm actively working to improve and I'm
generally a good enough
person it's hard to disagree with that
statement it's much much more likely to

[04:02]
statement it's much much more likely to
be true than the initial negative
cognition it's more accurate and it's
less likely to provoke a strong
emotional response one way or another
block and replace block and replace in
the beginning you may have to do this
10,000 times a day but maybe the next
day you'll only have to do it 9,900
times a day and over time you come to
develop a cognitive habit that supports
your emotional well-being all right
that's all I have to say if you have a
topic you would like to discussed in a
future episode or would like to set up a
consultation you can contact me at psych
