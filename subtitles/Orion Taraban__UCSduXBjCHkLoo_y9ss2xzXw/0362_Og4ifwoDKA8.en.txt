I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is of cats
and cheese so this is the framework I
use to approach the construct of human
motivation basically there are only two
things that motivate Human Action cats
and cheese cheese is a reward associated
with anticipated pleasure and
fulfillment that we approach
cats are punishments associated with
anticipated pain or loss that we avoid
so if you understand the relative
intensity and distribution of cheese in
a person's awareness and the relative
intensity and distribution of cats in
the same you can pretty accurately
predict how that person will move
through life at any given moment
now before I unpack this framework
further please remember to like this

now this motivational framework of mine
has some basis in the empirical
literature researchers have long studied
maze running behavior in rats
unsurprisingly when cheese is placed at
the maze's Terminus rats tend to move
more quickly through the maze than they
do if they are simply exploring in a
non-directed fashion so rewards
incentivize approach behaviors on the
other hand when the scent of a cat a
rat's natural predator is wafted into
the maze behind the rat rats tend to
move even more quickly through the maze
than they do when they are moving toward
the cheese so punishments incentivize
avoidance behaviors and punishments are

[02:01]
avoidance behaviors and punishments are
more incentivizing than rewards and this
is because as I discussed in my episode
the balance of pain and pleasure pain is
overpowered on this planet relative to
pleasure people like rats will do more
to avoid pain than to secure pleasure
understanding this basic principle will
help you make more accurate predictions
both about your own behavior and about
that of other people
so punishments are more motivating than
rewards however to optimize motivation
you ideally want to utilize both the
fastest maze running behavior is
observed when rats are running away from
a cat and towards some cheese
and the more these things are clearly
defined and immediately present the more
powerful these incentives become
another thing to keep in mind is that in
this maze that we call life

[03:01]
this maze that we call life
there is no escaping the cats
and no avoiding the cheese
on some level cats and cheese are
inherent to the maze itself they never
disappear entirely they just change
their forms for instance some first
level cats might be the inner but the
inability to avoid the basic necessities
of life food clothing shelter this cat
can be avoided in several different ways
begging stealing or more pro-socially
performing a service for another
so the cheese here would be the money
necessary to procure those things
however once that cat is successfully
avoided another comes to take its place
a second level cat in this domain might
be
the presence of a felt sense of
financial insecurity
and this cat could be avoided in other
different ways all of which basically
involve acquiring money faster than it
is consumed so the cheese here would be

[04:00]
is consumed so the cheese here would be
the money necessary to feel free of
emotional insecurity Etc
I'm lonely is a low-level cat
I'm lacking a fulfilling relationship
with someone who really interests me is
a high level cat
I'm depressed is a low-level cat
I'm not entirely self-realized he's a
high level cat
you see the cats never really go away
they just sort of evolve and this is
because what might have motivated you to
run nearer the beginning of the maze
might not be worth expending any effort
toward the further you progress through
the maze now if optimal motivation is
accomplished through a combination of
cats and cheese then a smart person will
find ways to explicitly and
intentionally introduce cats and cheese
into his or her life and that's because
the person will understand that it's
really the presence of these things and
especially the presence of cats that

[05:02]
especially the presence of cats that
instigate constructive meaningful action
furthermore where we believe we are
relative to the incentives that we have
identified will significantly alter our
sense of self and our perception of
reality for instance if we believe that
we are close to the cat
and very far from the cheese
then life is going to feel like hell
vicious hopeless and cruel
on the other hand if we're close to the
cheese and very far from the cat
then life is gonna feel like heaven Rich
rewarding and abundant
both conditions exist in the same maze
the maze is not one or the other the
maze is the medium through which those
conditions emerge
and while it's true that some folks just
seem to be born closer to the cheese
than to the cat and vice versa it's

[06:02]
than to the cat and vice versa it's
actually mostly up to us what we choose
to consider a cat and what we choose to
consider some cheese
and this is true because one person's
cheese will not motivate any effort in
another I mean your own cheese five
years ago might not motivate any effort
from you today and that can only really
be true if cats and cheese are not
objective features of reality but
perceptual constructs that evolve as we
do
and if this is true then we might
actually have much more control over
whether we live in hell or whether we
live in heaven then we may at first
anticipate
what do you think how do you introduce
cats into your own life let me know in
