i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
attend to your soil
so this is building on an episode i
published some time ago called be a
ruthless gardener
in that talk i made the analogy between
one's consciousness or mental state in a
garden
and that it's up to each one of us to
deracinate to pull up by the roots the
useless and negative thoughts that
proliferate like weeds in our minds
just like in a garden these thoughts
take up space that could otherwise be
allocated to more useful and attractive
specimens
and much like a gardener who feels no
pity sympathy or remorse about pulling
weeds you can likewise feel no pity
sympathy or remorse about attending to
these negative thoughts
now on top of this though
it's important to attend to your soil
what does that mean
well some soil conditions are far more

[01:02]
well some soil conditions are far more
conducive to the growth of weeds than
others
and if you simply limit yourself to
pulling up the weeds that sprout in your
garden without addressing the conditions
from which they arise then you will
likely end up doing much more work over
the long run than you would otherwise
need to
now the soil is the environment in which
you live the environment from which
thoughts emerge think about it
are you more likely to experience
positive confident and hopeful
cognitions when you're tired or
well-rested
when you're stressed or at peace
when you're hungry or well-fed
when you're hungover or sober
when you're around disrespectful people
or supportive friends
when you're around users and enablers or
secure and interdependent partners
i mean i think the answers are pretty
obvious
of course it takes time and effort to
cultivate say inner peace or supportive
friendships

[02:01]
friendships
however it also takes time and effort
and potentially much more time and
effort
to continually cope with the
consequences of not doing so
you'll be pulling out weeds left and
right if you don't work to change the
soil from which they emerge
with the right soil conditions you might
not have to pull so many weeds which is
very useful
so how do you attend to your soil well
in particular i'd like you to focus on
your social environment
if you hang around five guys who sit on
the couch and smoke weed every night
well guess what it's only a matter of
time before you're the sixth
on the other hand if you surround
yourself with people who know you who
care about you who support your growth
and progress
and who share your primary values
then you will be supported in becoming a
better version of yourself you won't
have to do as much maintenance to cope
with the consequences of their company
there will simply be fewer weeds to pull

[03:00]
there will simply be fewer weeds to pull
