this might be a bitter pill for some
women to swallow but I got to keep it
real for you if you want to be seen as
more than just a sexual object you need
to provide more than sexual value what
would generally happen on the first few
dates I kind of set everything up I take
the initiative and ask you out so I'm
disproportionately assuming the risk and
the responsibility for both of us on the
date I'm funny making you laugh Charming
making you feel engaged I'm intelligent
making you think and I'm interested
making you feel special in this common
dating scenario you just basically have
to show up and without sex what exactly
am I getting out of this interaction so
if you the woman want to be seen as more
than just a sexual partner then be
smarter than me and teach me something
or be funnier than me and make me laugh
or be more Charming than me and make me
feel something or take some initiative
so that I don't have to be responsible
for every last detail of the interaction
unpopular opinion but it's your
responsibility to demonstrate that you
have more to offer than simply sex
