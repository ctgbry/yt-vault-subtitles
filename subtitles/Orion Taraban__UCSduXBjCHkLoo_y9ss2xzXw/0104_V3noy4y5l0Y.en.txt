i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
persona 5 and confidants
so this is another dive into pop
psychology again with the fantastic rpg
persona 5. this game does so many things
right and in this episode
i'd like to talk about how the game
functionally lays down a blueprint on
how to make friends
and this is something that i talk to my
clients about
every single week
the fact of the matter is that the older
you get on some level the harder it
becomes to make new friends
it's not like high school or college
when people are just hanging out and you
can make spontaneous plans in adulthood
people have jobs people have families
and relationships they're a bit more
wary of folks and in many cases they
already have friends and family so
they're often not in the market to form
new friendships which as we'll see can
be time and energy consuming

[01:00]
be time and energy consuming
so it's hard to make new friends as an
adult
but persona 5 lays out a pretty solid
template for how to do so
first of all
it's important to understand that to
make a friend you have to spend time
with them
and in the game as in life
time is the most precious resource you
have
obviously if you spend time with one
person the opportunity cost is that you
don't get a chance to spend that time
with anyone else
which means that you deepen
relationships to a certain extent at the
expense of all other relationships you
have or might have
so you have to spend time with people
and this time will generally be spread
out over months if not years
it's really not possible to become close
friends with someone in less time
so pace yourself for the long haul now
just like in the game
everyone starts as an acquaintance a
classmate a person in your community a

[02:02]
classmate a person in your community a
chance encounter etc
and you begin the path toward friendship
when you take the first step to invite
an acquaintance to a one-on-one
interaction that's the first step
and usually that interaction revolves
around an activity like with ryuji it's
training you run or go to the gym with
usuke it's art you go to a museum or to
an inspirational location
so that's another thing to keep in mind
you can't expect every acquaintance to
enjoy every activity
in the beginning
the burgeoning friendship is based
around a shared interest
and this becomes the common ground on
which your relationship is based
this means that you have to pay
attention to the interests temperament
and personality of the people you're
dealing with in order to propose
activities that might resonate with them
and these factors are represented in the
game by the arcana associated with each
character which is a principle from the

[03:01]
character which is a principle from the
tarot which reveals let's say their
essential nature
so you need to spend time with people
one-on-one
in an activity that reflects a shared
interest
when this happens you tend to get
somewhat stereotyped compartmentalized
relationships this is my gym buddy this
is my museum buddy etc
this isn't necessarily a problem however
as this might be considered a necessary
phase
toward deepening a friendship
so how does that occur
basically
stereotyped relationships are deepened
by means of a gradual process of mutual
revelation
in the first few interactions with
someone you're both mostly going to be
talking about whatever you're there to
do
lifting techniques artistic principles
etc
but then
over time
personal details begin to emerge
people start to talk about things beyond
the present activity things that are

[04:00]
the present activity things that are
going on at home in their personal lives
or things that happen in their past
and this is a key moment
as it's basically a tentative invitation
to greater intimacy
and you can initiate this as well you
don't simply have to wait for the other
person to do it
the crux of the matter is determine
whether the intimacy is reciprocated in
kind
for instance if the other person makes a
self-disclosure and you don't mirror
this behavior with an appropriate
self-disclosure of your own the
relationship is unlikely to progress
however if you match your
self-disclosure with an appropriate
self-disclosure that is a
self-disclosure about the same topic on
the same level of intimacy your
relationship will deepen
the path toward friendship is a sort of
dance in which the steps are the matched
reciprocity of self-disclosure
and the last point i want to make is
that one of the best ways to accelerate
the process of intimacy in a
relationship is to overcome a challenge

[05:02]
relationship is to overcome a challenge
together
this is symbolized in the game by the
fact that you generally have to
accompany each of your confidants
through a personal difficulty
there is a suffering to pass through or
a crisis to resolve
and it's important to understand that
you don't actually have to eliminate the
suffering or mitigate the crisis either
is really the other person's
responsibility
you simply accompany the person through
their hardship with your steadfast
presence
this is sufficient as it's actually
quite a lot
so an accelerant in intimacy is assuming
shared hardship
something to keep in mind
