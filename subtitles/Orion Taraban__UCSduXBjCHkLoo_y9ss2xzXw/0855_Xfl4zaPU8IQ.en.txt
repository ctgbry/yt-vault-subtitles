I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is who
speaks for
men so this is a topic that I've been
asked to weigh in on on a few different
occasions when I've been invited to
appear on various
podcasts and so far I haven't really
liked any of my responses and I think
that's largely because I hadn't given
the subject much thought however in the
intervening time I've considered the
topic more deeply and I'd like to share
some of my insights in today's
episode basically I've been asked on a
few occasions to explain the cultural
phenomenon of the male
idealogue like how have certain
charismatic or forceful
personalities managed for lack of a
better word to seduce the hearts and
minds of so many young men what might be
the psychological explanation for this
happening now the best answer I've heard

[01:00]
happening now the best answer I've heard
to these questions which is not a bad
answer is that this Springs from an
absence of real male role models we're
currently passing through a crisis of
masculinity in which traditional
templates of maleness have been
systematically dismantled and nature
abhor a vacuum in the absence of better
Alternatives impressionable young men
hungry for direction will gravitate to
the most forceful or confident or
charismatic Personalities in their
cultural millu I think this is true and
something to take
seriously however there's something else
that I'd like to talk about with respect
to this phenomenon that I don't think
has received adequate attention and
consideration after all these idealogues
are not just strong personalities they
give rise to ad hoc societies around
them it's not like millions of young men
are just like individually locked in to
a single internet personality they're
also interacting with each other and

[02:00]
also interacting with each other and
this is just as if not more important
than the personality around whom that
Society
forms I think that it's no coincidence
that these communities have sprung up in
a world in which there are zero like
absolutely zero exclusively male spaces
anymore I think the absence of male
space is the larger vacuum that has
given rise to this particular phenomenon
let's consider this further it's
extremely difficult if not impossible to
find any spaces in the west that are
just for men like it very much used to
be a man's world the business World in
particular and work in general used to
be a male space not anymore women are in
the workforce and they're not going
anywhere then it used to be Sports no no
every broadcast now has female
commentators or reporters or announcers
then it used to be Social Clubs no those
were discriminatory and have been

[03:00]
were discriminatory and have been
legally dismantled I mean even the Boy
Scouts doesn't exist anymore because I
guess it was too traumatic for girls to
be excluded from that
organization however this infiltration
of unisex spaces has not been bilateral
women want men to surrender male spaces
but they want to retain their own the
Boy Scouts have been disbanded But the
Girl Scouts are alive and well and they
don't intend admit boys anytime soon
indeed these female spaces are proud if
not a little misguided about their
identities for instance there is a blog
post on the Girl Scouts website entitled
in a world of boys clubs give her one of
her own like I don't know what world the
Girl Scouts is looking at but it's not
the world I see there are no male spaces
anymore but a lot of those advocating
for girls and women haven't updated
their browsers

[04:00]
their browsers
there's a lot of resistance from women
around relinquishing female spaces and I
think that's right I think it's good and
right for women to have exclusively
female spaces just listen to their
experience women tend to feel safer they
tend to feel more comfortable they're
more willing to discuss certain issues
and concerns without men present it's
like no of course they do like why
else would 85 5% of gynecologists be
female but guess what the same thing is
true for men men feel safer more
comfortable more willing to discuss
certain issues and concerns without
women present like the addition of one
person of the opposite sex can change
the entire group dynamic
considerably this change isn't always
for the worse but let's be real it's
also not always for the better there's

[05:00]
also not always for the better there's
also considerable evidence that samesex
communities are associated with a host
of positive mental health outcomes for
boys and girls it would be very very
easy to make an empirically supported
case for the argument that men and boys
benefit from unisex environments at
least as much as women and girls do if

understanding to the next level I would

aboard unfortunately the dismantling of
mail spaces hasn't stopped there like it
wasn't enough to get rid rid of the

[06:00]
wasn't enough to get rid rid of the
physical spaces or to consider the
infiltration of every last one to be the
march of victory for some Progressive
Manifest
Destiny even the social dialogue has
been conquered like good luck trying to
address a male problem any male problem
in the public discourse go for
it like take I don't know suicide for
instance men are significantly more
likely to kill themselves than women are
in every society on the planet in the US
for instance about 80% of completed
suicides are male however ideology has
advanced so thoroughly into the public
discussion that the entire conversation
is skewed away from helping those most
affected by the problem when those
people are men the question here is not
why are millions more men than women
killing themselves the question is not
why why does this seem to be a gendered

[07:02]
why why does this seem to be a gendered
problem it's why are transgendered folks
significantly more likely to attempt
suicide than cisgendered people while
this is true it's also true that the
number of completed suicides by males
dwarfs the number of completed suicides
by all transgendered people and this is
how a problem that disproportionately
affects men is
co-opted when men speak to other men
about their problems they reminded did
not to forget about women because they
suffer too however issues that
disproportionately affect women are
allowed to remain female issues when men
try to uplift other men were reminded
not to forget about women because they
want those things too however so often
women don't include men in their
strategies for success it's a terrible
double standard and in the A and even in
the abstracted realm of ideas men are
not to have their own dedicated

[08:01]
not to have their own dedicated
spaces and it's no coincidence that it
is within this context of a total
abolition of male spaces that certain
ideologues have appeared and what is
their fundamental
message I'm for men I'm a man talking
directly to men and I'm on men's side
I'm going to help men get what they want
and I'm going to address men's problems
and I'm to put Men
First and this probably feels like
mainlining heroin to a lot of young men
because this isn't the 19th century
these young men have potentially lived
their whole lives in the west without
being acknowledged in that way they
haven't yet found a place where being a
man isn't just not a negative but may
actually be a positive and they feel
seen and heard for the first time in a
message that's exclusively meant for
them

[09:00]
them
like it or not some of these people are
Unapologetic advocates for men and being
an advocate for men is a kind of social
suicide in today's day and age like no
one says you're not supposed to do this
but on some level we all know that it's
not a good idea not to involve the
ladies so the role attracts
personalities that are so grandiose or
aggressive or hardened that they can
deal with the backlash that they
inevitably receive and this is the
important part some of these
personalities go too far and in their
advocacy of men they end up saying
women not a good
look but most of them
don't however even those who don't say
this might as well have like the social
inference here is that anyone who must
be for men must be against women and

[10:02]
be for men must be against women and
every social advocate for men is a
wouldbe oppressor of women and that just
isn't true and we certainly don't think
it's true when it's the other way around
like the thought leaders and
organizations that proudly and
explicitly Advanced Women's interests
aren't primarily considered to be the
sworn oppressors or enemies of
men but this incorrect belief creates
the problem that we are discussing like
if just advocating for men implies that
you're against women which will attract
a whole host of negative social
consequences then the vast majority of
men who might be more sensitive and
nuanced around the issues will be
bullied out of the discourse or just
think it's not worth it leaving only the
most aggressive or powerful
personalities and if cultural progress
is considered to be the infiltration in
dismantling of every single male space

[11:02]
dismantling of every single male space
then the only ones that will survive
will be those that actively defend
themselves and fight for their
existence not really a recipe for
Harmony and intersexual understanding
but the alternative isn't so hot
either on the other hand I believe that
if we take the need for male spaces
seriously if men and boys have the
consistent lived experience of being
valued and validated of being seen and
spoken to then the attraction of the
more forceful personalities will be much
less powerful men may not need the
spaces these personalities provide
because they would already have their
own so there you have it just like women
and girls can and do benefit from unisex
environments at all stages of
development men and boys do the same and
the more these spaces are nurtured and

[12:00]
the more these spaces are nurtured and
preserved in a positive and sustainable
way the less likely more polarizing and
extreme subcultures will take
root what do you think does this fit
