i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
catastrophic thought cascades
so this is a term that i coined to
describe the cognitive phenomena that
generally precede the experience of
being emotionally hijacked it's core to
the experience and syndrome of panic
disorders but we can also see it in play
when people fly off the handle and rage
or sink into a deep dark despair
basically they precede nearly every
sudden and intense emotional reaction
a catastrophic thought cascade is a
series of imagined events that appear to
be strongly linked by causality if
viewed only through the lens of the
emotion that produced it
these thought cascades also tend to lead
people to some pretty dark places hence
catastrophic
now in the beginning it can subjectively
feel like you go from zero to 8 million
in a blink of an eye

[01:00]
in a blink of an eye
that's your phenomenological experience
however
if we begin to apply greater mindful
awareness to our own mental processes
that increased attention has the effect
of slowing down the subjective
experience of time
mindful awareness can dilate the moment
in which the emotional hijacking occurs
and we can come to see that many many
many things actually happen in that
blink of an eye
the idea here is to expand that moment
by observing the chain of events in
order to give ourselves the opportunity
to get in there and disrupt the thought
cascade before it hits catastrophic
proportions
again any one link in the chain of the
thought cascade will appear valid when
viewed through the lens of the emotion
that produced it so the work here is to
challenge that apparent validity by
offering reasonable counter factuals
that derail the progress toward imagined
catastrophe and of course this will be

[02:00]
catastrophe and of course this will be
easier to do earlier in the process when
we aren't as ensnared by emotion
for instance
some people might interpret not
receiving a timely response to a text
message
as a sign that the other person is mad
at them
which can stimulate a feeling of
insecurity that can extrapolate a whole
series of imagined events culminating in
the heartbreaking end of a cherished
relationship
all
in the blink of an eye
this in turn can lead to a host of
maladaptive behaviors that will
generally degrade the quality of the
relationship one way or the other
of course if the cascade is allowed to
reach its ultimate destination the
emotion will feel so immediate and valid
that only emotional coping skills would
be appropriate at that time however if
those people were to slow down their
cognitive processes through mindful
attention
they may be able to offer reasonable
counter factuals to disrupt this process

[03:00]
counter factuals to disrupt this process
ideally as early as the initial
precipitating interpretation
for example
maybe the other person isn't actually
angry at them
maybe
he's just busy and hasn't had a moment
to formulate an appropriate response yet
or maybe the other person actually is
angry but that this could lead to a
conversation instead of a big blowout
fight etc
the point is that every link in a
thought cascade is potentially an
opportunity for intervention
you'll get better at doing this and
better at doing this quickly remember
you generally only have a second or two
to get in there with practice so hang in
there

catastrophic thought cascades drop a
