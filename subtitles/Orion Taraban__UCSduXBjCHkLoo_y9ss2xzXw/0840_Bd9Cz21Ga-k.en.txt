this is why I often don't talk about
studies on my channel because I actually
read studies most people do not read
studies even in grad school most of my
colleagues weren't reading the studies
they' read the abstracts um most people
don't even read the abstracts they read
popular articles written by people who
read the abstracts and sometimes they
don't even read those articles they just
read the headlines of those articles
written by people who read the abstracts
there's an enormous problem with that
because it actually is very difficult to
learn the language of scientific studies
to learn the language of sta statistics
it's not really intuitive it took me
years of reading and I didn't understand
a lot of what I was reading in the
beginning because it's almost like a
foreign language you have to become
fluent in statistics and study design
and there are so many ways to get the
outcome that you might be looking for in
ways that would be very difficult for
most people to pick up on so the fact
that a study showed doesn't really hold
a lot of weight for me there are some
well-controlled studies out there but
the vast majority of them are not that
well- controlled
