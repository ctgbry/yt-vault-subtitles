Why are so many men in positions of
power now? Why do they act so beta?
Well, I think that there is this
systematic I don't know if anybody is
really pulling the strings behind the
scenes, but the systematic push to kind
of get rid of alpha males. Yeah, alpha
males are useful in certain contexts
that are closer to survival or warfare.
And they're dangerous whether or not
they're actually threats. They're
perceived as threats to those who are
not as strong and not as capable. And
what is their place in peaceful civil
commercial society? Like we're trying to
figure that out. It's like a warrior in
a shopping mall. It doesn't really fit
in. Yeah. It's the guy from Vietnam who
comes back and doesn't know what what
his life is. Oh yeah. That was my my
grandfather's life. Yeah. He was pretty
messed up from the war and I don't think
he could ever really acclimate to civil
society afterwards. So the values and
the virtues and the competencies and the
skills that allow you to thrive and
succeed in front-facing commercial
society are not the same things that are
going to keep you safe and healthy and

going to keep you safe and healthy and
prosperous when you're closer to
survival. Yeah. And that's an issue both
for men and women. And we don't really
incentivize the development of those
characteristics in men these days. In
fact, if we're pushing strength and
self-sufficiency and boldness and
courage, you better be doing it for
women. Like girls get that kind of
message. But it's sort of what do men or
young boys hear? You know, become more
sensitive. Give up those traditional
toxic gendered traits. Don't be bound by
them. It's almost like there's this
gender reversal that we're teaching boys
and
