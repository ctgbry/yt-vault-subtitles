in one of my recent shorts in which i
held that a man can still be physically
attracted to a woman when there's
something off about her character
superkind asks how does this apply to
other cultures
she seems to make the argument that in
other cultures
looks are not as important especially
because looks may not be accessible to
men
as she says which i assume means like in
certain middle eastern countries where a
woman's appearance is
very socially mandated or regulated and
my response to that is yes there are
some cultural differences that exist
in this i would say that in the east
while love marriages
occur today they happen with still much
less frequency than they do in the west
and that marriages in the east
are more
traditional and utilitarian
which may not necessarily be a bad thing
and there's also a tradition of
polygamy and also open mistresses so
that's also something to consider
