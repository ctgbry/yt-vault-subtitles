there are many different ways for men to
perform controlled detonations on
prospective lovers and ideally these
tests are conducted before the date even
occurs saving both sides a lot of time
and energy one easy way to do this is to
ask a woman to send you pics prior to a
date I understand this is going to be a
contentious suggestion for some folks
but I think it's a good idea for a
number of reasons let's explore this
further first and foremost requesting
pick from a woman is kind of a way of
making sure that you're both more or
less on the same page with respect to
the nature of this potential
relationship like this isn't going to be
a friendly chat or some kind of
interview it's a date with all of its
attendant sexual associations and
possibilities this will not only help
prevent men from entering into ambiguous
interactions with women but it will give
men important information about the
woman's level of attraction and aspects
of her character as well
