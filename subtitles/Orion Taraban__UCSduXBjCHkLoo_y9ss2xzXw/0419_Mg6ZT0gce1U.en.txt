hi this is Dr Orion taraban and this is
cycats Better Living Through psychology
and I'm really happy to be able to
present you today Mr Chaz Ellis Chaz is
somebody that I've personally been
following on YouTube for she's probably
like close to eight years now and uh he
was one of the first folks
that I followed on social media when I
started to really do deep dives into
dating psychology and
um attraction and understanding women I
think his work is really amazing he is
down to earth his work is very
accessible and I think it's based on his
lived experience it's very real and I
think it's also very balanced because
correct me if I'm wrong Chaz you have
like the guys Channel which I think
as the name suggests the audience is
primarily men but I think you also have
a channel that's uh it's our audience is
primarily composed of women and you do a
lot of consultations with with women as
well correct right absolutely so you've

[01:02]
well correct right absolutely so you've
got a few different irons in the fire
and I'm really happy to have you here
today chess thanks for accepting the
invitation
hey thanks for having me
so when we spoke a few months ago you
told me that you were currently in the
Dominican Republic you want to tell yep
why you happen to be there
um well one of the things I'm working on
right now is a documentary where I'm
basically talking about people who are
traveling to different countries men and
women actually who are traveling to
different countries
um you know just trying to find love uh
in a way that's I guess you know
a little unconventional but um you know
nothing that's designed I know a lot of
stuff's out there that's demonizing
people for doing it or making it seem
like it's a it's um
that there's just nothing in America but
I just want to see exactly why people
are doing it and what's making them do
it and what they're in and who has
different motivations so that's kind of
what I'm doing now is interviewing
different people checking out the

[02:01]
different people checking out the
culture I'm in the Dominican Republic
right now I'm gonna travel to some other
places also and do the same thing
absolutely I think the term that I know
for that phenomenon is Geo Arbitrage
with respect to dating so like going
around to different markets where you
might have let's say a higher sexual
Marketplace value than you do right
around your home
um so my understanding is that unless
we're leaving aside kind of like the
mail order bride phenomenon where women
are just sort of like going on these
sites and and hoping for usually men in
the west to kind of wife them up that
traveling for the sexual Marketplace
value was really something that men were
doing like the passport Bros and that
kind of phenomenon but you said that
women are doing it too
man uh yeah I've seen it actually yeah
around here too uh a lot of times
something gets popularized like passport
Bros and it becomes like uh a thing
where people believe that that's the
only thing that's happening there are
actually a lot of women they're not

[03:00]
actually a lot of women they're not
calling themselves passports citizens or
or whatever man I called themselves
anything they don't have a name for it
yet but there's a lot of women that
actually going to different countries
too in the Dominican Republic is one of
them I don't know if you ever watched
the show like 90 Day Fiance or any of
that where people are on K1 visas you
know uh to come over to the United
States uh so it kind of goes both ways
and there are definitely women there
doing it too
and what have you discovered so far
from your time in the Dr
well what I discovered here is
and then I think it's one of those
things where
there are cultural differences anywhere
you go but people are generally the same
but there are cultural differences and
people who are looking for a specific
thing a lot of times really what they're
looking for to be honest is to get the
most bang for their buck
a lot of people are saying hey here's
what I've accomplished in my life here's

[04:00]
what I've accomplished in my life here's
where I am
um whether it's financially socially
um or whatever level that I've been able
to improve myself and I think that I
might be able to get a little more of
that more for that if I'm somewhere
other than the United States this which
is a market that's saturated with meat
you know if you are an American person
the market in America is saturated with
you you know just whatever you've
accomplished still there's going to be
more of you there than there are in
another country so I just
I hear what you're saying I imagine that
how much of that do you think is just
let's say the exoticism of dating
somebody other versus like I'm sure that
they have like specific values
Americans have specific values that
aren't as dominant in other cultures
that are actually
um highly valued by like a portion of
that dating population

[05:00]
that dating population
I think uh
in some cases that's that's going to be
that's going to be true but yeah I think
in some cases that's going to be true uh
what I've noticed is it really just
depends on where you date a lot of times
when you're in America you just try to
date parallel
uh to where you are socioeconomically
um to where you are in terms of your
religion to where you are just in terms
of your political views everything is
like try to be the exact same um for the
most part and when people go to
different countries especially if they
come here I notice that people the
people that I've talked to even that
have broadened their Horizons
so yeah they are like you said they are
getting different values I don't know if
that's just because they're in the
Dominican Republic or they went to
Thailand or somewhere like that I don't
know if it's just that or if it's the
fact that they're dating people who are
totally different than the people that

[06:00]
totally different than the people that
they've dated in the past are different
than themselves even well we hear a lot
um I mean almost every dating coach is
saying that you should date for shared
values like you should find somebody who
believes kind of the things that you do
and that's the recipe for Going the
Distance and it sounds like one of the
things that you're saying is that
whether we're aware of it or not one of
the values that Americans tend to have
is equality and that might not be a
value that is as
um valuable in other parts of the world
where they have let's say more they
might be more comfortable with more
unequal relationships is that part of
what you're saying I've seen that in
quite quite a bit around here where it
is a thing like Americans like you said
for sure most of the time Americans do
have some sense of a need for equality
in their relationships
unfortunately with that usually leaves
is a void somewhere because two people
are trying to bring the same thing to a
situation it's like we're going to sit
down and eat and you go I got peanut
butter and jelly

[07:01]
butter and jelly
you know you you come with peanut butter
and jelly and you say what do you got
and I go I got peanut butter and jelly
also yes we have both brought equal
parts to the situation but I didn't
bring what you needed if I had bread
we'd be in shape now now we can eat but
we both have peanut butter and jelly we
really don't need each other yeah so
yeah I made a video about this that
basically describes that inequality is
the basis of relationship because
um we can't really do business when I go
to a cafe the reason why we can actually
do something with each other is because
I want that cup of coffee more than I
want my three dollars and they want my
three dollars more than they want 12
ounces of their coffee and that's how we
can actually do business with each other
right
so complementarity
um okay now is it is it really that much
better or is that just sort of like the
fantasy that frustrated men and women
have when they are out of luck in um in

[08:01]
have when they are out of luck in um in
America dating around
well yeah I think whenever something
happens you change
when when you change your environment
oftentimes you change your outlook
you could take somebody who comes from a
totally different country to the United
States of America and most of the time
they see it as a place of opportunities
milk and honey uh the the greatest place
on Earth if you will then you have
people who've been living there their
whole lives and they feel like it's not
really that you know because
if you've been somewhere your entire
life everything's not new and fresh to
you so when people come to another
country to date the people are new
the the
um the different situations they find
themselves in are new they don't think
they know everything about people they
don't think they know everything about
dating most of the time when you go out
on a date and say you're 30 even just
you're just 30 years old once you you've
been alive for 30 years in the same

[09:01]
been alive for 30 years in the same
place you've dated people in the same
place for probably at least 15 of those
years and because of that most of the
time you really think you know exactly
what's going to happen on that date with
that person's intentions are
um you're taking even little small
things that happen on the day and
deciding certain things about them
um even before you get to the day you're
taking little small things in deciding
you know oh this would be the outcome if
we ever had a relationship that's what
most people do and that's because you
know
because the environment is old when you
come to a new environment a lot of times
you don't speak the language so you're
trying to figure things out in in that
you're open
to the situation and you're open to new
things you're open to new experiences so
it's a it's better because you're a
better you in a better version of you so
it's almost like what you're saying is
that when people already assume that
they know how this is going to go they
kind of don't pay as much attention they

[10:01]
kind of don't pay as much attention they
stop looking or they feel that when they
see little signals of something they
inappropriately conceptualize how the
future is going to go based on a limited
subset of information but because those
symbols make sense within that culture
and if they go to a different culture
the same behavior might not have the
same meaning and so they kind of have to
surrender their assumptions and kind of
get curious and pay more attention and
and that in and of itself can make other
people more attractive is that is that
part of what you're saying
um for sure absolutely I think that a
lot of times what happens is like you
said
um just following up on it um when you
already think certain things are going
to happen
the attraction just cuts off because one
little thing might have happened that
you've seen two or three different times
in dealing with people like for instance
you might have been trying to talk to
the person and maybe they didn't they
didn't look directly at you when you
were trying to talk to them or maybe you
didn't make eye contact immediately but

[11:01]
didn't make eye contact immediately but
when you come somewhere else that you've
never been before you're like is that a
cultural thing or is this something that
maybe they're
um you know with I don't even really
know what the cues are to whether or not
somebody likes me in this place because
it's different from what I'm used to and
sometimes you get you pay attention to
the individual
a lot more because you haven't grouped
them in so you are able to become more
attractive you're able to to stop
putting up some of the barriers that you
use to to fence yourself in and also you
don't have as much input from other
people most people whenever they date
they also have friends that input family
members the input but when you come to a
whole nother country
and those people aren't really this as
available to you then you don't get as
much of the negative feedback
I hear that I I there's been some videos
going around lately that talk about
women's committees and that seems to be
more of a phenomenon with women than men

[12:01]
more of a phenomenon with women than men
where they kind of make group decisions
about the boyfriend
um it happens quite a bit yes yeah
that's interesting and these things that
you're talking about with like eye
contact in Psychology we call those
proxemics and it's all of these
different dimensions of intangible human
behavior that influence how we think
about ourselves and other people that
most people just take for granted like
the the distance that we comfortably
stand
um away from each other very
significantly from culture to culture
and can be a sign of like disrespect or
inappropriate intimacy if you're not
familiar with that um that cultural
theme basically really interesting
so um that said
that is it fair to say that there must
be something that is driving the
dissatisfaction in Americans both men
and women to look elsewhere and if
that's fair like what are you noticing
when you've talked to hundreds if not
thousands of men and women uh what are

[13:02]
thousands of men and women uh what are
their common dissatisfactions
um yeah like you said I've been doing
this for 10 years so I've talked to
thousands and thousands of people
and the dissatisfactions are usually
similar for both people they just for
both sexes but they just think that it's
only each one thinks that they're the
only one dealing with the problem but
for most people it's um
just
being unclear
and not understanding what the other
group wants from them so if you got a
guy who's trying to date a young lady
most of the time he finds himself in a
situation where he's most frustrated by
the fact that he doesn't feel that her
intentions are clear to him what does
this person actually want from me
what am I supposed to do to fight to be
attractive to this person what am I
supposed to do to be the person that
they would Envision themselves with and

[14:01]
they would Envision themselves with and
for most people they feel like the bar
is just too high
or or invisible and high
uh you know I don't even know what to
aim for because the bar is invisible I
don't even what am I supposed to be able
to to do in this situation to make you
be attracted to me or treat me in a
certain way and how do I know when
you're not
so most people become very
disenchanted as they date years and
years and years they become in women are
are similar because they're like okay I
know it may not take very much for you
to want to sleep with me but what does
it take for you to actually want to be
in a real committed relationship with me
where you go forward with me
um and I actually have a certain
security to know that we're going to be
together for the for the duration of Our
Lives even and most women feel like I
don't know
where though what what those signs are I

[15:01]
where though what what those signs are I
have no clue so when people deal with in
the United States and what causes them
to want to go elsewhere is they want to
believe that there is a world that's
basically trapped in a set in a
in a time capsule
somewhere there's a world that's trapped
in a time capsule that I've heard of
that you know 1950 1955
1918 even there's some world that's
trapped in its time capsule where
everything made sense and where people
were honest and real and uh the I I knew
exactly what I needed to do in order to
attract someone and for them to to be
into me and want to be with me but and I
think that's why people want to leave
America because it just they feel like
it's so complicated there's got to be
somewhere else where it's simple and do
you think that's true
no

[16:00]
no I think it's complicated because I I
know in some of your videos that I've
seen you speak on the idea of like the
1950s is kind of a myth that it's been
romanticized so maybe it's like a false
comparison that there was this time this
fairy tale time where men were men and
women were women and everyone kind of
knew their roles and things were used in
relationships lasted forever and so
maybe that's part of it or is it also
that the confusion about gender and
power and sex and all it's like trickled
in everywhere is it both and kind of
situation I think it's I think it's both
in I think what's what's happened is
that people have a myth of a time going
by that may have been different in a lot
of ways but it wasn't perfect
um and it wasn't perfect or better
necessarily for either group
um and I think that
you also have a situation yes where
power dynamics have shifted

[17:02]
power dynamics have shifted
um people are in all kinds of different
walks of life now where they interact
with each other in totally different
ways and I think that's confusing for
most people and I think there's also
that mixed with
a a sense that everything should be
perfect it's like man there is supposed
to isn't there supposed to be some
perfect life that I'm supposed to be
able to attain in some kind of way
um some perfect relationship or
something like that
so the way that I heard you it seems
like in your experience both men and
women there's kind of like two potential
big problems one is that they don't
really understand what the other side
wants
that men are saying I don't really know
what a woman wants in order to get her
to sleep with me women are saying I
don't really know when a man wants to
get him to commit to me
and that suggests to me that in most men
and women let's say are good faith
actors like they they want to be able to

[18:02]
actors like they they want to be able to
give the other person what they want in
order to get what they want do you think
that that's fair
I think most people actually are
good faith actors I do I think I think
most people not only I don't think men
even just want to sleep with women I
think most men are looking for a woman
who would be in a real relationship with
them
um and reciprocate whatever love or
emotional attention that they're willing
to give out I think that that's how it
is for most people but
people generally don't find themselves
in a situation where they want to engage
with most people they want to engage in
generally with a small group of people
and who is into small people the small
group of people are usually just
whatever people are the most physically
desirable and
um outgoing
uh and sometimes financially secure also

[19:02]
uh and sometimes financially secure also
uh that those are the that small group
of people
is really like the um it's what
everybody Compares when people talk
about women who play games
or they talk about men who play games
and men who don't want to commit most of
the time people talk about they're
talking about this small group of people
who have all of the options in the world
and can do pretty much whatever they
want and they do whatever they want
other people are just left on the
outside of that in most cases because
they haven't really not only is it just
even the physical thing because you can
see somebody named like oh this person
this is physically attractive as the
next but they have not really mastered
dating
in a way that someone doesn't Master
sales or to say so the way someone
doesn't master acting or basketball or
football or something like that yes they
may look
physically the same but they haven't

[20:00]
physically the same but they haven't
mastered the techniques and because they
haven't they're in a situation where
they're at the mercy of those who have
men and women are in the same situation
you've kind of mastered how to get
certain things out of me that you want
without getting very much in return I
haven't been able to do that thus when
we deal with each other I'm always
getting the raw end of the deal so I
when I look at that I say well this is
how men treat women this is how women
treat pain when it's really
this is how these groups this group of
people is able are able to treat people
okay so that's interesting because on
the one hand we see that maybe a problem
that people have both men and women is
like ignorance they don't know what the
other person wants they don't know what
they have to be in order to to increase
their chance of getting that but a big
issue is that both men and women are
seeking
uh relationships of all kinds from most
attractive subset of the opposite sex in
heterosexual Dynamics and those folks

[21:04]
heterosexual Dynamics and those folks
um
are almost like they're priced out of
their their league
in the sense of maybe I know what it's
going to take in order to get into a
relationship the issue is not here
ignorance it's just too rich for my
blood that in order for let's say a
woman to secure commitment from a guy
who's got lots of options
well I I mean
for him to be able to give up not only
the the Dozen women that he's talking to
and all the
maybe hundreds of women that he might
have in the future I mean who who Could
That Woman possibly be like the the
value of her ex of his exclusivity is so
much higher than anything that she could
potentially offer and and maybe that's
why people are going to other cultures
is because
Maybe
what they're attracted to isn't like the
top 10 percent here but maybe they could
be attracted to something that's
lower than the top 10 percent in a

[22:00]
lower than the top 10 percent in a
different culture and so they don't have
that that problem do you think that's
that's part of this
yeah yeah I think sometimes it's
definitely part of it and I think people
are willing to change like expect let's
let's talk about women for and then
we'll go to men also for women a lot of
times if they come over and like say
they come to the Dominican Republic or
something like that a lot of times
they'll they'll snatch out the part of
this of the scenario that made it the
most difficult so for instance they'll
say in America they might say I need
somebody who makes six figures and looks
like this and has this type of
personality that's outgoing bubbly or
whatever
um and you know all these different
things but they might come to the
Dominican Republic and say
I want somebody who has all of those
other attributes but since they don't
make as much money you know the the
exchange rate is different here it's the
the money's not here necessarily I'll
take somebody who doesn't make that much
money well when you take that out of the

[23:01]
money well when you take that out of the
equation
and you have money or you're doing
pretty well financially well
that now now all of a sudden the world
just opens up and you got so many
options that you didn't have in the past
um you know now obviously there's always
going to be different things that go
with that but the options are now there
will you take go ahead well let me talk
about this for a second because I wonder
why it would be necessary for women to
actually like leave the country in order
to let's say reduce their criteria now I
we can understand that women have let's
say their highest sexual Marketplace
value all other things being equal when
they're young like according to uh
Tinder experiment that I talked about on
one of my channels uh women meet their
Peak reach their Peak sexual Marketplace
value at 23 according to men and men
reach their Peak Mark sexual Marketplace
value at 50 according to women so

[24:00]
value at 50 according to women so
there's a huge gap between that so women
are most attractive to men at 23 which
we could say that's when they can
command the best offer that's when they
can be most picky most demanding and
have the most criteria with the hope
that they might actually be satisfied
but a lot of the experience that I have
both dating personally and the guys that
I speak to is that they're sometimes
dealing with women who are
they're they're 38 now and it seems like
they still have the same criteria that
they did when they were 23. and that
doesn't make a lot of sense like if
they're willing to reduce
uh you know throughout the criteria
about making a six-figure income just
because they're going to the Dominican
Republic why why do you think women
wouldn't consider doing that
earlier like from a game theory
perspective it makes sense
as if I were a woman to like set my
standards like almost impossibly high
when I was 18 and then let's just like
continue to reduce them until I could

[25:00]
continue to reduce them until I could
get like the best possible
um secure commitment why don't women do
that why do they seem not to do that
well
I think there's a yeah that's a good
question I think is a couple different
parts that I'm gonna try my best with it
um as far as leaving the country there's
a few different pieces to that when
people leave a lot of times women leave
they leave the scrutiny of their friends
and family members um
um there's also
I don't want to say it's false
but there's a um
there's a stigma on
on not even poverty there's a stigma on
even median income in America
that Americans don't have for people who
don't live in America
so if you live in America and you make
forty thousand dollars a year that's not
bad it's not like you're just poor and

[26:00]
bad it's not like you're just poor and
you don't have anything you can't
support yourself but in America people
will look at that like oh well you know
I don't want somebody who's making forty
thousand dollars a year but they would
go to another country and the stigma
would be off it's like oh well you might
be making
um
1500 pesos a week and I'll I'm cool with
that you know because because I'm not
expecting you to have so much
now I'm gonna I'm gonna try to go back
to what you were talking about as far as
the going going down in terms of um
what they're looking for I'm just going
to be totally honest this might not be a
popular opinion to anyone but when I
look at dating strategies if you took
take morals of any kind out of it
and take just say what is the what would
be the best strategy
for a woman
in order to produce what she's really
trying to produce let's go back to just

[27:00]
trying to produce let's go back to just
straight just animal thought process
right to get what to get what you're
trying to get out of a situation the
best thing she could do would be
what do they call it um Alpha flux beta
books
uh go have
get pregnant by the person with the best
genetics that you possibly can because
that's the kid you're gonna have and
then get somebody else with medium to
whatever genetics they might have to
help you financially support that child
get as much as you can out of them in
terms of resources then take those
resources once your child grows up and
go back out into the world and then be
able to enjoy the physical presence of
the best looking most attractive and
most pleasing people
I mean if you just did imagine what
would be
which would require her to divorce the
beta right so for security absolutely
that's why you see so many divorces um

[28:02]
that's why you see so many divorces um
initiated by women I mean if you really
think about it makes perfect sense we've
talked about this privately it's like if
we are being stone cold just trying to
make the optimal moves within this the
game in terms of like the the the
benefits and the liabilities it's like
yeah that that makes a lot of sense a
lot of um what I talk about is
a lot of human behavior is determined by
the systems of reward and Punishment in
which they operate and I think that's
part of what I hear that men are looking
for outside of America is that they
don't have to date within the system of
incentives that actually motivate that
kind of behavior which is I would say is
not what most men are looking for right
maybe the alpha who just wants to have
fun
um I don't know if he necessarily wants
to reproduce because that could put him
on the hook for certain things
um right but yeah I think that's why a

[29:02]
um right but yeah I think that's why a
lot of
men are
believing that they could find better
options elsewhere because the system of
marriage and the incentives around
divorce may not be as prevalent or as
strong I mean I don't know what it's
like in the Dr but I doubt that they're
getting you know alimony for the rest of
their lives is that is that the fact
I'm not for sure but I don't think so no
I don't think so actually it's hard a
lot of these different countries that
I've been to it's a little harder that
are not in the western world they're not
in the western world it's a little more
difficult for women to be able to secure
a lot of the things that um you can
secure in the west where you can marry
somebody you can get alimony for life
um you could get half of all not even
just have you can get all of their
property you can get most of their bank
accounts
um that's just in it's not as easy to do
around here you know just

[30:01]
around here you know just
it's not it's just not as easy they
don't even have the same lawsuit culture
around here that they do in the United
States we see that and and that can help
explain why divorce is so prevalent and
why the vast majority of divorces are
initiated by women is that they're
actually seeing the game kind of clearly
and they're just being cold-blooded
about maximizing their play Within that
system
but we know that all women don't do that
and so let's go back to the idea that
maybe part of what allows women to
actually get what they want more
frequently outside of America is the
absence of the social pressure to behave
in a certain way or to conform
yeah sure there are two other ways that
um and I think this particularly impacts
women
that I've encountered both in my
personal life and in my clinical
practice one is
um the doctrine of feminism
which is particularly difficult
um for I think young women I've in my

[31:00]
um for I think young women I've in my
20s when I was dating women in my 20s
even 20 years ago uh I dated some women
who were like ideologically opposed to
the idea of actually getting in a
committed relationship with me even
though it was something that I wanted
because they had these ideas about uh
like these kinds of relationships are
based on patriarchal ownership and she
doesn't want to like settle down because
that is an abdication of her sexual
Liberation I mean that happened more
than once to me and I think that that
is something that a lot of those women
grow out of in their 30s but it's often
I wouldn't say too late but they've
they've sort of given a lot of time over
to that ideology so that's one and the
other one that I think really impacts
the dating scene is the idea of like the
Superwoman or the girl boss that she can
do everything that she has the um the
high-powered job and she can have the
husband and kids and
um

[32:00]
um
that that
uh that letting go of any of those
criteria is on some level a
mission that she couldn't hack it that
she didn't have the right stuff to be
like the super Wonder Woman does that
make sense right yeah absolutely
well I think it kind of boils down to
the fact that
in in I work with women all the time so
I'm not anti-women in any way shape or
form I tell them this to their face uh
the reality is
feminism
the world of feminism
is the playground for the [ __ ] boy if
you want to call them you know without
any real judgment you know that's what
they say so
you tell me the biggest losers the
biggest losers in feminism are women
they've actually lost more than anyone
and and here's why I say that
because
in reality nobody really wants to work
like nobody really wants to work a job

[33:01]
like nobody really wants to work a job
you know people want money sure people
want the trappings of success people
want some level of Independence and
self-determination but nobody wants to
come and punch a clock and work every
day nobody wants to do that so what
women have been sold
is that you come to work at this job
you're going to be a boss like you said
or you know you get an education and you
get take on a lot of student loan debt
um you're gonna and then at the end of
the rainbow you're gonna be a boss
you're gonna be a particular guy and you
guys are going to become a Power couple
where you know you go get some other
multi-millionaire and y'all build this
empire together and you're you're
basically like Oprah and they're like
um Obama or something or whatever you
want to you know I over and who no one
knows who Oprah's partnered with you
know what I'm saying yeah you're Oprah
and you're not but he's not Steadman
you're Oprah and male Oprah you know I'm

[34:05]
you're Oprah and male Oprah you know I'm
saying so that's the that's kind of what
women were sold for the most part and
the reality of that is if you're in
that
to one percent that's able to be able to
accomplish a lot of the things
then as far as your life is concerned
it's going to be pretty good yeah you
might feel a little upset about the fact
that you may not be able to find the guy
that you're looking for necessarily but
you still have the opportunity to go
somewhere else and hook up in the same
way that some of these guys do but
most women are never going to end up Dr
lawyer
Oprah
um uh actress famous you know or some of
these influencers even where it's like
oh I got millions and millions of
followers and everybody thinks I'm the

[35:01]
followers and everybody thinks I'm the
most beautiful thing in the world and I
got fans most women are never going to
experience that it's just not realistic
most people are going to be secretaries
uh LPNs
um you know this is you know these are
decent jobs not saying they're not but
it's not going to be the Glamorous boss
life that you were sold and then what
you're going to be left with in most
cases is also struggling to even find
the equivalent of yourself in a man
so now you're not going to have those
two incomes together to be able to
create a better life because when you're
young you don't want it
when you get older a lot of times
I don't want to say you've aged out of
it because it's not really true but
it's made a lot more difficult it's not
as easy as it was when you were 23 when
you were 22. it's just not

[36:03]
unfortunately that's what happens a lot
of times like
things don't turn out the way you
thought it would yeah you're when people
think about feminism they think about
the top
yeah I'm gonna be a boss I'm gonna be
the CEO of Facebook but
for most people it's like nah you're
more likely to be like maybe an
assistant manager at a grocery store or
something like that that's real well
that's that's interesting a couple
things I want to say about that
um my advice to women especially young
women is that they if they really do
want to be everything if they want to be
the successful corporate Warrior and
they want to have the the husband and
the kids why don't they do the husband
and kids part first
like absolutely like get that locked in
in their 20s when they have the best
possible chances of attracting the best
possible man because they're at their
Peak sexual Marketplace value and if
they feel like they're missing out they
could become an employee in their 30s if

[37:01]
could become an employee in their 30s if
they really want to but most women are
trading their 20s which is when they are
at their their Peak
um and able to let's say negotiate the
best deal for themselves for us a salary
which uh you could potentially get at
any stage in their life but it's much
much harder to get
um that that kind of commitment at other
stages
but here's the thing
well another thing I wanted to say is
um
I hear what you're saying but I I don't
know if it's really going to change
anything and you know that I used to be
an actor I know you've done some acting
too I'm sure at some point someone said
to me Orion you know that 99.9 percent
of actors don't make it it's a really
tough profession
but that doesn't stop millions of people
from shooting their shot because
everyone secretly thinks that they have
what it takes to be that top point one
percent
and it's just like a question of when

[38:01]
and it's just like a question of when
you realize that you're not in that you
know that very small band can you get
out with acceptable loss on some level
but yeah I think everyone secretly
believes that they're going to be the
CEO that they're going to be the movie
star that they're going to be the
athlete until sometimes it's tragically
too late
but well I think that's
what you were saying there I think the
problem with that for most people like
you you were saying most people aren't
going to believe that and I understand
that completely but I think what people
often don't do is ask themselves the
question what is it that you actually
want from life
a lot of women that I talked to over the
years
they they are people who are in the team
in the one percent they actually made it
they are the success story this is the
best that story is going to ever get
you know they made millions of dollars
so I was like okay if you can make
millions if you make two or three

[39:00]
millions if you make two or three
million 10 million ain't gonna change
your life that much just reality of it
so there are people who I have worked
with over the years who have made
Millions and they are in that they're
they're the success story but for a lot
of them
they they're they're saying you know
what
the problem with this is these successes
that I've been able to accomplish
don't get me what I actually want I
wanted the power couple where I was with
a guy and he's basically what I am
but unfortunately the two three million
that I got
the you know 500 000 I make a year or
something like that whatever I'm making
for whatever reason my credentials just
are not adding up to me being in a
situation where I can get the my
equivalent my male equivalent I'm in a
situation where
Oprah is with Stedman
you know what I'm saying Oprah is not

[40:00]
you know what I'm saying Oprah is not
with LeBron or Michael Jordan or
somebody you know like do that you know
it's like it it doesn't she's not with
Tom Cruise or something it doesn't work
that way most of the time so
well yeah that's another thing I wanted
to say which is well let's focus on
these top 10 percent of women who under
feminism they are very successful
certainly by let's say traditionally
male standards or our society standards
and making a lot of money they have sure
uh Advanced degrees they own their asses
um
I mean I'm sure you're aware of
hypergamy where women tend to mate and
date
across and up generally up sure they at
that stage they generally want guys to
have even more than they do and that's
obviously a very small pool and those
men because of what women tend to be
attracted to have insane optionality
like ridiculous guys aren't going to
look at a woman and be like damn look at

[41:00]
look at a woman and be like damn look at
her bank account man look at her
master's degree it's actually not
especially now guys who are already rich
sure because it's like that whole thing
uh you know I already got money so what
do I need your money for
um we become sort of irrelevant and this
is something I want to talk to you about
which is how do people like price
themselves out of relationships do you
see that happening
um yeah because what often happens with
people okay first of all most people who
have quote-unquote standards
normally it's just a list of everything
good right so they don't really think
about what their life would be with any
particular person they just think about
a list of all the good things that there
are in life and they say this is my
absolute bare minimum that I'm willing
to accept all the things that put you at
the top
0.001 of people
um not even one percent is now you're
just in a some decimal point somewhere

[42:01]
just in a some decimal point somewhere
so with most people so what people would
do is they'll have that in their mind
and then they'll have their own life
and they take almost all of their time
like and we're talking about women too
women we're talking about women really
right now what they'll do is they'll
take their entire lives and they'll work
for certain things okay I want to get my
degree
I want to get my business going or my
career whatever and I want to get to
this certain level well those things
take time so while those things are
taking time
a lot of times fertility is dropping
physical attributes are dropping I mean
it's very hard to compete with the 20
year old version of yourself when you're
in your mid to late 30s that's hard
um and the same thing happens to me but
there's one caveat one thing that
changes everything
when a man usually gets to that point
and he's in his like it said what um the

[43:02]
and he's in his like it said what um the
men 50 was their highest uh sexual
market value according to women and
their swiping Behavior okay so you got
this guy who's 50 years old
he says
I'm 50 years old
what I want is now at 45 50 somewhere I
may want to have a family which I'm
still capable of doing if I'm in
reasonably good health I want to have
um
I want to have people around me I want
to have a woman that's going to support
me love me that I can talk to that's
going to respect me in a certain way
finances never came into what he was
talking about
and what has he gotten over the years
influence
Finance wisdom
and most of the time for that man and if
he stayed in reasonable shape
he has some level of physical attraction
that he can get with a woman and he also

[44:00]
that he can get with a woman and he also
has things that no 20 year old were
being reasonable now no 20 year old is
able to accomplish you don't have 50
year old knowledge at 20. you don't have
it you have way more knowledge right now
than you did when you were 20 years old
certainly so you cannot match 50 year
old knowledge at 20. I know some 20 year
olds think they can but that's not
realistic you cannot match
50 year old money from somebody who's
been working to build their empire
you can't even match 50 year old car
insurance rates at 20 years old you
can't do it especially if you're a guy
this is that not possible so because
you're not able to do these things that
means that the 50 year old man is able
to compete with a 20 year old man or a
21 or 25 year old man on a curve
that favors him
yeah I I'm young and vibrant and maybe
look a little better
I got a yacht
damn

[45:01]
damn
I can get to the part of the party that
they will not let you into
you're not allowed in
I'm over here in a section with my own
table and all this stuff and I'm
ordering bottles you could not even get
here because the bouncers are males and
they won't let you in because they're
not because you look good it's not
happening so then you take women on the
hit on the flip side of that they can
accomplish all the things that they want
to accomplish but the problem that they
run into is they still want the same
things the woman who is
Fortune 500 millions of dollars in the
bank normally wants the exact same
things as a girl who's on fries at
McDonald's
the 20 year old his own fries you know
trying to make a way I'm looking for
somebody who's financially stable I'm
looking for somebody who um has wisdom
somebody who's able to teach me and
direct me well a lot a lot of times the
CEO is looking for the same thing I want

[46:00]
CEO is looking for the same thing I want
a mentor I want somebody who's even
smarter than me
what are the chances of that let me
let's break this down a little bit
because I think there's a lot of Truth
to what you're saying Chaz but there's
something that I've run up against and
I've done some a lot of consultations
with older guys and they they struggle
with this too which is that all things
being equal women want men who are
higher status who are wealthier who have
their lifestyle
taken care of uh that have some wisdom
that have that kind of experience that
they can take charge and direct
um but what I've discovered is that it's
not like women are lining up for those
men and making it easy
that on some level a lot of guys that
talk to me are like I don't get it Orion
I have the yacht and when I go out with
women they say I don't care about a
yacht
it's not like they're they're just like
maybe if you're in the top Point what
zero zero zero one percent of men in

[47:00]
zero zero zero one percent of men in
your world famous the women are gonna be
like reading outside of your tour bus or
outside of your hotel room
to just sort of like strike up a
conversation with you but there's plenty
of really high value successful Men Who
it's not like the women they still have
to kind of like approach women and start
from zero and to kind of like make them
think they're not serial killers and
that yeah they do have something to
offer and right and oftentimes I don't
know if they're they're lying or they're
not aware of their selection biases but
a lot of women are like I don't I don't
want those things I don't want a yacht
like and and why do you think that just
because you have a yacht and a lot of
money that you uh like deserve or earn
access to me does that make sense yeah
absolutely I want to start here though
everybody in the United States of
America wants a yacht
they're they're lying there they might
be lying to themselves nobody wants to
be poor especially not in America

[48:00]
be poor especially not in America
because
America is a totally different country
if you're poor like it's totally
different you know well I've heard that
the next person's America and a poor
person America totally different
I've heard that the best day in a boat
owner's life is the day he buys the boat
and the second best day is the day he
sells it
so absolutely I definitely can buy it
I've heard that too okay so let's go
into what you were talking about here
all right now
here's what I because I work with a lot
of guys who are in the same situation
you were talking about they got all
contemplated and doing really well but
here's what normally happens
they say money changes you
you know people say ah Money Changes
people money money changes you well in a
lot of cases when people get money
doesn't change them enough
hahaha
doesn't change you fundamentally doesn't
change you internally like they said
poverty meant or scarcity mentalities is
that what you scarcity mentality but
they also have they also care
you know what makes a guy be able to get

[49:02]
you know what makes a guy be able to get
women no matter what his situation is
not caring yeah complete indifference
towards because if you're a person and
you look at you really have an abundance
mindset you're not thinking oh man I got
a yacht and I got a nice car and I got a
nice house and I got all these things so
these women should line up to come date
me
you're not really thinking about that
because it's like well
I yeah but there's other people who
might have those things too it doesn't
that doesn't matter I am the person who
was able to get this stuff
me
I have been able I didn't win the
lottery and get it because there's not
very many lottery winners in the world
so I didn't win the lottery and get it I
was actually able to accomplish things
that put me in a position to be where I
am today
and that is what I bring when you talk
to me that should come out it should
ooze out of my pores that I feel like

[50:01]
ooze out of my pores that I feel like
I'm that guy and some people feel like
they're that guy when they're in Middle
School
and from being in Middle School
and feeling like they're that guy they
don't have any bitterness
they don't have any frustration remember
I talked about earlier you have years of
going through these things so you read
signs it's like the guy is talking about
oh she doesn't care about the yacht and
all that kind of stuff how the hell do
you know that
how do you know that
well what I'm saying is that sometimes
they're out on dates and they report
that is that they're they're trying yeah
that's what I'm saying that's the women
and they're saying here seriously I got
that and the women are like I don't know
how do you know that they didn't want
the yacht what I'm saying is like when
you start going I got a yacht I got this
I got that and all these kind of things
that you might try to tell women when
you meet them what you're you don't know
if they don't care about the yacht or
not you the way you presented the yacht
to them is normally the issue because
you go out here you go oh okay here let

[51:00]
you go out here you go oh okay here let
me show you not you I'm just talking
about people you talk to
um the they're going out here saying I
got the yacht I got the plane hey girl I
just made this business deal and all
this kind of stuff and the woman might
be like you know what I would be
extremely impressed with that if I found
out about that on my home
but because you told me about the guy
and you told me about all this you have
not triggered my Chase Instinct
um
you are the same dude that makes a big
valentine for a girl in the fifth or
sixth grade and presented the tour and
goes hey pretty girl look what I made
you do you want it take this and with my
heart take that also you get what I'm
saying a lot of these guys will get
money and all that kind of stuff but you
have not changed internally to the point
where when you meet somebody
the the idea that you could be gone in a
in a blink of an eye or you make your
feelings are unclear

[52:00]
feelings are unclear
because women are as we know Studies
have shown that women are attracted to
guys whose feelings are unclear I can
tell you that that's true because I work
with women day after day and I know who
they ask me about okay so when you come
into the situation oh I got a yacht well
you're telling me you're really
interested and you're telling your yacht
is all you have to offer which is a lot
but you're telling her that you're
trying to offer it yeah in order for her
to date you rather than being like yo
I'm the type of person who gives you
yachts so when I talk to you I'm talking
about me as a person I'm asking you
about you and if you don't seem vibing
with me and you don't seem interested
that doesn't bother me
you know because if you don't change
internally you're not going to get any
different results no matter how much
money
the way I I think that's really well
said Chaz um and I talk about these
things like yachts and uh sports cars as
a attraction proxies because I think a
lot of guys believe that if they get

[53:01]
lot of guys believe that if they get
those things then that will solve their
attraction problems right the only way
to solve the attraction problem is by
behaving more attractively with women
and I think this is a consequence of a
failure of most men to understand how
female attraction works
which is um I I think guys have this and
it serves them well in a lot of contexts
they have this like really explicit
problem-solving mentality and it's
almost like okay I have a problem I want
to get sex okay what do I have to do to
get sex okay I have to go out I have to
ask them out uh I'll buy them a drink
I'll take them to a restaurant I'll act
interested and then if I do all those
three things then I have like a 78.2
percent chance that it will end in a
sexual encounter at the end of the night
right yeah absolutely and so they have
that with the dating and and they never
really grew out of that and they just
kind of make the same mistake in a at a
larger and bigger magnitude because now
instead of just you know spending a few
hours on a date buying drinks they're
spending a decade of their life

[54:00]
spending a decade of their life
Building Wealth but they're really doing
it to get the hater to get a
relationship just like they did when
they were broke and so do you think it's
fair to say
that all things being equal a man will
have
um what do you think which man will have
greater optionality with women with
respect to sex and relationships the guy
who doesn't who's kind of broke or is
just sort of like non-remarkable with
respect to his status and wealth but has
let's say game and understands how to
how to finesse and talk to women or a
guy who's got all those things and still
has that kind of mentality that we
described
um yeah game game pretty much beats
everything
I'm curious why yeah okay you take them
you take a broke guy right
I used to work in the jail as a guard
and um I saw a phenomenon that was one
of the most amazing things I saw guys
who were locked up in jail of all Races
with

[55:02]
with
a lot of times really good looking women
who had good careers
and I was like this is at first I
started haitially on the outside so they
were still like waiting the woman would
be on it yet
coming down giving a guy money visiting
the guy I mean some of these guys got so
much money that's coming into them from
sometimes three or four different women
um you know and these women paying these
guys are custom girl out on the phone or
whatever you know and she'll still just
come down there and give her money and
put money on his books visit I mean
it's what they do you know and some of
these women they're not all the people
that you would go oh well she must be
some stupid unattractive no they're not
all like that a lot of some of them are
a lot of them are but some of them are
actually really attractive and they have
good careers
and what I've learned by just watching
people and interacting and asking
questions is
like you said a lot of times when you're
successful it's because you've used an

[56:00]
successful it's because you've used an
analytical mind
but
we sometimes you can be more successful
with women and with relationships and
humans when you realize sometimes two
plus two equals five
what do you mean by that
it doesn't always make sense
that it doesn't always have to make
sense some when you're when you're
dealing with a woman right and you're a
person who's like I'm really Analytical
in the way that I think I'm really
logical in terms of my brain how do you
sell something to somebody using logic
oh you don't that's why no one does they
sell an idea they sell an emotion
exactly
no advertising like try our carbonated
high fructose corn syrup because no
they're selling that it's Christmas you
wouldn't buy it yeah you wouldn't buy it
who would buy fast food if they used a
logical selling point
no they they show you the steam coming
off the burger and everybody's having a

[57:00]
off the burger and everybody's having a
good time high five no fat people in
sight and you're like oh man if I have
this burger on a subconscious level
you're like if I have this burger I'm
gonna have a good time
that's what
a person who has game understands how to
sell the experience not that I haven't
yet I could be on your yacht and the
girl that's on your yacht I'm gonna make
her feel like there's a spirit
experience is being provided by me
and it's a part of our situation and our
dating uh even though you're the person
who bought the yacht
and people who have game are good enough
at doing that whereas people who don't
develop games like I'm going to develop
money and that's going to take the place
of game no because even when you get a
girl what is she gonna try to do
separate you from your money
so uh
how do people learn game because I I
don't believe that

[58:00]
don't believe that
the vast majority of men are naturally
confident or that they inherently
understand female psychology in this way
and uh a lot of the advice that you hear
certainly in popular media and in our
culture is almost like it's so wrong it
just
it leads it makes things worse
so um how do people learn game
necessity is the mother of intention you
know was it Benjamin Franklin said they
help me out I think it might have been
necessity's mother invention
so um for most people what ends up
happening the way most people will
develop game is the way same way most
people develop sales skills the same way
most people develop the Hustler
mentality they have to
now some people try to skip the step by
getting money like over there they'll
say I'm not going to date until I get
money so then they don't have any game
the way you develop game is when you're
on the way up especially and even if

[59:00]
on the way up especially and even if
you're already there take away some of
what you have don't use it
talk to people
start learning how to actually have
conversations with people and develop a
relationship out of thin air out of
nothing
how do I go up to this person without
all my fanciest clothes on how do I go
up to this person without a
three hundred thousand dollar watch on
my wrist how do I go up the people even
people I'm not interested in on a
physical level how do I go up to people
and just start developing relationships
with them they can be platonic
relationships they could just be
acquaintances how do I go up to people
and talk to them and have conversations
and start understanding what people
actually want
what do people really want
and what are they willing to do to get
it
when you that's what if you talk to a
hustler or you talk to somebody that's
like a con person a con man con woman
what they are good at is finding out
what you want

[1:00:00]
what you want
exactly what your truest desires are and
when they figure out what you want all
they do is fill in for that
what you really want like most people
are saying oh well a woman wants to be
on a yacht why
see you bought a yacht because you saw
girls on a yacht why do they want to be
on a yacht
you got to figure that part out and
provide that with you and not just the
yacht
what make is it they're looking for the
experience they're looking for what they
believe a yacht means
the status that a yacht provides the
enjoyment the the stuff they saw in the
video where everybody was popping
champagne and they just seemed like they
were having such a good time that's what
they want from that yeah most of them
don't really know what kind of yachty
guy they don't know you know they'll
have much yacht information so would it
be fair to say that because I often say
this to my clients is that if it works
in sales it works in dating and what is

[1:01:01]
in sales it works in dating and what is
in common in both of those things is
that what really seems to be successful
is the ability to cultivate an emotional
experience
absolutely that is can we say that
that's kind of game in a nutshell is the
ability to cultivate an emotional
experience absolutely absolutely and to
make that experience something that they
feel like they can't get anywhere else
um
for people who grew up in the 80s and
90s that was the crack era right in the
80s and 90s they had this like they had
these people that y'all probably some of
y'all younger people may not even know
about crackheads but they would just be
just really on you know just really
after it getting after it and with most
of them
most of them it's not even necessarily
the chemical dependency as much as with
their body and their mind is telling
them is that first high that you got
you're gonna your body tries to chase
that your mind tries to chase that you
chased it on a spiritual level for the
rest of your life they call that chasing
the dragon now because of that that that

[1:02:01]
the dragon now because of that that that
experience that you want to get back
over and over again even if you keep
getting a diminished version of it you
keep chasing it over and over again what
a lot of men don't understand when you
go out with women when you deal with
women if you can create that experience
and that feeling
and tag and tap into something
emotionally one time have you ever
noticed that women would date a guy who
has doesn't seem like he has anything to
offer that you're like why do you keep
going back to this dude well they're
chasing the dragon
that dude
he [ __ ] her really good and that's
part of why she she keeps coming back
and that's certainly part of the uh well
maybe a small amount yeah a person it's
just like what a girl okay but the worst
piece of [ __ ] you ever have in your
life is still good
but how many guys do you know
are chasing after a woman who hasn't
slept with them in three four five six
years sometimes even more

[1:03:00]
years sometimes even more
still chasing still hoping man one day
if I do this she'll come back one day if
I do that she'll come back you might
even look at the girls like she's not
even really that attractive it probably
wasn't even that good or that much
better than the last woman but
she was somehow able to tap into an
experience an emotional connection that
you had and it hit all the factors in
your mind your body your spirit and
because that happened you were going to
chase that for as long as you possibly
can you're gonna you're chasing until
you have nothing left
and what a lot of guys don't really
understand it with guys who have game do
understand I need to create an
experience and as many times as I can
create that experience
It renews This Woman's attraction for me
I don't need it to create it with money
I don't need to create it by doing
spectacular things that matter so much
it's just I need to find out what makes

[1:04:01]
it's just I need to find out what makes
that woman tick and I need to create
that experience some guys created in a
negative way
how did they figure that out I imagine
you can't just ask directly because a
lot of people actually don't know
what what they really want do you think
that's true
absolutely is true well Utah okay the
way um it's like um I actually sold cars
in a couple of different items my father
always say this my father's the greatest
salesman I ever believe and he got the
plaques and everything to prove it he
taught me a lot of stuff about sales and
one of the biggest things is
to sell somebody something you got to
really listen
not just listen to what they tell you
but also listen to what they don't tell
you
so when you look at somebody and you say
you get it say you get a life a nice
girl that you you find attractive you're
just like what makes this girl tick I
don't understand this woman what is it
that I need to know about her that that

[1:05:01]
that I need to know about her that that
these are the things that make that
matter the most to her
well when you want to figure that out
about somebody
don't ask them what the most important
things are ask them about other things
hey you know what's your favorite movie
figure out what movie they like to go
see do they like to go see romantic
comedies
well that means that they want a lot of
times they want that up and down
uh Boy Meets Girl boy loses girl love
story
um
so a lot of times like if you watch a
guy who likes Spider-Man
okay he wants that story about the nerd
who
meets a girl that's the love of his life
he finally gets super powers you get
what I'm saying you can tell a lot about
a guy by that
so that basically kind of goes on the
psychological premise of identification
that that's kind of how movies work and
stories work
identified with certain characters and
that's easier to do than others and
maybe we identify

[1:06:00]
maybe we identify
um almost wishfully like with the people
that we most want to be or would like
most to be and if we're good at kind of
analyzing those themes or that work we
can kind of reverse engineer a person's
self-concept or or what their yeah
desire might be that's interesting
because because what we normally what we
normally identify with the most is
somebody who is the closest to us
transformed into the best version of us
hmm so when we watch a movie or a show
or something like that it's normally
going to be the thing like if you like
like look at Rocky
Rocky's not perfect Rocky's kind of slow
with
um doesn't talk very intelligently he's
poor he's not doesn't have a great
record as a fighter he's somebody who
you say wow this guy's you know he's
kind of a loser he gets this opportunity
this chance
out of nowhere where Apollo Creed says

[1:07:00]
out of nowhere where Apollo Creed says
hey I'll fight you and
the transformation that Rocky takes he
has a he has a mentor and you got to
look and you gotta pay attention to
every piece of the story he has a mentor
that comes in and trains and changes him
into the person that could actually
fight Apollo Creed and be successful
enough to go down to the last second
Rocky loses in the end but Rocky becomes
somebody you can Empire
that wasn't very popular I mean clearly
there was a dozen sequels but I think he
wins in every other movie it's almost
like people couldn't let the story end
with Rocky losing
that's that's another thing that people
don't think about when they think about
relationships why do a lot of women go
back to a guy who doesn't call them why
they call over and over again it's the
Cliffhanger the story didn't win the way
that I want to people chase the happy
ending just like they did with Rocky
they knew when they made Rocky lose that

[1:08:02]
they knew when they made Rocky lose that
fight that you would be so happy to go
see Rocky too
they knew it Rocky loses look at Rocky
three he loses the clever Lane the first
time Rocky's a fantastic movie in other
respects too Stallone I think wrote it
in three days he just like got this
inspiration he sat down and in a frenzy
he wrote the entire script by himself in
a long weekend
and uh it was rejected by I think
hundreds of uh producers because he
insisted that he played the part like a
lot of people a few people expressed
interest in the script and he said no it
has to be me and so it's interesting
because that was his his directorial and
his star debut too so it the real life
story of Rocky kind of parallels the uh
the The Narrative structure of Rocky
which I think is fascinating right it's
about a guy named Chuck webner who's a
well you probably you know like uh
Sylvester Stallone was in the um was in

[1:09:01]
Sylvester Stallone was in the um was in
the audience when he was fighting
Muhammad Ali so that's why Apollo
Creed's character is so much like
Muhammad Ali and webner was a was a
a mob collection guy
um he basically was he's basically Rocky
he's basically rocking Balboa
that's really interesting I've never
thought of it that way as a means to
kind of like indirectly
uh analyze what a person might really
want
that's that's really interesting I wanna
I wanna pivot one more um to one more
Direction which is okay most guys don't
have game most guys don't even
understand the importance of game
um but let's talk about something that
can happen once you become successful uh
with game it's almost like I think the
cynicism that comes with being a
successful salesman like you because
you're an ad exec at Coke and make

[1:10:01]
you're an ad exec at Coke and make
you know billions of dollars for that
company
and feel rightly accomplished in your
ability to do so but at the same time I
gotta believe in your heart of hearts
you're like I'm manipulating people into
buying carbonated sugar water
you know what I'm saying and it's like
the fit once you realize as a man what
women actually respond to and what
dramatically increases your chances of
sex and relationships
I think it can make a person cynical
um sure because a lot of the things that
men would like to be I think most men
would like to be honest and forthright
and direct and
uh let's say transparent and to show
they say hey I really like you and and
to and to be that version of themselves
that doesn't usually work in the vast
majority of context and I think guys
have to struggle with this idea like I
kind of have to be this version of
myself that I don't like as much

[1:11:01]
myself that I don't like as much
or I have to be the version of my cycle
like more and and suffer the um the
lower outcome rate associated with women
I don't think that I don't think you
even have to make a choice between the
two
um you know one of the things is
there's multiple ways that you can do
the same thing like if you're a Salesman
there's a couple different types of
salesmen some people sell you by making
you feel like you know something's way
better than it really is and some people
sell you by selling you on their honesty
and selling you on themselves you got to
understand that there are going to be
people who respond to that just as much
as they respond to whatever gamesmanship
or whatever type of
um false narrative you might try to sell
most of the time if you're if you are
somebody who's accomplished enough that
you that that you've been able to do
some of the things you want to do with
your life and it doesn't even have to be
major
um but if you if you feel good enough
about yourself you feel good about
enough about the product that you're

[1:12:00]
enough about the product that you're
selling you don't really have to lie to
anybody you just tapping you just tap
into the parts you just let that person
know what they want to buy
see this is the thing like if you're so
if I was selling you a car
and I sold cars for a long time if I'm
selling you a car there's people who are
trying to make you want to buy a car and
you don't want to buy
those people will never get your family
members to buy from them
they'll never get you to bring person
after person to them to where they don't
really have to do much work but you take
somebody who says I you tell me what you
want
if we got it here I'm going to show you
why this is this is it you may have all
the things like I said before people
usually don't know what they want they
just have a stack of things that are
good but what I'm gonna break down from
you is I'm gonna say what exactly is it
that you really want not just from what
you tell me but what I've observed from
you what you really want you want
somebody that's going to be as a mentor
to you I can tell that by some of the

[1:13:01]
to you I can tell that by some of the
lack of direction that you might have
so if I know that I'm that type of
person anyway all I'm going to do is do
my actions and words I'm going to show
you how I met and create that experience
of mentorship now you come back to me
for that over and over again if you're a
person that once
um to have an exciting time or you want
somebody that's going to protect you if
I know that I'm that person anyway all
I'm doing is showing you that this is
what you're supposed to be buying the
the customer needs Direction
I tell women this all the time
the the guy probably wants most of the
things that you have to offer
we know he wants at least one of those
things let's be real so why are you
struggling to sell him that the reason
why because he doesn't you're not saying
here this is where it is this is what
you these are the things that I know you
want and it's right here
when you deal with women if you if you

[1:14:01]
when you deal with women if you if you
figure out what they actually want
most of the time you have a lot of the
things that they actually want maybe not
the stuff that's on that list it doesn't
matter like oh well I'm not six foot
five chairs and I don't make 600 million
dollars a year and I don't have five
Jets well what did what do they actually
want why do they want to be on the yacht
why do they want to be on the jet
why if you start figuring out why and
not just the thing the metal in in the
leather and all that if you figure out
what it actually is that they want
nobody really wants a burger
from a fast food restaurant
somebody has a need
they don't want the cholesterol and all
the other stuff that goes along with it
they have a need and that restaurant
show them here's how you're going to
fill this particular need
so they don't necessarily need to be on
it yeah they need all the things that
they feel go with that you may not have

[1:15:02]
they feel go with that you may not have
it yet
but you could say look I know you want
to have a good time I know you want to
feel connected with your friends and you
want your friends to be jealous of you
because you're doing something that they
can't do here's how I can provide that
experience even though I may not have a
yacht even though I may not have any
money to spend on you
but the shortcut for a lot of guys
is money here I don't really know how to
create any experience so I'm gonna go to
my bank account get a whole bunch of
money out and throw it on top of you and
then hope that you're gonna that you're
gonna like me
okay well this has been a fascinating
conversation
um we're nearing the end how about we
talk as a closing
idea uh based on what we've been
discussing of late like with game and
successful women what do you think might
be one of the easiest things that men

[1:16:03]
be one of the easiest things that men
can begin to implement like today to
move the needle in the direction of
getting what they want from women
the easiest thing that you can Implement
today without doing any other work is
just go up and actually talk to people
not with an agenda not like oh I want to
smash tonight just go up and start
talking to strangers
men and women
anybody you see on the street
talk to strangers once you start getting
more used to talking to people and
listen and actually start listening to
what they want their hopes their dreams
that's going to make it easier for you
to deal with any woman
so not only because it would help you I
imagine to overcome the approach anxiety
of just striking up absolutely with um
right but also gives you it also gives
you the cues to listen for

[1:17:01]
you the cues to listen for
when you're doing it you can listen so
much more intently with somebody that
you're not
physically interested in it you know
when somebody's talking to you start
you're just listening like oh you know
dang I mean wow that's crazy and you're
not trying to impress
you're not trying to get their
conversation your conversation your
talking points out you're just listening
most of the time
and you start realizing you know what
the woman that I was talking to a couple
weeks ago told me a whole lot of stuff
that I wasn't listening to because I was
trying to say I got a yacht I was trying
to say I got a plane I was trying to say
I got money but if I'd have been
listening I would be like you know what
damn she she told me some of the cues
and some of the things that I could have
used and I could have called back to and
made her see like you know she's like
you when you're telling jokes or
something like that you're you're
reading the audience and you're bringing
stuff back around that's what makes a
comedian funny if you're not if you're
not listening and you're not paying

[1:18:00]
not listening and you're not paying
you're just trying to get your your
jokes off or you're just trying to get
whatever you want to tell them oh I got
I'm a CEO Fortune 500 company I got
money
you know you don't even know what you
should be saying it's like when you sell
a car to somebody and they're like yeah
you know I got five kids and then you
you say yeah man this Porsche that I got
right here bro you know it gets uh from
zero to 60 however long you know like
brought in okay thanks for that yeah

gotta listen
