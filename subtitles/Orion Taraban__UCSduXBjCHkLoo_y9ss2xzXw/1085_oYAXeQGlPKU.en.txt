One thing I say is that in sexual
relationships, inequality is the rule,
not the exception. So both sides
generally pick on the double standards
in which they are the unprivileged
party, but they tend to sweep under the
rug those double standards from which
they benefit. And maybe the
disproportionate number of double
standards tend to cancel each other out
in the wash. So, I don't I don't think
that we should be striving, nor do I
think it's even possible to eliminate
all the double standards and for men and
women to really have the same
experience. I don't think that's going
to happen ever, and certainly not
anytime soon. But the argument I make in
the book in chapter 3 is that this is
actually an economic thing. And you see
it, for example, in a soccer game. So,
when one team is up 3-0, they switch to
defense. It's their game to lose.
&gt;&gt; The team that's down will switch to more
and more offense. It's their game.
risks.

It has to do with who is in the more
privileged position at any one time. And
it just so happens that for most of

it just so happens that for most of
their singlehood,
women are the more powerful player in
the sexual marketplace. The average
woman from 18 to 30 is far more
attractive and and enjoys greater
optionality than the average man. Now,
that tends to shift from the 30s and
beyond, but like a man who becomes very
famous and very wealthy, he switches to
defense, dude. He's got more to lose by
one woman with a paternity suit or
somebody uh ruining his reputation.
