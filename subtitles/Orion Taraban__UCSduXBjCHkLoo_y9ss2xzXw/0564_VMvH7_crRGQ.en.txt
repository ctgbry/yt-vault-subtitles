I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is listen to
yourself so at this stage of my career I
do a lot of consultations with men from
all over the world and since most of
them now find me through my YouTube
channel I do a lot of consultations
about
relationships and a lot of guys come to
me looking for a more or less objective
third-party gut check on their current
relationships should they continue to
progress the relationship in the
direction of more invested commitment or
should they walk away now for the record
I've recommended both I'm not anti-c
commitment sometimes I don't hear
anything concerning and the general
orientation is move forward with caution
but frankly more often than not the
things that come out of a man's mouth in
the first few minutes of a consultation

[01:00]
the first few minutes of a consultation
is usually more than enough to dissuade
me from progressing the relationship if
I were in their shoes and this is
curious because I often talk to guys who
on the abstract level at least seem to
be fairly knowledgeable about women in
relationships in the sexual Marketplace
in general but for whatever reason
probably because they've already decided
to become emotionally involved with
these particular women and because
they've already progressed the
relationship to this point they can have
a lot of trouble applying these abstract
Concepts to their own particular cases
so I'm going to save a lot of men a lot
of trouble today because I've been
having these consultations a lot
recently before you call me up or you
hire someone else or talk to a therapist
or a life coach or whatever just listen
to
yourself open a recorder app and record
yourself I'm serious literally record

[02:00]
yourself I'm serious literally record
yourself talking about your relationship
concerns for 5 minutes you can then use
one of those AI speech to text
translators to turn that into a document
so you can see your own thoughts in
black and white then imagine that this
document was sent to you from a good
friend about his
relationship how would you
respond examples of things that I've
heard in just the past week or so from
Men on this topic are sometimes she just
explodes at me or she picks fights with
strangers in public and expects me to
step in and protect her or I'm not that
sexually attracted to her and we haven't
had sex in 3 years or I pay all the
bills but she still won't sleep with me
or we actually don't know who the father
is because she was sleeping with several
different men at the time or she says
she's a borderline but I hear that there
are treatments available for that or
she's on three kinds of psychiatric
medic ations or she's put on 50 pounds

[03:02]
medic ations or she's put on 50 pounds
in the last year or she makes fun of me
in front of my friends etc etc
etc gentlemen you need to listen to
yourselves you need to listen to the
words that are coming out of your mouth
and to be fair I think a lot of you guys
already know the answer to your own
question and I can understand your
hesitation I've been there myself it's
very difficult to pull the plug on a
nonfunctional relationship in which
you've already invested a great deal of
time energy and money like it's going to
be painful it's going to hurt and it may
hurt for a while it's not something that
you will immediately get over and no one
is enthusiastic about entering into a
painful situation I get it but the other
side of this is as hard as it's going to
be it will never be easier to go through
with it than it is today day like the

[04:01]
with it than it is today day like the
reason why it's going to be hard is
because you've invested so much time
energy and money and the longer you
hesitate the longer you procrastinate
that decision the more time energy and
money you continue to invest making the
eventual decision even more difficult
than it otherwise would be so it's hard
to walk away from a relationship but it
will also never be easier to do so than
it is today now before we go any further

appreciate it thank you very
much gentlemen listen to yourselves and
pretend what you're hearing is coming

[05:01]
pretend what you're hearing is coming
from someone else it's so much easier to
see clearly when you're not emotionally
invested in the outcome and remember if
you're still not sure how to proceed
after some weeks or months of
deliberation that's your answer that's
your answer to paraphrase Mark Manson if
it's not a [ __ ] yes it's a no and this
is especially relevant with respect to
the question of marriage you have to
understand that to a woman getting
married in today's day and age is like
hitting the jackpot it's a winfall that
can acrew her hundreds of thousands if
not millions of dollars over the course
of a lifetime irrespective of whether
the union lasts like there's a reason
women show off their rings on social
media and men don't if someone just
gifted me $100,000 I'd dance around and
show it off too and if if you move
forward with having children you're

[06:01]
forward with having children you're
going to be dealing with this person at
least for the next two decades whether
it works out or not so one there's
really no hurry to make a decision and
two you should be fairly enthusiastic
about the idea before moving forward
this is because as far as I can tell
it's actually very difficult to be
married and have kids so you're going to
want to be able to Coast at least for a
little while
on your enthusiasm motivation and
positive regard to get you through those
inevitably Hard Times let me make this
abundantly clear there is absolutely no
reason to be fighting in the courtship
phase of a relationship if you're
already fighting why are you there why
are you there it's like if there's ever
ever going to be a time time for the two

[07:00]
ever going to be a time time for the two
of you to just spend time together and
enjoy yourselves it's now and if you
can't manage to do that when there is
little to no responsibility or
obligation when the stakes are very low
and everything is new and exciting then
my dude you are never going to have that
ever ever with that
woman do not be misled by the modern
therapeutic promise that everything you
want is on the other side of mutual
understanding and effective
communication and emotional processing
and couples counseling and Sex Therapy
like [ __ ] that [ __ ] that like even if
you could get what you want after doing
all of those things which is an
uncertain Prospect at best it probably
wouldn't be worth it because there are
satisfying relationships you can have
with other women that don't require you
to go through all of that

[08:00]
to go through all of that
men you need to get comfortable cutting
things off with women at the first signs
of bad behavior don't rationalize them
away don't think you can work through
them and don't expect that things will
magically get better if you've never
seen them to be good to begin with
listen to
yourselves objectify yourself monologue
and imagine your concerns were coming
from a good friend what would you tell
him and then take your own [ __ ]
advice be smart out there gentlemen what
