i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is
overcoming emotional manipulation
so i have a slightly controversial
perspective on this subject
which is that it's not actually possible
to emotionally manipulate
another person however what is subject
to occurring
is that we end up emotionally
manipulating ourselves
so let me explain the way that this
self-manipulation
generally works is that another person
succeeds
in saying something or doing something
that provokes a distressing negative
emotion inside of us
and we all have emotions that are just
way more difficult to deal with than
others for some people it's guilt
for other people it's fear for another
group it's envy or jealousy
whatever the emotion is this other
person has succeeded in triggering the
emotion inside of us
and what seems to happen within the
subjectivity
of that emotional response is that we

[01:00]
of that emotional response is that we
now have no choice
but to agree to something that we
wouldn't otherwise do
in order to appease the apparent source
of the emotional distress
which we see as the other person
however the fact of the matter is that
that person's words or actions
didn't actually cause that negative
emotional response inside of you
if they did they would pretty much cause
the same negative emotional response in
others which we can fairly safely assume
isn't universally the case it's more
accurate to say
that the other person's words or actions
were stimuli
for certain judgments associations or
memories within your own mind
and that your emotional response is a
reaction
to these inner psychological events or
to put it another way
no one can actually make you feel a
certain way without your being complicit
to a certain extent in the decision your

[02:00]
to a certain extent in the decision your
feelings are your responsibility
okay so accepting that is true now that
i'm
holding this negative emotion the trick
to withstanding the bid to appease the
apparent source
is to increase your capacity to tolerate
that specific negative emotion and this
basically means your ability to feel
something to feel that despair to feel
that terror to feel that rage
without doing anything about it to think
it's gonna be okay this isn't what i
would prefer to feel right now
but the feeling isn't going to kill me
and i can withstand its pressure
without necessarily taking action in
fact
the feeling is probably going to go away
all by itself in 15 or 20 minutes
if i don't do anything so all i need to
do
is get through the next quarter hour
without making a decision
that will make my situation much much
worse in the long run
i don't need to appease the apparent
manipulator

[03:00]
manipulator
just to escape this distressing emotion
a few minutes earlier than i otherwise
would
i'm going to tolerate this emotion i can
watch it fluoresce
crescendo and diminish over time
and i can come out on the other end of
that emotional experience without having
compromised my values or sacrificed my
agenda
so the trick to dealing with emotional
manipulation is on the one hand
becoming increasingly aware of the ways
in which we trigger
ourselves and taking responsibility for
our emotional responses
and on the other hand increasing our
capacity to tolerate those negative
emotions
once they do appear whatever you're
feeling it will
change over time and you don't
necessarily have to do
anything to speed up that process thanks
