Ladies, a lot of you specifically
indicate on your dating profiles that
you are not interested in short-term
sexual relationships or one night
stands. While this might sound
inoffensive enough, I would discourage
you from adopting this position and I
certainly would not recommend explicitly
saying this on your profile irrespective
of your personal beliefs. Now, on the
surface, this position seems reasonable.
After all, how are you going to get a
long-term relationship if you're playing
around with one night stands? Why should
you waste your time pursuing something
you don't want at the expense of what
you do? And this perspective would
actually be reasonable were the
assumption on which it is predicated

different relationship pathways. that is
that the path to a long-term
relationship is objectively different
from the path to a short-term
relationship. And that is not the case

single pathway to relationship. The
difference between a short-term and a

qualitative. They don't take different
paths. It's quantitative. The only real
difference is when they end. To get
married, you do the same things you do
to get laid. You just do them longer.
