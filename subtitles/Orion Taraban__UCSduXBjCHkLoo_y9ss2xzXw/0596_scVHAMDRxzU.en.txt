I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is you don't
need money to get women this is a very
common misunderstanding among men and
like many misunderstandings it actually
has a grain of truth to it that has
subsequently been misinterpreted or
overgeneralized the grain of Truth is
that all of the things being equal if a
woman is presented with two otherwise
identical options and one is Rich and
one is poor then she is almost certainly
going to select the rich man in the
sexual Marketplace like why wouldn't she
however this just means that having more
money is generally seen as an asset to
women in actuality you don't need money
and you absolutely don't need to be rich
in order to get access to women I know
this from personal experience and I know
this from working with thousands of men
let me speak for my own experience for a
minute this may come as something of a

[01:01]
minute this may come as something of a
surprise to you but when I was a broke
actor in my 20s it was easier for me to
get women than when I was a successful
doctor in my
30s strange but true and I'll talk about
why I think that was the case a little
bit later in this episode my point is
that while you might need money to keep
women around in the long term you
definitely don't need money to get women
in the first place too many men believe
that being high value is just a
euphemism for having high net worth it's
not so let's talk about what's behind
this fascination with money I made an
episode a while back called beware of
attraction proxies that you might want
to check out if you haven't already
attraction proxies are things that we
hope will do the work of attracting
people in Lo of actually doing the work
of attracting people for some guys an
attra ction proxy is a six-pack they

[02:01]
attra ction proxy is a six-pack they
think I just need to get a six-pack and
women are just going to start throwing
themselves at me no that's not how it
works for other guys it's a fancy car
and they think once they see my ride
they're just going to be lining up man
and that's also not how it works like a
man could literally be earning an eight
fig income and some women are simply not
going to care and the women who do care
simply as a consequence of that piece of
information are also probably not the
women that man is going to want to have
to deal with the point is that these
things are not the Silver Bullet that
many men hope they will be every month
I'm telling you I work with guys who fly
private and own Super Yachts who are
looking for advice on how to get laid I
guarantee that there is an unemployed
broke dude living in his parents
basement who is smashing
tonight I guarantee that that is
happening somewhere and that means that

[03:00]
happening somewhere and that means that
there is a woman out there who is
willing to look past all of those things
because he gives her other things and
these other things actually are
instrumentally related to getting laid
now there are three things that help a
guy get women any one will work but if
you have all three even better and the
good news is that none of them will cost
you a dime let's go through them thing
number one is confidence confidence is
the consistent felt experience of
success so it's easier to be
authentically confident with women once
you've enjoyed a sufficient amount of
success with women until you reach that
point however it's possible to be like
psychotically confident it's psychotic
because it's not really predicated on
reality based evidence and it kind of
requires that you turn off a part of
your mind that say remembers all your
past failures or IM all the way things

[04:00]
past failures or IM all the way things
could go wrong and this isn't
necessarily a bad or crazy or unhealthy
thing like football quarterbacks need to
be psychotically confident to some
degree in the sense that they need to be
able to get up after being sacked and
trust that on the next play their
defensive line will hold and they can
get the yardage that they need psychotic
confidence kind of just never considers
that it might not succeed which actually
increases the odds of success all other
things being
equal thing number two is the ability to
engage a woman's emotions this is the
real core of being attractive like one
way to be attractive is to have a
symmetrical face a rugged jawline and
well- defined arms however that's not
the only way you can be attractive by
being humorous and playful you can be
attractive by being mysterious and
unpredictable you can be attractive by
being dangerous and edgy you can be

[05:00]
being dangerous and edgy you can be
attractive by being cocky and bold this
is because attraction is functionally
the ability to capture attention through
emotional engagement you can do this by
being super hot but most of us aren't so
most of us will need to find other ways
to capture attention through emotional
engagement which absolutely exist many
average looking guys have mastered the
ability to engage a woman's attention
through her emotions and these guys do
not have a problem getting laid and
thing number three is being a contextual
Alpha with respect to getting women it's
better to be the biggest fish in a
smaller pond than to be a bigger fish in
a bigger Pond who is not the biggest
fish in that pond and I think this
phenomenon is directly related to the
success that I enjoyed as an actor in my
20s even if I was just performing in
some Fringe theater in New York City if
I was the lead I'd be on that stage for
two hours and during that time a hundred

[06:01]
two hours and during that time a hundred
people would be looking at me and
listening to me and paying attention to
me and applauding me do you see even if
that show was of no particular
significance in the history of the world
like within the mood of that experience
I was the king of that little castle and
occupying the dominant role in a status
hierarchy no matter how small or
potentially ridiculous that hierarchy is
really effective at getting women this
means that even if you're a smalltime
musician playing to eight people in a
dive bar on a Tuesday or you're the guy
that gets everyone together for a magic
the Gathering tournament or you're
hosting a local event on investment
strategy you can occupy the highest rung
on a ladder almost irrespective of who
you are that said you might have to
build the ladder beneath
you okay but expending that effort will
make it more likely that the resultant
social strcture serves your best

[07:00]
social strcture serves your best
interests won't it these three things
confidence the ability to engage a
woman's emotions and being a contextual
Alpha are what actually get man laid
they are not proxies they directly solve
the problem and the more you exercise
these Solutions the more you'll realize
that the belief that all women just want
relationships is wrong like that's a
myth there are plenty of women who just
want to smash there are plenty of women
who just want to have fun however
they're only going to show you that side
of themselves if they're attracted to
you that is if you're able to Capt their
attention through emotional engagement
cars money a six-pack won't help you if
you cannot do this however if you can do
this you don't need the other things so
if you're a man looking to expand a
sexual optionality I would highly
encourage you to learn these things
rather than spend a lot of time energy
and money trying to create indirect and

[08:01]
and money trying to create indirect and
ultimately ineffective solutions to the
problem of access hopefully that clears
a few things up what do you think does
