One way to prevent inappropriate
attachment and its inevitable
narcissistic injury is to think of
yourself as a parking space. You are not
the car, whatever make or model that
happens to be parked there at the
present moment. You are the place in
which the car is parked, the container.
You are the space in which what you have
temporarily exists. And we know that the
having is temporary because all these
things came from some other place and
can only exist in that space because
some other things that were there
previously have left. It's kind of how a
parking lot works, right? So let's apply
this metaphor to some of the most common
inappropriate attachments.
Here's a good one. You are not your
money. As Marcus Aurelius reminds us,
money is a everyone uses it and it
belongs to no one and it would have no
value otherwise. Money circulates.

value otherwise. Money circulates.
That's why we call it currency like an
ocean current. It has to flow otherwise
it's worthless on some level. And how
can you think that you are something
that has belonged to countless others
and that only deres its value as it
leaves your possession? Like, how can
you even think of having something like
that, let alone being it?
