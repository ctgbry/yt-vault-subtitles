on my episode the nature of evil in
games DC asked how do you identify
malicious people this is a great
question unfortunately there isn't a
very
simple answer the fact the matter is is
that a small minority of folks out there
are predators and they are truly
malevolent and malicious and those
predators that small percentage of
people actually account for the vast
majority of really bad behavior that
exists in the world and it can be very
difficult to identify these malicious
people especially with a very small
sample however not to leave you too
empty-handed you kind of want to look
out for
how they treat others when it seems like
you are not watching that's the key A
lot of these predators are very good
about blending in and Optics so you want
to kind of find ways to observe them
when they don't feel like they're being
observed
