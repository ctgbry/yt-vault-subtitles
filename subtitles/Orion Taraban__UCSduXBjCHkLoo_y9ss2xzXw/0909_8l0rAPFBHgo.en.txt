My best explanation as to why there are
so many beta males in positions of power
and authority today. It's a stage in the
process. For the last few decades, we've
collectively been voting the alpha males
out. And this has really only been
possible because women have been able to
forge an alliance with lower status men.
This has largely been done through the
manipulation of emotion, especially
through the concepts of maleness and
masculinity. Across the same timeline,
all of the traits associated with
traditional masculinity, the toughness,
the strength, the stoicism, etc., have
been rebranded as toxic. Impressionable
young people who are typically still
sorting out who they are and who rely
heavily on external approval to navigate
this process have been raised with a
notion of what makes a man good that has
almost entirely been constructed by
women. You can see this most clearly in
the shaming language that women employ.

the shaming language that women employ.
A real man is always defined via v his
relationship with women, never to
himself. And this in turn has created
generations of weak misguided men who
have gotten this way by trying to rise
to the conception of manhood that has
been formulated by Wait minute.
