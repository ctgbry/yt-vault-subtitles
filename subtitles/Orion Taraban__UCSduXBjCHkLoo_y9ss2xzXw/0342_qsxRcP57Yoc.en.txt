I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is dominance
is psychological not physical
this is something I want the men out
there to pay attention to there's a lot
of talk on the internet about becoming a
more dominant man
about becoming an alpha man and this
process is almost always tied to some
sort of physical attribute lift weights
get bigger get stronger and I'm not
saying that those are not worthy goals
men all things being equal you should
strive to be in the best shape of your
lives however there is an important way
in which this advice tends to do men a
disservice and that's what I'm going to
talk about here today but before I do
please remember to like this episode And
subscribe to this channel it takes less
than a second costs you nothing and only
a beta wouldn't follow through
so do the thing
now what's the problem with this advice
to get bigger get stronger where this
advice tends to fall flat is equating

[01:01]
advice tends to fall flat is equating
pure physicality with dominance
I'm here to tell you that this is not
the case dominance is not physical
dominance is psychological and here's
how you already know that I'm right
have you ever seen like this big
powerful dog
absolutely cowed by one of those yappy
little lap dogs I'm sure you have at
some point in your lives they're this
big German Shepherd getting bossed
around by this little Chihuahua for
whatever reason that German Shepherd
forgot what it was forgot that it was
literally 10 times bigger than that
Chihuahua that I could bite through that
Chihuahua's trembling Little Neck
and that Chihuahua was able to
psychologically dominate that German
Shepherd and once that happened
all the German Shepherds fangs all of
its strength all of its viciousness and
intelligence were rendered absolutely
irrelevant

[02:01]
irrelevant
and that's because the psychological
maintains dominance over the physical
if you can dominate the psychological
then you can also dominate the physical
that it in turn dominates
this is true across mammalian species
and it's certainly true in the domain of
Human Relationships and here's an
interesting corollary to all this in the
majority of relationships that I am
personally aware of the woman is more
dominant than the man
and why is that is it because the woman
is bigger or stronger than the man
absolutely not
if you took an average man and an
average woman and put them in a No Holds
Barred bar brawl I mean it wouldn't be a
fair contest the vast majority of men
would just wipe the floor with the vast
majority of women and I think that's one
of the reasons why we don't do that in
society we all kind of understand that
it's just not a fair fight
but here's the counter argument if you
took an average man in an average woman
and put them in a no-hold barred

[03:03]
and put them in a no-hold barred
verbal argument
that contest would be just as unfair in
the average woman's favor
it would be an emotional
like metaphorically lying on the ground
wondering if anyone got the license
plate of the truck that just ran him
over women are far more Adept on average
let's say in
the emotional and psychological martial
arts
and it's here on the field of emotion
and psychology where the contest of
dominance is actually fought in society
so why is this important men if you're
out there trying to get those gains
thinking that bigger guns or higher T
will automatically translate into being
perceived as an alpha you're not
grounded in reality
that's not how it actually is
remember the German Shepherd and the
Chihuahua don't neglect your Fitness but

[04:00]
Chihuahua don't neglect your Fitness but
also don't pretend that it can give you
more than it can
it might also be a good idea to learn
how to spar verbally
so that you can
kind of put up a a decent fight
if it comes down to it
uh what do you think let me know in the
comments below and thank you for
