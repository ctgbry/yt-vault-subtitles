I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why buy
the
cow so if you weren't aware you should
know that I published my first book less
than two weeks ago it's called the value
of others and it's the product of nearly
10 years of deep critical thinking and
research on the topic of mating and
dating basically I attempt to provide a
single model to explain the behavior of
both men and and women in the sexual
Marketplace which is no easy task this
book does not simply compile my old
episode scripts it's overwhelmingly new
content and I don't expect to discuss
much of this content on the channel
moving forward however to give my
audience a taste of what's in the book
I'm going to put out a few episodes that
touch on ideas you'll find within its
Pages this is one of them so if you like
what you hear please consider buying the
ebook audiobook or the paperback version

[01:00]
ebook audiobook or the paperback version
links in the description below and be
sure to listen to the end of this
episode for the big
reveal all right why by the cow is the
first half of a somewhat snarky
observation about dating that I'm sure
you all know namely Why by the cow if
you can get the milk for free this
comment alludes to men's observed
hesitancy to provide additional
commitment or resources to a woman who
is already providing him with sex since
in general no one will pay more for the
same good when it can be acquired for
Less men's hesitancy is less about
emotional immaturity and more about
economic rationality and to be fair
there used to be a fair degree of Truth
in this observation the operative words
being used to be in point of fact this
statement no longer applies to the
current sexual Marketplace and
attempting to implement its implied
advice I.E to make men pay for milk is

[02:01]
advice I.E to make men pay for milk is
unlikely to achieve the desired outcome
let me
explain it used to make sense that men
wouldn't buy the cow when they can get
the milk for free however this truth
presumes a Marketplace in which milk is
generally
sold if every other vendor in the
marketplace is selling milk and a buyer
can get the same or comparable milk
without paying that is a great benefit
to the buyer
he's basically securing a desirable good
at a discount and since no one will pay
more for the same good when it can be
acquired for Less it is very unlikely
that the buyer in question will
voluntarily Pony up more resources to
secure a good that he has already
succeeded in securing more cheaply this
is why when this occurred in the past
such buyers needed to be coerced or
manipulated into buying the cow if it
were rationally in their best interest
to do so they certainly wouldn't have

[03:00]
to do so they certainly wouldn't have
needed to be shamed into action but
here's the thing we no longer operate in
a Marketplace in which milk is generally
sold just look around you For Better or
Worse we operate in a Marketplace in
which milk is freely
distributed in today's day and age sex
precedes commitment and in a Marketplace
full of free samples you can't
reasonably expect to charge for a taste
under such incentives the question is
not why by the cow when you can get the
milk for free it is why by the cow if
you have to pay for the
milk if buyers have a choice between
buying the cow or buying the cow and the
milk why would they pursue the latter
option it's too expensive as there are
now two incurred costs instead of one
like what is so special about your milk
that you can possibly expect people to
pay for it when vendors all around you

[04:02]
pay for it when vendors all around you
are handing out free
samples you can argue about whether this
is how things should be until you're
blue in the face but it's not going to
change anything this is the reality of
the Contemporary sexual Marketplace and
it's probably not going to change
anytime soon what this means is that in
the vast majority of cases when women
attempt to make men pay for milk all
they do is succeed in pricing themselves
out of the sexual Marketplace this is
because they are functionally demanding
a higher price point for a comparable
good that can be acquired more cheaply

below please check them out as this is
your way to support this Channel and its
Mission I really appreciate it thank
you in the modern day women need to
understand that insisting on commitment
prior to sex is equivalent to selling a
car
without
wheels what does that mean the fact that
a car has wheels does not motivate
anyone to buy a car this is because we
expect cars to come with wheels you do
not secure a sale by providing Wheels
with your car however a car without
wheels significantly demotivates anyone
from buying you functionally ensure that
you will not secure a sale by not
providing Wheels with your car providing
wheels does not help help you but not

[06:01]
wheels does not help help you but not
providing wheels absolutely hurts
you attempting to sell a car without
wheels for the same price as a car with
wheels would be
Madness you would be priced out of the
marketplace and no one would buy it you
could only sell a car without wheels at
a significant discount to offset the
total cost to the buyer of acquiring a
fully functional automobile that's the
only way you could sell that car by the
same token insisting on commitment prior
to sex in a Marketplace in which sex is
freely given prior to commitment is to
insist on a much higher price point for
a comparable good that can be acquired
more cheaply elsewhere and since they
are apparently not interested in
transacting at a discount like our
wheeless car owners such women price
themselves out of the marketplace unless
they provide something of additional

[07:00]
they provide something of additional
value to the man that offsets the
relatively higher cost of their sexual
opportunity and that their inter seexual
competition either cannot or will not
provide that was complicated so I'll say
it again such women price themselves out
of the sexual Marketplace unless they
provide something of additional value to
the man that offsets the relatively
higher cost of their sexual opportunity
and that their in seexual competition
either can not or will not
provide and the only thing that really
meets all of those
criteria is
Purity in today's sexual Marketplace
women can realistically only put their
sexual opportunities behind the pay wall
of commitment if they are virgins or
have an extremely low body count this is
because men highly value Purity in no
small part because it's getting harder
and harder to find and this might offset

[08:00]
and harder to find and this might offset
the relatively higher cost of the sexual
opportunity however the more women
participate in the sexual Marketplace
the less they will be able to provide
this compensatory good in general the
older they get the less effective the
strategy becomes for any given
woman so if the question is now why buy
the cow if you have to pay for the milk
how do women differentiate themselves in
a sexual Marketplace in which sex
precedes
commitment well if everyone is is
handing out milk you stay competitive by
offering the richest creamiest milk
around I've already said this in other
ways in other episodes milk exists on a
spectrum from tasteless skim to Rich
heavy cream and I'm telling you ladies
once a man gets a taste of cream he will
not want to go back to skim more than
anything else this will motivate a man
to take that cow off the market to

[09:03]
to take that cow off the market to
ensure that he has exclusive access to
that frothy delicious leche he will not
want any other men in his
Dairy however if all a cow produces is
tasteless skim there is absolutely no
need for a man to take that cow off the
market because he knows that no other
guy is going to do it just keeping it
real okay thanks for watching all the
way to the end of the episode so what's
the big reveal the big reveal is that
the idea presented in this one episode
constitutes just a few paragraphs of my
432 page book another way to say the
same thing is that my book the value of
others is equivalent to 500 unreleased
fulllength psyx episodes it is packed
full of unflinching truths about the

[10:00]
full of unflinching truths about the
sexual Marketplace and the game of
mating and dating so if you like what
