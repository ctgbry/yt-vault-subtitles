hi everyone I'm Dr Orion taraban and I'm
thrilled to be able to sit down today
with Alex Leon thanks for coming on the
show man it's really great to finally
meet you for those of you who don't know
Alex is a member of the naturals
lifestyle YouTube channel I think this
is one of the best
channels on the internet with respect to
pickup and seduction I personally
followed this channel for seven or eight
years so uh it's a personal treat to me
to be able to meet you today Alex and
I've also referred a number of my
clients over the years to content on
this channel because among other things
I think the folks on the channel like
Alex do a really good job of exploding a
lot of the myths around pickup and
seduction it doesn't have to be cheesy
it doesn't have to be extroverted you
don't have to have a six-pack there's
ways of
meeting girls in real life that is
non-creepy non-sketchy and more likely
to lead to a satisfying encounter or a

[01:00]
to lead to a satisfying encounter or a
relationship and I think these guys are
no nonsense but also not
um sensationalistic or
um you know just trying to racket body
count either so I think they're really
balanced they seem like like
well-rounded humans which is another
reason why I enjoyed listening to their
content
as we all are Alex also has his own
YouTube channel that he has launched a
few months ago Alex Leon is that the
handle here
okay yeah check him out because I'm sure
he's putting out some excellent content
these days so thank you so much for
being on the channel Alex happy to have
you
hello Ryan thank you so much for having
me first of all it's an honor uh I
checked your channel great stuff I love
it and yeah we were just chatting before
I really appreciate you as a
professional in the field you know
sending us clients that really means a
lot to to me and the whole team oh right

[02:00]
lot to to me and the whole team oh right
on well deserved so
um let's let's jump in because you're an
expert in pickup and seduction you've
been in this space for a long time
you're it's your primary business is
coaching people
um I work with a lot of guys who are
interested in overcoming approach
anxiety
but I also monitor the comments and sort
of the the Timbre
of male opinion on the channel and
otherwise and it seems like pickup has
sort of a a bad name these days
um and a lot of guys are afraid of
approaching not just I think because of
the let's say the organic fear of
rejection that may come from a pickup
attempt but a fear of being canceled a
fear of being creepy
um would you speak to this to some
extent like what's the state of pickup
these days
yeah good question uh I guess
dudes are afraid of the term pickup

[03:00]
dudes are afraid of the term pickup
because it's a term that's been used for
so many years by various dudes various
channels the media right pick up artists
it's like the Artistry of like
manipulating women and stuff like that
so I do understand why guys are worried
uh the reality is totally different
though right I would just not use the
word pickup I don't like to call myself
as a pickup teacher a pickup artist or
pickup company uh because of the same
reason I think it's about connection
um You can call it seduction but even
that you know has some negative
annotations sure let's call it
connection because really what we're
doing at the end of the day it's quite
simple it's like we as men want to
connect with a woman and we are offering
her
the invitation to a connection right
like that's really what it is at the end
of the day it's just like we're walking
up to a girl on the street and we say hi

[04:02]
up to a girl on the street and we say hi
and basically that high means do you
want to communicate do you maybe want to
connect for like 30 seconds and then she
can say no she can say maybe she can say
yes in her own way right prefer body
language with her words
um and that's what we do and that's what
I've been doing for a long time
personally because I was
I had the biggest approach anxiety
uh we can talk about that if you want
but I was like a total zero when it came
to that and that's what bothered me a
lot uh and I made it here and I see it
with my clients over and over
in the ladies eye approach and they
approach because I'm listening in on the
microphone women love being approached
so for everybody who's just never done
approaches
and the only input they get is maybe
like Sensational YouTube videos where
you know maybe a person like gets really
angry or where like one pickup artist
is in the media for doing something
horrible

[05:01]
horrible
that's the loud minority right at the
end of the day most people are just
normal people who want to connect so
that's interesting yeah so this is
a counter factual to a lot of men's
beliefs that the way to get to know a
woman is by asking her out on a date and
it's like the bait is a drink or a meal
or some sort of activity but you're
saying that really what a woman is most
interested in is the opportunity to make
an emotional connection with another
human being is that kind of what you're
getting at here of course yes and so
especially if you think about it the
kind of woman you know who we want a
dinner or a drink is like she's abundant
in dinner offers and drink offers you
know like how if she is a certain level
of attractiveness
her inbox is full with invitations of
that caliber and much more
so at the end of the day yes she wants

[06:00]
so at the end of the day yes she wants
connection so it's a way of offering
something different to stand out from
the intersexual competition and it
doesn't cost you anything I mean that's
another
point of resistance I often come up
against in the comments is people think
that you have to have a lot of money to
date and
um it's just not worth it but it seems
it sounds like what we're really
offering is a chance to get to know
another human being on a deeper level
and I think that means being able to
well that's interesting because the way
that you're describing it
correct me if I'm wrong but it almost
seems like there is no agenda here when
we know that men are approaching certain
women and not other women you know
they're approaching women that they are
attracted to
so you would think that there's some
sort of intention
where they want the interaction to
potentially lead
but it almost sounds like you're kind of
a gentleness when you speak about just
making a connection with another human
being is that part of the um
they probably definitely have an agenda

[07:00]
they probably definitely have an agenda
so I would say when you say I have an
intention
but I don't start with the intention of
hey I want to sleep with you because
that's too fast it's too early I don't
know her yet right so let's say in the
scenario
I'm walking through the park I'm holding
my coffee it's whatever 11 A.M
having a walk and I see a beautiful girl
it's like the first intention I have is
not oh my God I want to [ __ ] her I don't
know if I can swear here but it's like
oh there is something that spikes
obviously yes she's sexy right I'm a man
she's a woman I'm attracted yes there
was five women passing me that didn't
trigger that so of course the agenda is
Man meets beautiful woman and of course
her beauty is important but the first
intention I should kind of project on
her is like hey I wanna I wanna get to
know you who are you hey what's up right
and then the intention should be hey
uh I wanna know more about you you know

[08:00]
uh I wanna know more about you you know
and then if the connection here is good
it's like hey I want to take you on a
date and then maybe we will go home and
have sex obviously I won't say that to
her that way so there's definitely an
agenda I guess the problem is guys lead
with their dick when they should kind of
lead with their heart and I'm sure if
the heart says yes and the Brain says
yes and the dick says yes amazing right
take her on a date
um yeah that's that's where approaching
can become abrasive or aggressive when
it's just about the beauty right of
course that's what triggers the impulse
but there should be a different
intention first
sounds like there must be a balance here
if you lead too aggressively with the
sexual intent it backfires as I think we
can all mostly understand why I have
worked with some guys who struggled to
communicate sexual intent at some point
in the interaction and the conversation
seems like it's it's sparking but then
it just sort of Peters out and doesn't

[09:00]
it just sort of Peters out and doesn't
go anywhere where they actually succeed
in getting dates and they don't express
that intent and so they kind of end up
in the friend zone or they hear you know
you're a nice guy but I didn't really
feel any chemistry so it is also would
you say important to clearly express
your sexual interest in a woman when
it's appropriate to do so in
in this exchange that's a tricky one
right because there's a big
misconception I think about this whole
term sexual intent I hear that of course
a lot with my clients right and they
write it before they come we send them a
form oh I want to work on my sexual
intent oh I'm not good in my sexual
intent I want to improve my sexual
intent it's like okay what does that
mean do I stand in front of her and I
tell her
like I look her in the eyes with like
you know force or does it mean I'm
becoming flirtatious and I'm
complimenting on her looks or what does
it mean and in my experience
it's more like what you're not doing so
when we talk about man woman what is she

[10:00]
when we talk about man woman what is she
looking at right she's basically
assessing you as a man in a way and what
she's looking at is are you nervous
slash are you confident do you feel okay
right now can you hold eye contact
do you always jump in when she talks do
you leave pauses are you comfortable
with silence
are you comfortable letting her ask
questions or are you always coming up
with the next thing the next thing so if
you are if you leave pauses if you're
okay with leaving space in the
conversation looking her in the eyes
maybe pressuring her on something right
not not being so agreeable on the flip
side of that I believe is the sexual
intent so it's not about the words you
say necessarily sure flirtation is a
thing and being like really good with
words cool but I think that's a bit of a
fantasy in the pickup world of like the
same with texting right I think like I
don't believe there's amazing texting I

[11:02]
don't believe there's amazing texting I
think either she likes you already and
then you sure you don't [ __ ] it up on
text always just doesn't like you and
even if you have the best texting game
in the world it won't turn her around
so that's what sexual intent for me is
it's just like I'm super grounded and I
know what I'm doing and I can hold space
and I can look at her with a smile a
little bit
that's kind of like the the spice on top
right where she feels now she feels sexy
now she feels this is something else
this is not a friendly conversation
anymore this is a guy
being you know being in that sexual Vibe
that's interesting it's very subtle
because what I'm hearing you say is that
just sort of by changing the rhythm of
speech the pauses between interactions
maybe holding eye contact just a beat
longer than you normally would in a
social encounter by making just small
changes in how you behave in the
interaction you can communicate that

[12:00]
interaction you can communicate that
this is a different type of relationship
potentially than just we're fellow
citizens talking in the park
because it's really hard I mean it is a
subtle change but making that change is
incredibly difficult like being able to
just pause and look at a girl and like
not interrupt her and not feeling like
you need to come up with the next thing
just really being okay in silence is
difficult for everybody who's done cold
approach maybe they can relate or for
anybody who maybe even recorded
themselves that can be an eye-opening
experience sometimes of like oh my God I
talk incredibly fast and I talk all the
time and I interrupt her all the time
why am I doing this and it's like
because you think she's really hot
you're nervous yeah I I've seen some of
your infield
and infield Day game and some of the
interactions seem
like plottingly slow I thought maybe
that had to do with the fact that maybe

[13:01]
that had to do with the fact that maybe
English wasn't their first language
because I know you travel all over the
world
um and so you might need to use simple
words at a slow cadence to ensure
comprehensibility but yeah there were a
lot of space in that interaction when I
first started my training as a therapist
someone told me that there's like 40
different types of Silence you know oh
my God stereotypically you got that that
idiom that the eskimos have 40 different
words for Snow Well therapists have like
40 different varieties of silence and
it's not always awkward and I think
that's a um a misconception that people
have that silence means you're doing
something wrong silence that goes on too
long is uncomfortable and it's unwanted
I think it's actually a necessary
component's in tension and release which
is kind of the underlying Dynamic of a
great deal of attraction and seduction
for sure and you know we can even go
back to the beginning of this topic
where we talked about offering her

[14:00]
where we talked about offering her
drinks offering her a dinner maybe even
a holiday
a beautiful woman is abandoned in that
but what is she actually not abundant in
it is that presence it is that space it
is that opportunity for her to maybe
talk about something she truly cares
about right not being bombarded with low
level Small Talk questions and a man who
can hold space for her a man who is
truly present a man who can she can open
up to that is actually
something expensive something valuable
that a lot of women don't experience and
if we even go further
she often let's say she's like really
beautiful right desired by every man she
never gets the opportunity
to
fight for him to seduce him to try to
get him because she always has the
security in her life that she knows this
guy's into me this guy's into me ah yeah
I can easily have him right so it
becomes really boring for her so it

[15:01]
becomes really boring for her so it
sounds crazy but like she's so certain
she lives in so much certainty all the
time
giving her the uncertainty of like nah
you know maybe not texting back so fast
or asking a challenging question you're
giving her the gift of uncertainty of
like I'm not sure if this guy's into me
which is a new experience for her if
she's really attractive yeah I made a
video about that recently about how
using uncertainty and insecurity
strategically is really vital to keeping
passion and passionate attraction alive
even in long-term relationships like we
have this Collective intolerance for
those things uncertainty and insecurity
and I can understand you're really
attracted to somebody you want to kind
of there's this impulse to try to lock
them down as quickly as possible to seal
the deal but what you're saying is that
that's often counterproductive
yeah for sure
let's talk about a main reason that I
hear all the time that guys are afraid
of approaching women in real life maybe

[16:00]
of approaching women in real life maybe
it's reason maybe it's rationalization
but I hear it which is they're afraid of
being perceived as creepy
and creepy is a really challenging word
for me because it seems like it has so
much to do with
the other person's perception of you
like the same behavior in let's say a
man that that woman is attracted to
wouldn't be perceived as creepy but the
same behavior in a woman in a man that
the woman wasn't attracted to is creepy
and and that's tricky because how is a
guy going to know if he's attracted to a
woman before he tries you know
so
would you speak to that I'm sure that
comes up a lot in your in your coaching
yeah
um how do I approach this well let's say
like this
first of all you're right it's
definitely in how does she perceive you
and I would say if you're our normal
dude right like the people who watch
your videos and the people who watch my
videos are not the kind of guys who are

[17:01]
videos are not the kind of guys who are
like how can I
you know get my lay count
by plus 100 as soon as possible like we
don't attract this kind of guys so I
assume even if you're watching this
you're already not a creepy guy okay
you're just shy you just you have
approach anxiety you're just too nervous
to approach you two words whatever it is
so by you doing a normal approach which
means you keep the right distance you
don't touch her right you give a genuine
compliment and then you ask a normal
question you're not being creepy could
it happen that here and there a girl
perceives you as creepy yes and that is
the challenge of just becoming okay with
that
I would say the number one thing about
approaching is social freedom
it's developing a level of social
freedom and if you don't have that
you're not going to succeed because it's

[18:01]
you're not going to succeed because it's
going to be constantly hard you always
have to overcome this like fear right
you're not socially free you care too
much what people think and you care too
much if one in a hundred women which is
the reality will think you're creepy the
reality is one in a hundred will think
you're creepy right and it's like too
bad like let her think that because the
flip side of that is she's only gonna
think it for like 20 seconds
and then she's gonna think about her
boss or her ex-boyfriend or the Metro
comes or she's watching a Taylor Swift
interview whatever it is right it's like
even the worst case which is like oh my
God I'm being discovered as this creepy
guy because my Approach was really
uncalibrated and I bumped into her and
then I dropped my hot dog and then I was
like almost stumbled over this little
kid and like Oh I'm a [ __ ] creeper
and then I told her she looks hot and
not that's too much it's like okay
you're being a creep for 20 seconds it's

[19:00]
you're being a creep for 20 seconds it's
fine you didn't hurt anybody and she's
gonna forget about you if this is too
much right if this once in a is this
fraction of a kind of experience
is the reason you're not doing the other
90 of beautiful approaches and women
thinking you're brave and they're really
thanking you and some women give you
their phone number and some women go on
a date with you and some women have sex
with you
then it's just not going to work out so
you have to accept it that's basically
the thing yes some women will think it
for 30 seconds
deal with it basically yeah that fits
with my experience I've probably done
over a thousand approaches and the worst
thing that ever happened was I got kind
of a
you know kind of just she just turned
away or she did like a no you know a
very cold short one-word answer the vast
majority of women that I approached did
not give me their phone number you know
it's I think that also
I mean you're a pickup I'm sorry you're

[20:01]
I mean you're a pickup I'm sorry you're
a connection expert right but I I kind
of think about this like baseball that
even the Hall of Famers tend to strike
out more than they get hits sure of
course yeah so
um the VA you know the majority of the
time I'm not moving forward with this
interaction it's a one and done thing
but I've never had a woman sort of drink
in my face or slap me or
you know get our friends around to to
kind of like protect her or to angrily
insult me the vast majority of women
were I think authentically
happy with the way that I approached
them because it was I recognized that
they looked very good that they put
effort into their appearance and
that's often why women put effort into
their appearances so that it is yeah and
acknowledged by others and you know I
think that if you do it right you can
leave a person better than when you
found them
get what you want from the interaction

[21:02]
get what you want from the interaction
yeah and I'm always telling on Workshop
is like what's her alternative of
meeting a guy right it's like out of all
the ways she could meet a guy it's like
okay she could
go on a dating app and obviously guys
always complain oh dating apps are so
horrible for men because there's way
more man and you know it's this whole
pyramid and only four percent of women
swipe on 80 of guys another all this
math true right dating apps suck for men
but are they so amazing for women like
they also have a lot of swiping then the
the guy is just texting some horny [ __ ]
sends a dick pic as soon as he has her
number on the date he might be weird you
know the good looking guys then also
kind of weird okay then she can go to
bars you can go to clubs get hit on by
drunk dudes okay as you could sleep with
someone out of her Social Circle now her
whole group knows
it's like oh or she gets approached

[22:00]
it's like oh or she gets approached
during the day by a Charming guy sober
who looks her in the eyes and tell her
she looks beautiful in this dress or
whatever she's like huh it could make
her day you could text your friends
right afterwards you can't believe what
happened to me now she's got this story
even if it doesn't lead to anything
um absolutely the way that I kind of
mentally uh prepare myself to make a day
game approach is I think this is This
Woman's lucky day is oh yeah because I
know who I am and what I could
potentially offer her and I'm just
coming out of the blue it's like she won
the lottery you know this is going to
make her weak that I'm putting myself in
her in front of her and giving her an
opportunity to make a connection with me
yeah that's a great mindset
now another misconception that I come up
against a lot with my clients is that
to do this to approach women in the real
world requires a great deal of
confidence and or extroversion when you

[23:01]
confidence and or extroversion when you
mentioned social Freedom it's
interesting when you said that I
wondered if
that might be part of why
um maybe International
uh Day game might be easier because if
you're in a country where you don't
really know all of the little social
expectations it's easier to not feel
constrained by them
potentially I don't know
um yeah but the uh it's definitely more
fun to approach when you on holiday
because you're like I'm out of here in a
week so yeah you have a bit more
uh yeah permission yeah
the the what I was going to get at was
um oh yeah this whole like extroversion
thing like I have to be on I have to be
very Charming I have to be witty I have
to be hilarious
um and you have a very different vibe
when it comes to that
um both in this conversation and what
I've seen on the channels
I think you could describe it as low

[24:01]
I think you could describe it as low
intensity
so how how does that work with respect
to
um offering women the possibility of a
connection
uh yeah I think both can work and I
always tell dudes
to know themselves right I know I'm
introverted
doesn't mean I'm 100 introverted but I'm
majorly introverted I you know I'm
exhausted after social events I don't
mind being alone I can be calm I don't
need to be the Entertainer
cool and I work with that and then
there's other guys who are the opposite
and they work with that and we both get
great results because we're both in our
role so I think it's often dangerous to
look at you know either other coaches
other YouTubers either dudes in the
manosphere and then think like I need to

[25:00]
manosphere and then think like I need to
become that right it's like I mean the
extreme examples are like Andrew Tate of
like Andrew Tate is good at being
entertained you know he's like this
kickboxing tall kind of aggressive cigar
smoking dude and he's playing that role
really really well that's why he became
so famous right he's just like being
himself well nowadays there's all these
other guys they're like I need to become
entertained I need to talk like Andrew
Tate I need to think like and it's like
but it's not you like and again when we
talk about creating a connection well I
cannot connect with someone who is not
being himself
like that's putting this
wall in front of us you know and women
especially they have a sixth sense for
is this guy being real or is this guy
wearing a mask
and it's like I'm not wearing a mask
when I'm just being my low intensity
calm self
and I'm comfortable in that and
sometimes I don't need to talk and maybe
I come across as shy sometimes but that

[26:01]
I come across as shy sometimes but that
there is a charm in that because I still
do the main thing which is say hi and
give her a compliment right obviously
there's the Other Extreme which is just
I never talk to anyone ever and I don't
overcome that fear yeah that's a problem
uh and then as the other guy is like
more entertaining and he's vibing he's
like making jokes like if I would try to
be that guy it would come off as fake I
could maybe play it for 10 minutes 15
minutes sure I can entertain some people
at a party but like as soon as my
extroverted friends comes back I'm like
all right you take over I'm out of here
you know so that's the main thing like
know yourself there's people watching
they're more extradors people watching
they're more introverted and you should
be in your like natural mood because
women want somebody who's being real
okay knowing yourself is fantastic
advice I imagine though that your
feedback to your coaching clients isn't
just be yourself dude oh yeah that's
horrible advice right yeah that's like
what your mom tells you you know so to

[27:03]
what your mom tells you you know so to
my mind there might be some uh Middle
Ground here the way the word I usually
use is Persona now um a Persona is not a
it's not it's not make believe it's not
like you're trying to be Andrew Tate or
you're trying to be the extroverted
party guy if you're the introverted
person
it's a facet of your personality so it's
grounded in who you are but it's kind of
selectively emphasized in a certain
context or interaction so it's it is
grounded in your personality but it's
not it's a little bit
um more performative
does that make sense yeah we uh What uh
Shea my colleague says uh social Special
Forces I like that expression it's like
you know with weird Special Forces
secret agents trying to be social right
or I like to put my students into a
little bit of a soldier Warrior kind of
move like Yep this is a bit this is a

[28:00]
move like Yep this is a bit this is a
bit crazy right this is a bit of a a
challenge you are a bit fighting against
your inner demons we are a bit at war
with ourselves here out there on the
streets yeah just be yourself you might
be terrified of going on to the
battlefield right so you do have to kind
of access that that part of yourself
that's Brave that's courageous that that
moves towards the challenge or the
danger and that doesn't necessarily come
naturally to I would say most people but
I do think it lives inside of most
people as a potentiality or as a a more
minor persona
yeah so it's kind of like tapping into
the right facet of your personality that
that kind of where you can
you can be in that state sustainably
like you said you could do the extra
version for about 10 minutes then you'll
be exhausted so how can you be socially
sustainable what part of yourself can
you kind of rest in so that this is
um it's not simply just being yourself
but you're not totally performing a role

[29:02]
but you're not totally performing a role
does that make sense yeah
yeah totally I mean I would say again if
you talk about approaching because
quickly background on my you know come
up it's like I was in a technical high
school for five years
which means in Austria you know because
it's a lot of villages you often live in
in a boarding school not because it's so
expensive or so Elite is just like
we live in villages and to bring people
together you have to have a boarding
school otherwise the way to school would
be too far so it was all guys for five
years in that boarding school and some
like technical women in my in my class
so for five years I didn't know anything
about dating then I moved to Nicaragua
for a year I had kind of like the you
know Western exotic bonus there and
girls would approach me and I would get
really drunk in nightclubs and have
success there but then coming back to
Vienna I realized it's been the time
where I like read the game and watched
James's first video and I was like I

[30:02]
James's first video and I was like I
really need to learn this approaching
thing I was like I'm technically smart
you know I'm analytical I'm a good
programmer I'm good at solving problems
I might have a great job one day I might
make good money one day that's all like
looking good but I can't approach anyone
like not even I can't give compliments
to people I can't stop a girl I for sure
cannot tell her she's beautiful that's
crazy and that really bothered me so it
was really eye-opening for me of like
even if I will have everything going on
for me in life like great job income car
it was so clear crystal clear to me that
if I am not able to be that guy as well
right the the guy who pushes himself
enough
to approach strangers and hold up a
conversation and obviously there's way
more to it I'm simplifying now you know
there's like being able to escalate
asking her out stay grounded deal with
rejection deal with
uh her drama and so on like there's way

[31:00]
uh her drama and so on like there's way
more to it be good in bad sexual
escalation and so on if I'm not learning
these skills like what is life about
anyway you know uh so it took me a while
but yeah it's just realizing that how
important that is to be able to reach
out metaphorically and create this
connection
um not because you extroverted because
it's like it's you're surviving like
it's almost a surviving skill you know
it's like I would agree we are here to
reproduce in a very basic way
and like what are you doing here you
know it's like
you mentioned before we hopped on the
recording call that you had terrible
approach anxiety I think that's what
you're alluding to here yeah how did you
personally get over your approaching
anxiety
um honestly so first thing I tried was I
mean I did a lot of like at night drunk
okay then I realized this cannot be
forever like okay I'm young I can still
get wasted three times a week but it's
not sustainable and I tried cold

[32:00]
not sustainable and I tried cold
approach
and I absolutely failed like I was out
with a friend I was walking around the
streets of Vienna back then hours and
hours and I didn't do a single approach
then I downloaded this audio challenge
that makes you do stuff right ask 10
people about the time uh tell 10 people
they have a nice shoes whatever and I
failed within day three it was a 30 day
challenge I couldn't do day four
so really when I changed is when I got
in touch with James and to the Natural
Lifestyles team and couldn't afford
working with them back then and I just
offered my editing skills my photography
skills my web design skills and
eventually James like took up took me up
on that offer and not that I received
like so much coaching from James or
anything like that but just being in
that environment of guys
for whom it was normal to approach I
think that was the biggest shift it gave
me permission right just walking down
the street with like back then like Liam
and Tony just getting a juice and then

[33:02]
and Tony just getting a juice and then
seeing Liam approach a girl and then
seeing Tony approach a girl it's like
huh this is fine this is you know it's
like something switches in your brain
when you're just around the people who
do it
um it's almost like this the first guy
who broke what is it a four minute mile
or something like that and then suddenly
a lot of other people did it and it took
like years before it's kind of like oh
this is fine and then you do it and you
do that environment and that's how
really I I got the hang of it and then
obviously it's hundreds and hundreds of
repetitions by then
um but yeah so having a Social Circle
of man A brotherhood a tribe a wingman
whatever you call it I think is very
very important I hear that I also I mean
you can speak from your own experience I
also feel like the anxiety never goes
away entirely like it can be reduced to
manageable levels but there's always a
little bit of a I I've tried to reframe

[34:02]
little bit of a I I've tried to reframe
it as excitement
um right before a cold approach so it's
I think it's also
men making peace with certain Sensations
in their body seeing them as not
threatening not dangerous and tolerable
and also that's kind of what's fun about
it you know it's it's that there's some
sort of emotional jolt that you might
get from the approach
um that's part of what makes it fun
yeah like your reframe is good of like
yeah it's excitement right I'm excited
I'm about to meet a human oh my God
what's going to happen wow uh another
way that I reframe is like be careful
what you wish for it's like do you want
to feel nothing is that what you want I
don't think so right that would be
boring like what do you do then then you
just sociopathically approaching one
stranger after the other trying to get a
phone number so I'm I'm just trying to
get into gratefulness of like oh yeah
here it is again this feeling I'm

[35:00]
here it is again this feeling I'm
meeting a stranger can I do this yes
I've done it before will you be excited
yes you know I'm gonna make her day like
you said so it's like thanks God I'm not
a robot and I'm a human and I'm about to
meet a stranger what a beautiful chance
what a beautiful experience what uh what
a great gift of life that I'm allowed to
connect with total strangers right
yeah I think that sometimes getting to a
point of emotional indifference at least
with respect to the outcome like whether
I get the date or the number or not can
lead to that social Freedom that you
discussed earlier if we're too hung up
on
um the meaning of the Rejection it can
be constraining and impossible to really
be authentic under those circumstances I
would say that my own yeah that's where
you just set internal goals versus
external goals right the the internal
goal is I did the approach I overcame
that fear I gave her a compliment the
external goal is I got her number she

[36:01]
external goal is I got her number she
went and I was like well that's out of
my control exactly exactly so you can't
rack up numbers or dates or body counts
it's a behavior or an intention that's
within your control because who can
prevent you from doing that except
yourself right so this is entirely
within your locus of control and to me
that's a win
if I if I approach or one of my client
approaches that's a win my story about
this is slightly different
um maybe you've gathered on the channel
That psychology wasn't my first career I
was an actor initially and being an
actor it's like effortless to meet
people you're constantly going to
parties
people are always schmoozing with each
other you're on stage everyone's looking
at you and clapping at you it's it's a
it's a really easy way to to meet women
I never had any problems with that
then I switched careers and became a
psychologist now I went from a very
visible profession to functionally an
invisible profession like no one sees

[37:01]
invisible profession like no one sees
what I do like long they can't see what
I do
um so one of the ways that I teach men
to become more attractive to women
generally is to be visibly competent if
you're really good at something make
sure that people know about it not in
like a and in your face kind of a way
but don't don't hide your talents and
strengths get a YouTube channel get a
cool Instagram account that showcases
what yeah I love that no right because
if you're hidden
life isn't going to make the effort to
find you you know what I'm saying
especially beautiful women who might
have other things to do and yeah they're
not going to go out of their way to
to find the the diamond in the rough you
you do have to give
your best foot forward as it were
so I didn't have I couldn't rely on that
like effortless sociality that I did
when I was an actor so I said okay well
I'm dissatisfied with the dating apps I

[38:02]
I'm dissatisfied with the dating apps I
need to get over I'll I'll meet women in
real life so I would I'd put on a suit
which automatically made me the best
dressed man in San Francisco and I'd go
down to like a meat market bar in uh on
Polk Street and I said okay I'm gonna go
and I'll there's gonna be some beautiful
women here I'll go chat them up and see
what this goes
and I I couldn't do it like I was there
for two hours three hours I just ended
up having two or three drinks by myself
and going home
and I felt like a schmuck and I'd come
home and I'd be beating myself up and
I'd feel ashamed for my cowardice and
then the next week I put on my suitcase
okay this is the week I'm gonna do it
and the same thing happened for me I had
to put on my suit and go down to that
bar I think eight or nine weeks in a row
without talking to this woman
and I think it was the ninth of the
tenth time that I went down there and I
saw a beautiful woman and I and I felt

[39:00]
saw a beautiful woman and I and I felt
the the fear begin to arise in me as
usual
but then I remembered how I would feel
predictably when I left that bar every
night without talking to a woman how I
was so ashamed of myself how I'd feel
cowardly how I would feel alone at the
end of the night
and I got more afraid of that outcome
which was like a guarantee because I had
experienced it nine times in a row I got
more afraid of that happening than
anything I could possibly do to me
often it has to get worse before it gets
better and it's smoking like a
psychologist absolutely yeah
and so what was kind of what motivated
me to to finally overcome that initial
hurdle of approach anxiety is is fear of
not doing
the approach became more painful than
anything that that woman could possibly
do to me
yeah absolutely
that is I mean that's a great motivator
of like
in other words the fear of who will I be
as a man in five years if I don't figure

[40:01]
as a man in five years if I don't figure
this out who will I be as a man in 20
years you know who will I settle with
like which woman will I settle with
becoming my wife
uh if I don't figure out how to be a
strong man how to be a good communicator
how to be good in bed all that stuff
just like
again scares the [ __ ] out of me just
like I want the best I I have potential
and that's how I measure everything like
every conversation has potential every
guy has potential right it's like am I
living up to my potential
and the flip side of that is like I am
not living up to my potential is really
scary to me I hear that another thing
that comes up
when I talk to guys around this issue is
they have some body insecurities they
think that they're unattractive or a big
one is height
and I know that shorter guys do have a
harder time relative to taller guys
especially on the apps women just set
filters and they don't even get to see
them
uh how do you work with guys who get

[41:00]
uh how do you work with guys who get
hung up on some aspect of their physical
appearance
yeah good question and I do work a lot
with them right
um
sure height is a thing looks are a thing
but it's just a small thing right small
okay
uh yeah because first of all it is a big
thing if you focus on it that's the
issue right like guys would almost use
it as an excuse of like oh I can't
approach because I'm short and it
wouldn't work anyway I'm like have you
tried no because it wouldn't work I'm
like you didn't try you know
um I literally just coached a guy
I would love to look up how tall he is
but he's short
and we have it on video actually he was
a okay being filmed
um in the process of the workshop we
just did a four day workshop in Budapest
and you know short guy but he works out
he has a cool job he is very articulate
he's Charming he took advice really well
he literally approached a girl I had a

[42:01]
he literally approached a girl I had a
one-hour session with him he approached
a girl got her number date the same day
took her home the same night next day
Tinder date
even on online date took her home the
same night so he had two like uh you
know bedroom experiences in a row and
he's short and just like he does
everything else right it's like do women
want to date taller guys generally yes
my ex-girlfriend was the same height as
me right uh I'm 175. so I don't know
it's just like 15 in inches we might
have oh yeah
okay
yeah five eight five nine something like
that it's average um I think that's the
average yeah but she you know her
ex-boyfriend was taller but it's just
like I combine other elements as well
sure if you're very short you can do
something with shoes you can do
something uh with the way you dress of
course and if you like let's say if I

[43:00]
course and if you like let's say if I
would be
in a certain inches three inches or four
inches smaller and I would live in
Amsterdam I would probably move out of
Amsterdam right what's that what's wrong
with Amsterdam I was in Amsterdam I felt
really short everybody in Amsterdam is a
giant that is it's insane yeah so like
Dutch people are really tall is my point
it's just like if you're really short in
a country where everybody's really tall
maybe you want to move to a different
country like if it really changes your
life incredibly and suddenly you know
you move to Latin America or Asia or
just a different place in Europe you
know more south and your life quality
changes so much because suddenly you
stand out as attractive and before you
were average then do that you know think
outside the box
uh that's one aspect the other aspect is
we as men have it so good in a way that
we are not uh just rated on our Beauty
women are a lot right that's that is a

[44:01]
women are a lot right that's that is a
fact
um if a woman is very attractive she has
many things in life that a woman is not
attractive doesn't have as a man we can
be born quite short quite ugly and we
can still outwork other men we can work
on our physique we can go to the gym we
can work on our style we can work on our
lifestyle like what a woman coming into
our world what is she getting into what
experiences can I give you what Social
Circle is she entering do I have cool
friends do I do cool stuff on the
weekends I can of course work on my
wealth you know money is obviously a
thing again it's another thing not that
only thing but of course if you can
offer her a cool experience if you use
your money basically cool holiday maybe
you give her a gift you make things
easier you make things smoother you have
a nice apartment cool and mainly you can
your charm your communication skills
your poaching skills your confidence who
you are as a man how you you know the
energy you put out it's like all these

[45:01]
energy you put out it's like all these
elements you can work on
that will way outweigh how you look
I would agree
something that I think that you touched
on on the naturals Channel a long time
ago was the concept of inner game
uh would you mind
telling the listeners what you might
mean by that
yeah I mean the real expert is Shea
um in a game while it's basically your
confidence social Freedom plays into
inner game how you see yourself
um you know your your own perception
like are you the hero in your own movie
and also overcoming these struggles so
in a game is a very broad term is there
a specific question or
or how important in a game is in the
whole okay how about this I think a lot

[46:01]
whole okay how about this I think a lot
of inner game comes down to being
confident feeling at peace within
yourself
it's hard to cultivate authentic
confidence I have my own recipe we can
swap Secrets here
um I think it's more than just like
staring in the mirror and saying you're
the best you can do this everyone's
gonna love you yeah
um I don't know if anyone really
believes that I don't know if that works
so do you have recipes for cultivating
authentic confidence
yeah uh I mean the easiest one is
experience right like it's just like
when I can look back and say oh I've
done this before hundreds of times
successfully okay that will give me a
certain level of confidence right of
course
um if you're not there yet meditation is
big
then what I said before having a wingman
having a tribe is also huge like
um because the I think the difference is

[47:02]
um because the I think the difference is
not even that somebody pushes you to do
an approach it's more like coming back
after a rejection whatever you call it
and then having your body there kind of
like waiting for you is what makes it so
easier to just do it again right uh like
you will get more approaches that way
and then that will make your game better
and it will make your confidence better
and again better
um
yeah that's huge
there's just it's also a bit of fake it
till you make it right because the other
reality is even at my level
I've done thousands of approaches I
sleep with very beautiful women I would
say you can check my Instagram
um it's just like if I stand in front of
a certain type of girl I'm still like oh
my God right there's still this little
boy inside of me sometimes saying you're
not good enough you know she's too hard
you don't deserve her and it's just like
you can listen to that boy and being
like Oh yeah maybe but let's let's see

[48:00]
like Oh yeah maybe but let's let's see
where it goes let's try let's do our
best you know so again I don't think the
notion of you will be iron and your
inner game will be perfect if you do
it's just like you just start seeing you
just start observing more you get more
distance to it right just like you don't
believe everything don't believe
everything you're thinking kind of way
you know
sure I used to get that way that makes
sense on in a performance where you know
if it's been rehearsed enough and
there's multiple performances I can sort
of like be inside watching me go through
the motions of
the vocalizations and the movements with
this sort of detached observation
while in the midst of something that is
very physically Intense or even
emotionally
um
you know high pitched so you can be very
common
separate in the midst of even a
tempestuous emotional situation

[49:03]
tempestuous emotional situation
and I think that it's good that you kind
of normalized these doubts that men are
subject to having I think that that
doesn't mean that you are
um but there's something wrong with you
I think almost all guys have those
thoughts from time to time yeah it seems
normal especially successful guys that's
the other thing tell me more about that
successful guys have more of those
thoughts you think
I've seen this video which I thought is
really interesting of Alex hormozzi uh
which is like the three things that
every like super financially successful
guy has in common and it's like the
feeling that they deserve more than
others is the first so kind of like a
bit like not feeling privileged but like
yeah I should have a good life you know
I deserved it I will I will be bigger
than others but then combined with like
anxiety not feeling good enough not
feeling worthy and then the third one is
impulse control
so it's like the confidence mixed with
the I don't deserve this I'm not good

[50:01]
the I don't deserve this I'm not good
enough and I've so it's not a bad thing
necessarily it just keeps you humble and
also keeps you hungry in a way because
you wanna if you reach one level you're
like okay I do deserve this now because
I'm having it well what's what's next
what what else is there you know I hear
that in my recipe for confidence is the
consistent felt experience of success
and so that really speaks to your
experience criteria and it's like if if
you can do the thing
more often than not so that you can kind
of have confidence and look back at your
previous victories and say all things
being equal I'm more likely to succeed
in this scenario than not but also to
let that affect you emotionally
um sometimes perfectionists are sort of
still drowning in the midst of their
victories because they're focused
potentially on the one percent that
they're not yet optimized right so I do
think it's also important to let your
progress emotionally impact you which
generally for me requires every once in

[51:00]
generally for me requires every once in
a while looking back at how far I've
come like turning around and seeing how
much elevation I've gained on the side
of the mountain that I've climbed
because it's easy to just sort of get
lost in the in the grind of putting one
foot in front of the other for sure
yeah you alluded to something else
that's very interesting is becoming
increasingly popular I would call it
geo-arbitrage I mean you talked about
how if you were a short guy living in
Amsterdam you would move and you also
talked about how you you might have more
success in being perceived as more
attractive in different cultures or
different places depending on how you
look
you've traveled I think all over the
world it sounds like you've had a very
uh fascinating life what are some of the
places that you found are
most conducive to meeting women
um good question again people should
know themselves for that answer right so
we could break it down let's break it
down into

[52:00]
down into
Asia slash Latin America kind of like
not a word passport Pro is a is a term
right just dudes traveling to like third
world to to get women then I would say
developing countries maybe Eastern
Europe and then like the First World
um okay
I love Eastern Europe personally
because
just as a living standard it's like not
third world so things still work really
well uh I can and if I need a dentist
appointment I have one this week and I
have a good dentist clinic you know
privately paid
still cheap uh great if I need to go to
the airport it's going to work if I need
other public transportation is going to
work Texas is fine and so on
um
but it's obviously not as luxurious as
the first world but for my income level
it is more it's luxurious because I can
afford more like I live right now in a
four bedroom apartment with a rooftop
that I turn into a home gym and party

[53:01]
that I turn into a home gym and party
area
um for 1600 Euros a month and I'm
splitting it with a guy nice and I have
girls live with me 24 7. so uh not to
like whoops sorry not to have sex with
me or something like that just like I
like the female energy I like walking
out of this after this podcast into the
kitchen and just having a chat with uh
attractive Ukrainian girl who's like my
friend
so that's what I like you know I also
like that the women are
very feminine still
they are really nicely put together of
course they have nice genetics beautiful
bodies so the visual is definitely there
um they know their place in the sense of
the polarity is very strong still like
male male and female which of course
comes with a price right like my
ex-girlfriend is Russian okay costs
money you know like she has certain
expectations like don't expect her to
like suddenly go to work or contribute
highly to the income or all that stuff

[54:01]
highly to the income or all that stuff
or yeah she's gonna make some drama yeah
she has some you know certain other
behaviors that are me as an Austrian I
was like what the [ __ ] like I didn't
expect that right so you have to be
either ready for that or if you're not
then don't do it
um
okay then of course there's the First
World Europe and North America and so on
uh women are going to be more educated
you know so maybe that's more
interesting if you seek somebody who is
who you have intellectual conversations
with and go deep with and
discuss science papers with and you know
maybe the woman also has a PHD and she
also has her job it's like that's cool
uh and I respect that and I respect guys
who want that I'm just not currently in
a level in my life where I need that in
my female partner
like I have a lot of smart guys in my
Social Circle of course for travels for
clients through various projects I do I

[55:00]
clients through various projects I do I
have high level intellectual
conversations mainly with men and I have
really interesting emotional
conversations with the females in my
life right so if I have like a
heartbreak I will talk to females or if
a girl really upsets me I will ask my
female friends of like why is she acting
like that what is I'll send a screenshot
maybe what she's writing like what does
she mean please translate into my you
know analytical Austrian brain language
uh so I value that that they're just in
their feminine in that sense I don't
know if that answers the question but
it's like hey because I'm saying it
again of like some dudes move to Eastern
Europe and love it maybe some would hate
it some dudes are doing
you have one Asian chick after the other
and they love it they're like oh my God
I banged 100 Asian girls this year I
would not like it I would get really
bored really quick they're just not so
attractive to me right so
whatever do whatever you want but just
to finish it it's like there's a lot of
opportunity in this world that is not
the thing you're currently getting so if

[56:00]
the thing you're currently getting so if
you're now in a town or Village or city
and you're just like not feeling it well
book an Airbnb somewhere else for a
month
ask your boss to work remotely or quit
your job or maybe you don't have a job
or figure it out like there's always a
way and just be there for a month you
don't need to move somewhere forever
people are a bit too tied up of like oh
I couldn't move there I'm like you don't
have to just try it out for a month
maybe you will really like it and it
will really change your life and you
will feel much better than you do now I
think that's good advice I mean we
generally date before we get married so
to just go and
and see what it feels like to be in
different places
uh is excellent advice before you make a
life-changing move what's really
interesting in listening to you is I was
reminded of the fact that it seems
perfectly socially normal to move to a
different part of the country or even to
a different part of the world or let's
say better job opportunities
like no one will bet an eye at that yeah

[57:02]
like no one will bet an eye at that yeah
but it's very rational but the idea that
I might relocate because it might give
me better relationship opportunities and
you suddenly seem very strange
yeah and I think that's
I think that's interesting to note
because as you've mentioned earlier that
like a big part of your life is going to
be the quality of your intimate
relationships and just like if you were
born in a small town with there when
there weren't a lot of job opportunities
where there's not a lot of ways to make
money and so you'd be resigning yourself
to let's say a certain standard of life
if you stayed there
um people say no I can I can pack up my
bags and pull up my stakes and move to
the city or move to a different country
and build a better life for myself that
we have no problems doing that when it
comes to money and career but we
for some reason feel like it's like we
shouldn't have to do that when it comes

[58:00]
shouldn't have to do that when it comes
to relationships
I guess it's another form of social
freedom of like
um caring
whose opinion do you care about
because you know I care about the
opinion of people that I hang out with
and everybody who would judge me for
moving to Eastern Europe like I lived in
Ukraine for two years I lived in Hungary
now I'm moving to Bulgaria it's like
everybody who's judging that I'm not
dealing with these people on a daily
basis anyway and it's kind of like I
came to a level I just don't care
because I truly know that my life is
probably way better than theirs and
there's just a lot of jealousy in their
like opinion of like why is he moving
there and like in in not informed as
well of what Eastern Europe is and so on
and the people who I do care about well
they're around here or they're like guys
like you or they're guys like you know
who run their own online businesses and
they also travel and also have
experience and they're like yeah this is
cool that makes sense so it's just

[59:02]
cool that makes sense so it's just
eventually just making because social
Freedom again is just like whose opinion
do you value and
do you live your life based on what is
good for you or based on what people
tell you to do
it's so important one thing I tell my
clients is that even if you were to
devote your life to doing exactly what
other people want
you would still not Escape their
judgment they would think oh what a end
up on a cross right this guy doesn't
have this anyway he doesn't he doesn't
have any ideas of his own like the
Judgment of others is inescapable it's
also on some level none of your business
because what happens in the privacy of
other people's minds doesn't really
pertain to you
um
and if you have to make a decision it's
important to that might disappoint
somebody in my opinion it's better to
disappoint another person as opposed to
yourself because you have to live with
yourself 24 7. and a disappointment of
the other person may not be the

[1:00:01]
the other person may not be the
frustration of an explicit expectation
like something you agreed on it's just
something that they want
that maybe you didn't necessarily even
consciously sign up for you know they
might want more of your time they want
more of your energy or a relationship
and now they're feeling that this
decision might jeopardize their own
cultivated expectations that really
didn't happen because it's challenging I
mean you know they're like maybe they're
like I would really love to move to Asia
I would love to move to Thailand and
this [ __ ] guy is doing it and now I
feel really bad about myself that he who
maybe went to high school with me he he
got the same grades as me it comes from
the same type of household why is he
living this why is he living my dream
now like I should I should pull him back
like this is not okay like he's he's not
in his role anymore he's not living the
role his role is like stay in Austria
and get a normal job and make 2K a month
and pay your taxes but now he's not

[1:01:01]
and pay your taxes but now he's not
playing his role which shines a really
bad light on me the guy who's always
done what he's been told to do and it's
really threatening for people's ego
right totally
suddenly a guy on the exact same level
is upgrading
it's like it's always easy to [ __ ] on
rich people like oh the rich people
they're evil and da da that's kind of
easy because you don't know them and at
least where I come from they're not in
your circle but it's suddenly a dude who
was like your buddy is now making more
money and living a better life it's like
oh horrible really hard I have a video
coming out about this about haters and
my understanding is haters
are less about hate than about Envy use
the word jealousy I would say envy and
envy yeah
I mean we we get that confused here
there's a technical difference for
psychologists but you know the words are
functionally interchangeable for most
people
um but Envy can really only exist
between perceived equals if I already
think that you're much better than me at

[1:02:02]
think that you're much better than me at
something I will experience admiration
at your superiority even if it's about
something that I personally care about
that is related to my identity but if
that's and that's why Envy is always
most prevalent among like siblings and
peer level friends right yeah totally
because on some level it's like you're
not any better or worse than me and my
conceptualization but you're living in a
way that
you have a much hot you're getting these
different outcomes and it's like what's
up with that it's a narcissistic injury
for me uh if I allow that to happen so
it's a very Insidious emotion and it
operates behind the scenes a lot of
people aren't even conscious of feeling
envious but it operates through their
behavior
um and I do think that you you seem to
live an unconventional life and I would
say that uh that wasn't always easy to
do I mean like we said with my example

[1:03:00]
do I mean like we said with my example
about going to the bar you might have
gotten to the point where it was easier
to live the unconventional life than to
disappoint yourself or frustrate your
own potential but as somebody who's
lived an unconventional life himself a
lot of people especially people close to
me that I would really have wanted or
liked to have their approval or support
it just wasn't there
and you you I think you learn to become
more individually strong and confident
in your decisions when you take that
unconventional path because you can't
rely on that kind of social
support that maybe you might if you made
different decisions does that fit with
your experience
yeah and you cannot rely on the support
of just the people you grew up with but
I think we live in an incredible time
where you can find your tribe
and your new tribe member lives in
Tunisia and your other tribe member
lives in Bali and the other tribe member
lives in Mexico and they align with you

[1:04:01]
lives in Mexico and they align with you
and you're all chatting in a group chat
right like that was not possible 30
years ago and before for thousands of
years suddenly I can through the power
of the internet and then relocation even
I can bring people together who are
aligned and we're like that's really
cool what you're doing here you know
that's you should do that yes approach
that goal yes tell her she's beautiful
yes put it on that new jacket yes it
looks good on you yes you're not used to
it but you will get you know it's like
yes [ __ ] work out you know that was
my conclusion as well it's fascinating
where like exactly on the same page with
this it's like your biggest hater is
probably someone that you know and your
biggest fan is probably someone you
haven't met yet and it's important to
use the opportunities of the Modern Age
and Technology to kind of stand up and
say hey this is who I am this is what
I'm all about
and give people the opportunity to see
you from afar and your real Community
will be those who recognize and resonate
with whatever you're putting out and
you'll find a way to get to come
together one way or another like I love

[1:05:02]
together one way or another like I love
Instagram for that I think you know I'm
very aware of
the toxicity toxicity is that right yeah
of social media and you know it's
obviously addictive and these companies
are hijacking our brain and dopamine
systems I'm aware of all of that right
and that needs to be controlled and I do
that by having two phones for example I
have one phone during the day
because I don't trust myself not using
it you know and I have one phone where I
can indulge in when the work is done and
um I can be a bit monkey and scroll on
Instagram but as a social tool I think
it is incredible uh the way you can
connect with people the way you can
create a story about yourself right you
could create an archetype through your
feed you can communicate this is what
I'm about you mentioned before this is
what I'm good at this is my passion this
is how I see the world through stories
uh and communicating that to men and
women women you meet on the street right

[1:06:01]
women women you meet on the street right
maybe women you met on the street for
two minutes and they don't know you but
now they can get to know you through
your feed and stories uh and then the
servers of Instagram just like shouting
that into the world and connecting it
with people who are interested in it I
think is an amazing tool it's like it's
isn't it crazy like it's for in for free
um I mean that's why we're talking to
each other today not through Instagram
through YouTube and just by putting that
free information out over time we ended
up finding each other and connecting and
here you are in Bulgaria I'm in
California we're having a conversation
this is so cool and I'm really happy
that I got to meet you I think it's been
about an hour do you feel kind people
wrapping up the conversation Alex sure
whatever I'm free so whatever you'll
want to do well before we we wrap up
tell everybody how they can get in touch
with you if they want to know more about
you and what you're doing
sure uh easiest place to start is my
YouTube channel
um if you type in Alex Leon dating you

[1:07:01]
um if you type in Alex Leon dating you
find it I think the handle is Alex Leon
life l i f e uh I put out YouTube weekly

stuff and if you want to know behind the
scenes stuff a little bit more a bit
less about you know cold approach and my
coaching business but just like what I
do in my wacky life you can follow me on
Instagram uh Alex over the ocean
