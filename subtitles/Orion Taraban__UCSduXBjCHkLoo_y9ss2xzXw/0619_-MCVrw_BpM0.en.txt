I once read an article I think it was in
Time magazine or some a female author
was expressing her dumbfounded over why
so many like presidents and magnates and
successful men cheat and it's like she
totally didn't get it it's like the men
became successful in order not
necessarily to cheat but in order to
have access to more and more attractive
reproductive opportunities and on some
level that's why I often recommend that
men try to hold off making that
long-term commitment as late as possible
because they're generally all things
being equal unless they things up
they're going to have more and more
attractive opportunities with women as
they age as they increase their status
their Prestige and their wealth and then
they can make a determination as to I
can choose my best possible option or I
can enjoy my optionality just like those
young women did when that man
potentially 15 years ago asked that girl
to be his girlfriend and she said no I'm
just not ready to have a relationship
yet it's kind of for the same reason
yeah
