i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychex
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the coin
flip technique i like the coin flip
technique it's very useful when dealing
with indecision which we're all subject
to from time to time
basically it goes like this
take out a quarter heads and tails
define your outcome heads i stay tails i
go
next make a binding commitment to
yourself that no matter what you're
going to follow through
on whichever outcome the coin indicates
if it's heads i'm gonna stay no matter
what if it's tails i'm gonna go no
matter what no exceptions
and once you've defined the outcomes and
made your commitment
all that's left is to flip the coin
and see what happens
now the point of this exercise is not
actually to do what the coin tells you
to do
though it's helpful to pretend that
that's what's at stake

[01:01]
that's what's at stake
the point of the exercise is to notice
how you feel immediately after seeing
the result of the coin flip
this helps to reveal to yourself your
own attitudes and preferences with
respect to the decision under
consideration
it helps to confirm that deep down this
might be what you really want for better
or for worse
when it's not entirely clear what that
is
so for example
if you look at the coin and it's a heads
and you feel an immediate sense of
relief
that's likely the outcome that in your
heart of hearts you really want
on the other hand
if you look at that heads and you think
maybe that was just a practice throw
then you're likely leaning towards the
outcome represented by the tails in this
case you see
again the point of the coin flip
technique is not to do what the coin
tells you
but rather to reveal your own hidden
emotional preferences with respect to
the decision

[02:01]
the decision
and it might be a good idea to move in
the direction indicated by your
emotional response all things being
equal try it out for yourself
hopefully it helps to get you out of
indecision as quickly as possible so
that you can move on with the rest of
your life
