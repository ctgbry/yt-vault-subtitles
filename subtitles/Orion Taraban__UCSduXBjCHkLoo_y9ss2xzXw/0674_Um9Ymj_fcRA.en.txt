in today's sexual Marketplace women can
realistically only put their sexual
opportunities behind the pay wall of
commitment if they are virgins or have
an extremely low body count this is
because men highly value Purity in no
small part because it's getting harder
and harder to find and this might offset
the relatively higher cost of the sexual
opportunity however the more women
participate in the sexual Marketplace
the less they will be able to provide
this compensatory good in general the
older they get the less effective the
strategy comes for any given woman so if
the question is now why by the cow if
you have to pay for the milk how do
women differentiate themselves in a
sexual Marketplace in which sex precedes
commitment well if everyone is handing
out milk you stay competitive by
offering the richest creamiest milk
around more than anything else this will
motivate a man to take that cow off the
market to ensure that he has exclusive
access to that frothy delicious leche
