most people have it exactly backwards
they say to themselves I want a
girlfriend or I'm ready to settle down
and have a husband and then they go out
searching for somebody to fit into this
pre-existing mold this pre-existing idea
of the kind of relationship they would
like to have and this as you might
imagine creates a lot of unnecessary
friction in your relationships the fact
of the matter is is that you can't have
any relationship with just anybody
you can only have certain types of
relationships with certain people to
insist that you should be able to have
any relationship you desire with any
individual you desire to have it with
flies in the face of reality
a much better idea is to spend time with
somebody that you connect with that you
have chemistry with that you enjoy
getting to know and then seeing what
kind of relationship the two of you can
have the relationship should evolve
organically out of your connection and
it should fit the people involved
instead of the other way around
