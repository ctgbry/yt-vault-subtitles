I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is men's
dating double bind so men are at a
significant disadvantage when it comes
to the initial stages of the courtship
process and this disadvantage is unique
to them because of some of the social
and cultural expectations that inform
that process let's jump right into it so
what is men's dating double bind here it
is on the one hand men are expected to
initiate and make the offer to women
they are expected to approach the woman
at the bar not the other way around they
are expected to ask her out on a date
not the other way around they are
expected to lead the interaction in the
direction of a sexual encounter not the
other way around if men don't take
action then in the vast majority of
cases nothing happens that's just the
way it is now this situation already
comes comes with a number of

[01:00]
comes comes with a number of
disadvantages most notably men must bear
a disproportionate amount of rejection
in any negotiation process it's always
more powerful to be in a position to
respond to say yes or no and this is the
position that women occupy in the sexual
Marketplace by default just consider how
different it feels to send in a resume
for a job
cold and to get a phone call from an
eager recruiter in which scenario are
you more likely to be offered a job in
which scenario are you more likely to
command a higher salary Etc in the game
of please no it's never the player who
acts first who gets to decide however
that's not the double bind the double
bind is that as soon as a man approaches
a woman he is functionally putting
himself in the pursuer role in the
adorer role and people will swear up and

[02:00]
adorer role and people will swear up and
down and left and right that this isn't
true but the fact of the matter is that
we like people who like us less than we
otherwise would if we had no idea of
their feelings I will say that again we
like people who like us less than we
otherwise would if we had no idea of
their feelings it's that old Groucho
Marx joke I would never want to belong
to a club that would have me as a member
women in particular swear this isn't
true but if it were the case that liking
people caused them to like you more then
successfully seducing a woman would
simply be a question of pursuing her
more than anyone else and every man
knows that this isn't the case and every
man knows this because every man starts
by doing this and it's typically only
after sufficient heartbreak and
rejection that he begins to question
this fundamental assumption as I
explained in a previous episode people

[03:01]
explained in a previous episode people
want what they want not what wants them
the grouo corollary as I call it is that
people want what wants them even less
than they otherwise would if they were
unaware of that wanting and that's the
double bind in the sexual Marketplace if
the man doesn't initiate nothing happens
however if he does initiate he
automatically becomes less attractive
than he otherwise would have been just
by keeping his mouth shut and doing
nothing but if he does nothing then
nothing happens du pursuing a woman puts
her in the role of the adored which as I
explained in it's better for women to be
adorers is not where women actually want
to be and one of the reasons why this is
the case is because it's much harder for
a woman to look up to respect and be
attracted to a man when he's in the
adorer role if he's looking up at her
she is looking down at him

[04:00]
she is looking down at him
the very Act of approaching or declaring
his feelings can instantly knock a point
or two off a man's perceived sexual
Marketplace value so this is the double
bind the man is kind of damned if he
does and damned if he doesn't and this
will only affect men as long as men are
the only ones expected to
initiate if it were the case that
approaching made men more attractive
then it would be a fairly simple thing
to solve the dating crisis you would
just get more more men to approach more
women the act of approaching would make
them more attractive than the otherwise
would and this increased attractiveness
would facilitate sex and relationships
but that's obviously not how it works
now you need some at bats in order to
get some hits but the sheer AC of
approaching does not make people more
attractive it makes them less attractive
so how can we resolve this now before I
give the answer to that question if
you're liking what you're hearing please

[05:00]
who might benefit from its message

episode I don't do corporate
sponsorships or product placements so I
depend on your support to make all this
happen the more support I get the more I
can devote to the channel so thank you
very much I really appreciate
it now here's the answer the way out of
this double bind is for men to think of
themselves like job recruiters consider
what a job recruiter does a job
recruiter has to call people when
they're not expecting it they might be
interrupting someone they might be a
nuisance many people they reach out to
will have no real interest in speaking
with them so they often have to deal
with indifference or antagonism for a
while if and when someone actually stays
on the line to talk with them this is
because they initiate the interaction
which of course puts them at a
significant
disadvantage but here's the thing people
can succeed as job recruiters if in

[06:01]
can succeed as job recruiters if in
those first five minutes they can get
you so interested in the job opportunity
they represent that you are then
motivated to apply for the position
yourself if they're good that's what
recruiters do they drum up an interest
and a motivation that was potentially
non-existent just a few moments ago and
when they succeed in doing so the whole
script gets flipped
when recruiters cold call someone they
are 100% in the pursuer role however by
the end of the conversation the other
person is filling out an application to
their company the other person is now
pursuing and the other person
unwillingly takes on the disadvantages
of that position so this is the way out
for men men you can't avoid the cold
call you can't avoid approaching but but
your goal in approaching is to get some

[07:02]
your goal in approaching is to get some
sort of purchase in the conversation so
that you can flip the script as quickly
as possible the longer you spend in the
pursuer role the less likely you're ever
going to catch that woman and the reason
for that is that women generally only
allow themselves to be caught by the men
they want to be caught by pursue a woman
and you're much more likely to pursue
her right out of your life than to
outrun her and how do recruiters get
purchase in the conversation by
stimulating interest for example in
general people want more money so if a
recruiter can flash a significantly
higher salary then he's going to capture
a lot of people's attention but does the
recruiter actually give people the money
no he just shows it to him same thing
men succeed with women not by giving

[08:00]
men succeed with women not by giving
women what they want but by showing them
what they want this will excite the
woman's interest all by itself and
motivate them to pursue you in many
cases demonstrating that you're a high
value man can stimulate a woman's
interest however it only ever does so
indirectly and it runs the risk of
attracting the wrong kind of woman
anyway it's a better move to stimulate a
woman's interest directly by engaging
her emotionally and this is something
you can get better at with practice the
idea here is to stimulate a woman's
interest by engaging her emotionally and
then slowly backing
off this is how you get a woman to
follow you not through money not through
commitment but through her emotions
remember women are loyal to their
emotions if you can engage them
emotionally then you can leave behind
the door rooll and break out of the

[09:01]
the door rooll and break out of the
double bind and I'll talk more about how
