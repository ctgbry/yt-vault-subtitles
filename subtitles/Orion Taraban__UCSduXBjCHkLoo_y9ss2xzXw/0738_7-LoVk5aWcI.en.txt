I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is men's
romantic fantasy so I've already
introduced the idea that most men are
Romantics in a previous episode today
I'm going to be discussing in Greater
detail what I believe is the most
predominant romantic fantasy that exists
in the Contemporary masculine
imagination you may not believe me when
I tell you what it is but I ask for your
patience and open-mindedness as I make
my case over the next several minutes
here it is the most predominant male
romantic fantasy at least when it comes
to their sexual relationships with
women is
partnership the most romantic thing a
man can want from a woman is
partnership probably not what you were
expecting right so what do I mean by
this what I mean by partnership is the
idea that no matter

[01:00]
idea that no matter
what I've got your back and you've got
mine no matter how bad it gets I will
pull you out of the fire and I trust
that you will do the same for me we'll
be working together as teammates on a
shared Mission the shared mission of
family prosperity and happiness when we
put our egos aside and selflessly devote
Our Lives to each other we secure our
best possible chance of achieving our
goal all for one and one for all no one
gets left
behind so this is a beautiful dream but
in my experience this isn't what women
want and it doesn't take much to
understand why most women mate and date
for gain this means that most women will
not entertain the possibility of a
relationship unless she believes it will
significantly improve the quality of her
life it's very difficult if not
impossible for a man to simultaneously
be an equal partner

[02:00]
be an equal partner
and a better option and if a woman has
to choose between these two options nine
times out of 10 she's going to choose
the guy who can significantly improve
the quality of her life however as easy
as this might be to intellectually
understand that doesn't stop many men
from thinking that this kind of
partnership is possible and to be fair
women are complicit in this
understanding they talk about finding
their partner in crime or being a power
couple or just espousing equality in
relationships as a virtue this gives men
hope that an equal partnership is what
women are actually setting up for when
they enter into
relationships contrary to popular belief
men love the idea of equal partnership
not only because as I've discussed in
the previous episode 5050 relationships
represent a substantial savings to men
relative to the standard costs of doing
business but because it caters to their
own romantic fantasy that they can be

[03:02]
own romantic fantasy that they can be
loved not for what they do not for what
they can provide but just for who they
are you see this idea reflected in the
marriage vows I don't know who wrote
those traditional vows but I guarantee
you it was a man like I've been to a lot
of weddings and if anyone's crying at
the altar in the vast majority of cases
it's the groom the groom is the one in
tears and this is not because cynically
he is catching a glimpse of a bleak
future no it's because there is a woman
standing in front of her family her
friends and God himself and promising
that she is going to stay by his side no
matter
what you're you're going to stay with me
even if I'm
sick you're going to St with me even if

[04:02]
sick you're going to St with me even if
I'm
poor oh God like can I I can understand
why a man would get emotional at that
moment because no one has ever done that
for him ever in his entire life and the
idea that he has finally met someone
whom he can rely on to that degree whom
he can so fundamentally trust someone in
whose hands he can place his heart and
soul that's a beautiful and awesome and
touch in
idea but guys I have just one question
for you if this is such a beautiful idea
at least in part because most men have
never experienced that kind of devotion
and Security in a relationship before in
their entire lives then on what grounds
can you reasonably believe that this
woman is going to be the
exception if you appreciate the insights
on this Channel I would highly encourage

[05:01]
on this Channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationship the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description I appreciate that's a pretty
hard-hitting question like it's possible
that she'll be the exception there are
some very loyal very good women out
there but they are rare gentlemen they
are rare and given that they are rare I
would suggest that the burden of proof
lies on demonstrating that she is the
exception as opposed to assuming that

[06:00]
exception as opposed to assuming that
she is until you see evidence to the
contrary the fact of the matter is that
the road of life is twisty and tury I
don't know any man's life that is a
constant slope up and to the right like
I've lost everything more than once in
my adult life and I've built it all back
and more there have been ups and downs
ups and downs over that time I've had
many different relationships and let me
tell you no woman has ever left me when
I was doing well let that sink in no
woman has ever left me when I was doing
well men look at your own relationship
experience when a woman has decided to
end a relationship what were the
circumstances of your life like what was
going on did she leave when you were
successful or when you were struggling
did she leave when you were relaxed and
thriving or when you were stressed and
overwhelmed I hate to break it to you

[07:00]
overwhelmed I hate to break it to you
but Partners don't cut and run when the
going gets tough which is why I've come
to the conclusion that despite the
apparent evidence to the contrary women
don't really want to be partners they
want to benefit they want the UPS they
do not want the downs and they can want
that because they can get that that's
just the reality of the sexual
Marketplace so well I would absolutely
say that there are some fantastic
wonderful phenomenal women out there
it's probably safer to assume that any
one woman that you're dealing with does
not belong to that rarified class the
burden of proof is on her to demonstrate
that she's the exception not the other
way around the idea of partnership
gentlemen is beautiful it's one of the
most uplifting and ennobling
relationships human beings can have with
each other on this planet and while it
is possible to have that kind of
relationship the kind of relationship in
which no matter what you have each

[08:01]
which no matter what you have each
other's back guys you are much more
likely to have that kind of relationship
with another man than with a
woman this is the kind of relationship
you find in the Band of Brothers among
soldiers who fight shoulder Tosh
shoulder it's if one of their comrades
is wounded they will carry him out under
enemy fire if needed because they trust
that he would have done the same for
them you are much more likely to find
that kind of trust and loyalty and
teamwork that selfless surrender to the
shared Mission among men like it's still
rare but it's much more common in male
communities teams and groups than in
sexual relationships between men and
women so hopefully I've made a case for
the idea that partnership is at the
heart of the male romantic fantasy when
it comes to their sexual relationships
with women in my experience most women
don't want partnership so if you engage
with women with that intention you are
likely going to be disappointed fair

[09:02]
likely going to be disappointed fair
