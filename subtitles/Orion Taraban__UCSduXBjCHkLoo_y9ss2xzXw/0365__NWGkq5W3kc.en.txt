I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is being
kind isn't being nice or the two faces
of kindness
so kindness is actually a complicated
construct it's not synonymous with
simply being nice being nice is not
always kind and being kind is not always
being nice and I think the best way to
illustrate this distinction is by
discussing the two faces of kindness

so kindness Has Two Faces the first face
of kindness is the one that's more
commonly accepted it's basically an
attribute of Mercy in this case kindness
means not adding insult to injury or
kicking somebody when they're down if
somebody's having a tough time it's kind
not to add difficulties
with punishment judgment or censure to
their problems we might even try to
offer some relief as appropriate
and keep in mind that this applies
equally to both other people and to
ourselves it's very important to be kind
to ourselves so that when we fail when
we fall short of our goals which we
inevitably do we don't beat ourselves up
we don't criticize ourselves unduly and
we don't pile extra punishment on top of
the organic pain that's one face of
kindness to not cause harm and to ease
suffering as appropriate

[02:00]
suffering as appropriate
however there is another face of
kindness that is less commonly
appreciated
this face has more to do with loving
honesty and it does not allow other
people to continue to hurt themselves
unnecessarily
it is not kind to stand by while people
destroy themselves
now obviously this is tricky because
unfortunately if someone has a mind to
do so there's little you can do to
prevent this from happening some folks
are so deep in delusion that they will
reject that help however my point is
that you can't really think of yourself
as kind if you don't at least try to
intervene in unnecessary
self-destruction
this has nothing to do with a moral or
ethical obligation for people to change
their ways that's a should-based
judgment on how people ought to live
their lives and who are we to dictate
that for others what I'm talking about

[03:01]
that for others what I'm talking about
is approaching another from a place of
love and truth and recognizing without
judgment or censure that they are
hurting themselves with a certain
Behavior
kindness is saying that I cannot stand
by and watch yourself destroy yourself
without at least trying to bring us to
your attention
real kindness is like a coin it has two
faces exercising the one without the
other is pathological
and we see this kind of pathological
kindness playing out every day in
certain cities in certain States all
across the country
in San Francisco for example more people
died from drug overdoses in the streets
than from covid during the two plus
years of shutdowns
in that City there is an attitude that
it would be unkind to intervene in these
people's lives to provide consequences

[04:01]
people's lives to provide consequences
structure and accountability because
they have already suffered enough
that is the first face of kindness not
kicking seven while they're down without
the other this is not kind this is
enabling
stepping over someone's unconscious body
to get into your apartment building does
not support individual autonomy or human
rights it is degrading for all involved
and because it's enabling it tends to
make the situation even worse over time
let's take a more concrete example let's
say that one of your loved ones is an
alcoholic it's not kind to say nothing
while this person drinks themselves into
Oblivion each night
that's enabling when a person believes
that saying or doing nothing is a form
of kindness what we're really dealing
with is a strategy to rationalize
conflict avoidance because unfortunately
bringing up an alcoholic's drinking can

[05:00]
bringing up an alcoholic's drinking can
provoke a good deal of defensive
reactiveness
it's also not particularly kind to
moralize about it and to complain that
they shouldn't drink so much not only is
this judgmental it just doesn't work
what kindness might look like in the
situation is something like hey you know
I really care about you and I've noticed
that you've been drinking a lot more
lately and you don't look so good you're
sleeping late you're missing work and
frankly you've been really irritable to
be around I'm concerned that your
drinking is getting out of control and
I'm worried that if this doesn't change
it's going to negatively impact our
relationship which I value
and it may even negatively impact your
health or life
now the other person is going to respond
to this as he or she sees fit that's not
up to you but on some level
kindness carries with it an imperative
to at least try to extend a hand to
folks when they are actively

[06:01]
folks when they are actively
self-destructive
again it is not kind to sit back and
watch that happen
that's a dangerous rationalization
real kindness requires loving honesty
which almost always consists of
acknowledging that people are not purely
victims of circumstance
and are at least somewhat complicit in
their suffering
and this is actually empowering because
if they are at least somewhat complicit
in their suffering then they can
actually do something to change their
circumstances which wouldn't be possible
if they were merely only victims
what do you think does kindness require
accountability
