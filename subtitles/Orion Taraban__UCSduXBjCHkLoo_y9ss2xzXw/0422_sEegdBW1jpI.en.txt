okay hello everybody Welcome to psych
hacks I'm Dr Orion taraban and today I'm
very happy to be speaking with Mr Rob
anger uh Rob is a he has a number of
YouTube channels that I followed over
the years I think first and foremost is
collative learning in which Rob gives
some really deep and insightful analyzes
on some of my favorite films and uh I've
been a fan of his channel personally for
many many years so I'm very very stoked
to be talking with you today Rob thanks
for joining us on the podcast
it's great to be here and I asked to say
Orion taraba I loved that name and
that's like that's something I have a
some crazy science picture movie I
thought was like a yeah fantastic yeah
it's an intense name I didn't choose it
of course but it's it's something I've
tried to grow into which type when I was
younger but it's uh it's nice to have
when you're older
so uh Rob I remember I that you posted

[01:01]
so uh Rob I remember I that you posted
an episode a while back that was
something along the lines of like why is
it so difficult for people to
appreciate that there might be deeper
levels of meaning in film
like I I I'm assuming that's coming from
a perspective of you sharing some of
your interpretations with maybe friends
or folks on the internet and then saying
ah you're you're just reading too deep
into this it's just a movie uh so I
think we're talking about semiotics here
the the reading of symbols why do you
think why do you think this is so
difficult for folks and and how can
people learn how to read film as a like
a medium
well uh it's a strange one because when
I first started posting the videos I
didn't think anyone would be interested
in the stuff but
um turns out there are some people who
are really into this stuff you know I
was quite surprised I thought it would
only be other filmmakers but there's a
lot of regular everyday people who are
who are interested in this stuff and if
you start telling them about it
um and showing them the little bits and

[02:00]
um and showing them the little bits and
pieces from the movies or you're
pointing out things from movies that
they're already familiar with
um then they're like oh my God yeah and
they can even remember from the scenes
the details that you're talking about
and and they love it you know some
people do but yeah a lot of people just
really back off from this stuff and like
whoa whoa whoa whoa I just want to go
with the surface plot of the movie I
just want to believe what I'm told by
the characters
um there's a simple straightforward
narrative that you've followed it's got
a middle beginning and an end and at the
end you're told what the full story is
and that's it and then the movie's over
and then you just go away and that's
that's that
um but yeah this this idea that the of
movies which that have a lot of hidden
stuff that isn't obvious a lot of people
are really uncomfortable with it and it
shows in that the choice of movies that
they watch as well
um you know the type of people who don't
want to go anywhere near the movies of
like David Lynch or something like that
because you don't get a very obvious
explanation at the end of the movie and

[03:00]
explanation at the end of the movie and
they hate walking away confused they
they feel uncomfortable with that
confusion
and um
I mean there's a there's a few different
things that I think this is down to uh
one I think is
we humans have got into this sort of
bearable reality that we've created for
ourselves which is incredibly useful uh
you know we go around and we take this
incredibly complex world that's around
us and we apply all these verbal labels
to these complex things just so we can
have a simplistic organizing approach to
reality oh there's a car you know but a
car is actually an unbelievably complex
thing if you actually go and study it in
detail
um so I think that's an issue is people
don't like Delvin out of the comfort
zone of simplistic verbal uh reality
and once you get outside of that it's
like oh my God the world is too complex
and I'm getting a headache and I'm not
sure if I can handle this but I think
there's that reaction a lot of the time

[04:01]
there's that reaction a lot of the time
and another one is that
I think a lot of people are
uncomfortable with
the idea that they've been deceived that
somebody has come along and made a movie
and
they fooled the the person who was
watching it into thinking it was about
one thing and it turned out there was a
lot of other stuff going on there and I
think sometimes it makes people feel
like
um uncomfortable it's like I mean people
have a problem with deception generally
anyway uh a lot of people like to just
follow the newspaper headlines and stuff
to get their reality about how the world
works and of course the real world is
way more complex than the newspaper
headlines
um so that's a big factor as well and I
think when people watch movies a lot of
the time they just want to be
entertained they want to get away from
the world of deception and
um I mean there's a thing about movies
as well where
um you have the you know good guys and
bad guys in movies
and people loved the Simplicity of good

[05:02]
and people loved the Simplicity of good
guys versus bad guys and movies but in
reality you can't always tell who's a
good guy and who's a bad guy so you know
that that makes things nice and
comfortable in movies you don't have to
deal with deception so much the bad guys
make it obvious that they're a bad guy
so yeah the the complexity and dealing
with the deception that's gone on when a
movie has deeper themes I think those
two things people have a major problem
with so among other things what I'm
hearing is that it's like an emotional
discomfort over overwhelming or
incomprehensible complexity that tends
to turn people off and maybe there's a
sort of literacy that comes with being
able to read symbolism in film or in
literature or in other works of art that
people don't practice and therefore
don't have but maybe some people have
the potential to move in that direction
but they might feel emotionally
uncomfortable about doing so because it
might shatter some of their let's say
comfortable World Views I really like
what you said about the Simplicity of

[06:01]
what you said about the Simplicity of
good versus evil because I think that
some of the best works of art whether
it's film or literature is not really
about good versus bad but about two
two sorry like you you cut out a little
bit there can you just go back a little
bit you cut out for about five seconds
so oh sorry I I heard everything on on
my end so what I was saying is that I
really like what you said about the good
versus evil being too simplistic because
in my opinion all the Best Literature
were film is not really about good
versus evil it's about two mutually
incompatible World Views that each have
their merits but they can't both be held
at the same time I'm actually working on
an analysis of Les Mis the book and and
the musical because there's this
fundamental antagonism between Javier
and Valjean that I think is actually
mirrored in kind of like the old versus
the New Testament you got you got Jaber
who's like an eye for an eye there has
to be order when there are bad guys and
good guys and that's totally

[07:00]
good guys and that's totally
incompatible with the let's say the new
testament worldview which is that people
can change people can be redeemed and
um once a bad guy not always a bad guy
because if we open up the possibility to
that it really throws all of the order
of the uh the Old Testament Covenant
into chaos and that's exactly what
happens to Javier at the end of the film
so uh and and it's not that Javier is a
bad guy he definitely has a point we
need Justice we need order
um we need Sentinels in the night to
look out for folks so it's not that he's
he's bad he's just you can't have both
of those World Views at the same time
and so it's a contest to see who's kind
of going to come out in the end ahead
now with the deception this is something
that you I remember you talked a lot
about in your analysis of 2001 which I
think is just absolutely brilliant where
you talk about how on the surface this
film seems to be like uh a movie about
first Contact it's about
um you know the star baby elevating into

[08:00]
um you know the star baby elevating into
the next dimension of human
consciousness
but I think I'm getting it right your
argument is that
Kubrick was actually trying to make a
commentary on
like Cinema itself is that fair to say
yeah partially yeah yeah I'll show you
about the medium itself and how the
medium can be deceptive you know and uh
I'm not not to go over it too much uh
because I've covered this stuff a lot
before but the whole idea about touching
the monolith and the monolith being the
cinema screen in Disguise but it's been
rotated at 90 degrees
um when you touch the monolith and
you're touching the movie screen itself
it's like if you're sat at home or you
sat in a cinema and you're watching this
movie and you think oh this is so real
but if you go up and touch the screen
it's like it's not even unreal you know
I can touch the screen right now and you
are not really in front of me and you
know that we've got this communication
going on digitally but
um I think that's part of the concept of
2001 is that don't believe in what you

[09:01]
2001 is that don't believe in what you
see on your screens and just go and
touch the screen and realize that it's
just a magical display that's going on
it's not reality you know I think that's
part of the whole 2001 thing yeah yeah
and the way that you worked in all of
those rotationals
um gestures you you notice the
rotational gestures in the movie to turn
the monolith from vertical to horizontal
to mimic the panoramic service would
have picked up on that I thought that
was very observant Rob now I do believe
that you mentioned that partly the
reason why that level of meaning might
have been buried into the service in
2001 was that Kubrick couldn't really
get that film produced like no one was
going to pay
to bankroll a film about
the the illusion of Cinema they wanted
this was in the era of I guess it was
before Star Wars but we're getting into
the space race and this was very popular
and and so he kind of had to do it for
pragmatic reasons so the question I have
for you I'm going to play a little bit

[10:00]
for you I'm going to play a little bit
of a devil's advocate here is
if what you're saying is true about
these hidden levels of meaning and if
the filmmakers really wanted people to
understand these levels of meaning why
did they go through the trouble of
hiding them like why don't they just
tell the people what they really want
them to know
okay uh does something that I think is
going on particularly with Kubrick and
Lynch and people like that where they're
challenging the audience it's like the
saying I'm not going to hand it to you
on a plate I'm going to give you lots of
Clues and you're going to do the rest of
the work and figure it out you know it's
like uh there was actually a in the
novelization of 2001 which Kubrick wrote
with Clark and Kubrick had authorization
writes on that novel he was able to
override Clarke
um
in the novelization there are many many
models all over the Earth it's not just
the one that arrives so there's tons of
them with different ape groups

[11:00]
them with different ape groups
and the apes are being tested that
explains that it's it's not just about
training the Apes it's about testing
them and so the monoliths are looking
for the Apes with the most potential
and
so it tests them with a number of
perceptual tricks and I think at one
point they have to throw stones at the
the monolith and there's like a Target
on it and they have to throw stones and
hit it and stuff like that so it's
looking for Apes with potential to
really develop and it doesn't bother
with the rest
and you know this it's quite you could
say it's kind of like snobbish and
elitist
um but I think Kubrick was basically
just
he wasn't trying to make a movie that
everybody would be able to get I think
he knew that a lot of people that would
have just been like too much of a
headache for them or they couldn't be
bothered they're not motivated well I
think he realized that there would be
some people around
who would be really interested in
developing their understanding feather
of the movie and because the movie

[12:00]
of the movie and because the movie
doesn't give verbal explanations those
people would have to explore the visual
you know the non-verbal the metaphoric
the symbolic uh they would have to delve
into that and gradually start to decode
what he put in yeah and so that you know
the the novelization is very specific
about that about
um
I think that there was a point where it
actually said that the monolith was
there
to find out whether the Apes were worth
helping oh my god
um I think Kubrick may have said that in
an interview as well at one point
um I can't recall if it was just in the
novelization but you have that when I
came across the I was like my God is
this
is this like the attitude Kubrick was
taken with with this film was like um
I'm gonna hit you with this really tough
puzzle that is right outside your
comfort zone right outside of your
familiar verbal thinking and it's
definitely outside of the thinking of

[13:00]
definitely outside of the thinking of
the investors so they're not going to
get it
um but if there's some of you out there
who are going to be open to this stuff
who are really willing to step outside
of the usual mental boundaries and here
you go I've got some employer I've got
like a cinematic Rubik's Cube which if
you can break it down and figure it out
either individually or collectively
figure it out then you can have the the
goodies that are hiding underneath yeah
the hidden narrative I like that
well let's let's kind of pivot a little
bit and talk about
um I I think this is an interesting
connection so like why why do symbols
even work at all and I think there has
to be some sort of psychological
response to that question that the the
reason why symbols might be so rich
especially as a communicative medium is
that like a rose is not just a rose a
rose can also be Beauty it's also about
sexuality it's the color of the Rose
could be passion or it could be
friendship

[14:01]
friendship
um that these are all associations that
we have with the symbol either the word
or the image of the rose that we can
kind of play with without even
uh
making it seem like we're activating
those associations so they they seem to
be in play in our Consciousness even
though we may not be actually perceiving
them on the screen
do you think that that's part of what
we're talking about here definitely yeah
I mean this I mean it's it's it is kind
of you've hit on the night I don't need
that there's a lot of people who resist
this kind of symbolism in movies because
they're not used to this kind of
symbolism but symbolism is dead in their
life every day and they use it when they
speak they don't realize they're talking
that way
um you know if if if they if they meet
someone who is very uh say intelligent
they'll refer to that person as bright
how are they bright it's not like
they're actually emanating light but

[15:01]
they're actually emanating light but
they use that term and that is such an
inbuilt
um metaphor that we all use it as if
it's a real thing you know
um so it seems like people are really
okay with using symbolism that they're
familiar with and they know that
everybody else is familiar with but when
you start getting into new types of
symbolism or more complex symbolism then
it's like oh they start to back off yeah
sure because I think at basis all
language that we use human language is
metaphorical in its Essence because
otherwise we would just be talking in
tautologies like if I were to say a rose
is a rose like that's x equals X as a
mathematical proposition which is true
but totally not useful and not
interesting information so the way that
we communicate is we actually say it
looks x equals a times b or something
like that so we we can kind of transmute
this one variable into a combination of
other variables and still maintains some
sort of equality between them and that's

[16:01]
sort of equality between them and that's
how we can kind of expand our conceptual
understanding of the universe it's
through metaphor which is basically a
graded comparison between two things
right yeah yeah I mean I I I've been
getting it quite into the idea of um
I've been learning a bit more about
about mathematics recently I've been
studying uh I wrote a huge video which
I'm still editing which is about uh
cubic reality and it covers 2001 Space
Odyssey the movie Tron and uh the video
game Minecraft you know with this cubic
blocky world okay and um cubism in
Picasso's artwork it goes through a
whole bunch of historical cubism things
that have happened in the past 120 years
and uh I was I was very interested
because I think there's something in
this there's patterns going on here what
is what is it with this cubic reality
thing that people are drawn to and so I
started like
um researching a bit more about
mathematics and mathematical theories
and

[17:01]
and
I sort of started I've already suspected
this for a while but sort of came to the
conclusion that mathematics itself isn't
the real thing it's actually symbolic
you know numbers are just symbols
um if you go through history there's
been different numerical systems of
existed yeah the the Roman numeral
system most of us are familiar with that
we get taught her in school and we've
got our own system and there's there's
all these different ones with it's not
just the ten point thing but I think the
main theory is that we we have a 10
point
um you know 10 numbers because of the
the number of numbers of fingers and
thumbs on our hands so it makes it
easier for us to count intense so that
um 10-digit system which is used
everywhere in the world today
um it's almost like taking over to the
point where we think it is real but it's
just one other form of it's just another
set of symbols that's fascinating so
you're basically saying it's an
anthropomorphized uh view of reality

[18:03]
anthropomorphized uh view of reality
that's been like reified as something
that's objective to nature which isn't
true because even though I think every
culture in the world now uses the base
10 system of mathematics that hasn't
always been true in fact now computers
are not running base 10 they're running
binary
um and exactly and base eight
um but I think the Mayans used a base 12
calculation which I think would be very
difficult for me and most modern people
to take off the retrain our perceptions
but it's not anymore or less real than
the one we've already got yeah I used to
be a math professor and I used to tell
people that math is not about numbers
it's about quantity which is a different
thing and quantity is really about
relationships like the the number
0.75 is about the relationship between
three to four and three and four not
really numbers because they are
quantities in of themselves that can be
reduced into different kinds of
relationships like there is no value in

[19:00]
relationships like there is no value in
and of itself all values exist in
proportion to other values so what we're
talking about an absolute
that's kind of a misnomer we're actually
just comparing it to some other things
everything is about relationships
um so let's talk about this so if
the symbolism of film is related to
let's say the psychological associations
that people have in their minds about
certain images
would it be fair to say we could take a
film like Mulholland Drive which I just
rewatched yesterday and show that to
like
the folks in
Papua New Guinea and they're going to be
able to pick up on the symbolism or is
there stuff in Lynch's films that you
kind of need to be trained by maybe
other lynches films or by Western Cinema
in general to be able to perceive like
are these symbols contextual or are some
of these symbols Universal
definitely a mix of the two
um
I mean it's you know with with Lynch I

[20:02]
I mean it's you know with with Lynch I
mean a key thing is just figuring out
which scenes and dream sequences and
which aren't you know you as far as I
tell with without doing that you cannot
figure out the proper narratives of this
films like Mulholland Drive it's
actually got a very
um
uh it's got a narrative that makes
perfect logical sense and a standard
plot way it's just that it's presented
through a mixture of dream sequences
which I think is about
something like the first two thirds of
the movie I think is all dream sequences
and then you start getting presented
towards the end of the movie with the
waking State experiences and you have to
relate those to the dream experience
scenes in order to figure out what
really happened so you know you get one
character who shows up but they
represent a different character uh you
know in real life they were a different
character but in the dream they are
somebody else
um I mean that that stuff kind of goes
I would say that's

[21:00]
I would say that's
it's difficult to work out but I think
that can be figured out by people from
any culture because in all cultures
people dream
um and I I would well I don't know if
there's been any research done on this
but I would assume that the similar
kinds of bass symbolism goes on in
dreams across all cultures I should
imagine it
somebody from some Far Away culture that
is really exotic and different to mine
and if some of the air has a dream I'm
pretty sure they're in their dreams
every now and then somebody will pop up
in the dream who who visually looks
different but they represent somebody
who exists in that person's real
awakened state that you know the person
has been
um represented differently in the dream
I I would assume that that happens
across cultures
um in all dream states so on that basis
I would say people from any culture
should be able to look at a movie like
Mulholland Drive and start figuring it
out I suppose you've got the language

[22:01]
out I suppose you've got the language
bar you might make it awkward as worker
yeah I don't think it's research but I
think Paulo coelio said that Shepherds
tend to dream of sheep which kind of
makes sense but what we're getting at I
think is uh the possibility that there
may be Universal
um symbolism that all human beings are
capable of perceiving and understanding
and in Psychology the guy who most
people are aware of did the most work on
that is Young And The Arc Type yeah and
I think one way that we can think about
archetypes is that they're Universal
symbols that they exist in the
collective Consciousness and may even
have like a biological origin yeah and
these are ways of perceiving that all
human beings are capable of
um other all human beings are capable of
regardless of their culture or their
language so these are symbols like
um
like death

[23:01]
like death
or like
um the wise old man or
um the empress things like that you know
the kind of stuff that shows up on tarot
cards actually yeah so it I think that
there is a strong argument for the
possibility of archetypal symbology in
all human beings just like there seems
to be some Universal human emotions that
are always kind of as far as we know
experience but certainly expressed in
the same way regardless of people's
culture or socialization
um what have you what have you done with
respect to junking archetypes in your
work Rob
well funnily enough I just finished
editing uh yesterday morning or the day
before
um a new video that I haven't put out
yet which is on um Carl Jung's uh quite
short book called the Undiscovered self
um I read that for the first time
recently and it's only 79 pages so so
tons of notes and recorded that

[24:01]
tons of notes and recorded that
um
I've been aware of Carl Jung's stuff for
a long time I've read about his theories
but never read his books until recently
I think I've read some of his papers
before
um and I I think it's fantastic he's
absolutely brilliant he was so ahead uh
of the Kev and like the stuff that he
was writing away back in the 1950s is
absolutely relevant today
um yeah so I mean was there some
specific aspect of young that you wanted
to discuss there well you've made a
couple of videos on the Shadow and I
think the shadow is really interesting
because there are a few different ways
that we can approach the idea of the
Shadow both in jungian Psychology and in
other forms of psychology
um I think there are two general
um ways to approach it that I'm aware of
and you can correct me if you
if you want to change the definition or
if you have another idea one is that the
shadow is sort of a disavowed self it's
the part of myself that I don't allow
myself to acknowledge and so I deny and

[25:00]
myself to acknowledge and so I deny and
repress and and see it in other people
and want to destroy the projected evil
that I perceive in others because I'm
willing to accept it in myself I think
that is the more let's say jungian
approach to it there's another
um idea about the shadow that basically
says the shadow is kind of inescapable
even if you were to do all of this deep
personal
you know psychological work to kind of
like understand your demons as we say to
integrate Your Shadow you still have a
shadow you can't get away from it
because your shadow in this
conceptualization is just the sum of all
of your unchosen lines
that it's not necessarily a bad thing
it's just the path that you didn't take
and on some level The Shadow
becomes even more dangerous to the
individual when the unchosen path
represents let's say greater happiness
and prosperity than the one that you
decided to take does that make sense

[26:01]
decided to take does that make sense
yeah yeah
um okay so let's try to think that so so
you're talking about the like the
rejected part of ourselves absolutely
that's so big I totally agree with that
and we projected on to others and then
we we hate the older people who we
projected onto absolutely and uh you
know I mean young talked about that in
terms of well before world affairs Wars
and stuff you know it's like he said
virtually all laws it's just two sides
each project in their own shadow onto
the other side and then attacking it you
know so
um he talked about the the mutual
withdrawing of projections as a way of
stopping War not an easy thing to
persuade all the leaders to do is it
um and then the other one you mentioned
can you just clarify that for me a
little bit again yeah rather than be
like so in the first definition the
things that I'm disavowing of myself are
like my own capacity for cruelty my own
darkness my own hatred my own envy and
selfishness
I I prefer you know like I'd prefer to

[27:03]
I I prefer you know like I'd prefer to
think of myself as all good as righteous
as honest as forthright
but like those those darknesses live
inside of me you know and I if if I
don't get through them they're always
there they're built in um
into uh it's in our nature the way we we
grew up in the you know the way we
evolved we had to fight we had to be we
had to fear you know all that kind of
stuff yeah it's uh you can't get really
you can become aware of the Shadow and
lessen its effect on you so that you
don't project so much but you can't get
rid of it that's my understanding of it
yeah and I think that the more that I do
that shadow work myself and accept those
parts of myself I become more
compassionate and patient with other
people because it's like yeah and when I
see this and other people I'm like well
you know have I really done have I done
something that bad myself in the past
maybe I have could and if I haven't
could I yeah I probably could so

[28:01]
could I yeah I probably could so
um you know I don't want to give bad
behavior a pass but it is important to
the we can respond to that behavior
without necessarily needing to hate it
or destroy it absolutely so yeah so
that's that's one part the other part is
that um like
think think about this maybe there's an
archetypal story I can't think of one on
top of my head but there's like two twin
brothers and one person takes the path
of I'm becoming a scholar and I'm
working hard and I'm getting married and
becoming a productive member of society
the other person takes the path of I
want uh a life of adventure and
exploration and
um danger and like this intensity of
Life neither one is necessarily bad or
wrong but one is kind of the shadow of
the other because they couldn't take
you'd either take one path or the other
and on some level that twin becomes the
shadow of the other person because
um they represent all of their the way

[29:01]
um they represent all of their the way
their life could have been but they
didn't choose does that make sense so
all of the uh motivations the desires
that would have opened the the would
have been the basis of that alternate
life if it had happened you go down a
different path but
okay I guess you could say the edge for
the the path that you didn't go down
that edge is still there you could refer
to that as like the shadow sure because
whenever we make a choice we actually
have to forbear every other decision out
there and so every decision requires
this sacrifice and that means like
actually giving up a huge part of our
lives and a huge part of our our
potentiality it's like my best friend in
in high school he right out of college
went to law school and he got a
corporate job and he bought a house and
got married and I was an actor and I was
living this kind of life and he would
look at me sometimes and think oh Ryan
you're so free you get to do kind of

[30:00]
you're so free you get to do kind of
whatever you want and I was like yeah
but I'm broke and you got a nice house
and a fancy car so it's like we just
represented the path that the other
didn't take okay yeah yeah that's a lot
of paths there it is right yeah
yeah but so I think in that case the
shadow is more around like Choice points
it's like if I could
um you know what would my life have been
like if I didn't marry this person or if
I didn't become a doctor but it's
usually around really or even that this
tragedy didn't befall me you know what
I'm saying that's a big one yeah
so it's not necessarily about the the
negative that's just another way of
looking at it but we can talk about
either one of those definitions of the
Shadow or something else I think I got
what you mean yeah I mean it's um
the the term Shadow because Shadows are
literally dark implies that it's a
negative uh
nature to the to the shadow but yeah I
definitely agreed as
either whether you would call it the

[31:01]
either whether you would call it the
same Shadow or whether we've got
multiple Shadows that come with us and
some are more positive some are more
negative yeah but definitely I agree
that there's
um
an unconscious side of us that follows
us that's full of positive things
definitely yeah I definitely agree
that's the case I mean whether you want
to look that in with the negative side
and call it as one or whether you can
separate it out into different pieces
for them but we're getting into
mathematical uh
relationship comparisons there so I
don't think the words really can do it
justice can they you know they often
can't so I was bringing this up in the
context of your analysis of a full metal
jacket do you want to talk about that or
do you want me to try yeah great yeah
yeah so what do you what do you see is
the role of the shadow in that film
uh the main thing that I see is the the
split between the two halves of the
movie the first half and the second half
and a lot of people don't like the
second half of the movie this is quite
interesting because I mean young talked

[32:01]
interesting because I mean young talked
about
that a lot of people don't like
accessing their own unconscious they
don't want to be aware of their own
shadow it's uncomfortable isn't it you
know
so um so naturally they don't like the
second half of Full Metal jackets so
much because it gets into the the the
jungian shadow thing uh and you know
Kubrick did talk about Carl Jung in
relation to Full Metal jackets and
interviews he specifically said that he
and the co-writer Michael Hare who wrote
the book uh is called dispatchers which
Full Metal Jacket takes many of its
scenes from
um Kubrick said that he and Michael hair
were specifically talking about ways of
getting Young's The Shadow into full
metal jackets so I mean you know never
mind all the secrecy that with 2001
Space Odyssey that Kubrick was pretty
open about putting uh jungi and Shadow
Concepts into full metal jacket it's not
so obvious when you watch the movie
because nobody tells you except for that
one moment when um The Joker character

[33:01]
one moment when um The Joker character
is talking to I think is a kennel or a
um some high ranking officer and the
officer the officer demands to know from
why have you got a peace symbol on you
jacket and you've got born to kill
written on your helmet and Joker says I
was trying to make a comment about The
Duality of Man the jungian thing you
know that that's quite a blatant
giveaway for Kubrick I mean he's not
normally that blatant but you know he
slipped it in there
um so yeah but for me the overall split
that happens in that movie is between
the first and second half and the way I
view it is that the recruits in the
first half of the movie
they are shadowed in the second half of
the movie
those recruits in the first half are
reborn as the Lost hog Squad in the
second half of the movie uh I did a
video up there in fact it's still up uh
about Full Metal Jacket called um
it was about the private pile character

[34:02]
it was about the private pile character
um Born Again hard I think I called the
the video just so sorry I haven't
watched that one a few days ago I
thought that was really insightful yeah
so so you know the basic point where
private pile his death is symbolic in
the toilets in the first half of the
movie and that's like killing off the
the innocent child he's like a baby like
innocent character and in the military
training they want to kill that off they
want to get rid of your innocence and
your your childishness and just turn you
into a man I mean they literally call
you we're going to turn you into a man
that that standard jargon in you know
military training so they want to get
rid of the infants so he gets killed off
uh symbolically in the first half and
then he comes back in the second half uh
his shadow is the character called
animal mother and if you watch the two
characters they have similar facial
expressions similar height and build
one's fat and the other ones suddenly
become lean and um yeah so this that

[35:01]
become lean and um yeah so this that
that's your Shadow at work right there
and what neither of them is aware of the
other animal more that never ever makes
any reference to uh the first half of
the movie in fact in the second half of
the movie nobody talks about the first
half in the movie at all
um the cowboy character shows up in the
second half and Joker meets up with them
but it's like the first half of the
movie didn't even exist I think that
freaked people out and watched him film
out the jackets like you're watching two
separate movies
um and I think it was like they're two
heart two hemispheres of the brain
separated the oil and but it's not just
animal mother who that happens with
lots of the other characters in the
first half of the movie appear to be
reborn in the second half so you've got
private snowball which is the black
character in the first half
um he becomes private eight ball in the
second half
and he gets killed later
um and yeah yeah so that that's that's
the way I look at it is the the squad is

[36:00]
the way I look at it is the the squad is
reborn as their jungian shadows in
Vietnam and the military has split their
psyche so that they've become somebody
else and they can't even remember who
the hell they were when he started the
basic training well there was one um
a very clear clue they're found in the
the Full Metal Jacket script and if you
look in the movie the look The Lost hog
squad has got it's got a number it's
4092 or something like that you
um but in the script it's the the
trainees who've got that number so
they've got their squad and it's named
4092 or whatever number it is and in the
movie it switches to the Lost hog Squad
in the second half I thought that was
quite interesting you know
um so yeah it's been a a while since
I've done any videos on Full Metal
Jacket but that's the general uh jungian
gist uh that I got from that yeah I
think that's brilliant because I
remember the first time I saw that movie
back when I was a teenager
I would not have been able to make that

[37:00]
I would not have been able to make that
interpretation I think my sense of
private piles suicide was it was a
commentary on just like the brutality
and cruelty of the military yeah and it
you know this it just destroyed this
person through like this ritualized
trauma and it was a commentary on the
evils of militarism and maybe even
American imperialism I do think it was
that as well I mean this is the thing is
like with Kubrick he he wasn't just he
didn't just feel the need to present one
narrative he was happy to present you
with a number of different things
um which all have some truth to them and
yeah the first half of the movie works
very well on that point and I always
perceived it on that level as well so
I'm not saying that that version of the
first half of the movie is invalid and
it's just the youngin take on it is it's
just a different uh view of it but the
the good thing about that jungi intake
is it does make kind of sense of the
second half of the movie and that's
where people get confused what the hell

[38:00]
where people get confused what the hell
is this second half of the story where's
it going what's it about
yeah yeah and and that's why it it's
weird it's
when I watch some of your
interpretations of films and I think
this is probably true for symbolic
interpretation in general it's like when
I hear your vision of it it like makes
so many things clear and it's almost
like that moment of that makes total
sense and I kind of on some level knew
that without even knowing it that I
think is the confirmation of the
validity of the interpretation it's like
the things that you point out are
absolutely true but they were just
happening subliminally like below the
level of my own awareness
um but everything kind of shifts and
there's a great deal of like Integrity
between between everything that
previously just seemed confusing and
disjointed and hence the reason why you
would click to watch your film analysis
of fullwell jacket you wouldn't watch it
if you didn't think there was more there
absolutely and I think you're right most

[39:00]
absolutely and I think you're right most
people really
first half of that movie which is weird
because the second half is the war movie
you know on some level it's the action
it's the killing it's the yeah I think
part of the reason why a lot of folks
don't like the second half is because
it's not actually just a flat out War
pick it has this like meta Narrative of
the soldiers in action but also like
being interviewed about being in action
which sort of like breaks up the action
of the war movie which is unusual I
don't know any other war movie that's
kind of like that
yeah yeah it's it's
the yeah there's a funny aspect of it
where it's like in the second half of
the movie you know they talked about
John Wayne a lot in the film both in the
first and second half there's references
to John Wayne and it's it's kind of like
in the second half of the film uh all
the soldiers are acting like they are in
a movie
um you know even in like the first
battle scene it's like they're all
posing for the camera you know trying to
look tough for the camera and stuff and
um and you got the when they're all

[40:01]
um and you got the when they're all
sneaking up towards that building where
there's I think the snipers or something
up in the building not the ending of the
movie the first battle scene and they
all just blast this this building to
Pieces
um and it's so staged and choreographed
it's it's like they
it's like they are it's almost like
they're aware that they're in a movie
it's like we are in a war movie and
um well I think that was part of when
they play it up and we're going to act
it up yeah yeah and I think that's part
of why the Vietnam War as I understand
it was so unpopular because it was the
first excessively televised War so that
could be like a kind of historically
accurate um you also talked about the
military creating a man and I'm actually
doing a number of pieces on like
performative masculinity and so maybe
the introduction of the camera in the
film is a commentary on how
we it's like
we we that men these days are are acting
as if they were men on some level that

[41:01]
as if they were men on some level that
they that's more of a performance of
masculinity than
um but actually
okay man potentially
fascinating stuff okay um can I pivot
again Rob okay because once around
whatever subjects you want to talk about
I want to be sure we get to this because
uh I'm one of the biggest James Bond
fans on planet I get a sense that you're
up there too so I'm really excited to be
talking to you about the series so um
I I probably got into Bond when I was a
teenager and I just became obsessed with
him and I probably seen all the
pre-crag movies at least
20 or 30 times so it's like I'm pretty
oh that's a serious bonfire serious yeah
um so I want to there's a number of
things we can discuss first I just got
to get off my chest because I think that
you've made your uh public let's say
disdain is that too strong of a word for
the for the Craig movies

[42:03]
so what's up why do you why do you hate
the Daniel Craig Bond movies so much
um
I don't know about hate I just find them
boring incredibly boring
um you were talking about uh people
acting up on masculinity
um and instead of actually being
masculine and I see that with the Craig
Bond movies and there's too much of an
effort to try and make him look
really tough and hard and you know it's
like I prefer the old bonds where Bond
was having a laugh and
um I I love the uh the Sean Connery
Roger Moore Timothy Dalton era
um
yeah there's so much to go into about
that yeah but it's I find the new ones
are too fake uh ironically that they try
to be more realistic but they're not
more realistic they're just as stupid as
the old ones
um but they try to put this uh veneer of
realism on it

[43:00]
realism on it
um that isn't there the plots are just
as stupid the the characters are just as
stupid the fights are just as
unrealistic but in the old movies they
embraced it and they they didn't lie
about it and they they acknowledge to
the audience who said look you know we
know this is absolute garbage we know
this is juvenile teenage
um masculine sexual fantasy and it's it
could never happen in the real world but
we are going to fulfill those deep
fantasies that you've got on the most
brilliant level
um you know you know we're going to take
the fantasy beyond what even you would
would do with it you know
um and I love how they did that because
for me that felt very honest they made
them movies unrealistic
but I think that was honest because the
fantasies that we men have
that were being fulfilled by the movies
those fantasies are unrealistic to begin
with so I think the more mature approach
is to present it unrealistically on the
screen and the new movies try to

[44:03]
screen and the new movies try to
uh pretend that it's not pretended
yeah they do have this like grittiness
and this realism we don't have exploding
pens and uh you know helicopters and
suitcases and women with ridiculous
names and and things like that but
um
realistic by the way
that case that they're not more
realistic I I do think that for most of
the series they are catering to the male
fantasy it's like who would want to be
this dashing secret agent who lives a
life of adventure embeds all these
beautiful women and saves the world I
mean it's like sign me up for that that
sounds fantastic
and there seemed to be some sort of like
crisis of conscience about this that
happened in my I think the first signs
we see it in our GoldenEye which I we
watched a couple of years ago a lot of
people that are my age have this
romanticized view of GoldenEye I think
because of the video game that came up

[45:00]
because of the video game that came up
uh at that time around the time when we
were classic game and so we love golden
eye but when you go back and watch it
it's actually kind of depressing and a
lot of that movie they spend just like
flagellating bond for his misogynism for
his you know being out of date you know
the money Penny the new Young Money
Penny isn't going to flirt with them so
she's she's too good for his advances
and it's like we can't have fun anymore
in in Goldeneye and it was like we have
to stop uh we have to stop The
Superficial male fantasy that we've been
indulging in for too long and not only
that we have to enact some sort of
penance on men and I actually think
that's where we're getting within the
Craigs because I do I do think that
um you know ever every actor who played
Bond certainly brought something unique
to the role and I think that's also not
just
a representation of who he was as a
person or an actor but also of the times
and um I think what Craig brought to

[46:01]
and um I think what Craig brought to
bond was you know that we hadn't really
seen in bond before is that I can take
it I can take whatever you throw at me
and still stand up like I'm tougher than
anything else it's like you couldn't
think Roger Moore I don't think could
really get the crap beaten out of them
maybe you know he he'd probably keep a
stiff British upper lip but like Craig
is just no matter what you throw at me
no matter if you it's the same with
Connery by the way I mean a lot of
people think if Connery as being a tough
Bond but actually when you see him with
his shirt up in the movies he was just
as skinny as Roger Moore he just had a
hairy chest but heavy chest doesn't stop
but lots of conscious does it you know
so yeah I mean we had Bond like running
through drywalls in Casino Royale and
just like being this this
almost this unhinged weapon of like pure
ID and destruction that needs to kind of
be reigned in in Casino Royale to become
a more targeted effective assassin
basically

[47:01]
basically
um but I do think that the the Craigs
are kind of a
um I mean we're talking about how to be
a man in a modern society that kind of
doesn't believe in men that thinks that
men have done all kinds of bad things in
the past and not only maybe shouldn't be
in power anymore but maybe need to be
brought to bear for those transgressions
those historical Transmissions
and um that Bond as the man who's like
who gets things done and it's tough is
becoming increasingly irrelevant like
you see that in the exchange with q in
Casino Royale and they made Q into this
um this young nerdy character we also
find out in no time to die that he's gay
and he basically says that you know
you're I can do more damage
on my laptop than you could in your
entire life you're you're just someone
needs to pull the trigger every once in

[48:00]
needs to pull the trigger every once in
a while so we're using you you're just
like this brute animal you don't really
have a place and you also see that in
the storyline in like um uh what is it
Specter where uh who is it C is trying
to take over MI6 it's like the the whole
MI6 Empire is we don't need this anymore
we're globalists uh we need to move
Beyond this parochial view of
nationality it's just like the whole
thing about that bond is coming up
against in the Craig films is you are
irrelevant like that just gets told to
him over and over and over again and
over and over and over again he shows
that he's not
like I think that's the the male fantasy
today which is men live in the society
where they're kind of being told in so
many ways that they are increasingly
irrelevant yeah you know we're not
that's a good take on it I like that
yeah and and Craig's and he kind of
takes it on the chin every time it's
like the exchange with Vesper on the
train when he just like Smiles as she
skewers him and no one really [ __ ]

[49:01]
skewers him and no one really [ __ ]
believes in him but he is he gets the
job done and almost everybody comes
around and respects him in the end and I
think that's the new male fantasy not
that I'm gonna go in bed you know 30
different women and have a bunch of cool
cars it's that like I can still be a man
and be respected and celebrated for
doing so yeah what do you think
uh I can I can see that reading of it
um I don't
for me it doesn't make the movies work
um because
right in order to be respected as a man
you have to save the world and I can go
through all kinds of pain and beat
people up and fighting and stuff but
that's the male fantasy version what
does that mean a woman doesn't have to
go through that does that mean some
other person from some other group
doesn't have to do that why is it only a
a male has to do that you know it's a
good point so yeah it's not a message
that I agree with
um but I also never got the the feeling
and I didn't cease back to but I saw the

[50:01]
and I didn't cease back to but I saw the
other ones I never got the feeling in
any of those movies that he ended up
respected at the end it's all for me the
endings were always just flat and dull
um well he died in the last one didn't
he well he does and then they toast him
and you know everybody is very sad uh
Vesper comes around after he started
with his hacks very sad uh maybe you're
right it's the difference isn't it I saw
some interesting takes one thing that I
do think was great about the Craig
series is that really for the first time
you see continuity between the films
which I think was some something that
the series as a whole really
missed out on like I think you see
Sylvia trench for two seconds in From
Russia with Love and she's the girl that
you meet at the baccarat table in Dr No
but other than that other than like q
and Moneypenny and there's like no every
every movie is it takes place in like
this almost
in its own time capture a lot of
medically sealed universe exactly and I

[51:02]
medically sealed universe exactly and I
think that I do kind of like that though
because I love the fact that with all
the old movies you can just say which
Bond movie do I feel like watching today
and you can dive into any one of them
and it's a complete whole experience on
its own
um
where's the new ones yeah it's more like
a series I I prefer the old style but I
can understand that there there are
appeals to having a continuous story
between them all but there's some
interesting things that come out of the
uh the disconnected nature between the
old
um Bond films it's almost like they're
all remakes of the same story you know
and the formula for sure yeah definitely
the same formula they're all remade lots
and lots of different ways
um and you kind of always knew what the
outcome was was going to be but there's
things about that that I found really
fascinating and one of them is uh if you
looked at them as being continuous a
continuous Bond story
what happens to each

[52:02]
what happens to each
um woman he gets with at the end of each
movie before the next movie is the I was
actually thinking I might do a video on
this at some point I think you talked
about this in one of your episodes you
have a little pep probably bad yeah I
mean does he does he does he kill them
off does he uh you know is he serial
killer uh does he just go and sneakily
dump them is this some woman
broken-hearted crying their eyes out
somewhere well he's off Adventure in in
the world meeting the next girl
you don't often see that you see that I
think in uh Tomorrow Never Dies where he
goes up to uh Terry Hatcher's character
and she just slaps him and I think this
is the first time in a film where bond
gets reintroduced
to a woman that he has seduced in the
past you don't you see that yeah yeah
and then he succeeds in seducing her
again so I guess yeah yeah of course he
does yeah yeah there's always an excuse
to let Bond off with them with being a

[53:00]
to let Bond off with them with being a
naughty boy isn't it you know so it was
usually like he sleeps with one girl or
two girls early in the movie and they
get killed by the bad guys sometimes
Bond even slip slips up and accidentally
puts them in danger and they get killed
anyway but then he gets to be with the
woman he really wants in the movie at
the end and he doesn't have to have the
guilt of dumping the other ones because
they got killed
I think that's certainly the formula I I
don't know the numbers but I get the
sense that in recent movies he seduces
fewer women per movie
too I think we're all about Madeline
Swann and there are other some there's
some other eye candy in that movie but I
don't think he actually seduces them my
favorite girl in no time to die was
Paloma the girl that did you see that
one Rob I've seen it yeah I can't
remember much of it
that one really uh kicked me in the
teeth
um Paloma is the girl that she he meets
up with I think in Cuba with Felix and

[54:02]
up with I think in Cuba with Felix and
they have like
a big gun fight she's super competent
she's on the floor shooting the people
and and drinking with her and at the end
he like shakes her hand says good job
and it's like it's almost that one felt
a little heavy-handed it's like man this
is how you're supposed to treat female
colleagues and you know even if they're
beautiful and
um you know this is a male fantasy so uh
but I do think that you know he didn't
sleep with her and in fact
um there's a little bit of a
misunderstanding in a scene where she
brings him into a closet to get him into
change into like an outfit and um he
thinks that they're going to have sex
and she's just like no no no no
um that actually happens in a different
point in the movie with the woman who
becomes the new 007
yeah she kind of picks him up at the
club and they go back to his house and
he just is she's like is the bedroom
over here and he's like okay I guess
we're doing this and it turns out that

[55:00]
we're doing this and it turns out that
she's the new 007 and they're not gonna
have sex so it almost feels like the I
think the number of seductions has
decreased significantly in recent years
and I think that is
um maybe that just has to do with the
political climate or uh how some of the
Seductions in the bond series have
really kind of
toyed with the line of consent let's put
it that way I'm thinking there's a
thing with the from what I recall with
the the Craig Bond films were if he does
sleep with a woman it has to it has to
be because there's been some sort of a
trauma he's been through a horrible time
or she's been through a horrible time
and it's kind of like
um
blocking out the raw sexual attraction
and making out that it's like oh this is
an emotional connection based upon
shared trauma sure which again I found
I find it dishonest because people do
have raw sex Desires in real life people

[56:03]
have raw sex Desires in real life people
do go around you know guys and women
that go around and see people and
um just uh you know decide I'm gonna
but I I would like to just [ __ ] this
person that's what people do it's like
can you hear my phone going off in the
other room there you're good okay my
phone's going off if you can't hear it
that's fine
um so yeah people do have this raw
pornographic desire for people who they
just spot in the streets or people they
know that is what people are really like
you know it's it's there
um so I think to try and take the bond
thing and hide that and say we've got
we're only going to have Bond have
um sex with women when there's some
emotional trauma that's going on between
them and they need to support each other
it's not always like that you know
um
I guess I I don't see the point of
making trying to make bonds more
realistic
um

[57:00]
um
or to try and make bond into the
socially responsible uh movie series
it was never intended to be anything
like that
um if you're gonna make if you're gonna
do a spy series that is socially
responsible then you should have a spy
who questions uh the orders that you
receive through you should have a spy
who looks into his own government and
finds out who he's really working for
what they're really about what their
agendas are not just the agendas of the
enemy
um if you're going to do a socially
responsible spy film you go down that
route and that would involve uh James
Bond going off in a direction that would
be unrecognizable from anything we've
seen before it's like an underpinning
there's an underpinning of the Bond
movies where his own government is
always in the right it's always
trustworthy it might make some mistakes
but it's got the right ideas it's you
know at heart and therefore he is
Justified in killing people blowing
things up whatever attacking enemies in

[58:01]
things up whatever attacking enemies in
order to defend what his government has
ordered him to do you know that was
always a a naive aspect of bond
um and it's almost like it's like bond
is a um it's like he's a man's life you
know
um he's brainwashed into thinking that
he should spend his life putting himself
in danger in order to protect who who
are these people who give them the
orders you know I think they played with
that realistic on bond I would say drop
that stuff sure they I think they play
with that a little bit in Goldeneye in
the antagonism between
007 006 who betrays England and you know
Sean Bean is questioning for England you
know he's only he's only a colleague he
doesn't need to show him being character
I'm talking about the people who are
high up above bomb absolutely but I
think that's in in the second definition
of the shadow that I was mentioning
that's interesting in Goldeneye because
006 is like a double O who begins
presumably to question the the

[59:00]
presumably to question the the
righteousness of the British government
and the orders and like goes Rogue and
betrays the government and so he's like
the shadow side of 007 who's just is
blindly obeying orders and doing
everything for Queen and country that's
actually an interesting antagonist which
film is that in that's golden eye yeah
it's one of the best parts of that film
is I like gold knife because it was a
decent Bond Sean Bean as as Alex
trevillian was was fantastic there is a
there's a spy movie that kind of off top
of my head that does do that it's not an
action-packed spy movie but it's called
the lives of others have you seen that
one Rob very very good yeah
a lot of the things that that you
discussed that movie didn't get talked
about very much no I think it did win
you're one of the very very few
it's a great film I I think I saw that
one in the theaters a long time ago did
It win best foreign picture I'm not I'm
not sure I think it did win some awards
won some awards somewhere I can't
remember why it it got some good

[1:00:00]
remember why it it got some good
recognition when it came out and it just
seems to have been largely forgotten
about in film discussion since then I'd
even forgotten about it myself for years
yeah that was a pretty good one I have
to know um do you have a favorite Bond
I have a soft spot for more too because
the very first Bond movie I saw was um
The Man with the Golden Gun yeah and uh
which I think
It's actually an underrated Bond but it
certainly is one of the best uh and so I
grew up kind of with Roger Moore
well I mean what I what I love about
um Roger Moore is that he's the happiest
Bond if you were going to pick any of
the bonds and live there life had picked
the Roger Moore one because it just
seems to be really cheerful and happy
everywhere he goes and none of the bad
things that happened seem to make it
dense in him emotionally you know
um he lives a great life and he's a real
charmer and he's hilarious he has a
laugh I wouldn't want to live the Daniel

[1:01:00]
laugh I wouldn't want to live the Daniel
Craig Bond life because he's too
miserable and angry and depressing I
find it boring I don't like people like
that I like people who've got a bit of
life to them and people who they don't
just
take all the punches that life has got
to give and get back up and fight back
they actually come back fighting and
they're happy as well they stay happy
despite the traumas I think um for me
the new the new Bond is kind of like a
symptom of something that's been going
on for a long time where
um people value anger and uh self-pity
far too much you never got Roger More
pity and himself in the the bond role
you know I mean even the actor Roger
Moore didn't take the role seriously
um but yeah it's like this like the bond
who has to be pitied because this
happened to him when he was a child or
he got his heart broken and blah blah
blah blah
for me bond isn't a character you're
supposed to Petty he's supposed to be
someone who bounces back strong and
positive
every time you know so I love that it's

[1:02:02]
every time you know so I love that it's
not realistic but for me that's a much
better fantasy uh as a bond I think I
can respect that I mean I I understand
that if you can get through something
but you're so traumatized by having
passed through it that you're devoid of
any Joy or meaning then that's certainly
a pure Victory isn't it it's not it's
not a victory it's all really is and you
might physically survive but you your
emotions haven't survived if you if you
stay in trauma Zone do you have a
favorite film
favorite movie out of the uh series
out of the bond series yeah mine again
this is an unpopular choice but I
[ __ ] love Moonraker I love Moonraker
too yeah I did when the when the
pandemic just started uh I did a a
bondathon I did a tournament of all the
movies I'm a huge Bond nerd and
Moonraker got really really far it's
like the apotheosis of
just the the
bonds fantasy it's like the formula is

[1:03:01]
bonds fantasy it's like the formula is
cubed it's just bond to the moon it's so
over the top and it's so like self-aware
of being over the top it's it's just a
joy to watch it's so much fun
and it's it's there's so much good stuff
to say about I mean it's gorgeously shot
cinematography and moon record is
fantastic you know not just a special
effects but just beautifully shop
throughout
and
um I mean I mean the themes of it are
fantastic as well you know it's uh
particularly with the pandemic
you cut this guy in the space station in
the movies fairly use like uh
genetically engineered whatever the hell
he says to kill people not that I'm
saying that the the pandemic was that
well it's crossed all of our minds at
some point anyone who says it hasn't
crossed their mind is a liar it could
well have been I don't know
um but yeah but there's also a massive
uh overlap between Moonraker and Dr
Strangelove and 2001 A Space Odyssey and
this is true I've documented this in

[1:04:01]
this is true I've documented this in
some videos before
um this very specific references to uh
2001 Space Odyssey in the novelization
of Moonraker which was written alongside
with the movie
um
yeah just loads and loads of great it's
even got the thing which uh I I don't
the only other movie I can think of that
does this Starship Troopers where
um Moonraker shows a a future Hitler
type character and he was supposed to be
a Hitler type character like a Doctor
Strange Love German character but he
made they used a french actor because
they needed to film in France when they
were making Moonraker and he did a great
job I can't remember the actor's name
who played the villain but you know
french actor he was superb but that
character was scripted to be very
specifically
um so so he he had a German history
um that he was an ex-nazi you know and
so
in Moonraker that character shows up and
he's creating this new master race and

[1:05:01]
he's creating this new master race and
um Bond sort of points this out later
um when they're arguing on the space
station about his vision of the future
but his
totalitarian Master race is a
multicultural word
he hasn't gone the Hitler route he's
gone beyond the path of I'm going to
take these couples of all the different
races I'm going to bring them along and
I'm going to create
um a version of Hitler's
um ideas about how the world was going
to be but I'm going to make it
Multicultural version of it and so
Moonraker did that back in 1979 and for
me that that
that was a crystal ball ahead towards
we've got now because a lot of the
people who are pushing
um the multiculturalism and diversity
stuff don't give a damn about that stuff
that's a tool that they are using to
divide people that's the way I view it
um it's a lot of rich white people who

[1:06:00]
um it's a lot of rich white people who
are pushing that stuff to get other
people attacking each other on the basis
of race gender stuff like that and and
that prevents people from actually
looking at the very super Richard that's
often saying hang on what are they doing
to us yet divide and conquer so I think
that's been happening in a while then I
think Moonraker predicted that and the
other movie that predicted that was
Starship Troopers because it showed them
a future Society where
um you have men and women as equally
equally as soldiers
um fighting in the battlefield and stuff
and um and you have all the different
races together and it's like we've got
this big diverse future Society but it's
a totalitarian one anyway
you know so that those are the only two
movies I can think of that tapped into
that so that was one good aspect of the
moon right that's fascinating yeah I I
did notice that in the film when I
rewatched it that it was uh not going
the pure Airy and bloodline route when
they did show the
um the couples that were selected to
repopulate Earth but they were all like

[1:07:02]
repopulate Earth but they were all like
beautiful and I presumably you know very
genetically healthy like they were they
were tested and uh you know for their
which defeat defeats the points of
diversity they're not diverse in terms
of their level of Health well that's
certainly true so it's just taken
Hitler's Doctrine and instead of basing
it on one single race we're gonna base
it on the most healthy beautiful
specimens
you know which how is that any better
yeah there is a uh there's a lot of
uh history that people don't understand
about the like Eugenics movement there
was a Eugenics movement in the United
States that predated the uh Eugenics
movement in Europe
uh they were on laws on the books in
several U.S states until I think maybe
the 60s or 70s with mandatory
sterilization of certain individuals
that were uh yeah say cognitively

[1:08:00]
that were uh yeah say cognitively
impaired for instance
um you know pretty
pretty nasty laws but the the idea that
we can
um we can move in the direction of that
certain certain parts certain types of
individuals are really corrupting the
nature of society and it's
it's our responsibility to cleanse
Society of these folks I mean that's a
very old idea and I don't know if it's
ever going away it sounds like what
you're arguing is that it's it's just
been transmitted into something that is
absolutely more socially acceptable and
because of that it's harder to see
find it harder to see so maybe a lot of
people do
um yeah yeah I made a video about the
department of the jungian Shadow thing
that well you know which is you know
like I said Carl Jung said this goes on
with all laws uh with the Nazis uh We've
bought the Nazis and they are the evil

[1:09:01]
bought the Nazis and they are the evil
ones completely utterly evil and we are
absolutely right to fight and defeat
them and do whatever is necessary to
defeat them but we're not recognizing
that what is there in the Nazis is there
in us as well in Britain and America and
everywhere else it was true back then it
was still true now I mean if I remember
rightly Than That season some of their
propaganda stuff they used to put out
um they would actually point out how
um the UF streets uh blacks you know and
um that was well they will put that out
as part of their propaganda but there
was some truth to it you know so you got
two sides who uh who've got racism going
on lots of different groups each
criticizing each other's racism it's
just Shadow stuff projectional you know
from both you see that yeah I I do I I
I'm conscious of the time and I've
really enjoyed the conversation so far
Rob I I will
um also mention since we're talking
about Moonraker
the

[1:10:00]
the
you you called to my attention this
perceptual illusion about Dolly's braces
I I had to go back and watch that movie
as soon as I saw that video because I
could not believe you I had this
incredibly strong memory of seeing
Dolly's mouth break into a racist-filled
smile when she died
and I was like there's no way I've seen
that movie 40 times I know that by heart
and she doesn't have braces it was so it
was so incredible
and I I think your explanation for why
that perceptual illusion existed in the
minds of so many people uh I think it
was
um you know persuasive so thanks for
bringing that to my attention well I
hope it was because I can't find that
footage the original footage in there
yeah I sure thought she did but I went
at least on the DVD versions I had the
VHS versions back when I was a kid I
don't think I have them anymore

[1:11:01]
don't think I have them anymore
um I did notice you've only saw no time
to die once so you probably wouldn't
catch this but there was changes in the
movie from the theatrical release to the
DVD release they're not the same film
I don't know why they did this but there
were they changed the scene between Bond
and uh the villain who who what's his
name
Lucifer it's like Lucifer luciferon or
something like that I can't remember I
can't even remember the the character
that Randy Malek plays when Bond
confronts him in his Fortress and they
have that back and forth about like some
men I remember very explicitly in the
theater as it was a very weird shot
where usually they do this um
you know the kind of perspective taking
back and forth within the conversation
and then there was this shot where the
camera looks right at Bond and bond
looks right into the camera which never

[1:12:01]
looks right into the camera which never
happens and he basically says some
people don't you know want to play God
and it was just this really jarring shot
that doesn't exist in the DVD release
and there's a few other lines that have
been changed and the shots have been
changed I think as far as I can tell
only in that conversation and I have not
been able to find any information about
this on the internet I don't know if
anybody else has even noticed this but I
guarantee I'm remembering this correctly
because it was such a jarring change and
that kind of you know close up into the
camera look these things do happen don't
they do you think that happened with
Dolly's braces I'm thinking I'm thinking
it's possible because you think that you
have this strong memory of the braces I
think I have a strong memory the braces
but why would they that doesn't make
sense that they would like get rid of
braces from the VHS you did mention
before that there was uh the thing about
when you were younger you watched the
movie on VHS yeah and yeah I think I put

[1:13:00]
movie on VHS yeah and yeah I think I put
that in the video I did about it where
when you're watching the VHS because
it's a a lower resolution image you're
going to be more likely to perceive
braces there
um you know often watching the HD movie
makes it look so much different visually
and there's been times when I've done
studies of movies uh years like some of
my early film studies I had to rely on
uh DVDs I didn't have there wasn't
really hardly any HD movies out back
then when I first started doing film
analysis and there would be points where
I would thought that I could see certain
things in the certain movies and then
when I get the HD version suddenly it's
more clear so that's what it is okay I
would never have been able to guess that
so it could be something like that I
always thought though that it was such a
clever little visual thing that the
directors were doing because you have
Jaws who's this monstrous yeah not only
is he tall but he's monstrous because he
has this like bunch of metal in his
mouth and you would think he'd be
terrifying to this small little girl and

[1:14:02]
terrifying to this small little girl and
then when she smiles she has metal in
her mouth too
yeah it makes total sense that the
braces should be there yeah um
definitely and the way she slowly Smiles
you you think oh there's going to be a
slow revealing of the of the braces
there and yeah it is it's a it's a an
incredible illusion there unless there
it really is some sort of
uh conspiracy where the footage got
changed or something I don't know it was
uh I don't I don't think so I don't know
why they would take the braces out but I
I want to know why they changed the
dialogue in that scene in no time to die
so if anybody out there knows please get
in touch with me uh Rob I feel like I
could talk to you all day but I want to
be respectful of your time uh anything
else you'd like to say
uh not that I can think of no I can't
remember if there was any other subjects
we wanted to discuss uh I mean what
about if there's any last topic you'd
like to quickly cover or you know
whatever
um
well we can leave Bond
um I

[1:15:01]
um I
I'd like to know maybe if you have any
film recommendations for folks out there
I I have the Criterion channel do you
have that Rob
I haven't got the channel no but I've
got lots of movies that are from the
Criterion Collection I don't get any
kind of Kickback from saying this but I
highly recommend that people look into
the possibility of getting a Criterion
Channel subscription it is fantastic
it's 100 bucks a year and you get access
to thousands and thousands of like the
highest grade World Cinema Classics
um movies that are very hard to find
anywhere certainly you're not going to
find them on Netflix
um and so that's really helped me to
broaden my cinematic Horizons but um
always looking to know
where I'm what I'm missing so do you
have any recommendations for folks
okay so I was trying to think of some
amazing movies which hardly anybody
knows about so talks about and one
spring Springs to mind came out the same

[1:16:00]
spring Springs to mind came out the same
year as 2001 A Space Odyssey but it
cleared up at the Oscars was the musical
version of Oliver you know Oliver Twist
sure I saw that a long time ago
yeah that is an amazing movie on all
kinds of levels wow I haven't seen it in
a while in a long time do you think
that's that movie's so great and the
size of the production is just
incredible just on the pure technicality
of the scale of the production the
songwriting and musical score is
incredible I don't even like musicals
generally it's usually my least favorite
genre and for me that's the best music
I've ever made I like pretty much all
the songs in it
um
the the actors the set designs you know
the many
um classic performances in it and Oliver
Reed was amazing because Bill Sykes and
yeah you've got tears it's Tom Moody as
Place Fagan
um there's just so much good stuff in
that movie I've been wanting to make a
video about it for years but not really
good I did make a short video on the

[1:17:00]
good I did make a short video on the
bill Sykes character
oh yeah that's a movie that uh still
massively impresses with me today
um I think partially I like it because
it gets into this really dark aspect of
uh history how people lived and suffered
and died in in
parts of Britain back then and
um
but the subject matter is so grim
that the movie has to use a musical
presentation in order to stop in the
blow for the audience if it was just
done in this with the same crew and
director and everything
um with no musical aspects of it I think
it would have been too Grim for people
um so yeah I think the the the musical
frame and of it makes it very palatable
yeah that's fantastic one of my one of
my top 20 favorite movies of it that's a
strong recommendation I watched a long
time ago when I went through all of the
best picture

[1:18:01]
best picture
um films I haven't seen it in years but
on that recommendation I will check it
out again
yeah call Rob if people want to know
more about your stuff where can they
find you
uh on the YouTube channel
collatedlearning.com
c-o-l-a-t-i-v-e correlative learning or
on the website of the same name and um
yeah yeah this is a couple hundred
videos there on the YouTube channel some
of them are really long like two hours
long so we'll be just short ones and
then on the website there's uh articles
and stuff available there as well yeah
I'll put those film analysis but
sometimes on psychology stuff as well
I'll put links in the descriptions for
folks and some of those videos are
definitely worth watching even the
longer ones um especially the ones on
The Shining uh blew my mind man so
really great work thank you so much for
talking to me today thanks for having me
on it's a pleasure talking to you yeah
thanks Rob all right let's touch all
right bye
