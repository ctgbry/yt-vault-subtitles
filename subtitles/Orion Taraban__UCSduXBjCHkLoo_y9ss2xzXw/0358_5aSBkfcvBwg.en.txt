as a man it can actually be fairly
difficult to discern whether you
actually like a woman or you are simply
sexually attracted to her and obviously
it's important to make that distinction
now there are many ways to do this and
it might sound a little crass but in my
opinion one of the best ways to
discriminate between those two options
is to have sex with the woman and notice
how you feel immediately afterwards if
you notice that you are full of regret
you're questioning what you're doing
here and you can't wait for her to leave
congratulations you were horny and you
were sexually attracted to this woman
doesn't necessarily mean that you can't
find something about her to like or that
you shouldn't continue to pursue that
relationship but you don't yet actually
like the person on the other hand if you
finish and you enjoy her company and you
like appreciate her presence in that
particular moment there might be
something about this person
that you are attracted to
