I don't often believe in bad
transactions. Like if a transaction is
too desperate, it doesn't occur. So to
give an example about that reminds me of
my own life. So when I was younger, I
got involved with a lot of very dramatic
and unstable women. I was an actor. I
did a lot of actresses. We're not known
for our emotional stability. It would
just be chaos some of these
relationships. And I would think, well,
I'm I'm giving so much and I'm getting
nothing in return. Like that in my mind,
I thought that it was a bad transaction,
right? maybe this woman is feeling
similarly. But that wasn't entirely
true. But as long as I felt that that
was true, it kept me in that dynamic.
What helped me break out of that dynamic
was to understand and appreciate how
deeply I had a need for excitement to
feel like somebody was a problem so that
I could solve that problem, which helps
me feel useful and and reassured, which
was a big part of my ego identity. That
I hated boredom. That these women, even
though they were crazy and
unpredictable, there was never a dull
moment with them. So, they were meeting
a lot of needs that I wasn't willing to

consciously accept for a while. And that
kept me in this bad dynamic because I
kept seeing her as the problem. She was
potentially just I was giving and giving
and she was just taking and taking and
taking. And that doesn't actually happen
in reality is that people who truly give
and give and give and and and don't
receive anything in return generally
don't stick
