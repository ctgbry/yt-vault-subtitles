I went to uh Tish School of the Arts and
I went to the experimental Theater Wing
the entire first semester of my acting
training was spent playing one game
that's it we played this one game for
like 4 months straight that's all we did
and I've since realized that this game
is the fundamental game of human
interaction it's very simple it's called
the game of please no there's always two
people who play I'll start I can only
say the word please you go second you
can either say yes or no and you have to
start with no and the goal of the game
is for me to get your no into a yes
using only the word please so what this
forces people to do is it very quickly
they come up against the limits of their
own like semantic language if the only
word you can say is please you have to
rely on all other forms of communication
like gesture body posture eye contact
expression Rhythm duration like you
learn how to communicate
non-verbally and you learn to listen
really well to people because the way
someone tells you no always offers a
clue as to what it would take to get
them to say yes
