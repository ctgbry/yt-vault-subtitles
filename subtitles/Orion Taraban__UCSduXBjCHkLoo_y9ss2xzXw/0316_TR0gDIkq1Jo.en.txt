I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
what's in it for me
so when this question occurs in the
context of romantic relationships this
question of what's in it for me can come
off as selfish or even mercenary there
is a great resistance to approaching
romantic relationships from this
perspective as it seems to reduce them
to the level of transactional exchange a
relationship becomes a bartering of
sorts you get this and in return I get
that and my response to this would be
what's wrong with that
now before I defend my position please
remember to like this video And

back to my argument
the thing is that people need things
from other people and the medium through

[01:01]
from other people and the medium through
which value is exchanged between people
is called a relationship
think about it guys in a relationship if
one person isn't asking what's in it for
me
that relationship is exploitative
and if one person can't ask what's in it
for me
that's slavery
and I don't think anybody here is going
to be defending exploitation or slavery
anytime soon
on the other hand when both parties ask
what's in it for me
That's the basis of free and Equitable
negotiation
and unless both people can ask that
question you don't have freedom and you
don't have equality
and that means that there's something
exploitative baked into the very
Foundation of that relationship
asking what's in it for me is not
mercenary or insulting it's the basis of
free and Equitable relationship
that said this question absolutely rubs

[02:01]
that said this question absolutely rubs
some people the wrong way which is a
little sus
I mean think about it if this question
can't be asked we're dealing with an
exploitative relationship
and who is likely to be more wrinkled by
this question being asked the exploited
or the exploiter
obviously it would be the exploiter who
would be more upset by this question as
it threatens the basis of his or her
exploitation
someone who is prepared to provide
something of value to the other party
would have no problems with this
question in fact he or she would invite
this question as its answer indicates
the basis upon which a free and
Equitable relationship could be
established
all this is perfectly rational however
we have this really intense cultural
programming against asking this question
in the context of our romantic
relationships and I think wherever you

[03:00]
relationships and I think wherever you
find the most resistance to this idea
you also tend to find the most
inequitable relationships
examine it for yourself
what do you think please let me know in
