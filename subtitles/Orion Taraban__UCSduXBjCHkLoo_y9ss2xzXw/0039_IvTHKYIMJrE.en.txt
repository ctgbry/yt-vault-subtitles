i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is the trap of why
so this is something that people are
subject to falling into
especially following a painful loss or
setback
the end of a relationship the death of a
loved one things like that
and i think it's perfectly natural for a
person in such a situation in the midst
of grief
to search for meaning to question why
why did this happen
why did this occur now to a certain
extent
this question is useful it's sort of
like reviewing the tape after losing a
football match
by performing a postmortem for example
you can see where you zigged
when you should have zagged and the goal
of reviewing that tape
is to glean a few lessons that you can
implement in future games moving forward
this is useful and unproblematic however
after reviewing the tape it's useful to
put it away
and get ready for the next match people

[01:02]
and get ready for the next match people
who fall into the trap of why
keep reviewing the tape over and over
and
over and over again and this can happen
because no why question why did this
happen
ever has a single definitive answer
that is so valid and unimpeachable that
it will resolve
all future doubts on the subject until
the end of time
there is no such answer that will
contain the perfect and total
explanation
for why something occurred it's just
sort of beyond our can
beyond our human understanding but
in the search for just such an answer
some people can fall
prey to playing that tape obsessively
hundreds of times
thousands of times at this point they're
not really learning anything new
they're just sort of ruminating on their
past mistakes or their past misfortune
and this isn't very useful at all doing
this is like picking a scab

[02:00]
this is like picking a scab
by not allowing the wound to heal these
folks maintain a kind of emotional
connection to the lost
object a painful connection to be sure
but to many people
a painful connection is preferable to no
connection at all
it's a way of keeping the lost object
alive in the emotional memory of the
griever
that's really what that's about so
in general there are good enough answers
to why questions
but no completely satisfying ones people
don't stop
asking why when they arrive at a
definitive answer
they stop asking why when they decide
to stop asking why at this point
the question changes from why did this
happen to
because this happened what do i do
moving forward
a decision that ideally will be informed
by the lessons one gleaned
from the good enough answers to the
question of why
so those are my thoughts on the matter
