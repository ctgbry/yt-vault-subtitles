What really motivates the modern woman
is FOMO, the fear of missing out. Thanks
to social media, it appears that other
women are doing all of the things, which
sends the cue that doing all of the
things is the fattest part of the
behavioral curve, which as we've
discussed is where the safety is. And I
think this is a big part of why so many
women today are making themselves
unnecessarily anxious and stressed and
depressed. The vast majority of women
cannot do all of the things which
basically sends a constant signal to
them that they are drifting out of the
shaw. Their emotions are responding to
this perception of danger. However, this
is not conscious in all but the most
self-aware individuals. FOMO as a
guiding principle also helps to explain
a lot of what would otherwise remain
baffling about the decisions of modern
women. If the goal is to do all of the

any path that forecloses any other. This
is a big part of why women tend to use
their 20s, the decade when they are most
likely to secure a long-term
relationship on the most favorable terms
to advance their education and careers
rather than start a I'm waiting.
