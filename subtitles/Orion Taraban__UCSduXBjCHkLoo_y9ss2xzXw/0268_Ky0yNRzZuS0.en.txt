in my episode if you've done nothing
wrong don't apologize kimberly brown
diaz comments
even if you did not do something wrong
it's rude not to apologize now i can see
that point of view however i will have
to respectfully disagree with it and and
here's my counter argument if you're
primarily concerned with let's say
politeness or or rudeness
then i would say that
demanding an apology or expecting an
apology from someone who you admit did
nothing wrong
is more rude
than not apologizing for something when
no transgression happened even if
another person's feelings were hurt
um
that if you acknowledge that the other
person has done nothing wrong
that most likely the expectation was a
covert contract that wasn't explicitly
negotiated with the other person and
holding the other person responsible for
your disappointment
um is rather unpolite
