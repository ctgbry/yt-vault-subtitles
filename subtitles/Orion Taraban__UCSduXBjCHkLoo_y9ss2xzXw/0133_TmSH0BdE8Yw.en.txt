I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is the
truth about romantic love un
obtainability
so this is the first in a series of
episodes in which I hope to expose some
of the Lesser known and darker aspects
of romantic love in a previous episode I
discussed the origins of romantic love
they were in the secularization of the
dogma of A persecuted p sect known as
The cathars Who existed in the provance
region of France in the 11th and 12th
centuries
a now one of the main reasons romantic
love took off was that many members of
the powerful aristocracy that existed in
that time and place like the Knights of
the shival order were also secretly
members of the cathar sect and these
Nobles did much to preserve the
principles of romantic love and to
promote its practice across Europe so we

[01:03]
promote its practice across Europe so we
actually talk about chivalry and romance
in the same breath for good reason some
of the first practitioners of romantic
love were the chivalric Knights now it's
important to understand how romantic
love existed within the shival code as
many of these principles continue to
exert an an invisible influence on
romantic relationships today back in the
day every shival night chose one woman
to be the object of his
desire So In traditional romantic love
the man is always in the position of the
adorer and the woman is always in the
position of the adored it's never the
other way around if you need a Refresh
on these terms check out my episode on
the balance of Attraction the shibel
Rick coat demanded that the male Knight
voluntarily Place him self in a position

[02:00]
voluntarily Place him self in a position
of adoration relative to a specific
woman who is generally a noble occupying
a higher position in the social
hierarchy the Knight placed this woman
on an emotional pedestal saying of her
often exaggerated virtues and dedicated
to her the fruits of his labor sound
familiar but here's the catch and the
part that has largely been lost In Time
the woman in question
was always married to another
man this is so important that I'll say
it again the woman the shivel Knight
chose to love was always married to
another man this Arrangement ensured
that the adored functionally remained
unobtainable which is actually an
essential feature of romantic love and
why might this be the knights believed
that unconsummated love was purer than

[03:01]
that unconsummated love was purer than
the consummated variety remember romance
is the secularization of the dogma of
the cathar cult and cathar means pure
these guys were really into the idea of
Purity by selecting an unobtainable lady
a married woman of higher Social Status
as the object of their devotion the
shival knights protected the Dignity of
their love from being sullied by the
carnality of Sex and the B of marriage
that's right the romantics were also
opposed to marriage which was a
sacrament of the Catholic Church the
cathar UR while persecutors furthermore
the unup ability of the adored also
ensured that the Game of Love could be
played indefinitely whether we like to
admit it or not much of the pleasure and
excitement of the game of love comes in
the pursuit of the Beloved actually
catching the pursuit ends the game or at

[04:00]
catching the pursuit ends the game or at
least changes the game significantly so
if you enjoy playing the game of love it
makes sense to choose an object of
Desire well beyond your reach that way
the pursuit never has to end and you can
keep feeling all the
feels romantic love thrives in
conditions where the adored is
unobtainable and I think you'll find
this to be true in your own experience
the moments when you experience the most
intense feelings of romantic love
probably involved a a a large gap in
social status or attraction or B an
unrequited onesided affection both of
these facilitate the UN obtainability of
the adored romantic love is not about
sex and it's not about marriage it's
about feeling a certain kind of emotion
a pure and heartfelt longing for the
other it's a sweet and Melancholy Pang
whose pains are upset by the supposed

[05:00]
whose pains are upset by the supposed
nobility and righteousness afforded to
the ever hopeful
