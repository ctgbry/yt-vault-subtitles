i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
fundamental law of attraction
so let's jump right into it the
fundamental law of attraction is
people want what they want
not what wants them
i'll say it again people want what they
want
not what wants
them
think about it from your own experience
no matter your current feelings about
dating and relationships there was
likely a time in your life when you
received unwanted attention and
affection from another person
the fact that you did not reciprocate
this person's attention and affection
may even have motivated this person to
try even harder to communicate their
intentions
what was the effect of this additional
effort on your level of attraction
did you suddenly make an about face and
think wow i wasn't attracted to this
person at all but i guess i didn't know

[01:02]
person at all but i guess i didn't know
just how into me they were
and now that i do i just can't resist
them anymore
absolutely not right
if anything this person's additional
effort
drove you even further away because it
further emphasized the increasing gap in
attraction between the parties involved
wanting someone more
does not make them want you more
i'll say that again wanting someone more
does not make them want you more
it will likely do the opposite
on the other hand wanting someone less
can make them want you more it doesn't
always work but it can
this is the fundamental law of
attraction people want what they want
not what wants them if people wanted
what wanted them the world would be a
much simpler place
but what do you think
