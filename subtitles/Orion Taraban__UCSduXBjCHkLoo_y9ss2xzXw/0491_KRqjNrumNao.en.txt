in order to illustrate how women punish
the men they like let's say you have two
men and one guy you could kind of take
her Le decent he's okay to have some fun
with every once in a while but you're
not that emotionally invested and the
other guy you really like he's handsome
charming makes you laugh treats you well
and seems to have good potential and the
more emotionally invested you become
which of these two men are you going to
be annoyed at if he doesn't text you
back right away which of these two men
are you going to get jealous of if he
spends time with other women which of
these two men are you going to pester if
he's not showing sufficient enthusiasm
and doing what you want you get what I'm
saying the second guy whoever he is
apparently has been able to successfully
attract you and engage your emotion and
as a consequence of that he increasingly
becomes the target of your negative
emotions if this guy doesn't feel like
he's getting the same slack and
permissiveness that you would give to
the guy you don't give a about he's
not going to stick around if he has any
decent optionality
