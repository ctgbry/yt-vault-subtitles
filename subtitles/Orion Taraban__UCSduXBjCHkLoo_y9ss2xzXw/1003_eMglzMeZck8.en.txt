Well, I think a lot of nice guys will
look at the quote unquote bad boys and
ask themselves why these guys, these
dicks, these jerks, these [ __ ] get
all the women. I don't think that
they're a bad boy or they mistreat them.
I think there's elements of that
behavior that makes them very attractive
to the women that they're out seeking.
&gt;&gt; Oh, certainly that is absolutely true.
Is that we can play with the linguistics
and say, okay, they're not a cocky,
they're confident or they're uh not
arrogant, they're self- assured and
bold. So like and clearly there are
those are different constructs that are
adjacent and it's very hard to walk
those lines. But again, sexuality is not
squeaky clean. Like there's darkness and
the bedroom plays by different rules
than the rest of society. It's like the
wild west. And there are women who get
off on being disrespected. There are men
who get off on being disrespected. So
it's like the idea that these women just
want these men because they're confident
isn't necessarily the case. Like what
people are attracted to is a labyrinth.

people are attracted to is a labyrinth.
It's a morass. It's very difficult to
tease apart. It's very difficult to
understand. Is it even necessary to
understand as long as it's not breaking
any laws, you know, and and both people
are into it? Like, what's the problem?
But to say that all women get off at
just being treated respectfully by a
confident man, that nice guys mistake as
an [ __ ] is also incorrect.
