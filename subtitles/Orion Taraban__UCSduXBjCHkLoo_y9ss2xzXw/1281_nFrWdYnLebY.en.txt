Love and justice. These are two grand
words that represent two very weighty
concepts. We seem to have two very
different attitudes toward these two
concepts. We seem to want love, demand
it even, but justice, well, maybe for
other people, but not so much for
ourselves. Many people explicitly
believe that only God can judge them in
the sense that they believe that no one
has the right to put him or herself
above another in the act of judgment.
All humans are created equal after all.
So they say therefore human judgment is
a kind of arrogant usurppation of God's
place which belief gives rise to all
kinds of contempt for earthly
institutions. And I can see where these
people are coming from. Earthly
institutions have a long history of
abusing the power entrusted to them to
execute justice and justice absolutely
in its highest sense can be understood

[01:02]
in its highest sense can be understood
as coming from God. However, the exact
same things could be said about love.
Love absolutely in its highest sense can
be understood as coming from God and
many abuses have been perpetuated in its
name. My point is that the common
objections against justice aren't unique
to that idea. They can be applied to
pretty much any and every moral good.
But this collectively puts us in a very
strange position. We refuse to be judged
by people especially because judgment so
often comes with consequences or even
punishments that are experienced as
painful. But we expect love from people.
That is we expect people to be divine in
their capacity to love but not in their
capacity to judge which is very
peculiar. We are collectively saying I
want the good stuff now and I'll take
the bad stuff in the next life if there
is one. And in any case, I'll be banking
on God being a merciful distributor of

on God being a merciful distributor of
justice.
