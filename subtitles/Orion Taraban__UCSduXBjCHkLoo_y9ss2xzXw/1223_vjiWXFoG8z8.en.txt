when you look at the both aspect
relationship versus love which you seem
to draw like a line in between.
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; What can expand you more as a human

love can really expand who you are as a
human being

could building a business.
&gt;&gt; Like so could adopting a child.
&gt;&gt; True. There are many very hard things
that human beings can do that will
dramatically expand their consciousness,
their sense of self, their soul. And how
many people do those in their spare
time? [music] So again, the ironic thing
to me is that when people say they're
looking for love, they're not looking to
be turned inside out. They're not
looking for this really hard thing. Ooh,
I really want to do a hard thing that's
going to break me open so I can learn to
love in a selfless way. They want to be
loved, which is a totally different
experience.

different experiences the restaurant. To
be loved is to be served. It's the best
thing in the world.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's great to have that kind of
selfless devotion attended to
