I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
cherry on top so the inspiration for
this episode came from a consultation
that I did with a man who let's just say
was becoming increasingly frustrated
with women from his perspective
relationships with women were just so
costly and difficult and any benefits he
received did not justify the expense the
whole the juice isn't worth the squeeze
argument and at one point he asked me
Orion what do you personally get out of
relationships with women like what do
they really have to
offer so I paused for a bit and I
considered my own experience and I
answered him honestly and I said you
know I get a lot from my relationships
with women like it's nice to have
someone to connect with at the end of
the day it's nice to have someone to
spend an evening with

[01:00]
spend an evening with
whether it's going out to dinner or
cooking at home it's nice to have an
occasional travel companion someone you
can share the good things in life with
as it's the sharing that makes them even
more enjoyable it's nice to have someone
to cuddle and squeeze and fall asleep
with and it's nice to have someone who
can help me out from time to time to
pick up a bottle of wine or drop off my
dry cleaning or what have you like women
make my life a little sweeter and a
little better for being in it and after
I finished the guy kind of looked at me
like like I had fallen from the Moon and
he asked Orion are you really going to
tell me that you're willing to put up
with all the expense and difficulty and
inconvenience and headache of a
relationship with a woman because they
will occasionally drop off your dry
cleaning there's absolutely no way
that's worth it that sounds ridiculously
overpriced and I answered oh yeah
definitely it's completely
overpriced not going to argue there

[02:01]
overpriced not going to argue there
now he looked at me even more
incredulously so why do you do it and I
replied it's like I said women make my
life a little sweeter and a little
better for being in it everything that a
woman does for me I could do or have
done for myself often more cheaply and
more easily however it's nicer when a
woman does it and it's that niess that
justifies the expense at least in my
mind like I've just made my piece with
how much that niess
costs women are like the cherry on top
of the Sunday and let's be honest you
don't need a cherry to have a Sunday a
Sunday is mostly ice cream and syrup and
caramel and whipped cream and nuts and
what have you the Cherry is just a
garnish it's not necessary a Sunday
without a cherry is still a Sunday but
boy oh boy doesn't that bright red

[03:01]
boy oh boy doesn't that bright red
cherry on top just make the Sunday
perfect like a Sunday is definitely
better with a cherry than without
one now those little cherries are pretty
pricey like a jar of those marcinos can
cost as much as a couple of gallons of
ice cream and that's wild if you think
about it because you know the ice cream
is necessary for the Sunday whereas the
cherries are not but that's kind of why
they're so expensive they're a luxury
good and that's kind of what women are
especially in today's day and age I mean
long gone are the days where women were
expected to provide necessary value
where they churn the butter and sew the
clothes and cook the meals our modern
technological advancements have
liberated women from these roles and I
don't have a problem with that like I
would much rather spend five bucks on
butter at the market than turn it myself
so I certainly can't chide women for

[04:00]
so I certainly can't chide women for
wanting to opt out the issue is that
this Liberation like anything else in
life comes at a cost and when women
stopped providing necessary value then
relationships with them started to
become
unnecessary they stopped being
necessities and started becoming
luxuries and this isn't necessarily a
problem provided they can find someone
willing to happily incur the cost cost
of a luxury the issue is that on the
population level most men can't afford
it and this begs the question that we're
now openly debating in contemporary
culture namely is this a net gain for
women are they better off when they are
expected to provide necessary value for
men or are they better off when they
can't find men who can afford their
relationships with
them if you appreciate the insights on

[05:00]
them if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description again I don't really mind
the expense but that's because I'm at
the stage of my life where I can afford
a little luxury when I was younger I
certainly could have used a woman's help
like there were many things I could not
yet do and I really could have
instrumentally benefited from a woman

[06:00]
instrumentally benefited from a woman
during that time and even though there
was nothing stopping a woman from
providing that necessary value from
building a life with me when I had
nothing from cultivating a true
partnership in the fullest sense of that
word I found no women who were
interested in doing that and trust me I
offered that opportunity to several
rather they chose men who were more
materially established than I was and
whose lifestyle were far more
extrapolated like many young men today I
was frustrated and confused by women's
apparent unwillingness to partner with
me of course 20 years later my
circumstances are now completely
different I don't really need a woman
because women have forced me to learn
how to do what they might have done for
me for myself like I don't know a single
woman who cooks better or more often
than I do for example

[07:00]
than I do for example
and because I'm now successful and
self-sufficient I can increasingly cater
to women's desires to be luxury goods
and at this point they kind of have to
be cherries like the sunde has already
been constructed that's why they're
interested now I got the ice cream and
the syrup and the nuts and the whipped
cream so what else can they be the
Cherry is the only thing missing
remember only Founders get equity
and if you can appreciate that you're
dealing with a luxury good with
something that isn't strictly necessary
then your attitude towards it starts to
shift in the first place you stop
burdening it with unreasonable hopes and
expectations like don't expect much from
a cherry it will definitely make your
Sunday a little sweeter a little
brighter but you could certainly
dispense with it if
necessary men run into trouble when they
want the woman to do more than a woman

[08:01]
want the woman to do more than a woman
can do or will do there are many things
that a woman can do in a relationship
but there are at least as many things
that a woman can't do and unfortunately
these are the things that men tend to go
to women for like a woman isn't going to
make you happy she can't she's not going
to bring you peace she can't she isn't
going to complete your life she can't
only only you can make yourself happy
only you can bring yourself peace and
only you can complete your life don't
look to a woman for those things that's
expecting the Cherry to be the Sunday
and that's not fair to her because
you're setting her up for failure which
will only lead to anger resentment and
disappointment it's a much better idea
men to get those things from the rest of
your Sunday like if you have the ice
cream and the syrup and the whipped

[09:00]
cream and the syrup and the whipped
cream you're going to be pretty happy
and satisfied with or without the cherry
and that will make it easier for you to
enjoy that sweet delicious bite at the
end what's more this attitude shift will
help you have more appropriate standards
with respect to women like what are
reasonable standards for a cherry a
cherry is sweet a cherry is bright a
cherry is fresh and when a Cherry is
those things it perfects the sunde on
the other hand if the Cherry is sour if
the Cherry is dull and if the Cherry is
stale it can ruin the entire confection
like a little bit of putrescence can
absolutely destroy an otherwise
delectable dish so those are the
reasonable standards associated with
cherries that they should be sweet and
bright and fresh and of course cherries
are compensated in the responsibilities

[10:00]
are compensated in the responsibilities
by the Privileges of their position
sitting comfortably at top a carefully
constructed bed of whipped cream so I
wanted to share that with you today if
you can approach a woman like a luxury
good then it might alter your hopes and
expectations for that relationship a
cherry on top can be a delightful
addition but it's probably best that you
go to your Sunday for your subsistance
and
fulfillment what do do you think does
