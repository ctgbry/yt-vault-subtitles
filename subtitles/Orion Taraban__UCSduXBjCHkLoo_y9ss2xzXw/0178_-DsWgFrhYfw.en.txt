i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the work
never ends
so throughout most of my life my go-to
strategy when i had a lot to do was to
roll up my sleeves hunker down and work
until the job was over
and this is certainly a useful strategy
to cultivate in one's life some people
need to learn how to do this and it's
appropriate under certain situations
however there came a point in my life i
was in grad school at the time
when the inflow of new work surpassed my
ability to discharge it
so when i rolled up my sleeves and
hunkered down
i
worked and i worked
and i worked so i rolled my sleeves even
higher up and i hunkered down even lower
and i worked and i worked and i worked
and the end was still nowhere in sight i
had never seen this before

[01:01]
had never seen this before
and i burned myself out in a really
serious way
the problem was that i was using the
wrong tool for the job rolling up your
sleeves and hunkering down works when
you have a finite amount of work to do
however if you're at all successful in
life you will reach a point where the
influx of new tasks completely overtakes
your ability to discharge those
responsibilities
it's just how it is
people respond to that point in
different ways some will get help and
delegate others will restrict the
pipeline and distance themselves from
the responsibility
my attitude is somewhat different
i've just sort of adopted the attitude
that the work never ends
so my job
is not to finish the work
my job is to work for the time that i've
assigned to working
and to stop working when that time is
finished
i stop when i'm done not when the work
is done
because the work is

[02:01]
because the work is
never done
my mental image of work is carrying a
bucket of water at the start of my my
day i pick that bucket up
i carry it for a time and at the end of
my day i put that bucket down
and tomorrow i'll pick up that bucket
and carry it a little further down the
road
the day will not arrive when i get to
pour out the water
so i'm not laboring under the illusion
that one day the water will be delivered
in fact that bucket will likely need to
be carried long after i'm gone
when i can't pick up the bucket anymore
someone else will pick it up and carry
it a bit further down the road and when
he can't pick up the bucket someone else
will take up the load and so on
i'm a therapist
it might be strange to hear
but i'm not working for the day when all
people are healed and all neuroses are
banished and all trauma is reconciled
and everyone is content with their lives
and satisfied with their relationships
that will

[03:01]
that will
never
happen
these problems are made new each day and
with each passing generation
the work
never ends
so my job is not to arrive at the end of
the work that attitude just leads to
burnout because it is practically
impossible
my work is to work for a time
helping the people that i can
until i put the bucket down
