in my episode how to improve your luck
australian girl comments it feels so
strange to dress up and put on a show to
attract the opposite sex i've always
felt like it's the opposite of
authenticity
i can understand how you feel that way i
think this is something that all people
more or less have to come to terms with
the way that i would ask you to consider
to think about going out on a first date
is similar to how you go about preparing
for a first job interview
i assume that you put on a
a good business outfit and that you've
looked over your resume and that
potentially you've practiced responses
to certain questions and
it's not so much that you are
lying about who you are
though i guess some people do in order
to get um jobs
it's about presenting yourself in the
most desirable and attractive light in
order to get what you want
and um that's not necessarily
inauthentic hopefully that makes sense
