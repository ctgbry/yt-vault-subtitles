if we're being really honest about what
the mind can do it's a really powerful
organic computer that is calculating all
of these billions and billions of
valuations on a number of different
levels beneath the threshold of
awareness and what it can basically do
is we're going to put this information
in to this model with these sort of
assumptions and it will spit out the
likelihood of predicted success
associated with various scenarios so
what happens generally is that the brain
calculates all of those odds ratios
beneath the threshold of awareness and
that like probability kind of gets
transmuted into an emotion in normal
people so a normal person doesn't spend
hours in the serial aisle they walk down
till they see Lucky Charms and they just
throw it in their cart because they're
like oh Lucky Charms I like this one
that liking is the transmuted result of
all of these billions and billions of
unconscious calculations that are going
on under the surface but if you take
away the emotion you just have the
billions and billions of calculations
and information overload which leads to
analysis paralysis
