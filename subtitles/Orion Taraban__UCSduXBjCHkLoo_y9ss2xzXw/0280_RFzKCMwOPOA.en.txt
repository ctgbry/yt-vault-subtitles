in it's good to add to your profile that
you're looking for a long-term
relationship Australian girl commented
that basically men are sex-starved on
dating apps and unfortunately I would
have to agree
um the vast majority of men are sex
starved the vast majority of men are not
having sex the vast majority of men do
not know how to get sex and they have
very poor optionality which is again why
they're moving on to the online dating
platform and this thirst is real and so
you're going to experience a lot of guys
who are horny and desperate for sex on
the online dating platforms on the other
hand if you meet a guy on these
platforms that doesn't seem to be
thirsty it's not because he's
transcended his sexual impulse why would
you even want to be in a relationship
with a man who has done that it's it's
because he's getting sex from somebody
else so that's another problem that
women tend to complain about but you
have to understand that that if men
aren't
thirsty they're getting satisfied
elsewhere
