Guys, if your girl bulks at a thrift
store ring, it should, for once and for

have that marriage is really about love,

concordance with the actual product as
like an ad for a herpes medication where
everyone is just like frolicking about
and playing beach volleyball. It

thinking about her future, her salary,
her perks, and the lifestyle her
compensation package would allow her to
enjoy. And once a man sees this clearly,

cold-hearted, rational decisions. There
are two main questions to ask here. Can
