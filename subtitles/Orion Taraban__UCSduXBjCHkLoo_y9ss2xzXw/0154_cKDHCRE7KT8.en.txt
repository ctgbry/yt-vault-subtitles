i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
conquering the fear
of being judged by others
this is a problem that i encounter
routinely in my clinical practice and i
have some measure of success in helping
people overcome it
the key to doing so requires us to
understand a psychological concept
called theory of mind
it's a little clunky
but theory of mind basically means that
we tend to believe that other people
think the same way that we do
in order to make interpersonal
communication efficient let alone
possible
we project our consciousness onto others
and interact with them through that
projection this process is unconscious
and functionally inescapable
theory of mind is a kind of necessary
evil because it's just not possible to
directly experience the consciousness of
others and it's generally safer to
assume that for all our differences we

[01:02]
assume that for all our differences we
have more in common than we don't
like for example we assume a common
preference to avoid pain and disrespect
on the grounds that we ourselves would
prefer to avoid those things and this
projected assumption keeps society more
or less civil
so you can see how theory of mind can
facilitate pro-social affiliation
theory of mind can also be an effective
means by which to change our actual
experience of reality let's get a bit
more concrete as i mentioned before i
often talk with folks who are afraid of
being judged by others
they generally don't have any concrete
proof of these negative judgments
however they believe that these
judgments are a kind of social
inevitability
they believe that other people secretly
think that they are annoying or stupid
or unattractive etc
then i talk to these people a bit more
and i generally come to learn that these
very same people who believe that other

[02:00]
very same people who believe that other
people are judging them negatively
are almost constantly in the process of
judging other people
negatively these folks are often very
very judgmental of other people
and by virtue of theory of mind they
assume that other folks are behaving in
the privacy of their own consciousness
the way that they themselves
are behaving in the privacy of their own
consciousness
and they are unconsciously projecting
this tendency onto other people
basically if i'm negatively judging
other people on a consistent basis then
i'm going to assume that other people
are doing the same thing as a matter of
course
so
what does this have to do with changing
our experience of reality well according
to theory of mind we can change our
experience of reality by altering the
content of our own consciousness
for instance i typically ask those with
a fear of being judged to become
increasingly mindful of their own
negative judgments of others and to

[03:01]
negative judgments of others and to
address these with the block and replace
technique
and when the frequency and intensity of
their negative judgments of others
begins to decline
lo and behold all of a sudden
the world doesn't seem to be as
judgmental as it used to be
it's fascinating
and this i think is how we can
potentially understand
the buddhist admonition to change the
world by changing yourself it's through
theory of mind
if we change the content and structure
of our own consciousness then by virtue
of this unconscious projection we come
to live in a world that's increasingly
aligned with these changes inevitably
and by default on some level it can't
not occur
so that's what i'd like you to consider
to what extent can you intentionally
change your beliefs about reality to
create an experience of reality that's
more aligned with your own

[04:00]
more aligned with your own
self-interests
