What's the distinction then between um
pathological or a negative manipulation
and the and the manipulation that people
want?
&gt;&gt; Sure. I was a teacher for 20 years and
that's a form of manipulation as well is
that these students were paying me money
and consenting to an experience where I
was going to reach into their minds with
my words and alter the way that they
think. That's manipulative. But they
were doing it willingly and we were all
kind of on the same page about everybody
wanted this to happen and this was the
desired outcome. So that's we could say
a a positive form of manipulation. Like
I don't think anybody would have a
problem with that, but it is technically
manipulation. I think that the danger
becomes when I use hypothetically I use
my skills or my knowledge to to change
you on the inside, your mind or your
emotions in a way that only serves me
and or is at your detriment. I think we
can all agree that that's where it kind
of crosses over into the the darker
aspects of manipulation. And people do
that especially when they feel like they
don't have a chance of getting what they

don't have a chance of getting what they
need or want in more constructive,
positive, explicit ways. People aren't
going to give up on what they need and
want, especially what they need. If I
can't earn it, if I can't take it by
force, if I can't beat you in
competition, if I can't um get you
become friends and get you to agree to
give it to me willingly, if I despair of
all of these potential solutions with
respect to getting what I want from you,
a lot of people will eventually resort
to more of these underhanded negative
manipulation techniques.
