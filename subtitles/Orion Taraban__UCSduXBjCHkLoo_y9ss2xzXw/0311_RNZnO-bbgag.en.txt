I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
Peak sexual Marketplace value so in this
episode I'm going to be talking about
another one of my favorite articles on
dating entitled aspirational pursuit of
mates and online dating markets for
those of you who want to look it up it
appeared in the American Association for
the advancement of Sciences
peer-reviewed journals science advances
in 2018 volume 4 issue 8 and there's a
link to the article in the description
now this article is a little dense
because it was actually written by
non-psychologists it was written by two
University of Michigan professors one of
whom belongs to the Department of
sociology and the other of whom belongs
to the Department of physics and the
study of complex systems which I love
because there are a few things in life
more complex than dating now before I
unpack the results of this study please
please remember to like this video And

so what was the study about basically
what these two guys did was they brought
some really sophisticated statistical
models to bear on millions of data
points collected in four major markets
over a one month period on a popular
dating app
they don't mention what the app is but
based on some of the other features
mentioned in the article I'm led to
believe that it's probably Tinder
they also strangely didn't include a
sample size however they do note that
the most popular person in that one
month period received a total of 1 504
messages during that time and that's
just one person in all of New York
Boston Chicago and Seattle so very
likely we're talking about millions of
data points which would make the
conclusions extremely robust now what

[02:02]
conclusions extremely robust now what
the researchers tried to do was to
quantify desirability which it turns out
is actually pretty hard to do for a
number of reasons one is that men
apparently initiate contact over 80
percent of the time so you can't simply
use who is being contacted as a metric
of who is attractive as more desirable
men received more responses from women
than less desirable men so what they did
is they constructed this really
complicated Vector analysis that
included data on the number and
direction of contacts and responses and
basically ranked everybody who used the
app during that one month period in a
given Market from least to most
attractive
everybody had a rank this also allowed
them to calculate the desirability gap
between contact doors and contactees
which in turn was factored into the
analysis this means that people were

[03:01]
analysis this means that people were
ranked as more desirable not simply due
to the fact that they got more messages
or responses but if they got more
messages or responses from more
desirable potential partners
it's actually a pretty nuanced and
sophisticated algorithm these guys are
clearly Big Data dorks and they were
bringing their knowledge and expertise
to bear on this really interesting
problem
here's one of the things that they
discovered to make sure I get it right
I'm just going to quote it directly from
the paper here we go
once we have our desirability scores we
can use them to identify characteristics
of desirable users by comparing scores
across various user attributes as shown
in figure 2 for instance average
desirability varies with age for both
men and women
although it varies more strongly for
women and the effects run in opposite
directions
older women are less desirable while
older men are more so for women this

[04:02]
older men are more so for women this
pattern holds over the full range of
Ages on the site the average woman's
desirability drops from the time she is
18 until she is 60.
for men desirability Peaks around 50 and
then declines
end quote so what's the upshot here one
way we can think about these results are
as Peak normalized sexual Marketplace
values apparently according to men a
woman is at her Peak sexual Marketplace
value when she is 18 years old
as determined not only by the amount of
male attention but by the quality of
male attention that she receives
on the other hand according to women a
man is at his Peak sexual Marketplace
value when he is 50 years old
as determined not only by the amount of
female attraction but by the quality of
female attraction that he receives

[05:01]
female attraction that he receives
pretty incredible huh
this is not an individual preference
this is data collected from hundreds of
thousands of people of all ages and
ethnicities across millions of data
points data that were remarkably stable
across four different and independent
locations that makes the research
extremely powerful
I also really like this study because as
a psychologist I understand that there
is a big difference between what people
say publicly and what people do
privately
and this article is examining behavior
that is anonymous and private it shows
us how men and women Express desire when
they think that no one else is looking
so on some level results like this are a
lot more trustworthy than the kind of
responses you tend to get when you ask
people directly what they're attracted
to
in the first place people don't always

[06:00]
in the first place people don't always
know what they're attracted to and in
the second place they're public
conscious reports are almost always
distorted by social desirability biases
you can listen to what people say but
you need to look for Behavioral
confirmation subsequent to that
disclosure so again according to this
study two men women are most attractive
at 18 and to women men are most
attractive at 50. also while female
perceived attractiveness Falls
precipitously over the lifespan male
perceived attractiveness is fairly
stable for about
20 years from 40 to 60.
I'm including an episode on this study
to back up some of the responses I made
to comments on my episode why men like
younger women
here's the data I was talking about it's
not just my personal opinion and my next
episode will take these results one step
further to some fairly interesting
conclusions so stay tuned what do you

[07:02]
conclusions so stay tuned what do you
think
