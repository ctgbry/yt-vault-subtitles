i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
too short to suck
so
this was a rule of thumb back when i was
a member of a dance theater company in
new york city it basically meant that
any show that we created needed to be
too short to suck if people liked the
show great
it would leave them wanting more and
they would keep coming back
and if people didn't like it well
at least it was too short to suck so
they wouldn't feel as though we had
particularly wasted their time this is a
great principle to follow whenever you
have to give a speech make a
presentation or undertake some creative
endeavor and that's because it's no fail
either leave them wanting more or
feeling grateful it wasn't longer
