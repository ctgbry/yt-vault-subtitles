in the truth about commitment ashy kitty
leaves a very interesting comment
attempting to renovate modern marriage
by proposing marriage by renewable
contract
basically people get married for a
limited time five to ten years they
spell out their explicit expectations
one for the other with the understanding
that they will examine those
expectations at a future date to renew
the contract or not it's really
interesting idea in theory i respect it
but i think would be very hard to
implement in practice because in
practice marriage is this conflation of
two really powerful ideas it's the
conflation of friendship and emotion
and
business and legality if a friend were
to come to you and say look ashley i
really like you um but here are my
expectations for being your friend over
the next five years please sign this
contract and if you bulk on any of these
i'm going to take you to friend court
and will not renew our friendship at
that time
you would probably be off put by that
idea and yet
here we are with marriage
