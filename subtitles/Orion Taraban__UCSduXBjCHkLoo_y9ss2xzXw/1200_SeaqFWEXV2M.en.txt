How do strategies for short-term
relationships differ from long-term
relationships? You wrote, "Air on the
side of being more boring when you're
looking for a long-term relationship.
Air on the side of being too bold when
looking for something shortterm."
Explain that to me.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are some of the major
differences. Look, people, men and
women, they want different things from
different people. This is also something
that's really important for mostly men
to understand. Women already get this.
When I was younger, I just thought that
all women wanted relationships. And so
that's what I tried to give them because
I in my masculine mindset, I will give a
woman what she wants and therefore she
will give me what I want and that's the
basis of a reciprocal relationship. And
I just thought that women wanted
commitment and love and the labels and
all of that stuff. And a lot of women do
want those things from the men they want
them from, but they don't want them from
all men indiscriminately. There are
certainly men that they just want to
have a fun evening with. That's kind of

have a fun evening with. That's kind of
how players can play. Like they have to
have someone to play with.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; So, and and these aren't all bad,
promiscuous women. Sometimes these are
women who do have low body counts and
they just get swept up in the moment
because the man is masterful at creating
an emotional experience and conducting
them in the direction of a sexual
relationship. It doesn't mean that he
lied or deceived her. Obviously, that
can happen in pickup. But in the vast
majority of cases, she isn't a willing
and enthusiastic participant in the
interaction.
