i'm dr orion taraban and this is cycax
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is find your
dark horse so
this one is for the ladies today i'm
going to be talking about an effective
mate selection strategy for straight
women so what do women generally find
attractive in men
success
status resources competence confidence
these traits signal the ability to
provide and protect and also offer a
place in society
sounds good right
the issue is that under most
circumstances it takes a very
very long time
for most men to achieve these things if
they ever do
we can kind of call the men who do the
winners in the race of life they've
crossed the finish line and they're kind
of in the winner's circle
now according to tinder which actually
does a lot of interesting research with
its data
the top 78 percent of women the vast

[01:02]
the top 78 percent of women the vast
majority of women
are competing for the top 20
of men
that's a 4 to 1 ratio and the ratio only
gets more ludicrously lopsided the
further up the male hierarchy you go
this means that to continue my metaphor
most of you women are more or less
hanging out at the winner's circle
trying to attract the attention of the
men who make it that far
and you know this makes a certain sense
because if he's gotten that far he
probably has many of the attributes that
you might be looking for
but it's also easy to see the liability
in this approach
how many
other women are hanging out at the
winner's circle
now the question becomes
why would the man want to pick you
over the other four ten hundred because

[02:00]
over the other four ten hundred because
a guy who crosses the finish line
kind of gets his choice of the women who
are waiting for him there
so this is a good strategy in theory but
it only works if you can be fairly
confident that you can out compete the
other women who might be doing the same
thing and the better the man the worse
your odds will be
in my opinion women a better strategy is
for you to find your dark horse a dark
horse is a racing term for an underdog
performer who ends up winning the race
to do this you have to become a bit of a
sleuth and you have to learn about men
what do bookies do before a race they do
research they look at past performance
they check the pedigree they examine the
forelocks they consider the stride they
check out the teeth
you get the idea
you gotta do some investigation and i'm
gonna help you
one of the best things to check for
is whether he has a detailed and reality
based plan for the future

[03:01]
based plan for the future
this is a very good thing to see when
you're looking for a dark horse so learn
about men
do some due diligence and place your bet
before
the race is run now obviously this is a
bit of a gamble
but
so is hanging out in the winner's circle
if there are nine other women there you
have a 10 chance of bagging the dude
and if there's 99 other women there
forget about it
contrast that with the dark horse what
are his odds of going the distance they
might be better than one in ten almost
certainly better than one in a hundred
do you see what i'm getting at
this is a more reliable way of ending up
with a winner provided you know what
you're looking for
so ladies your best bet is to actually
find a guy who hasn't won yet
but who has the attributes of a future
winner
then you get all the good stuff all to
yourself
