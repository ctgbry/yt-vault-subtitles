This is important to understand because
in my opinion, body count is too often
used as an easy proxy for, let's say,
purity and inexperience, two things that
men value highly in long-term partners.
But body count and purity are not the
same thing, especially when considered
in light of women's accounting. For
example, I've done a number of
consultations with guys who live in the
Republic of Georgia. Georgia is a very
Christian country and apparently it's a
culture in which a woman's virginity is
still highly praised. Like it's
difficult for a woman to get married if
she's not a virgin in the sense of
having her highman intact. However, an
intact himman doesn't necessarily mean
that she hasn't blown 50 guys and taken
it up the which has long been a favorite
loophole among god-fearing folk. In any
case, yes, yes, she might still have her
high himman, but is such a woman really
pure and inexperienced. There are ways

pure and inexperienced. There are ways
around this. And I found this to be the
case with respect to many exceptionally
beautiful women like they can plausibly
say that they have low body counts with
respect to vaginal intercourse. But
that's only because they found other
ways to satisfy the resource for sexual
opportunity transaction that undergirds
their relationships. Whether you like it
or not, you can't go on body count
alone. And men who are too fixated on
this number generally are so to their
own detriment.
