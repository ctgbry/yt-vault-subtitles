i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
today i'd like you to consider that your
feelings
are not personal this is a
somewhat very strange to talk about
feelings in this way because
for a lot of us feelings are like the
most personal part of our experience
it's because of all of the chemicals
that create the somatic
experience inside of us the fact that i
can't feel your feelings
you can't feel my feelings uh people are
subject to identifying with their
emotions as a result
um but i'm under the opinion that our
feelings aren't really
personal rather they're the consequence
of our thinking behind every feeling
is a thought and thoughts are
are fairly impersonal i could write down
some of my thoughts on a piece of paper
hand it to you you could read
that piece of paper and suddenly my
thought is in your head
and if we both choose to believe the

[01:01]
and if we both choose to believe the
same thought we will likely
then experience very similar emotions as
a result
so for example if i were to think the
thought you know i'm a worthless
individual and nobody loves me
and i really were to believe that to be
true
it would be very difficult for me not to
feel somewhat dejected
and depressed and if you also were to
think that thought that that i am a
worthless individual nobody loves me and
you really believe that it's true
you likely will also feel dejected
and um somewhat depressed it would be
very difficult to think
that thought believe it to be true and
feel let's say content
and confident so
our feelings have more to do with what
we
choose to believe to be true than who we
are as a person
and on some level the same feeling or a
very similar feeling
can be cultivated in other people simply

[02:00]
can be cultivated in other people simply
as a consequence of sharing similar
ideas or beliefs
so what does this mean this means that
if we want to
cultivate different emotional states we
have to be
very intentional about the thoughts that
we
choose to validate the thoughts that we
choose to believe to be true
it's not possible to believe certain
things are true
and feel however we want this is
something i often say to my clients
is that you're free to think however you
want
however you're not free to feel however
you wish
as a consequence of what you choose to
think so for example if a person chooses
to think those thoughts
like for example i'm a worthless
individual and nobody really cares about
me
that person really on some level isn't
free
to feel contented and confident
as a consequence of thinking those
thoughts
now it's not an easy thing to simply

[03:02]
now it's not an easy thing to simply
change the way that
somebody thinks but it is possible and
it's the best
one of the best routes towards creating
sustainable
emotional change in an individual we'll
talk more about how to do that in future
