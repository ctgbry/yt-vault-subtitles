I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is love has
nothing to do with relationships
so I've made a number of episodes on
both of these topics however I typically
speak on each one individually since to
me their Mutual Independence is an
obvious fact of reality but it turns out
that what might be obvious to me might
not be obvious to others
and when I speak about relationships as
the medium in which value is transacted
I get a lot of pushback from folks in
the comments and the most typical type
of pushback I receive is something like
well what about love Orion does love
have no place in a relationship how
mercenary I guess we've come to the
point that relationships are simply
transactional these days and that's why
modern relationships are doomed etc
etc well I'm going to respond to this
critique in today's episode by arguing

[01:01]
critique in today's episode by arguing
as the title indicates that love has
nothing to do with relationships
absolutely nothing
let me explain why this is the case
again a relationship is the medium in
which value is transacted since this is
the case relationships have rules what
is allowed and what is not allowed
relationships have definitions this is
what it is and this is what it is not
and relationships have compromises this
is what I will get for what I will give
up
and this is because we need rules and
definitions and compromises to in effect
do business with each other
which is what we do when we transact
value
however love has absolutely nothing to
do with any of these things
love does not love where it is allowed
that's absurd it has an imminent
contempt for rules love does not

[02:03]
contempt for rules love does not
restrict itself to a certain
relationship format it ignores every
label and definition that attempts to
constrain it and love does not expect
anything in return
so there is absolutely nothing to
compromise
expecting love to abide within rules and
definitions and compromises is not only
absurd it cheapens love
it's the emotional equivalent of taking
an animal out of its natural habitat and
shutting it up in a zoo
and then we wonder why the animal seems
so spiritless and depressed for all the
benefits of its new arrangement
the other day I re-watched angley's
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon it is a
fantastic film and for all of its
action-packed martial arts sequences it
actually contains a really profound
psychological message so maybe I'll do
an analysis of the film in a future
episode but with respect to our message
today
the main narrative presents two parallel

[03:02]
the main narrative presents two parallel
love stories one of which is between
Julianne played by Michelle yo and
limubai played by Chao young fat
these two characters did not get married
they did not cohabitate they did not
have children they did not have sex they
did not buy each other flowers or cook
each other dinner or go on vacation
together
they did not talk about their feelings
or Define what they were or wonder where
things were going
in fact it would be very difficult to
argue that they were in a relationship
at all because what did they actually do
with each other
but these two characters loved each
other so much
that they were inextricably bound at the
spiritual level
no ceremony required
late in the movie limubai is poisoned
and he tells shulian that he has only
one breath left
in modesty she averts her eyes and asks
that he not wastes his breath on her and
instead use it to enter the Heavenly
realm as he had been trained that's love

[04:02]
realm as he had been trained that's love
love is wanting the good for the loved
one without any regard for the self
because the more you love the less self
there is
love wants what is best for the loved
one even to the point of sacrificing the
self
and Lee mubai replies that he would
rather walk the earth as a ghost by
shulian's side then enter Heaven without
her
that's love
love wants nothing but in humility if
possible
to remain in the presence of a loved one
everything else that you can get
from someone else is worthless junk by
comparison
love wants only to remain in the
presence of the loved one
but is willing to sacrifice even that
for the good of the loved one
now before I go any further if you're
liking what I'm hearing please
share this video to someone who might
benefit from its message it's Word of
Mouth referrals like this that really

[05:00]
Mouth referrals like this that really
help to make the channel grow you can
also hit the super thanks button which
is in those three little dots in the
lower right hand corner beneath the
video and tip me in proportion to the
value you feel you derived from this
episode I really appreciate your support
so this is why love has nothing to do
with relationships all the things that
people want in relationships children
commitment respect sex lifestyle
excitement security love doesn't give a
about any of them
love doesn't care
whether it gives everything and receives
nothing in return precisely because it
is not transactional
but we would call such a relationship
where one person gives everything and
receives nothing in return and abusive
or exploitative relationship
love is given spontaneously as a gift at
the pleasure of the lover
expecting acknowledgment let alone
reciprocity is just transaction

[06:00]
reciprocity is just transaction
disguised as love
and this is because love is actually a
form of defeat
listen up love is exaltation by virtue
of the humiliated self
and that is why it is so very rare to
see in the world today
and not even today at any time in human
history and why the people who are out
there looking for love don't really
understand what they're signing up for
love is the humiliated self-exalted
in Casino Royale when Vesper asks Bond
about his armor he replies I have no
armor left you've stripped it from me
whatever is left of me whatever I am is
yours
bond is naked and vulnerable and
pathetic
he's humiliated himself
that's love
and that's also why when he learns a
vesper's betrayal he puts the armor back
on more securely than ever and

[07:01]
on more securely than ever and
functionally says never again
why because to quote Leonard Cohen I've
seen your flag on the Marble Arch and
love is not a victory march it's a coal
and it's a Broken Hallelujah
that's right that's right love is defeat
and that's why it's strange for me to
hear people saying they are looking for
love and expecting to find it in a
relationship
this is some high level personal Alchemy
I've got for you
love is the passage into a higher form
of life through the Gateway of the
humiliated self
if you've never experienced love before
you're going to think that this is
but this is the true fact
and it's also true that this has nothing
to do with relationships
we need to be real with ourselves if we
want things from others if we need
things from others
then we don't want love we want a

[08:01]
then we don't want love we want a
relationship we want to do business
and I see nothing wrong with that except
the rampant hypocrisy
that wants to pretend that that is not
what it's doing
and that is because wanting a
relationship is the right thing to want
if you want things from other people and
that is because a relationship is the
medium through which value is transacted
so if you want to do business get
yourself down to the marketplace and
prepare to barter with what you have to
offer and if you want a lot be prepared
to bring a lot to the bargaining table
and we can do this because let's be
honest everything that you can get from
another person in a relationship has a
transacted value and can be bought
that doesn't necessarily mean bought
with money but it can mean that you can
buy sex
you can buy companionship
you can buy emotional support and child
care and home-cooked meals you can even

[09:02]
care and home-cooked meals you can even
buy children through adoption or
surrogacy
you can buy everything that can be
transacted in a human relationship
however you can't buy love
and that is because paradoxically Love
is valueless valueless in the sense that
it is free
and valueless in the sense that it
cannot be bought at any price
on the other hand if you want love
you don't need a relationship why
listen carefully
if love is wanting the best for the
loved one
you can only reasonably want a
relationship with the loved one if a
relationship with you is literally the
best possible thing for the loved one
and let's be real it probably isn't
it probably isn't
wanting the best for the loved one

[10:01]
wanting the best for the loved one
therefore generally means sacrificing
both the self and the possibility of a
relationship
that's why Rick Blaine in Casablanca is
the Romantic hero par excellence
he puts the woman he loves on a plane
with another man because he realizes
it's better for her that way
remember love is not a victory march at
least not in any way we're used to
speaking about victory
but in so doing Rick finally succeeds in
humiliating the self which had been
mired for years in cynicism and despair
and presumably attaining to something
higher at the very least we suspect a
new beginning is in store the beginning
as Louis says of a beautiful friendship
I appreciate that this can be hard to
understand so feel free to listen to
this a few times if you need to but the
fact of the matter is is that love has

[11:00]
fact of the matter is is that love has
nothing to do with relationships because
on the one hand love is valueless and
therefore cannot be transacted and on
the other love must in any case
sacrifice the possibility of a
relationship with a loved one since the
arrogance of assuming that a
relationship with the lover would be the
best possible thing for the loved one is
antithetical to love as the humiliated
self
