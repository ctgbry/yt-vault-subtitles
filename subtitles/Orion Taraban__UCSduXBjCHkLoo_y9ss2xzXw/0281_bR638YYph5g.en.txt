I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is women
treat men the way men treat jobs
this is the single most powerful
realization I've ever had about women in
dating once I came to appreciate its
truth so many otherwise painful and
incomprehensible things became clear to
me and I began to have significantly
more successful relationships but to
approach this idea you've got to keep an
open mind okay
now before I unpack this realization
please remember to like this video And
subscribe to the channel it takes less
than a second cost you nothing and it's
how you can support me and my mission to
deliver free high quality content to the
world so thanks for your help
now women treat men the way men treat
jobs what does this mean
women see men as a means to an end
to women men are opportunities to

[01:03]
to women men are opportunities to
further their goals
similarly men see jobs as a means to an
end to men jobs are an opportunity to
further their goals men will choose the
job that all things being equal they
believe will do the most to further
their goals it's not personal it's
simply a rational self-interested choice
and women will choose the man that all
things being equal they believe will do
the most to further their goals it's not
personal it's a rational self-interested
Choice the more you appreciate this
reality that it isn't personal the more
successful you'll be in the dating
Market
the women listening already understand
this so I'm going to be helping the men
out there men let's say you're working a
job
it's not a bad job you enjoy it you're
paid decent you like your co-workers
there aren't any real problems but one

[02:00]
there aren't any real problems but one
day you get a call from a recruiter and
the recruiter says we want to offer you
offer you a position at a competing firm
we'll give you a promotion we'll double
your compensation we'll give you
unlimited PTO and we'll give you full
benefits for life
what are you gonna do
every man is going to at least entertain
the opportunity and frankly provided
there isn't something otherwise terrible
about this new position they're probably
going to end up putting in their two
weeks notice
they'll go to their bosses and they'll
say look it's been great working here
I've learned a lot I've really enjoyed
my time I just feel like I have to do
this for my career it's not personal
it's just the right move for me right
now so thank you so much for the
opportunity and I wish you all the best
and they'll legitimately mean that this
guy isn't going to have any hard
feelings though he might feel a little
guilty about leaving his team in the

[03:02]
guilty about leaving his team in the
middle of a project or something he's
not going to feel guilty enough not to
leave
of course the more he dissatisfied a guy
is with his job the less more attractive
another offer would have to be to be
enticing
however people don't only leave their
jobs when they hate them is my point
they leave because there's a better
option out there for them with respect
to their careers
so switch to relationships this holds
true because women have relationship
goals the way that men have career goals
most men don't have relationship goals
that's kind of a feminine idea women
want to progress the relationship the
way that men want to progress their
careers this means that at the very
least women are always willing to pick
up the phone when the recruiter calls
this means that they may not act on it
but they will at least entertain the

[04:02]
but they will at least entertain the
opportunity and if that opportunity
sounds significantly more likely to
further their goals whatever they may be
then they're going to put in their
notice it doesn't necessarily mean that
she hates the guy that she's currently
with or that she isn't attracted to him
anymore or that he wasn't a good guy
if she's low value she'll pick a fight
to instigate the end of the relationship
however if she's high value she'll sit
him down and say you've been a great guy
thank you for all the good times I just
feel like I have to do this for me you
know this is something that I need to do
for myself at this stage of my life it's
not you it's me it's not personal
do you see people's goals come before
their relationships
a man's goals come before his
relationship to his employer and a
woman's goals come before her
relationship to a man
when goals are aligned then people can

[05:01]
when goals are aligned then people can
do business when they aren't it's the
relationship that gets canceled
hopefully this doesn't just melt
people's brains the upshot is that the
more you can appreciate this truth the
more you can shift your attention to
being another person's best option
because this and this alone is what
attracts and maintains relationships of
all kinds in the real world an employer
with a solid compensation package
doesn't need to worry about his
employees getting calls from recruiters
do you understand all those phone calls
do is make his offer look better
hopefully this makes sense it's a really
important topic so don't blow it off
casually what do you think please
