sale yes and no one really knows how
much something is worth until someone is
willing to put their money on the table
and say it's worth this much and if you
accept that money you agree that it's
worth that much if you accept L reforce
that value yeah reify the value you
bring it into existence it didn't exist
before you accepted that value if you
took less it would have been worth less
if you held out and eventually received
more it would be worth more but it's

gendered between men and women in the
sense that you have to measure a
person's point of sale against what is
more difficult for them to receive since
women are The Gatekeepers of sex it's
certainly no big thing for them to open
their gate at will it's much harder for
them to get the other side to open their
gate and so that's how we have to
measure let's say their success rate in
the marketplace and vice versa for men
