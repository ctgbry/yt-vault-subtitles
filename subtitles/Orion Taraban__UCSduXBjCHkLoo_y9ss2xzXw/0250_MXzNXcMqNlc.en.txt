i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
if you punish the truth
you're asking to be lied to
the title of the episode says it all we
all exist in relationships we're in
intimate relationships we're in
relationships with our neighbors we're
in relationships with our governments
you can expand and generalize this
lesson to any level of human interaction
you prefer
now the thing about people is that
people are different
they have different values they want
different things and this is subject to
creating conflict in the course of a
relationship
no one really likes conflict and we all
have strategies for avoiding it or at
least mitigating its effect
however if you are in a relationship
with someone
and you ask them a direct question
and you are respected enough to be told
the truth by the other person
even if that response is something you
would prefer not to hear

[01:01]
would prefer not to hear
even if it's difficult for you to accept
even if it's contrary to your own
self-interest
it's very important
not to punish this other person for
their honesty
we don't necessarily have to agree with
let alone support this divergent
perspective however there's a way to
tolerantly and respectfully disagree
with another person that is unlikely to
be perceived as punitive
if we respond with yelling and screaming
withdrawing affection and intimacy
with ostracizing them from the community
at large
the fact of the matter is that person
will never make that mistake again
you will probably never hear the
unvarnished truth from that person ever
again as long as you live
and that's because expecting other
people to be honest irrespective
of the social financial or relational
costs associated with honesty

[02:01]
costs associated with honesty
is asking too much of people
people are not saints
so they're not entirely good and
virtuous and most people do not have a
comprehensively extrapolated personal
ethic
so they're not necessarily consistently
moral
it's very easy to say how other people
should behave but that's just not how
people are
if you punish them for telling you the
truth
the vast majority of people will never
make that mistake again
a minority of folks will choose honesty
despite the consequences and we can
appropriately admire these individuals
but the majority will not
and shaming or blaming this majority
will do nothing to change this behavior
so what's this got to do with us
well
if we punish a truth that we don't want
to hear
then we won't ever be able to fully
trust the other person from that moment
forward
any given question will potentially put

[03:00]
any given question will potentially put
them in a position
where they will feel forced to choose
between their integrity and their
relationship
or their integrity and their livelihood
and that's a liability for us
because it creates the possibility of
building upon a fabricated or illusory
foundation with that person
a good rule of thumb is if you can't or
won't tolerate the answer
don't ask the question
what do you think
