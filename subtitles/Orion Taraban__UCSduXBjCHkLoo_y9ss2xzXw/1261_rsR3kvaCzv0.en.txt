And the topic of today's short talk is
women are dirty. Now, I don't mean that
they're physically dirty. I mean that
women's minds are full of dirty, dark,
and twisted desires. To be fair, men's
minds are the same way. But men already
have a reputation for this. Girls, on
the other hand, are presumed to be made
of sugar and spice and everything nice.
And I'm here to tell you that is far
from the truth. Every woman is two
women. Every woman carries at least two
personalities inside of her. One is the
public-f facing persona that she uses
when she goes to work and rides the bus
and engages with her friends and family.
And the other is the bedroom persona
that comes to life behind closed doors.
And it's very difficult to make accurate
predictions about the bedroom persona
simply by viewing the public-f facing
persona. That said, we can make some

persona. That said, we can make some
reasonable generalizations
derived from psychological truths and
observed behavior at like the population
level. When we look at these sources, we
see that women's desires are much, much
more socially unacceptable than they are
typically considered to be. And that
these socially unacceptable desires tend
to cluster around fairly predictable
themes.
