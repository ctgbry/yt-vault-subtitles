One of the rules that I have for myself
is that I have to give myself enough
time to succeed. A lot of plans fail to
come to fruition due to impatience. We
don't give them enough time to succeed
and therefore we are complicit in their
failure. To give an example, I've shared
in interviews. When I started this
channel, I committed to publishing
regularly for 3 years. 3 years before I
would allow myself to evaluate whether
or not I would continue. Why? Because
according to my research, it could take
2 years of consistent production before
a YouTube channel sees any appreciable
uptake. And since, in my experience,
things often take longer than I expect
to succeed, my rule of thumb is to add
50% to any due diligence I conduct to
establish a realistic time frame. Since
my due diligence said 2 years, an
additional 50% would be another year.
So, I gave myself 3 years. That's enough
time to succeed. If I didn't succeed in
three years, I was doing something wrong
or it wasn't the right moment or it

or it wasn't the right moment or it
wasn't for me or I didn't have what it
takes. But it certainly wasn't because I
didn't give it enough time. Do you
understand?
