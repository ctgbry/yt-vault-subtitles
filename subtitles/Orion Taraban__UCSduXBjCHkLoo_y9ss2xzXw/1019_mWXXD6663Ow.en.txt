Partnerships are formed to mitigate
deficiencies in skill and ability in
order to accomplish a mutually defined
goal. This is why the successful ones
are always always always based on
complimentarity. I'm going to be the CEO
and you're going to be the CFO. We do
not need two CEOs. Two CEOs is just
asking for trouble. And the entire point
of putting up with the trouble of
relating to you is based on my
recognition that I need you or someone
with your skill set to reach my goal and
get what I want. And that's why the
fundamental rule of partnership is
everyone do your job. Like no one
is going to come up with cute little
songs about their CFO. They would
probably feel demeaning anyway. And in
any case, ain't nobody got time for
that. I've got my hands full and I
expect you to be carrying your weight as
well. And if I end up being more useful

well. And if I end up being more useful
and productive than you, then we're
going to have a problem. This is what
people really really don't understand
about partnerships. They think that just
because they're partners, that is
because they decided to structure the
relationship that way, that they are
equals. like they think they are equals
by virtue of the fact they are partners.
But when it comes to people, there are
vast differences when it comes to
competence and effort. And a partnership
can only be sustained between equals.
That means that it's actually the other
way around. They are partners by virtue
of the fact that they are equals. A
partnership formed between people of
unequal competence and effort cannot
succeed. I'll say that again. A
partnership formed between people of
unequal competence or effort cannot
succeed. It's impossible.
