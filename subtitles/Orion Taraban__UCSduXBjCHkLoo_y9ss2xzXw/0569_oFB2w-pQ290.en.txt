for me one of the issues when I was in
my 20s was trying to make relationships
the center of my life it sounds like
that's related to what you were
describing now I think a relationship is
it's very important but it's secondary
to let's say my personal mission what
I'm here to do in life you know it was
back in the old ad copy for krison
command I've since taken it out but it
was the fundamental line was you know
relationships are everything and I think
that was reflective of my own honest
perspective at the time but a
dysfunctional one and the lack of
independent
self-directedness and self- okayness and
self-love created this whole coping
mechanism which spawned a company which
spond to the whole lifestyle and all of
these other sorts of things from it but
I I very much agree that uh as I have
done more self-healing I see the the
pressure that I put on relationships the
need that I have for them dissipates
which actually creates space for what
we're talking about which seems like
genuine love space sunshin type energy
