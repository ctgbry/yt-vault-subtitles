i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
suffering is expensive
when i was in grad school
i read a research paper on an experiment
that surveyed tens of thousands of
psychotherapy patients in america on a
number of issues
and one of the survey items was the
amount of time
the psychotherapy patient spent
suffering from the problem for which he
or she sought therapy before
actually contacting the therapist
and apparently on average
an american experiences a problem for
10 years
before contacting a therapist 10 years
on average
now on some level this is understandable
therapy is expensive and we don't want
to incur unnecessary expenses
it's true that we can get stuck from
time to time in our lives but we often
find ways to get ourselves unstuck of

[01:00]
find ways to get ourselves unstuck of
our own accord
and it's generally a good idea to make
as much progress on our own regardless
of the endeavor before enlisting the
help of a professional
that said i was flabbergasted by this
statistic
10 years is a very long time it's a
decade of time
and we only have so many good decades in
our life what six as an adult seven if
we're lucky
ten years is a significant portion of
one's life
to suffer potentially unnecessarily
but with all this
sometimes people balk at the cost of
therapy
uh it's 200 bucks an hour it's
and is it even really going to help you
know that kind of stuff
now one way that i ask folks to consider
approaching this issue of cost is like
this
think about whatever problem you're
dealing with right now
if you could write a check for ten

[02:01]
if you could write a check for ten
thousand dollars
and this problem would just go away
would you do it
this is an interesting thought
experiment because if you're like um
no maybe not 10 000 bucks then on some
level you might be fortunate because
maybe you're not actually dealing with
that significant of an issue but if
you're like yes absolutely who do i make
the check out to then on some level
you're willing to spend at least that
much money on a solution
and ten thousand dollars is a year
of weekly therapy at 200 an hour
and that unlike the magic check in this
thought exercise
could actually help to solve your
problem
you're obviously willing to spend the
money and you could potentially save
yourself nine years of unnecessary
suffering i might i mean you might not
even need a year
if you think about this in this way it's
way
more expensive to suffer

[03:00]
more expensive to suffer
it's a useful thought exercise put a
price tag on the magical removal of your
problem that is actually your budget for
solving that problem
hope this helps if you'd like to suggest
