I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is making
men angry at women is a business and
it's a big business on social media
platforms like YouTube so this is
something that I think is really
important for folks to understand
especially for all the young men out
there who are the principal demographic
for many of these YouTube channels over
the past decade I've subscribed to many
of these channels and I think many of
them do many things well however almost
all of them to some degree or another
fall into the Trap of selectively
focusing on some of the most flagrant
examples of the nonsense of which women
are apparently capable much of their
content is cherry-picked to be
provocative and inflammatory because
extreme content is more likely to be
clicked viewed and shared very frankly
it drives growth this content can kind
of feel like anonymously rubber necking
a car crash from privacy of your own

[01:01]
a car crash from privacy of your own
home it satisfies darker impulses that
we all have which are not socially
acceptable to admit
so I'm here to caution guys who watch
these channels to take everything that
they hear with a grain of salt there
very well may be truth in what these
creators are saying how and extreme
examples have the didactic usefulness of
providing Stark exemplars of phenomenon
that may be difficult to observe in
other cases in which they assume less
intense forms and are confounded by
other variables however any truth that
you glean should ideally be tested out
in The Crucible of your own personal
experience and that includes the content
on this channel as well
think it out and see whether what I'm
saying may be true we have teeth in our
mouth and not in our stomach because we
need to chew on things for a while
before we swallow them whole
Society has become increasingly
polarized in recent years and relations
between men and women in particular

[02:00]
between men and women in particular
aren't mistrustful and strained
how did we end up here the answer is
somewhat complicated as it involves an
interdependent system with three main
components the content creators the
content consumers and the social media
algorithms no one factor is really to
blame so I'm not here to cast aspersions
I just want to help people understand
how the thing works
now the shift toward polarization is
accomplished in large part through
operant conditioning which is what we
call using punishments and rewards to
influence behavior the amazing thing
about operant conditioning is that it is
usually done unconsciously in many cases
neither party knows that he or she is
rewarding or punishing or being rewarded
or being punished and in most cases
contingency management is even more
effective when it occurs outside of
awareness
let's start with the content creators
the fact of the matter is that it is

[03:02]
the fact of the matter is that it is
very difficult for people not to act in
line with let alone against their
financial best interests as a
consequence it's fairly unreasonable to
expect that people will in fact do so
if more extreme content leads to more
clicks views and shares and if more
clicks views and shares lead to more
Revenue then creators are slowly being
trained to create more extreme content
whether they're aware of it or not take
this channel for instance I have a few
dozen playlists on a whole variety of
topics inspired by my clinical practice
I talk about spirituality and
Consciousness grief and loss success and
achievement emotional regulation and
Mastery among others and I can tell you
that if I just put the word woman in the
title of an episode
that episode will get at least five
times as many views as an episode that
does not this is a powerful incentive to

[04:01]
does not this is a powerful incentive to
create more and more videos about women
now I'm probably not going to make the
channel exclusively about women because
I would find that boring however many
creators end up in a situation where
their channels are simply the same one
video in hundreds of slightly different
permutations
that said I'm aware of this constant
pull to do just that that I have to
actively resist and it may be easier for
me to do so because I don't need the
revenue
this channel is something fun that I do
in the time when I'm not running my
other businesses generating some revenue
is nice it allows me to invest more in
the channel but it is nowhere close to
replacing the income generated by my
private practice
so I might be able to afford to be more
intellectually honest and autonomous
because I'm not dependent on the revenue
generated by the channel or affiliate
advertisements
and this isn't just because I'm fairly
small if certain other creators some of

[05:00]
small if certain other creators some of
whom may have gotten very very big have
given up their other revenue streams to
focus exclusively on their channels well
this puts them in a vulnerable position
vis-a-vis their livelihood and again I'm
not blaming these creators because it is
very hard for anyone to act against
their financial best interests and
everyone needs to make a living and if
that means making money on social media
all the power to them speaking of which
before I go any further if you're liking
what you're hearing please consider
sending this video to someone who might
benefit from its message it's Word of
Mouth referrals like this that really
help to make the channel grow you can
also hit the super thanks button and tip
me in proportion to the value that you
feel you have derived from this video I
really appreciate your support
all right next up is the algorithm right
out of the gate we have to appreciate
that algorithms are not neutral in the
first place they will exhibit biases
based on the data on which they have
been trained and in many cases these
biases can only be observed across

[06:00]
biases can only be observed across
millions or billions of data points so
they are functionally invisible to
humans until their operation produces
significant Downstream consequences
and in the second place they are
business tools that were ultimately
created to drive Revenue to their parent
companies for instance the primary goal
of YouTube is to keep people on YouTube
that's it the more people watch the more
opportunities to sell advertisements and
the more lucrative those ad spots become
this has to come before everything
because if the business isn't solvent
any other goals the company might have
can't be met
traditional media has understood this
for centuries the primary goal of
newspapers is not to tell the truth when
that happens it's a fortunate
afterthought it's to sell more
newspapers and Sensational headlines are
print media's equivalent of clickbaity
titles
turn on a news broadcast any of them
most of what you'll see is Sex and Death
and decontextualized sound bites on

[07:00]
and decontextualized sound bites on
controversial issues this material is
designed to stimulate an emotional
response so that bam they can hit you
with an advertising break every eight to
ten minutes
your emotions make you less rational and
therefore more likely to buy whatever it
is they're selling if you're interested
in learning more about this I would
highly encourage you to check out the
excellent film Network or read
gerrymander's four Arguments for the
elimination of television
in any case if people are more likely to
engage with Sensational provocative
content then the algorithm will promote
Sensational provocative content this
will encourage people to click watch and
share which engagement translates
eventually to money in the bank so
that's the algorithm
last but not least are the content
consumers
let's be real
creators wouldn't be swayed by the
operant contingencies and the algorithms
wouldn't not be promoting sensationalist
content
if you didn't click on it

[08:01]
if you didn't click on it
but just like the proverbial car crash
there seems to be something in human
psychology that makes it very difficult
not to look
social media has also not been around
for very long so we're all still kind of
learning how to navigate the technology
with discipline and moderation
but let me tell you if you ever complain
about the polarization of society
then do your part and don't click on
Extreme Sensational content don't watch
it and don't share it
consumers changing their consumption
will have significant Downstream
consequences for both the creators and
the algorithm
as I said previously creators consumers
and algorithms they're all kind of in it
together no one component is really
responsible for social polarization but
each contributes to it as a consequence
of the feedback loops that constitute
their interdependence
and with respect to a lot of red pilled
channels you need to appreciate that men
making men angry at women by means of
Sensational content is a business

[09:01]
Sensational content is a business
and if you buy it wholesale then you are
a customer
