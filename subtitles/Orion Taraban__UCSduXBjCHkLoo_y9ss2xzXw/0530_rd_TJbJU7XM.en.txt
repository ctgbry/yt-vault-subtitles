I need to be clear about something
emotional Detachment does not mean that
you have no emotions unfortunately many
men do succeed in functionally divorcing
themselves from their emotional
experience however I believe that such
men do so at Great cost to themselves
this is because it generally requires
some degree of self-violence in order to
amputate a component of your lived
experience of course most men cannot do
this completely so they arrive at a
place where the only emotion that they
can consistently recognize is anger long
periods of a kind of numb neutrality are
punctuated periodically with intense
episodes of anger and frustration and
that is no way to live life my friends
for me personally emotions make my life
richer more interesting more enjoyable
more complex I like having emotions but
I am also very emotionally detached
emotional Detachment does not mean that
you sort of dissociate from your
emotional experience or that you
alienate yourself from your feeling
sensitivity we do not want to become
unfeeling rocks this is an extreme
solution
