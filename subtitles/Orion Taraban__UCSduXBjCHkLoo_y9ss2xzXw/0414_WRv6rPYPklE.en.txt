I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is scicax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is I don't
want to waste my time
so this is something that men generally
hear from women often older women women
who have entered their 30s but not
always the idea here is that from her
perspective a relationship that doesn't
have a high likelihood of ending in
marriage and children is not worth
investing in since her biological clock
is ticking her time is an increasingly
precious resource and she can no longer
spend it with men who are not prepared
to give her what she wants such men are
time wasters
all right well I have a few
unconventional takes on this topic let's
get into it first I can begin with the
most obvious one namely it's not
actually possible for someone else to
waste your time
you can waste your own time but someone
else cannot waste your time without your

[01:02]
else cannot waste your time without your
permission take one of these episodes
for instance even if I were to set out
with the explicit intention to waste
your time by say rambling tangentially
or reading a string of random numbers or
talking total nonsense I couldn't
actually do it without your
participation like I couldn't force you
to sit there
and waste your time without your consent
and if I weren't providing value you
would probably think I was acting
ridiculous and move on to another
episode after a certain amount of time
externalizing responsibility for that
decision by arguing well I wasted your
time because of my content or my
intentions would be immature
as it would be an abnegation of personal
responsibility so no one can actually
waste your time even if that is their
explicit intention without your consent
now the pushback that I usually get from
this position is that some men actually
are time wasters Orion because they are

[02:01]
are time wasters Orion because they are
flat out deceitful
like this man lies right to your face
and says things like oh sweetie baby I
love you you're the only one for me I
want you forever and ever I want to
start a family with you but I'm just not
ready yet or whatever and to make this
the most egregious possible example
let's even assume malice like the guy
has no real intention of ever making
good on any of these promises
even in this case
even in the most extreme example of this
phenomenon the woman is still
responsible not entirely but mostly
responsible for wasting her time
unpopular belief but if you believe a
lie it is to some extent your fault for
believing the LIE
that is it's your responsibility for not
exercising appropriate discernment with
respect to what you choose to believe
now some Liars are very convincing and

[03:01]
now some Liars are very convincing and
some of us have to learn this lesson the
hard way but that's the way it is
think about it how could someone tell
you exactly what you wanted to hear
could it possibly be because you made it
very obvious what you wanted to hear or
could it be that you punished the truth
and therefore were asking to be lied to
or is it possible that your attraction
caused you to turn a blind eye to some
of the inconsistencies you noticed in
his behavior things to consider
now should the guy have lied well
it depends on what you mean by should
the town liar should lie that's what the
liar does
you should not expect a liar to tell the
truth expressing moral indignation is
wasted emotion and would be energy
better spent improving your discernment
believing that people shouldn't lie or
steal or cheat or betray is believing in
a world that doesn't exist rather than

[04:01]
a world that doesn't exist rather than
exhort reality to be other than it is
learn to navigate that reality more
successfully externalizing
responsibility for that obligation by
remaining in a victim role communicates
that you in effect still haven't learned
your lesson and this means that you will
likely re-experience that victimization
until you do so now before I go any
further if you're liking what you're
hearing please consider sending this
episode to someone who might benefit
from its message because it's Word of
Mouth referrals like this that really
help to make the channel grow and you
can also hit the super thanks button
it's the three little buttons in the
lower right hand corner of the video and
tip me in proportion to the value you
feel you've received from this episode
this helps to make this all happen and I
really appreciate your support
now another problem with the idea of
having your time wasted is that it
suggests on some level that if a
relationship isn't a Forever After

[05:02]
relationship isn't a Forever After
affair
if it doesn't end in marriage and a
lifelong partnership with the two of you
holding hands on your deathbed using
your last breaths to communicate your
undying love and commitment for each
other
then the relationship is a failure and a
waste of time
this is something that we really need to
examine carefully because the fact the
matter is that all relationships end
and the longevity of a relationship
cannot be the primary metric of success
I know many perfectly stable unhappy
marriages thank you very much
if a person is going to invalidate all
the good a relationship provided simply
as a consequence of the fact that it
ended or the fact of how it ended or the
fact that it didn't provide everything
we would have liked then that person is
very stupid
and that person is stupid because she
has robbed herself of a significant
portion months or even years of her own
life
it's immensely self-disrespectful to

[06:02]
it's immensely self-disrespectful to
judge one's own experiences and
decisions as valueless and wasted
because of whether or how a relationship
ended
this attitude is almost monstrous and
should be closely examined all right and
my final issue with this phrase I don't
want to waste my time is that it is a
tactic used by women to put pressure on
a man to if not make a commitment then
at least make a commitment to making a
commitment in the near future
I've spoken with many men who have made
significant commitments to women out of
guilt and pity for the woman's
circumstances namely that she is running
out of time with respect to her
reproductive window
listen to me men
you do not have to play Hot Potato
her failure to plan is not your
responsibility
if she's in her 30s her relationship
with you is not her first rodeo this
means that she has likely turned down

[07:00]
means that she has likely turned down
other relationships and in some cases
many other relationships before you even
entered the picture
her decisions have brought her to this
point in her life you do not need to
rescue her from the consequences of her
decisions because she potentially
overestimated how easy it would be to
get what she wanted when she finally
felt ready to want it
how did she spend her twenties
some of them were just having fun at the
club but the vast majority of women who
end up in this situation chose to
prioritize their career throughout this
decade of their lives and some of them
do this very successfully which gives
them what I would call a false sense of
confidence in their ability to get
married and have a family
and how can you blame them up to this
point they've gotten pretty much
everything that they've wanted a
master's degree a six-figure salary lots
of male attention and they were
encouraged to and celebrated when they
took this path
the issue is that the game changes

[08:01]
the issue is that the game changes
significantly in the 30s when men come
into their own and many of those men who
would have been thrilled to get her in
her 20s won't be as excited if she lets
him have her in his 30s
if they want it all women would be smart
to go after marriage first if they still
feel like they're missing out they can
always be employees in their 30s
