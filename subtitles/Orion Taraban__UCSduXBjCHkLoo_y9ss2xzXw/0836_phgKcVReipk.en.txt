what role does money play in dating as a
man oh man it's such a a double-edged
sword right it's very confusing right
now because women are doing just as well
in some cases better than men in the
money department they don't need a man
to buy them dinner or to pay their rent
you might if you're if you're only
making six figures a year you you might
need a double income in order to buy a
house in certain markets so it's still
useful in some contexts but it doesn't
seem like it's as necessary used to be
that said we know from the statistics
that when a woman earns as much or more
than the man there's very poor outcomes
associated with that relationship like I
think that man is three times more
likely to be on erectile dysfunction
medication they are I think full twice
as likely to get divorced their
professed marital satisfaction is
significantly lower it seems according
to the research that both men and women
are happier when the man earns
significantly more than the woman does
