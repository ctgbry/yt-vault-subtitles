I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
deal with
perfectionism so I consider myself to be
a perfectionist in recovery I definitely
succumb to the Trap of perfectionism
when I was younger and I am no longer a
perfectionist today so I'm going to talk
a little bit about some of the
realizations that I had in my own
personal life that helped me move from
point A to point B because this is
something that I see people with every
single week perfectionism is exhausting
debilitating and painful while we can't
dispense with it entirely as there are
some instances in which perfectionism is
called for computer programming brain
surgery it is generally not an
appropriate mode for Human Action rather
we kind of want to be satisficing the
vast majority of the time and optimizing
only when necessary actually one helpful
intervention is just to imagine that

[01:01]
intervention is just to imagine that
there is like a switch in your mind that
you can access in order to intentionally
toggle between these two states like you
can create that switch and that should
allow you to begin to have some measure
of control over the problem so let's
talk about my personal journey to
overcome perfectionism the first company
I founded was a private Tutoring company
it was really just me but I gave it a
name and I worked with many different
students on a variety of subjects across
New York City the motto of my company
was excellence in all things and it was
my personal goal to show my commitment
to Excellence in every little thing that
I did no matter how small or
insignificant in fact the smaller the
detail the greater the opportunity to
demonstrate my commitment now this is
going to sound very silly now but one
way that I thought to show my commitment
to Excellence at the time was through my
invoicing
every month I would go to the stationary

[02:02]
every month I would go to the stationary
store and buy this fancy parchment and I
would handwrite all of my invoices with
a pen and an ink well before I would
deliver them to my clients in order to
get
paid I thought that helped to impart the
upscale Boutique personal vibe that I
was going for now writing these invoices
was expensive and it was timec consuming
but at least to my mind it showed my
commitment to what I believed in
now I did that and many many other
things for a while before I started to
realize a few things about my
perfectionism in the first place I
increasingly understood that my motto
was a lie I certainly was not excellent
in all things in fact I might only have
been decent in a few things at best and
rather unremarkable in the vast majority
of things like I couldn't fix a toaster
or speak speak Arabic or ride a unicycle

[03:02]
or speak speak Arabic or ride a unicycle
or hit a target with a bow at 100 yard
or cook a sule or etc etc etc if I was
being honest I could really only do one
or two things better than most people
and yet I was able to maintain this
illusion about excellence in all things
for quite some time how is that
possible when I examined this question I
realized that it was possible because I
sort of minimized the value of all those
other things I wasn't good at like those
things were beneath me or they didn't
really matter or they weren't truly
important and I would form negative
judgments about the people who did excel
in those fields they were just just dumb
jocks or superficial idiots Etc and this
was all in the service of protecting my
rather fragile view of reality like I
could be excellent in all things as long

[04:01]
could be excellent in all things as long
as most things didn't matter so they
kind of didn't count right and I've seen
the same thing in nearly every case of
perfectionism that I've worked with it
requires a very selective attention to
maintain to prop up the illusion
perfectionists kind of have to willfully
not look at all the things they can't do
very well and this is made easier
through the denigration and criticism of
those things
after all if they truly were important
and meaningful and perfectionists
weren't perfect at them then what kind
of cognitive dissonance do you think
that would create so that was the first
crack in the facade of my
perfectionism now before I go any
further if you're liking what you're

description let's get back to it now the
second crack in my perfectionism had to
do with the realization that I was
emotionally identified with the products
of my perfectionism in my mind the
invoice wasn't just a piece of paper it
was a reflection of my core values and
an extension of myself and that of
course is why I put so much time and
attention into the invoicing because I
believed that other people would somehow
be able to see me through that piece of
paper it would attest to my value and
worth and I think I did this because I
was still a young man at 20 years old
this was my first business and I was was

[06:00]
this was my first business and I was was
absolutely still developing my personal
and professional identities and despite
the fact that this was entirely
appropriate given my stage of life I was
also profoundly embarrassed by my own
inexperience and
incompetence as such I was
overcompensating as a means of avoiding
contact with those emotional experiences
on some level I believe that I needed to
provide my clients with even more value
than they hired me to deliver in order
to offset the liability associated with
hiring me in the first place so I felt
the need to go above and beyond often in
respects that didn't really have to do
with my job per se in order to make up
for the fact that I didn't feel
exceptional at my actual job these
additional efforts were kind of a crutch
to bolster my professional
identity Over time however this crutch
became increasingly unnecessary after
thousands thousands of hours I got

[07:01]
thousands thousands of hours I got
better at running a business and I got
better at working with students I was
able to see more and more that the
invoice wasn't actually a reflection of
myself it was just a piece of paper and
a rather expensive and inconvenient
piece of paper at that and this was
incredibly liberating I talk about this
a bit in my episode how to be
indestructible we become vulnerable and
exposed when we allow ourselves to
identify with things that are not
ourselves through narcissistic extension
it's a better idea to identify only with
yourself and to make the surface area of
your ego very small as this will allow
you to navigate life more peacefully and
without unnecessary
friction and then one day after years of
this I made the conscious decision not
to provide my clients with handwritten
invoices anymore and

[08:00]
invoices anymore and
I was actually pretty nervous about this
decision after training my clients to
expect these invoices I was worried that
they would see my choice not to provide
them as a downgrade in the quality of my
services that they would think that they
are paying more for less and you know
what it turned out that nobody cared
like literally not a single client even
mentioned anything about not receiving
the invoices anymore it turns out they
just needed to know how much to make the
checkout for and that information could
easily be communicated in other ways
nobody cared nobody noticed it was all
in my
head every month I was spending a couple
hours of my life creating these invoices
this was expensive not only in terms of
the stationary but also in terms of the
opportunity cost I could be doing
literally anything else with my life
including using that time to make more
money to increase the value of those
invoices and this experience opened my

[09:01]
invoices and this experience opened my
eyes to the fact that different actions
possess radically disproportionate
values and that it's the other person
who decides ultimately what those values
are remember the cat decides what milk
is good all too often we believe that we
can kind of make that decision for the
cat and it doesn't work that way however
through careful observation you can get
better at ice in the behaviors that are
truly important to the cat irrespective
of your own opinions you can then
optimize those behaviors and satisfies
the others and this will allow you to
become much more effective and much more
efficient in delivering value which in
turn will allow you to deliver a lot
more value to a lot more people
accelerating your growth both as a
business person and as a human being
hopefully that made sense what do you
