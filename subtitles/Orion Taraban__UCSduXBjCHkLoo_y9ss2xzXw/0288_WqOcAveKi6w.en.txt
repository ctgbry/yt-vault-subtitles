so once again the internet is all a
twitter on the subject of male sexual
preference this most recent
controversy was sparked by the Andrew
Tate Piers Morgan interview that came
out a few days ago I actually don't know
who either one of those guys is I'm not
very up on popular culture but I do like
to make episodes that are relevant to
the time so that people enjoy them the
fact of the matter is it's been very
solidly demonstrated empirically that
men have a preference for younger women
and that women have a preference for
older men this is usually explained in
terms of evolutionary psychology that
youth and Beauty are an indirect metric
of reproductive capacity I.E fertility
and so that men are kind of biologically
programmed to seek after younger women
but there's another really important
reason why this occurs please see my
recent episode why men like younger
women for the answer staring Us in the
face the whole time but nobody talks
about it
