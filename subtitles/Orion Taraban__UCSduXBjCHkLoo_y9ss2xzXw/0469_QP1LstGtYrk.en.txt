I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is men and
women don't need each other anymore
so I recently received some feedback
from a viewer who told me that she got
the impression that in some of my videos
I imply that women need men and she felt
that such an implication was
misogynistic
now when pressed she couldn't tell me
what I said that gave her that
impression or even what episode or
episodes were responsible
however that apparently was the vibe
that she got from my episodes
now it certainly is not my intention to
be misogynistic among other things my
goal on this channel is to tell the
truth about intersectional Dynamics
without either enraging men or
alienating women and frankly that's not
an easy task I imagine I don't always
succeed but that is what I aspire to do
in any case I think my response
surprised her because I actually agreed

[01:01]
surprised her because I actually agreed
with and expanded upon her fundamental
premise she was right women and men
don't need each other anymore
I don't mean this on the population
level like Civilization would fall apart
with not without a lot of men and
Humanity would go extinct without a lot
of women
men need women around and women need men
around but perhaps for the first time in
a very long time modern man doesn't need
a woman
and modern woman doesn't need a man
and I think this is a really important
driver of the unprecedented decline in
marriage dating and sexual relationships
that we're experiencing at the present
moment we no longer need each other at
least we no longer need each other the
way that most of us did even a hundred
years ago throughout most of recorded
history men and women came together out

[02:00]
history men and women came together out
of necessity
and that necessity was rooted in
survival life was extremely hard the
vast majority of humanity was living at
a subsistence or a poverty level and few
people can do that alone I mean one of
the ways that really poor folks get by
like in the favelas of Brazil where I've
spent some time is they form really
strong interpersonal bonds like if you
don't have anything yourself you need
other people
and if you have a lot you need people
less
and I think that at least partly
explains why in every culture on this
planet over the last 100 years birth
rate has declined as per capita GDP has
increased
it's also why affluent modern folks tend
to be much lonelier and more isolated
than poorer folks in less industrialized
societies it makes sense actually the
more you have yourself the less you need

[03:00]
more you have yourself the less you need
other people and the less you have
yourself the more you really need others
and when people were very very poor and
where in some parts of the world they
still are
men and women have come together because
they really needed to lean on each other
and close to that subsistence level of
living where biological necessity
becomes more pressing men and women
discover that they have complementary
skill sets that are absolutely
indispensable for survival
on the other hand the further folks are
from a subsistence level the more
flexible social roles can become simply
because we have more room for error
we don't have to send the best hunters
out for food anymore if other folks want
to take a stab at hunting why not let
them even if they don't bring back as
much food as frequently we're probably
not going to starve at least that's how
I see things

[04:00]
I see things

little dots in the lower right hand
corner and tip me in proportion of the
value you feel you've derived from this
episode
I need your help to do all of this and I
really appreciate your support thank you
in any case here we are in the affluent
Western World men and women don't need
each other the way that they used to and
this is a really interesting a really
fascinating moment to be living through
I'm legitimately really excited to see
how we collectively navigate this the
crisis and the opportunity of this
moment is precisely this
since men and women no longer have to
come together because they need to
we're increasingly seeing that men and

[05:00]
we're increasingly seeing that men and
women only come together because they
want to
and where there is neither the need nor
the want there is nothing
again this has probably never happened
before in recorded history it's an
incredible development especially
because what we're discovering
is that a lot of women apparently don't
want men and a lot of men apparently
don't want women
since we don't need each other like we
used to a lot of men and women are
walking away
what's more to initiate any form of
sexual relationship men and women
increasingly have to cater to the
desires as opposed to the needs of the
other
and this changes the game of mating and
dating considerably
in the past both men and women could
kind of lean on necessity like you might
not love the idea of me but there are

[06:00]
not love the idea of me but there are
only three guys in this Village and two
of them are old and stinky and I could
help you survive the winter
where else are you gonna go what else
are you gonna do
so I think we got to be careful about
romanticizing the days when people got
married at 17 and stayed together for 70
years
personally I'd rather not go back to
that time with its lack of optionality
or recourse I like being able to choose
an option that's right for me as opposed
to having to settle for the only thing
available
that said this optionality is also a
driver in the present decline in
relationships with dating apps and
social media many people are ensnared by
the illusion of infinite optionality and
this illusion has exacerbated the
Primacy of desire in the modern game of
mating and dating even more than the
elimination of necessity by itself ever
could
why because if I don't need someone and

[07:01]
why because if I don't need someone and
very desirable Partners exist somewhere
in that infinite optionality then I have
little incentive to settle for anything
less than something very desirable
and why shouldn't I have it all I don't
need to settle for less I'm young and I
have plenty of time anyway
and this one is a little tricky to
navigate because forming an actual
relationship with a real human being
always requires some degree of settling
like it's never possible to get
everything that you want but where to
draw the line is always an individual
choice
it's important to do that though because
if you retain the infinite potential you
end up with nothing
because that's what potential is
nothing
the illusion of infinite potential makes
people believe that they're suffering an
enormous loss by trading the infinite
potential for a given actual
by trading everything for just one thing

[08:02]
by trading everything for just one thing
in reality however people actually
achieve an infinite gain by giving up
the infinite potential for a given
actual they give up nothing for
something
in any case we're in the situation where
men and women are really only interested
in getting together if they want to
and what we're discovering is that at
least a sizable minority of each sex
doesn't seem to want what the other one
is selling
my hunch is that this is going to give
rise not only to new relationship
Arrangements but to new strategies on
both sides to secure desired
relationships for better or worse if
they want a relationship straight men
and women not only will need to become
increasingly attuned to what the
opposite sex wants but they will need to
restrict the operation of their own
desire to the constraints of reality as

[09:00]
desire to the constraints of reality as
well
