i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
people want what other people want
this is a very important principle to
keep in mind
both in terms of dating and employment
and in fact there's actually a lot of
overlap between those two domains
in order to illustrate this principle
let me tell you a story
i was an actor for many years before
becoming a psychologist
and i attended a prestigious acting
conservatory for undergrad and in my
senior year i was selected to
participate in what we called industry
night basically the top 20 performers in
the school were invited to audition in
front of hundreds of agents and casting
directors in order to help these
performers get industry representation
and launch their careers after
graduation so it was a big deal to be
invited to participate in this event
and i remember going to the event doing
my best with the audition and anxiously
waiting by the phone the following

[01:00]
waiting by the phone the following
morning when interested agents and
casting directors were expected to reach
out to the performers who caught their
eye
and the next day i got a couple of calls
at 9am i got a call from an agent at a
major agency
and the very first question he asked me
was who else has called you
and i truthfully confess that he was
actually the first and that i was so
excited to receive this call
however upon learning that information
he got off the phone with me very
very quickly
about an hour later i got a call from
another agent who asked me the very same
question who else has called you
and this time i was able to honestly
answer that i was contacted by so-and-so
at this agency and that i was very
excited to receive his call
and the response was oh
just one other person
this was
another very short conversation
and that was it
i got two phone calls and they were

[02:01]
i got two phone calls and they were
primarily interested in who else was
interested in me
people want what other people want and
to a certain extent this makes sense
in the absence of personal experience or
direct analysis the interest of others
serves as a kind of proxy for the
variable of interest
it's possible that a hundred people are
all wrong but it's less likely than a
single individual being wrong
so in this way we tend to delegate our
judgment onto the behavior of others
for instance those two agents who called
me must have been interested in me
but the apparent fact that no one else
seemed to be
probably suggested to them that it might
be hard to represent me as a saleable
commodity to others
so try to extrapolate this principle to
your work
imagine getting invited to interview at
your company of interest and being asked
well who else are you talking to and you
respond with no one you're the job i
really want and i've been waiting by the
phone for you to call

[03:00]
phone for you to call
well that may be true
it's far less incentivizing for the
company to act and make you an offer
than a response like actually i've been
talking to five or six other companies i
have a couple of open offers on the
table but i'm here because i'm
interested in what you have to say and
what you can potentially and what we can
potentially do together
this response will motivate action with
respect to that particular opportunity
it also provides a sort of proxy
with respect to your
capacity and talent
otherwise it would be unlikely that all
these other companies would be
interested
this makes you a safer bet
it's almost like these other companies
have already vetted you for your company
of interest which consequently doesn't
have to look at you that closely
by wanting what other people want people
delegate responsibility for selection
across a distributed network this of
course can be disastrous
however if the nodes of the network in
question are competent and independent

[04:00]
question are competent and independent
this is actually pretty good heuristic
in general
so it's always a good idea to keep
creating opportunities for yourself
until you have an explicit offer that
you are enthusiastic about accepting
people want what other people want which
means it's not enough to be good or
talented or competent you also have to
be attractive
