I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is a PhD in
men ladies this is an episode for you if
you are single and you don't want to be
it is time to go back to school now I
don't mean enrolling in a graduate
program in most cases that's actually
not a very good idea what I mean is that
you might have to invest some time
energy and money into learning about men
like how they operate and what makes
them tick now you might hear that and
think Orion why should I have to do this
like do men make an effort to learn
about women and I would say yeah yeah
they [ __ ] do obviously not all men
but I guarantee you there is a non
insignificant portion of the male
population who hold a PhD in women there

[01:00]
population who hold a PhD in women there
are men who have made it their second
[ __ ] job to try and figure out what
women want how they operate and what
makes them tick and they do this not out
of the goodness of their heart but out
of a self-interested motivation namely
the desire to get more of what they want
from
women one class of men who do this who
make it their vocation to study and
understand women are known as pickup
artists now that term by itself already
grosses some women out like some women
really don't like the idea of these men
but what is pickup Artistry
fundamentally it is applied behavioral
psychology men go out and over hundreds
or thousands of iterations allow
outcomes to teach them what words what
tones what actions what behaviors work
in order to increase the likelihood that
women will be interested in sleeping

[02:00]
women will be interested in sleeping
with them and that ultimately is what
tends to creep women out the idea that
these men are manipulating women into
having sex and that's probably true at
least to some extent like some
manipulation is definitely taking place
but what's the alternative women aren't
handing out sex on the street corner and
female desire is much more reactive than
male desire reactive in the sense that
it responds to stimulation a woman might
feel spontaneous sexual attraction for
say Henry caval but if you're an average
guy probably not so if you're an average
guy and you want to have sex you have to
kind of go out and make it happen and
you do this successfully by learning
what stimuli women actually respond to
not what you think they should respond
to not what you want them to respond to
but what they actually respond to and
this takes practice

[03:00]
this takes practice
these guys take courses spend thousands
of dollars on coaching change their
appearance and suffer an incredible
amount of rejection they read books and
listen to podcasts and watch YouTube
videos they make it their job to learn
how to get what they want from women and
on some level regardless of how you feel
about pickup artists you got to kind of
respect that like they definitely put in
the time and that's the other reason why
women generally don't like pickup
Artistry it works obviously not all the
time but game absolutely makes it much
more likely that you will get laid as a
man if these things didn't work I don't
think that women would be so upset they
don't like the idea that men can learn
to do things that will increase the
chances that women will sleep with them
because it kind of makes them feel like
suckers for falling for their tricks but
on some level that's fair like if you

[04:02]
on some level that's fair like if you
put in the time energy and expense then
you should see some positive results and
women might bulk well why can't men put
in the time energy and expense into
giving us commitment and being loyal and
I would respond because that's what you
want that's not what men want if men are
going to go through the trouble and
expense they're going to do so to get
what they want make
sense if you appreciate apprciate the
insights on this channel I would highly
encourage you to get your hands on a
copy of my book the value of others over
the course of 432 pages I delve deep
into my economic model of relationships
and explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again

[05:02]
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description now let's look at it from
the other side I don't know a single
woman who has gotten a PhD in men indeed
the idea that women might have to learn
some skills and acquire some knowledge
and change their behavior in order to
get what they want from men is ludicrous
if not offensive to the majority of
Western
women and to be fair women probably
don't have to earn a PhD in men mostly
because men are far less complicated
than women are men are often
oversimplified like it actually takes
more than sex and a sandwich to win us
over but they are far far simpler than
women so women wouldn't need to devote
several years of study to understand men
but you know they could get a

[06:00]
but you know they could get a
certificate in men like an associates
degree in men that's that's reasonable
like some period of dedicated study
would probably be helpful even if it's
significantly shorter than men's
equivalent course and why is this study
required because just like the pickup
artists women can learn what words what
tones what actions what behaviors work
in order to increase the likelihood that
men will be interested in giving them
what they want and just like pickup
Artistry this will generally require at
least some degree of
manipulation but what's the
alternative men at least the men that
women wanted from aren't handing out
commitment on the street corner a man
might feel spontaneous desire to commit
to a fabulously beautiful woman but if
you're an average woman probably not so
if you're an average woman and you want
to get commitment you have to kind of go

[07:00]
to get commitment you have to kind of go
out and make it happen and you do this
successfully by learning what stimuli
Men actually respond to not what you
think they should respond to not what
you want them to respond to but what
they actually respond to and unpopular
truth if you aren't willing to put in
the effort to learn those things then
why should men give you what you
want that would be like a guy who won't
make an effort to be attract rative to
women just expecting that he should get
sex from
them I mean that feels really creepy and
entitled right ladies well from our
perspective it also feels kind of creepy
and entitled when you insist that you
shouldn't have to make an effort to be
attractive to men in order to get
commitment from them just like men some
of you might need to invest some time
energy and money into learning how to
get what you want and if you do your
success will be

[08:00]
success will be
Fair like if you put in the effort then
you should see some positive results
because in the absence of this training
in the absence of evidence or outcomes
or strategy or system what are you left
with a bunch of [ __ ] cliches that
aren't true if it's meant to be then it
will be as if you can just sit tight and
wait for your meat cute if he loved me
he would try harder as if his level of
effort has nothing to do with you a real
man knows the value of a woman and will
treat her like a princess and put a ring
on it like all those things have to do
with men where do you factor into
getting what you want wake up it is your
responsibility to get what you want it
is not men's responsibility to give you
what you want you are not entitled to a
goddamn thing no one

[09:00]
goddamn thing no one
is most men are not walking around
thinking wow I sure hope I can find a
woman today to protect and
provision it's extremely rare for a man
to like spontaneously desire to offer a
woman a lifelong commitment it's inside
of most men but you have to kind of
Bring It Out Of Us by the same token
most women aren't walking around
thinking wow I sure hope I get
absolutely ravished in a nasty
disrespectful way
today it's pretty rare for a woman to
like spontaneously offer that super
freaky milk to a man it's inside most of
you but we kind of have to bring it out
of you and those who learn how to do
those things tend to get what they want
so if you're a woman and you're single
and you don't want to be then it might
be time to do something that you haven't
done before pick up a book take a class
get some coaching put your pride aside
and go out and get what you want I know

[10:02]
and go out and get what you want I know
