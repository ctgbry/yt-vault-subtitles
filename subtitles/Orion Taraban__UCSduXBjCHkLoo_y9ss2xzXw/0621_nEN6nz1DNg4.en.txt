I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is being
famous is like being a woman so I'm
going to go out in a limb on this one
because I'm only a little bit famous and
I'm clearly not a woman however becoming
well known through the YouTube channel
has afforded me some interesting
experiences experiences that as far as I
can tell just wouldn't have been
possible as the functionally anonymous
man I was just year ago and I'd like to
share some of those experiences with you
today nowadays I get recognized when I
go out in public and people from all
over the world both men and women reach
out to me unprovoked for all kinds of
different reasons needless to say
neither of these things tended to happen
before the channel blew up and I'd like
to start by talking about one of the
first such messages I received about a
year ago back when the channel had just
a few million views I actually can't

[01:00]
a few million views I actually can't
remember if this was a comment or a DM
or an email and I'm embarrassed to say
that I don't remember the name of the
sender or the business but I do remember
the thrust of the message which is the
important part for our intents and
purposes apparently the guy who
contacted me was a barber who worked at
a barber shop in San Francisco he told
me that he and all the other guys in the
shop loved my stuff and when they
learned that I lived in the area they
collectively invited me to come in for a
haircut on the
house now I never took the guy up on his
offer but I wish I could give him a
proper shout out nonetheless because his
offer was very sweet and genuine he
clearly didn't have to express his
appreciation like that and I was touched
that he did so now it took me some time
to realize this like it didn't hit me
right away but this was the first time a
stranger like someone I had never met in
my life had ever offered to give me

[02:04]
my life had ever offered to give me
something at least as far as I can
remember I'm sure some adults gave me
little treats when I was a kid but here
I was 40 years old and I was being
offered a gift by a stranger for the
first time in my adult
life maybe you know where this is going
as I often do I started to look at this
experience through the lens of
Behavioral economics and the sexual
Marketplace so the value of a haircut is
about 40 bucks and all I apparent had to
do to earn that gift was to provide
value to a few million
people now 40 bucks is like two drinks
at the bar over the course of my
adulthood to how many women have I made
an equivalent
offer like the barber I was often a
total stranger to these women and I was
just showing up unannounced with an
offer to give them something and I and
not because they did anything
particularly impressive or useful or

[03:00]
particularly impressive or useful or
exciting or virtuous but just because I
thought they looked cute and I did this
not because I was grateful like the
barber was after all what did I have to
be grateful for these women hadn't done
anything but because I thought that
offering that gift would increase the
chances of initiating a sexual
relationship with her and of course if I
was offering these gifts to her how many
other men were doing the same now before
I go any further if you're liking what
you're hearing then please consider
sending this episode to someone who
might benefit from its message because
it's Word of Mouth referrals like this
that really help to make the channel
grow I'm also proud to announce that
I'll soon be publishing my book the
value of others so if you'd like to

this is why being famous is like being a

[04:01]
this is why being famous is like being a
woman on the whole when you're famous
people treat you really really
well like at this point I can kind of
count on a guy coming up to me to pay
his respects like several times a week
he'll come up and say hey are are you
that guy whoa let me shake your hand I
really love what you do you've helped me
out so much thank you for all the great
content keep it up keep it up man and
let me tell you that's really cool like
it's it's one of the best things about
the success of this channel one of the
best things about the success of this
channel is that it's allowed me to meet
so many interesting people that I
probably would never have met otherwise
and because I'm just here in my house
talking to a camera it's really great to
be able to meet the people on the other
end of the line especially since they're
generally so grateful and positive and
encouraging like it always makes my day
I feel happy when it happens and it
definitely helps me to feel more

[05:00]
definitely helps me to feel more
confident about moving forward with the
channel and now I can also kind of
imagine what it might be like to be a
woman who can kind of count on a guy
coming up to her to pay his respect
several times a week like excuse me wow
you're beautiful I'd love to be able to
buy you something sometime like a drink
a meal what do you say would you go out
with me like even if I was happily
married how wouldn't that feel good
how wouldn't that feel validating and
flattering I'm sure it would make my day
a little brighter and put a spring in my
step but of course the difference would
be that as a woman I wouldn't think that
I did anything to deserve that kind of
attention or
treatment no I would just think that I
was someone who deserved that kind of
attention or treatment and why wouldn't
I even I would know that I didn't do
anything to earn that attention

[06:00]
anything to earn that attention
which would mean that if I was receiving
that attention it must be because of who
I was not because of anything that I
might have done and this in turn might
cause me in time to believe that I was
entitled to that treatment in kind of
the same way that I as a man believe
that I'm entitled to like basic human
dignity this is why I think so many
women think that they're the prize like
inherently most women are kind of
lowgrade famous
in the sense that they receive treatment
comparable to someone with a few hundred
thousand followers on social media like
just for breathing and I can only
imagine what it would be like if people
were coming out of the Woodworks to pay
me compliments and offer me gifts from a
very young age like what a distorted
view of my own selfworth would I likely
have of course those gifts often come
with strings attached as I admitted
they're designed to functionally lure a
woman into a sexual Rel relationship

[07:00]
woman into a sexual Rel relationship
however that would have to be mystified
those strings would have to stay very
well hidden because if I believed that I
was entitled to those gifts just by like
being a good person I would absolutely
be insulted by any insinuation of an
ulterior motive or any expectation of
reciprocity on the other hand as a man
I've kind of had to earn any good
treatment that I've received generally
by providing value to others and in this
case by providing value to a lot of
other people so it's not something that
I take for granted however I doubt that
I would ever have thought that there was
anything odd about this Arrangement
until I attain to the very special form
of success called Fame my dude's Fame is
not like wealth or ABS or status and
that's because those things aren't
always visible and obvious Fame is like
being hot regardless of how physically

[08:00]
being hot regardless of how physically
attractive you actually are
because like hotness Fame is highly
visible and immediately apparent and let
me tell you women respond to fame the
same way men respond to hotness and this
is why I have advised you guys many
times to find ways to become visibly
competent the kind of attention you
receive as a man by being visibly
competent is a force multiplier in the
sexual Marketplace like you might even
be disgusted by how easy things become
because potentially nothing else about
you has changed except for the fact that
more people now know that you
exist in any case my point is this I
don't think I would have ever fully
appreciated how tough and unfair life
can be for men until my life started to
become a little
easier like I didn't even think that was
possible

[09:00]
possible
I just kind of thought that the way
things were were the way they had to be
they're not and if we men can do one
thing to effectively change a situation
that we were complicit in creating it's
this stop giving women unearned
attention I know it's hard to do I did
it myself for years but it's absolutely
a big part of why women today walk
around with certain delusions about
their own self-worth they were trained
to think that way by the men around them
men like you and me something to
consider what do you think does this fit
