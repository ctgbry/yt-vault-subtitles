So many men have so many bad habits that
I'm like, you need to get rid of those
bad habits before you try to be
yourself.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, to what extent is the self
organic and to what extent is the self
intentionally cultivated? You know what
I'm saying?
&gt;&gt; It's fluid. You're different all the
time.
&gt;&gt; But I do think that like let's just take
a very obvious example like learning a
foreign language. Like in the beginning,
it's very conscious. It's very
intentional. It's very problematic. But
if you stick with it long enough, it
becomes a part of your identity. You
might even be able to effortlessly
converse or dream in that language.
&gt;&gt; So are you a foreign language speaker
like in innately or is it really a
result of all of your efforts that it's
now become this unconscious talent or
capacity that you have?
&gt;&gt; You you you know you woke up late, you
ate poorly, you know, you lived in your
mom's basement and all a sudden you
start hanging around guys who are more
successful than you. Get up early, go to
the gym all the time and then you become
more successful. At what point were you
you yourself? Were you yourself before
or are you yourself now? And the idea is
what yourself is is not organic. It is
something that evolves and changes over

something that evolves and changes over
time. So whenever I hear women say,
"Hey, these men should just be
themselves." It just makes me think
they're trying to pick out who the
losers are quicker. Because if a man
watches copious amounts of pornography
and he says, you know, sits on his couch
and he's morbidly overweight, him being
himself only hurts him with women.
