i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is
the critical inner voice is a very
important psychological concept
i think we all have it to some degree or
another
however it can be sadistically cruel in
the case of depressives
now the critical inner voice isn't a
hallucination
people don't experience the voices
coming from outside of their own minds
rather it's a malevolent form of
self-talk that can in its extreme forms
be incessantly berating and abusive
for instance it's the thought that
judges you very harshly when you make a
mistake
or that over generalizes global
personality flaws from local failures
and rejections
it's the voice that makes categorical
statements about you as a person in a
highly negative valence
it's very
very difficult to enjoy any measure of

[01:01]
very difficult to enjoy any measure of
quality of life when the critical inner
voice is predominant
so
where does it come from
a lot of researchers believe that the
critical inner voice is an introject
of the parents perceived negative
attitudes toward the child
these negative attitudes may have been
explicit in the form of physical or
emotional abuse
but in many cases
these negative attitudes largely remain
implicit
in the form of a look a gesture a tone
of voice a withdrawal of affection etc
and the child unconsciously internalizes
these attitudes as a kind of negative
conscience
just like the rules and values of the
household are instrumental in
formulating the child's positive
conscience for productive action the
parents perceive negative attitudes
towards the child it's needy stupid and
convenient burdensome etc
can be internalized as a negative
conscience against productive action

[02:01]
conscience against productive action
so that's where a lot of folks believe
that critical inner voice comes from
okay so what do we do about it
the first step to addressing the
critical inner voice
is to begin to appreciate that this
voice isn't really you
it's an introject
an introject is like a thought or a
belief that doesn't really belong to you
but is nevertheless inside your head
it's similar to how a hamburger is not
actually part of your body even though
it's inside your stomach you wouldn't
think i ate a hamburger now this
hamburger is me
but people think all the time i had a
thought so it must belong to me
so the first step in addressing the
critical inner voice is to make this
ego alien as they say
to begin to identify this voice as other
as
not me if you can do that that's already
a big first step in the direction of
resolving the problem
and we'll definitely talk more about how
specifically to do this in future

[03:00]
specifically to do this in future
episodes
for today let's contend ourselves with
an introduction to the critical inner
voice it's likely origins and the first
step towards its undoing
i hope you found this helpful if you'd
like to suggest a topic for a future
episode or you would like to schedule a
