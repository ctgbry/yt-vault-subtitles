every woman on this planet possesses
these two versions of themselves and
this means that every woman on this
planet has to learn how to navigate this
ambiguity within themselves especially
because women receive all kinds of
conflicting messages about their
sexuality from society some women
attempt to resolve this ambiguity by
just collapsing the dichotomy they're
hyper controlled and generally hyper
contr controlling and they try to
civilize the bedroom as much as possible
there is no Wild West anymore just LA
and order all the time under a Vigilant
surveillance State on the other hand
there are women usually young women who
collapse the dichotomy in the opposite
direction they're underregulation with
poor boundaries and inappropriately
sexualized interactions that have no
business being sexual with these women
it's only the wild west and anything
goes as might be expected neither one of
these situations is particularly ideal
and most women resolve this ambiguity by
kind of compartmentalizing the two in
different dimensions of reality
