one thing to know your emotions and be
able to read them but then there's
another thing to express them
haphazardly right you got to be careful
about expressing emotions as a man
especially to a woman that you're in a
relationship with I made a video a long
time ago called the captain can't
complain and the metaphor here is that
as the man you are the captain of the
relationship now your woman could be
your first mate which is a really
important position on the ship but is
still slightly below the captain in the
hierarchy if one day the first mate were
to come into the Captain's Quarters and
say Hey cap how's everything and the
captain turns around and says oh man I
don't know if we're going to make it you
know I'm really concerned I think that
there are some pirates on our tail and
they're catching up to us and we're
heading right into a sh and I don't have
aing map I I mean we're running low on
supplies I I just am so overwhelmed and
stressed out I don't even know what to
do I mean that first night is kind of
like okay um get it together and if it's
so bad she might be looking for the
first chance to get off that boat
