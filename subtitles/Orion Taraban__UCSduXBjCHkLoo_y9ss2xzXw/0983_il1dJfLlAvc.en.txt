Are are we just trying to recreate let's
say you had a traumatic or we all
probably have some form of a traumatic
relationship with at least one parent.
Are we looking for partners to kind of
re revisit that and and heal it?
That's what Freud said. He basically
said that we can either repeat or we can
remember
what what's your take on that?
I think that there's some truth to that
for sure because the greatest victory is
to achieve a different outcome in a
problematic relationship from our past.
So, let's say that we had a father who
was very withholding and he never told
us that he loved us and never gave us a
hug and was kind of mean or absent. Then
we unconsciously or not might get in
relationship with cold, aloof,
withholding men. In therapy, we call
that a reenactment. So, we're kind of
creating a psycho drama by casting a new
actor in the same role. Now, why would
you do that? Well, because there's this
desire that I'm going to set up the
scene exactly as I remember it on some

scene exactly as I remember it on some
level, but I'm going to get him to love
me this time. I'm going to get him to
recognize me, to acknowledge me, and to
have a happily ever after. And that new
ending, people believe, will resolve the
trauma associated with the previous
relationship.
Does that ever work?
Generally not. And it's pretty easy to
understand why. is because the person
who sets up the psycho drama only has
experience with the bad ending.
