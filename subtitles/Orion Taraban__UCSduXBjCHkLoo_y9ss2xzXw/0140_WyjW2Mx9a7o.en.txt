i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
you are paying more than you need to
and the more successful you are
the truer this statement becomes so what
do i mean by this
a metaphor i often use with clients is
that work is an auction house you ever
been to an auction house there's
something for sale people are bidding
and the lot ultimately goes to whoever
offers the highest amount
okay
if you win in an auction house
it means you overpaid
why
because by definition
you were the only person in that room
who thought that lot was worth that much
no one else thought it was that valuable
and that's why you won
on some level overpaying is the price
you pay to secure the privilege of
winning
however in the vast majority of cases
you probably could have bought the same
lot with less money

[01:00]
lot with less money
the issue is of course that you don't
know how much less money you could have
used to buy that lot it could have been
a dollar less it could have been a
million dollars less but you almost
certainly could have saved some money on
that transaction
and this excessive spending isn't that
big of a deal if you're only going to
the auction house every once in a while
but if you're going there every single
day to bid on multiple lots like at your
job
the extent to which you're overpaying
can create a significant liability for
you over time because you don't have
infinite resources you have a finite
store of time energy and money
and if you're overpaying on 10 lots that
might mean that you're not going to be
competitive for the 11th
so what does this have to do with work
basically it means that if you're
winning
if you're successful
if things are going smoothly
it might mean that you're over bidding
you could potentially secure the same
results
with less time and effort

[02:00]
with less time and effort
and the only way to figure out the
extent to which you're over bidding
is to systematically experiment with
your time and effort investments
pull back a little bit and see what
happens
obviously you need to use your good
judgment here don't experiment on a
critical project or an essential
responsibility
target less important components of work
first
remove some of your time and effort
focus on satisficing as opposed to
optimizing
and observe the result
did anybody even notice
did this titration create a problem for
anyone else
huh
maybe i had this idea in my mind about a
certain standard of quality or
proficiency that i needed to demonstrate
in order to secure a successful result
and maybe that standard simply exists in
my own head
maybe it's not necessarily true huh well
in what other aspects of my work or life
am i overpaying in terms of time energy

[03:02]
am i overpaying in terms of time energy
or emotional investment in order to get
the same result
and when we begin to be a bit more
deliberate and systematic about how we
choose to allocate our time and energy
then we actually liberate some of those
resources to be productively invested in
other aspects of our lives which makes
our lives not just our work more varied
interesting and successful something to
keep in mind and remember that if
pulling back really does create an issue
trust that people will let you know
it's just like in sports unless the foul
is really flagrant the ref isn't going
to go straight for the red card usually
it's just a whistle
and if you don't hear anything assume
the ball is still in play
what do you think have you experimented
with this idea in your own life
