The lengths that men will go to attract
and secure female attention are
considerable. They'll spend thousands,
tens of thousands of dollars. They'll
spend years of their lives becoming
something that a woman might be
interested in. And it seems that some
women are maybe they'll take a weekend
course at a community college on what
men might want. And I think that's a
stretch sometimes. And I think that has
to do with the power imbalance in the
sexual marketplace right now. That
wasn't always the case. I think that in
most traditional literature, for
example, you don't really see the trope
of the man pursuing the woman. You've
seen those old toppers on wedding cakes.
It's like the woman dragging the man to
the altar. Like that's kind of how it's
been for a very long time. And for that
to happen, the women had to use their
whiles and figure out, well, what does
it work to get man's or that particular
man's attention because that's what I
want. I want to lock down that guy. And
that kind of worked because that man was
kind of indifferent. He wasn't looking

kind of indifferent. He wasn't looking
for it. He was soldiering. He was having
fun with his buddies, etc., etc.
Nowadays, it's like the women are in the
spotlight. The men are looking at them.
The men are pursuing the women. And so,
it gives them an opportunity to become
more indifferent. And the power
imbalance has shifted considerably.
Like, it'll probably shift again back
and forth. These things are probably
historical pendulum swings.
