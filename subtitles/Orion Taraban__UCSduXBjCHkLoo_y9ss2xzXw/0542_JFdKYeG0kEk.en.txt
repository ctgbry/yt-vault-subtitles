I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is fear is
the basis of
respect in my consultations I talked to
many different folks from many different
walks of life however one of the
recurring themes in my consultations is
disrespect these men struggle with
feeling disrespected disrespected by
other men and disrespected by the women
in their lives if they're fortunate
enough to have any and I often respond
to this complaint as I will do now by
sharing a brief Parable this Parable
comes from the Hindu tradition and it
kind of goes like this once upon a time
a cobra lived on the outskirts of a
village this snake had bitten several
people who had subsequently died so
people came to fear and avoid the snake
one day a monk visited the village and
the Cobra confided in the monk the snake
complained monk I'm so lonely everyone
here is afraid afraid of me they avoid

[01:01]
here is afraid afraid of me they avoid
me like the plague please help me what
am I doing wrong and the monk responded
snake the reason why people are afraid
of you is because your bite is venomous
and you're killing people if you don't
bite people anymore you won't have this
problem and the snake nodded and said oh
okay that makes sense I I'll stop biting
people yeah and it slithered off into
the grass a week later the snake
returned to the Monk and it looked
terrible it had a black eye and its tail
was bent and someone had take a chunk
out of its side and the monk exclaimed
snake oh my goodness what happened to
you and the snake replied oh monk I
followed your advice I stopped biting
people but as soon as people figured out
that I wasn't going to bite them all of
their fear turned into anger they
ruthlessly attacked me and I barely
escaped with my life I I kind of liked
it better when they just avoided me this
is much more painful and the monk
replied oh snake

[02:00]
replied oh snake
I only told you not to bite I never told
you not to
hiss and that's the end of the parable
and this is the moral of the story the
point that people who struggle with this
issue of disrespect need to understand
is this it's important for people to
hear you
hiss if you present yourself as so Meek
and agreeable that you would never
possibly bite anyone under any circum
ances then you're going to get it like
the snake in the second half of the
story you might end up as everyone's
personal Whipping Boy they'll be angry
with other people but they'll take it
out on you why because they wouldn't be
so sure that the people that they're
actually angry with wouldn't retaliate
in this way you might actually end up
absorbing a great deal of the pain and
suffering that other people would like
to inflict on others but are too afraid
to do so

[03:00]
to do so
because of the potential
consequences but there apparently aren't
any consequences to treating you with
anger and disrespect for whatever reason
probably due to your own judgments about
anger and aggression you have decided
that implementing consequences is just
not a possible outcome of this
interaction and this is part of the
reason why family relationships have the
potential to be the most dysfunctional
relationships on the planet people
believe on the one hand that no matter
what they do there will always be a
place for them in the family and on the
other hand that no matter what another
person does they can't turn their back
on their family and let me tell you
neither one of those beliefs is true now

grow you can also hit the thanks button
and tip me in proportion to the value
you feel you've received from this
episode I really depend on your support
it helps to make all this possible and I
really appreciate it thank
you in any case hissing is important
this means that you are able and willing
to communicate under certain
circumstances that you are someone to be
reckoned with there has to be something
in you that other people fear because
though we're rather squeamish to admit
it fear is the basis of respect we
respect people who have the power to
hurt us but who choose not to I'll say
that again we respect people who have
the power to hurt us but who choose not
to I discussed this more in my episode
don't be harmless that the power to do
good has the same root as the power to
inflict harm namely power and a person
who cannot harm like someone who has no

[05:00]
who cannot harm like someone who has no
capacity for harm generally is not
someone who has the power to do much
good and if you can neither help nor
harm someone else then you are
irrelevant at best and at the mercy of
those who can at worst now it's
important to keep in mind that this
capacity to harm doesn't necessarily
have to be physical it can be that but
it doesn't have to be that the capacity
to harm could be Financial or relational
or
emotional and it's the awareness that
someone has the ability to hurt us in
some way that motivates more kindly and
respectful action relative to someone
who we feel will never retaliate against
us this is why countries who participate
in all kinds of treaties and pacts and
alliances still have armies it's not
noble words and good intentions that
keep people on their side of the fence
it's guns and if if you don't have guns

[06:00]
it's guns and if if you don't have guns
you'd better be able to harm others in
some other way like through their money
which is how for example Switzerland has
managed to stay neutral and Sovereign
despite centuries of War being waged
around it so the point is that in order
to be respected by others others must
fear the consequences of their own
aggression and disrespect and this
generally requires having some leverage
over them this could look like being
bigger and stronger or being smarter and
more cunning or enjoying professional
superiority or shaping group opinion or
controlling funding sources or
possessing another person's heart etc
etc in conjunction with the willingness
to lean on that leverage as appropriate
and in general just like an actual
physical lever the bigger the leverage
the less you actually have to lean on it
to make people move this is why Teddy
Roosevelt's motto was to speak softly
and carry a big stick if your stick is

[07:01]
and carry a big stick if your stick is
big enough you don't have to raise your
voice or get angry or make threats or
become aggressive and that's because
your stick will speak for you to receive
respect you need to communicate to
others that there is something in you to
be feared this isn't sufficient to
receive respect but without meeting this
condition respect generally doesn't
occur and this might be why King Solomon
argued that the highest wisdom was to
keep God Commandments and to live in the
fear the fear of the Lord when people do
not fear the consequences of their
actions they behave less wisely so even
wisdom like respect might require
appropriate fear eliminating it entirely
