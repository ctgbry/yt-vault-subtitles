I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is play is
the essence of game now when I say game
I'm talking about game in the colloquial
sense of the ability to effectively
seduce game is the ability to win the
game of Seduction this is something that
many people especially men want to learn
and today I'm going to reveal the secret
at the heart of this Talent so let let's
get to it now game is often
misunderstood sometimes people think
that game is slightly ridiculous it's
gimmicky pickup tactics or tacky
scripted exchanges on the other hand
other people think that game is dark and
malevolent it's Machiavellian and
manipulative in the sense that the man
is attempting to satisfy his sexual
desire at the expense of the woman and
both of these expressions of game

[01:00]
both of these expressions of game
do exist in reality let's not pretend
that they don't however I think that
both really miss the mark with respect
to the heart of game which is play play
is the essence of game so let's talk
about play for a minute play also gets a
bad rap it's something that children do
not mature and serious adults like us
and when it does occur it's something
silly or trivial a bit of entertainment
or a fantastic interlude before we get
back to the important business of life
we think that play only occurs during
clearly defined periods of leisure which
legitimizes the time outside of those
periods as not play ironically playing
at not playing is the most common and
pervasive form of play there is
unfortunately most people are so

[02:00]
unfortunately most people are so
identified with their play they are so
psychologically close to their roles
that they truly don't believe that they
are playing and will become offended at
the suggestion that they are this is
precisely why play is so dangerous and
therefore effective in seduction it's
transgressive in the sense that it can
alter a person's fundamental sense of
reality so what is play play occurs when
a person succeeds in cultivating the
perception of a separate reality within
the overarching reality that is only
accessible to the initiated in which the
objects of play assume a special
significance independent of their
meaning in the overarching
reality consider what a child does
whereas you or I might just see a pencil
which perception will activate all of a
pencil's attendant associations a child
might see a spaceship hurdling through

[03:00]
might see a spaceship hurdling through
the Cosmos on a desperate mission to
save the Galaxy and anyone initiated
into that play will also see the pencil
as a spaceship the ability to cultivate
that Vision in another is the essence of
play now adults don't really see the
spaceship they might play along with the
child but they usually can't really play
with him and because of this they
believe that unlike the child
they exist in objective
reality don't be fooled this is merely
because perceiving a pencil as a
spacecraft is a bridge too far for most
adults it's too overtly Whimsical or
ludicrous on the other hand if I were
say to see you as you most desire in
your heart of hearts to be seen you will
likely join me in that shared reality if
While most other people just see you as
a person like any other I were to see a

[04:01]
a person like any other I were to see a
ravishing beauty or an unappreciated
genius or a spiritual Guru or even just
a capable adult the temptation to join
with me will likely prove greater than
your capacity to resist provided I can
identify the right
desire the reason why this works is that
most people secretly believe these
things about themselves their vanity
Harbors the conviction that they are
exceptional in some regard and they must
constantly contend with the ego injury
of being surrounded by people who in
their own ignorance and self-interest
cannot recognize them as such meeting
someone who sees them not as everyone
else sees them but as they see
themselves means entering into a shared
reality in which things are slightly
more the way they believe they should be
it's meeting someone who also sees the
spaceship this is the essence of play

[05:00]
spaceship this is the essence of play
and it's a very seductive
Prospect if you appreciate the insights
on this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the
description now it's also important to
keep in mind that the best play is
serious play like when we watch a movie
we want the actors to take their roles
seriously if if they were to break the

[06:00]
seriously if if they were to break the
fourth wall or step out of character the
illusion is shattered and we can no
longer be seduced into the world of the
film we may even be annoyed and ask for
our money back and this is why the best
seducers are sincere and the next best
seducers can Fain sincerity
effectively that is if you get the sense
that I don't truly believe that you're a
ravishing beauty or an unappreciated
genius or what have you and that I'm
only playing along with your desired
self-perception like the adult who
humors a child by swearing the pencil is
a spaceship then the spell of Seduction
is broken the play was to obviously play
which prevented you from getting swept
up into the story for play to succeed it
must be serious and sincere that is it
must pretend it isn't
play this is what I mean when I say that
people play at not playing as this is

[07:00]
people play at not playing as this is
the most effective and therefore
desirable kind of play of course it's
important to remember that even when
you're playing and not playing you're
still
playing you are not who you think you
are no book can contain its own author
and no one else is who they think they
are either however the vast majority of
adults are about the business at playing
at who they think they are and doing so
very seriously in sincerely to boot this
can create the appearance of constancy
and reliability which itself can be
seductive to the right person it's
typically someone embroiled in chaos and
drama but it also generally demands the
repression of those aspects of our
personality that are antithetical to
that stability and it's this repressed
material that is seductions favorite
medium by remembering that you are not
who you think you are by remembering
that you have been playing at not

[08:00]
that you have been playing at not
playing you create room for yourself to
maneuver to express different dimensions
of your personality as the situation
warrants this will help make you more
flexible adaptive and ultimately
effective in seduction as you'll be able
to tailor your approach to the
individual in question and by
remembering that other people are not
who they think they are by remembering
that they are repressing aspects of
themselves to maintain the illusion of
playing it not playing you embolden
yourself to tap into those hidden
desires contrary to popular belief most
people want to be seduced they're dying
to be seduced without seduction and the
promise of Escape that play offers life
for most people would just be
discharging an interminable series of
responsibilities until they die it would
be a humorless obligation or a benal
transaction draw the other into a

[09:00]
transaction draw the other into a
separate shared reality that reflects
their vanities or repressed
personalities seriously and sincerely
play at seeing the other as the other
would like to be seen introduce sexual
interest at the right moment and voila
you have the recipe for a successful
seduction and this is important to
remember because it seems to me that
many of the content creators speaking to
men these days on intersexual Dynamics
are inordinately focused on the
importance of being an alpha male it's
not that these guys are wrong expressing
dominance and cultivating an alpha
presentation will absolutely help you
get women it's just not the only way to
seduce which is great news for guys like
me who don't Tower over their
intrasexual
competition the greatest seducers in
history the Don Juans and the covas
weren't underwear models with seven
figure incomes they succeeded not
because they presented as hyper

[10:00]
because they presented as hyper
masculine in fact that can sometimes be
a liability but because they were able
to draw their targets into a separate
reality in which the women in question
believed they could be provided with
what they most desired and more than
anything else what most women desire is
an emotional experience you do not need
ABS or a bank account to do this my guys
what you need is the ability and
willingness to play with me meaning in a
way that is emotionally relevant to a
woman and this more than anything else
is the essence of
game what do you think does this fit
