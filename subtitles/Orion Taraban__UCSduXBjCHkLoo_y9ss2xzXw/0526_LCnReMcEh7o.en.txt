one of the perennial complaints you hear
from women in this department is that
men just want to go straight to
intercourse women love foreplay a lot of
them need foreplay in order to get in
the mood and I don't just mean physical
stimulation though that can obviously
help they want to talk and connect and
cuddle and feel heard and feel cared for
and then they want to build up to
penetration with kissing and touching
and stroking Etc I mean it can take a
lot ofing work just to get women to the
point where they are receptive to sex
and the bad news is that that's how it's
going to be for a lot of them however
the good news is that foreplay is more
than just fumbling around immediately
before intercourse in fact if you do it
right a lot of foreplay occurs outside
the bedroom and hours before the sexual
encounter this means that if you put in
a little effort throughout the day your
woman should be much more open and
receptive to having sex when you're
ready to have it at the end of the night
