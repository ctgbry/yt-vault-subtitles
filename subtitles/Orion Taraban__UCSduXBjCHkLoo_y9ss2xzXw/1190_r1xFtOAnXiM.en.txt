Here's the truth. You can't feel another
person's love. I wish you could, but you
can't. Similarly, you can't feel another
person's fear or another person's pain
or another person's despair. I know that
there are a lot of empaths out there who
believe that they can, but at the very
most, what they're experiencing is some
kind of mirror neuron activation that
stimulates a comparable emotion inside
of them. But I think you'd be hardressed
to prove that those two emotions are
identical given that all physiological
processes like emotions are interpreted
through particular subjectivities with
particular experiences, memories,
expectations, etc. In any case, even
when empathic reactions do occur, the
people in question are still only
experiencing their own emotions. Just
like you could be sitting next to
someone having a full-blown panic
attack, someone who fully believes he's
about to die and not necessarily become
panicked as well, you could be sitting
next to the most loving, affectionate

next to the most loving, affectionate
woman in the world and still not feel an
ounce of that love inside of you. And
that's not because you're a broken,
heartless man. It's because you
literally cannot feel another person's
feelings. You can only feel your own
feelings. That means that if you want to
feel love, you've got to feel your own
love coming out of you. That's the only
way you can do it. Love others and
experience that love coming out of you.
