i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
practice enjoying your life
at first blush this might sound a bit
weird
why would you need to practice enjoying
your life that seems like something that
most people do naturally and that could
very well be the case however i'm
talking specifically to folks who tend
to be workaholics
these are type a individuals high
achieving hard-working successful folks
who are actually very good at delaying
gratification in the service of
achieving their goals
at this point in my career
my active clients have a collective net
worth of well over 100 million dollars
and i've worked with a number of very
very successful men
uh later on in their lives
by the time they're more or less forced
to retire in their late 60s or early 70s
they have everything they could
materially desire a big house a yacht
investment properties around the world

investment properties around the world
fancy cars debt-free education for their
kids the works
and they think finally i get to enjoy my
golden years in rest and relaxation
and they spend about a week lying in a
deck chair by a pool doing nothing
before they want to rip their faces off
they just don't know what to do with
themselves
and i think it's because they haven't
practiced enjoying their lives
instead they've spent the last 50 years
practicing the delay of gratification
and now that they're at the end of their
career and they're expected to actually
experience gratification
they
don't really know how to do it
it's uncomfortable it feels alien
strange
and usually these guys kind of
quasi return to the workplace they can
only semi-retire because all they really
know how to do is work
so it's important for folks to practice
enjoying their lives such that when they
eventually transition out of their

[02:01]
eventually transition out of their
careers it's not a tormenting bardo but
rather a state that they can luxuriate
in and take pleasure in because they've
practiced doing so along the way
it's important to practice enjoying your
life because you otherwise might not be
able to when you actually have the
opportunity
