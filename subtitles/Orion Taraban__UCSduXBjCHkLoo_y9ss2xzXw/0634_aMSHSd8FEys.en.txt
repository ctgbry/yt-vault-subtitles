the average age of the sexiest man alive
I think is
42 do you know what the age cohorts were
that they were uh taking data from no I
don't the reason why I ask is cuz when I
think of like the mid2 year-old women
that I know like none of them would look
at a 50-year-old and be like oh yeah
that guy's hot like that's what they
always say yeah right right you think
they're lying maybe they are maybe
they're not you know the thing about
talking about the sexual Marketplace and
how men and women behave inside of it is
that we can at best sort of make
statistical you know observations and
any statistical observation the
population level will be disproved at
the individual level right so you could
say that women generally respond better
to men who are taller and higher status
and older and you'll always have a woman
who might say well that doesn't work for
me I don't care anything about those
things as if that doesn't validate the
population level observation right right
but it is true it's like on a on a
individual level it's anybody's guess
