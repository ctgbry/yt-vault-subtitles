are sex workers kind of becoming
normalized now because I saw like a a
longtime friend the other day he's like
oh I'm dating only fans girl so it seems
like the institution of marriage is kind
of going down you know the the the rise
of sex work like what's your take on all
this stuff well it's interesting I was
doing a conversation with James ston on
soft white underbelly thought I was
tossing him a softball I said what do we
call it when we exchange resources for
sex I was obviously reaching for
prostitution and he responded with
marriage the idea that traditional
marriage is not an exchange of resour
ources protection and provision for
let's say sexual access Andor
exclusivity is absurd like that's one of
the fundamental components of
traditional marriage it's probably one
of the greatest resource allocation
programs on the history of the planet
like it beats communism by far because
it's existed in far more different parts
of the world for far longer I think that
this can be taken to extremes and it can
become let's say mercenary just like
some guys some players can get lost just
in the game in the conquest
