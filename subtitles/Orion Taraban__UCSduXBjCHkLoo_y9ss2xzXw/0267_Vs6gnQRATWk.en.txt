i'm dr o'ryan taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
love your neighbor as yourself
so this is one of the most important
christian principles according to jesus
himself
and i think there is a spiritual truth
to this pronouncement that is often
overlooked
but before i get into it please remember
to like this video and subscribe to the

now i think that this pronouncement love
your neighbor as yourself is usually
interpreted as a commandment
this is kind of the golden rule the new
way of doing things that takes
precedence over the old way of doing
things
the reduction of the ten commandments
the old testament into the single
commandment of the new
the idea here is that this is something
people should and ought to do and
certainly you can see it from that angle

[01:00]
certainly you can see it from that angle
however i think there's another way of
looking at this particular verse namely
as an observation of a high spiritual
reality
to make this plainer to see we simply
need to include the implied subject
when we do so the commandment becomes an
observation
you love your neighbor as you love
yourself
and i think there is a real spiritual
truth to this that as you love yourself
you love your neighbor and as you love
your neighbor you love yourself the two
things are intimately connected
and i think this makes sense coming from
jesus because way behind the scenes and
from a very high spiritual perspective
the other is yourself
it's hard to see this in our everyday
consciousness however at a very high
level you are your neighbor and your
neighbor is you and so we really
shouldn't expect a difference in how we
love ourselves and how we love our
neighbors

[02:00]
neighbors
this understanding also suggests a
corollary
that we can only love others to the
extent
that we love ourselves that it's not
possible to love another person in a
manner or extent beyond which we are
capable of loving ourselves
and this makes sense from a
psychological perspective when we are
not treated how we would like to be
treated by important others there is a
tendency in our nature to believe that
this is due to some failing on our part
and these negative internalizations can
long outlive the relationship that
produce them
however it's important to understand
that how we were treated by others was a
reflection of how these others felt
about themselves
in that moment you were loved in
congruence with how those others loved
themselves because according to our
corollary it would not have been
possible for them to love you any better
hopefully that makes sense did you
