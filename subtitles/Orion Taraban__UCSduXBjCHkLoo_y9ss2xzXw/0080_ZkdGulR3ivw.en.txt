i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
assume you've already won
this is a belief i try to put into my
mind whenever i enter into a difficult
conversation or a delicate negotiation
it makes me think of an excellent scene
in an old movie called searching for
bobby fisher which is a fictional
account of a young chess prodigy
in this scene the protagonist is playing
in the championship match of a
tournament against his rival
the protagonist is able to look at the
board and recognize that he has
checkmate in 15 moves
now out of sympathy for his opponent the
protagonist offers his rival a draw
however because his rival cannot see
that far ahead
he contemptuously dismisses the offer
that said the rival's inability to see
the reality of his own situation doesn't
change that reality one bit
so the match plays out along the
predetermined lines of action and the
protagonist eventually secures the

protagonist eventually secures the
victory that had already been
established
now once the protagonist recognized the
path to checkmate there was no urgency
in his action
there was no anger or irritation in his
demeanor on the contrary he seemed to
feel pity or compassion for his opponent
who was doomed to lose in light of that
recognition
at times you might find yourself talking
to folks who don't understand that
they've already lost
however if you can approach these
situations with the attitude that you
can see clearly the pathway to victory
that in some sense you've already won
and the other person just hasn't
realized it yet
then the fear and uncertainty are
removed from the exchange
and when this occurs you can then
calmly and compassionately
move through the required steps to
obtain the predestined outcome
which can make that outcome more likely
to occur even in situations where the
result isn't as guaranteed as a chess
match

match
this belief allows me to approach
difficult conversations with an attitude
of confidence and serenity
both of which are highly conducive to
success
