I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why 50 50
relationships don't work
okay so this is a very common belief
that is prevalent in Western Society
namely that relationships between men
and women should be 50 50. it's equal
people get as much as they give and it
creates the basis for a fulfilling and
sustainable long-term relationship right
well not really well this might sound
good it doesn't really work in practice
for a whole host of reasons over the
next eight minutes I will explain one of
these reasons to you here we go
at least when it comes to their sexual
relationships assuming they are in a
relationship with a man they are
attracted to the vast majority of women
would not have a problem with an unequal
split provided that it favors her
I don't know any woman who would

[01:01]
I don't know any woman who would
continue to work for the next 40 years
on Purely ideological grounds if her
husband were willing to completely
bankroll her lifestyle and I don't see
anything wrong with that
they might not all Express gratitude but
they probably wouldn't bulk at the
arrangement
now
nor would most women have a problem with
a 90-10 split or an 80 20 split or a 70
30 split which I personally think is the
best arrangement or even a 60 40 split
however we're really getting to a
woman's limit when we hit that 50 50
split and we know that because there are
very few women who would feel good about
even a 40-60 split if they're the ones
assuming the majority of the expenses
and responsibilities do you see
what that means is that for the majority
of women 50 50 is the furthest they're
willing to go
50 50 is a stretch

[02:02]
50 50 is a stretch
they're not signing up for relationships
where they assume the majority of the
expense and responsibility 50 50 is
their limit
now let's put that aside for the moment
and approach the idea of equality from
the perspective of men
if I were to ask 100 men what it would
look like to fairly distribute expenses
and responsibilities between two people
I guarantee that 100 out of those 100
men would answer
you split them 50 50. and that's because
50 50 is the [ __ ] definition of
equality do you see however in reality
men have largely resigned themselves to
assuming a greater share of the expenses
and responsibilities in relationships
with women not because it's fair not
because it's equal but because that's
just sort of the cost of doing business
as Eddie Murphy said there is no romance
without Finance

[03:00]
without Finance
one way or the other you gotta pay to
play

really appreciate your support
so now we're well positioned to
understand why 50 50 relationships
between men and women don't work in
practice it's very simple
50 50 is where Men start
on the other hand 50 50 is where women
end up
like there are women who are willing to
do 50 50 but they are outnumbered by the
number of women who would be happy with
an 80 20 split
and there are men willing to do 80 20
but they are outnumbered by The Men Who
would be happy with a 50 50 split

[04:01]
would be happy with a 50 50 split
in a 50 50 split the woman is giving the
most she is willing to give with respect
to the relationship while the man is
giving the least he is practically
willing to give with respect to the
relationship
if a car were being sold this would be
equivalent to a negotiated price that is
the most the buyer is willing to spend
and the least the seller is willing to
discount
irrespective of the actual value of that
car do you think both the buyer and the
seller are going to be equally happy
about that transaction
absolutely not the buyer is going to be
grumbling and the seller is going to
feel peachy keen and that's just one
transaction imagine living that
transaction day in and day out week
after week month after month year after
year that's unsustainable

[05:00]
year that's unsustainable
and it's not sustainable due to the
objective equality or inequality of the
transaction whatever that might be
it's not sustainable due to the feelings
associated with the relative allocation
of resources it may be fair but it
doesn't feel Fair
and this is partly due to Market forces
a woman could likely find a man who
would be willing to assume more than
equal share of the expenses and
responsibilities so she can plausibly
feel like she's getting a bad deal at a
50 50 split
people feel pretty schmucky when they
buy something a week before a sale
even though they were apparently happy
enough to part with more money for the
same product the week previous which
means that they felt it was a fair
transaction at that price point they
don't like the fact that they could have
paid less for the same thing our
conception of value is not really
anchored at the objective or inherent

[06:02]
anchored at the objective or inherent
value of a thing whatever that is it's
almost entirely determined by the price
points of similar transactions
now I'm explaining this not because I
believe that things should be different
I'm explaining this because that's the
way it is I know it can be hard for men
to understand this but For Better or For
Worse
50 50 is a stretch for most women
and very few women consider going Beyond
50 50 as a realistic possibility
on the other hand the vast majority of
men understand the Practical necessity
of going Beyond 50 50. this creates the
emotional conditions that amount to a
woman feeling like she's spending more
that she has to
for at an equal allocation of expenses
and responsibility
equal doesn't feel Fair which is why it
doesn't tend to work

[07:00]
doesn't tend to work
and personally I'm not into 50 50
relationships I'll just put it out there
I work best in relationships where there
is a clear power imbalance
and part of the cost of a power
imbalance that favors me is that I
assume greater responsibility for the
material aspects of that relationship
it's not equal but it's fair
and an unequal relationship that feels
Fair will be much more sustainable than
an equal relationship that feels unfair
that's just the way it is
and as long as the Privileges are
commensurate with the responsibilities
then the relationship will continue to
feel fair to the individuals involved
irrespective of the actual allocation of
expenses and responsibilities does that
make sense
