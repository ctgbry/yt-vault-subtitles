i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychex
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is how to confront a friend
this is actually very very difficult to
do
the reason is that when we're in close
relationships with friends and loved
ones
we often depend on that relationship
both emotionally
and instrumentally in a lot of different
ways and when a loved one begins to
manifest
problematic behavior one that is
corroding the quality of that
relationship
we can feel reluctant to confront the
other out of
fear of losing the relationship so
sometimes we end up
enabling behaviors out of a desire not
to lose a relationship
that is let's say mostly good but is
becoming increasingly problematic
that said i think it's important to call
people out on their behavior
especially if those behaviors left
unchecked
would naturally bring about the

[01:01]
would naturally bring about the
degradation of the relationship
all by themselves so let's take a simple
example like
flakiness flakiness is one of my
personal pet peeves i hate it
and throughout the years some of my
friends and acquaintances have
demonstrated flaky behavior
one way i've learned to deal with this
is by calling them out on this behavior
early on in the process by revealing
what the impact of their flakiness
is on my willingness to continue the
relationship
and this is especially powerful if this
impact
is kind of an organic natural emotional
response
so for instance a friend makes plans
with me
and at the last moment he flakes so i'll
call him up and say something like hey
man
i've noticed that you've been flaky the
last couple times we've made plans
and i just want you to know that your
flakiness makes me more reluctant to
make plans with you which
sidebar is the natural human emotional
response
when people consistently cancel plans

[02:00]
when people consistently cancel plans
you come to not trust
that they're going to follow through and
so you kind of organically begin to pull
back
and this of course isn't news to anyone
it's likely exactly how the flaky person
feels
when someone consistently cancels plans
on him
so you just share with them how their
behavior makes you feel you don't come
down heavy saying things like people
should keep their word or
you need to get your act together
instead just say something like the
natural consequence of you doing this
is that i don't really want to make
plans with you moving forward
and that's concerning to me because i
like our relationship i value
our friendship and i'd like us to
continue but i've noticed that i'm kind
of starting to pull back and withdraw
from you
as i'm often left with the fuzzy end of
the lollipop is this something you're
open to changing
at this point if you succeeded in
confronting your friend with i
statements
talking about your own subjective
experience non-judgmentally
instead of coming down with a lot of
blame and shame most people
are going to be like yeah you're right

[03:00]
are going to be like yeah you're right
okay my bad i'll try harder
and then you can see if their behavior
actually changes moving forward because
people can say whatever they want in
that moment the real apology has changed
behavior
and that's kind of how you go about the
business of confronting a friend you
speak about the natural
emotional effect the behavior has on you
and you confess that it's compromising
your ability to participate
authentically in the relationship okay
i hope that's helpful if you have a
