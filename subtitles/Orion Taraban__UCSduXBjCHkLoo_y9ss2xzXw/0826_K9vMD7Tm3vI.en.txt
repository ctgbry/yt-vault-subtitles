you have to also understand that if
there is this inequality at the heart of
transaction which is the basis of
relationship that inequality in
relationships is the rule it's not the
exception and on some level humans are
only equal in the abstract and that's a
useful concept because it keeps Society
from going to off the rails but if you
look at people and you listen to people
you'll see that they are very unequal in
terms of their capabilities in terms of
their appearances in terms of their
status in terms of in pretty much any
way that you'd like to quantify and
those are the things that people
consider when they think about entering
into a relationship with person a versus
any other you know person B right they
have to make their decision based on
something that they can observe or
perceive and anything that's the same
between two options is irrelevant
because you're going to get it both ways
and so people use inquality facilitate
decision- making they need people to be
unequal or else anybody would be just as
good as anybody else which is clearly
not how people act in the game of meting
and dating so people are using
inequality to facilitate decision-
making
