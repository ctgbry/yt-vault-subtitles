I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living jury psychology and
the topic of today's short talk is women
have more options in the sexual
Marketplace
this is a follow-up to an episode I
released a few weeks ago called what is
the sexual Marketplace so I would
encourage you to listen to that one
first if you haven't done so already
in short I describe the sexual
Marketplace as a sort of dock or peer
where the men go to build a ship learn
to sail and plot a course and where
women go to examine the quarters test
his ability and review his manifest if
both the captain and the passenger agree
the two can get on with the voyage and
this is true to a point but it is in
fact a partial explanation now before I
explain why this is a partial
explanation please remember to like this

nothing and it's how you can support me
and my mission to deliver free high
quality content to the world so thanks
for your help
now here's the thing the fact of the
matter is that women don't have to be
passengers
that might have been true 100 years ago
but it's certainly not true today in
fact women are supported encouraged and
in many respects incentivized to to
become their own captains
to build ships learn to sail and plot a
course
I'm not saying this is good or bad it is
what it is
and I can certainly understand why women
might want this as a man I would never
want to be a passenger on somebody
else's ship it just goes against my very
nature like the core of my being
furthermore I can appreciate that in
some parts of the world there aren't
that many good captains and I would much
rather strike my own path than get on a
rickety boat that isn't going to go

[02:01]
rickety boat that isn't going to go
where I want it to go anyway so I get it
on the whole I think it's good when
people have options so I have no problem
with women wanting to be captains
the issue is that this optionality
hasn't extended to men
still only have one option if they want
to be on a boat they gotta build it
themselves on the other hand women have
two options they can be a passenger or
they can build their own boat
hence the title of the episode women
have more options in the sexual
Marketplace in today's world it's
perfectly acceptable for a woman to say
she wants to be a passenger I want to
find a man get married and be supported
while raising his children that's an
appropriate and acceptable path for a
woman she could also say I want to have
a career Forge my own path and explore
my options that's also an acceptable
path for a woman
but there's never been a place in the
world in all of human history where it

[03:02]
world in all of human history where it
has been acceptable either to society or
more to the point to women
for a man's goal in life to be finding a
woman to support him while raising her
kids
and just for the record I'm not
complaining about this because this
really isn't an attractive option for
many men modern feminism would like to
liberate men from the gender-based
shackles of tradition by normalizing
stay-at-home dad as a vocation because
that's their idea of equality men can
have careers so women can have careers
women can raise kids so men can raise
kids it's equal but only superficially
on a deeper level it's not equal at all
because modern men don't have multiple
attractive options for them whereas
modern women do it is what it is the

[04:01]
modern women do it is what it is the
upshot is that women no longer need a
man to supply them with a ship they can
be their own captains and while this
solves a number of problems it also
creates a host of new ones and I'll
discuss one of the most significant of
these newly created problems in my next
episode so stay tuned what do you think
