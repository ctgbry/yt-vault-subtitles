I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
standoff between men and women so in
today's sexual Marketplace men and women
are engaged in a kind of Mexican
standoff in which neither one wants to
put their gun down first consequently
there's been this standstill that has
led to a significant reduction in all
kinds of sexual relationships over the
past 10 years let's examine why this
might be the case it kind of looks like
this women today look at men and they're
just kind of
disappointed they think there are no
good men anymore and the men who do
engage with them they just seem to want
sex without commitment from their
perspective this would mean settling for
a lot less than they think they're worth
since they believe that dealing with
such men would be at a perceived loss
they would rather just remain single and
wait until they meet a man who will give
them more of what they want by the same

[01:00]
them more of what they want by the same
token men today look at women and
they're just sort of
bewildered they think there are no good
women anymore and the women who do
engage with them just seem to want the
moon they're demanding and entitled and
delusional they seem to want so much and
offer so little in return from their
perspective this would mean paying a lot
more than they think they should since
they believe that dealing with such
women would be a perceived loss they
would rather just remain single and wait
until they meet a woman who will give
them more of what they want and that's
kind of the situation both sides want
the other to move in the direction of
its preferences women want men to give
them more of what they want or no sex
men want women to give them more of what
they want or no commitment or resources
in the standoff both sides want the
other to put its gun down first and

[02:01]
other to put its gun down first and
surrender its demands and neither seems
willing to do so this is because both
sides believe they are being cheated in
the Contemporary sexual Marketplace and
the crazy thing is they're both right
both men and women are getting less of
what they most want from each other and
the upshot is the decrease we've seen in
all kinds of sexual
relationships more men and women are
deciding it's better just to remain
single
now I've already discussed how we got
into this situation in an episode called
appropriately enough how did we get here
it's actually one of my all-time
favorite episodes so please please do
check it out if you haven't done so
already in any case I'm not going to
talk about how we got into that mess
today today I'm going to talk about how
it's going to get resolved and I'm going
to explain this resolution using a
historical anecdote from the Roman
Empire it kind of goes like this along
long time ago there was a man named

[03:02]
long time ago there was a man named
Marcus linius crus crus was not only the
richest man in the Roman Empire but he
was one of the wealthiest men who has
ever lived in the history of the world
and one of the ways he got so rich was
by controlling the fire department in
ancient Rome when a fire broke out he
would show up at the scene with his
Brigade he'd have his ladders and his
pumps and his hoses all prepped and
ready for action and
do nothing he do nothing
he just stand there watch The House burn
for a
while eventually the owner of the house
would Panic what's the matter with you
do something are you just going to stand
there put the fire out and crus would
respond you know that's a pretty nice
house you have there I mean it's
obviously not in great condition at the
present moment but you can see that it
was quite a fine property in its time
would you take 50 dinari for it

[04:00]
would you take 50 dinari for it
and when the owner heard this he
typically flew into a
rage are you crazy I paid 100 dinari for
this property I can't sell it for half
of its value who do you think you are
this is the most insulting offer I've
ever received in my life just just do
your job do better and put the fire
out and crus would respond oh I beg your
pardon I I certainly didn't mean to
offend you and in any case I'm sure
you're right
and he would go back to doing nothing
he'd just let the House burn for a
little while
longer and then he would
say my apologies but I'm afraid my last
offer was a bit overzealous as you can
see the property has deteriorated of
late would you mind terribly accepting
40 dinari for
it and this is when instead of getting
angry most homeowners got

[05:00]
angry most homeowners got
quiet because they finally understood
what was going on Cris was going to let
their house burned to the ground unless
they sold and they would receive nothing
for their pile of ashes and this was
true this was what happened Crassus
would only direct his fire department to
put out the fires on properties that he
owned otherwise he would just focus on
containing the Blaze and the longer the
house burnt the less he would pay for it
smart owners understood this from the
get-go and accepted the offer of 50
dinari less intelligent owners gener
generally needed the second offer to
understand what was happening that
things were going to get worse before
they got better either way that
homeowner was going to lose his house
that day the only question was whether
or not he would receive anything in
compensation for it

[06:01]
compensation for it
at this point most homeowners
begrudgingly sold the house for 40 and
crus would order the Brigade to put out
the fire he would then either keep the
property increasing his real estate
holdings or sell the property back to
the original owner for tce what he just
paid turning a nice little profit and
this is how crus became the richest man
in Rome obviously not a very scrupulous
business model as he exploited other
people's crises as his opportunities but
that's how it was crass has understood
how the standoff played out as a
function of time now before I go any

just discussed are below in the
description okay let's get back to
it now let's return to the standoff in
the sexual Marketplace between men and
women ladies I'm talking to you what you
have to understand is that your house is
on fire whether you want it to be or not
your house is on fire by this I mean
that your sexual Marketplace value like
the value of that real estate will only
go down as a function of time that is
because the cat decides what milk is
good whether you like it or not your
value is determined by men's perception
of you just like men's value is
determined by your perception of them
and that perception of you is
fundamentally anchored to your physical
ATT activeness I really really really

[08:02]
ATT activeness I really really really
wish this weren't the case both for your
sakes and for ours I wish it weren't the
case for you because it sucks to be
judged primarily by your physical
appearance and a lot of interesting and
important attributes go unnoticed when
unpaired with physical attractiveness
and I wish it weren't the case for us
because we're just so stupid about the
extent to which we value this attribute
and this overvaluation can produce all
kinds of suboptimal relationship
outcomes however it's just kind of
hardwired into us so you have to
appreciate that it's not going anywhere
anytime
soon so if your sexual Marketplace
values are anchored to your physical
attractiveness which only tends to
decrease as a function of time then most
women just like the homeowner in our
anecdote would be best served by
accepting an offer sooner as opposed to
later in many cases you will not receive

[09:01]
later in many cases you will not receive
a better offer than you do today which
is why I say that women's default mode
is to act and if you bulk at the offer
because like the homeowner you believe
it is too low then men will
just
wait that's the standoff and your house
will burn for a little while longer in
the vast majority of cases the next
offer won't be as high as the last one
you have to understand that if your
house is on fire the rational decision
is to sell as quickly as possible so
that's the resolution of our Mexican
standoff in the beginning the positions
might be equal women say to men your
offer is too low give us more or we're
comfortable being alone and men say to
women your price is too high except less
or we're comfortable being
alone but what happens as time passes

[10:00]
alone but what happens as time passes
just like in the anecdote the value
proposition changes differentially as a
function of time on average and as a
function of time men's sexual
Marketplace value as reckoned by women
increases and women's sexual Marketplace
value as reckoned by men decreases this
means that the next offer women receive
might not be as high as the last now
some homeowners didn't sell their house
to cres
they were insulted by his lowball offer
and they were infuriated by his business
practices his offer hurt their pride
they would rather the House burn to Ash
than allow him to get his hands on it
for less than what they thought it was
worth at the end of the day they had no
house and they had no
money but at least they had their pride
the pride of not selling to an
unscrupulous businessman

[11:00]
unscrupulous businessman
of course the only they only thought
cis' offer was too low because they were
anchored to the value of what the house
once was I.E when they first purchased
it not to the value of what the house
would soon be I.E when it is a
smoldering Rubble they thought that an
offer of 40 dinari would be a loss of 60
from what it once was not a gain of 40
on what it would soon
be and their pride objected to that
perceived loss this is why I say that
women's greatest enemy is their pride
pride prevents people from selling at a
perceived loss however the longer they
wait the greater the perceived loss
tends to be this means there are really
only two strategies here if you're
committed to going all the way and
seeing your house potentially burn to
the ground without receiving any

[12:00]
the ground without receiving any
compensation for your loss which is
absolutely your right then don't budge
don't ever move not a single
inch
however be serious with yourself if
you're not actually willing to see the
standoff all the way to its ultimate
conclusion if you're not willing to see
your house reduced to ashes then you
should lower your gun as quickly as
possible and accept the offer because
the longer you wait the more your house
will burn and the worse the next offer
will be just like escaping the sunken
cost fallacy you have to let go of the
past in order to save your
future something to
