I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is a feast
of
crumbs so today I'm going to explain why
so many decent guys end up in
unsatisfactory relationships typically
in their late 20s or early 30s I've
heard this story over and over and over
again in my consultations with men so I
wanted to address it on the channel in
order for the message to reach a larger
audience and hopefully do more good so
I'm just going to be real with you guys
most of you are
unattractive it is what it is I know
that because most men are unattractive
and as a consequence of that most men
receive very little if any positive
attention from the opposite sex this is
one of the reasons why it can be so

[01:00]
one of the reasons why it can be so
difficult to be a young man your smv
will likely never be lower and to make
matters worse the smv of the women
around you will likely never be higher
the only young guys who have a real
chance of leveling the playing field are
the physically attractive ones tall
handsome athletic Etc this isn't true
forever but it is true for young men
which is a big part of why so many young
men are disaffected and hopeless when
when it comes to women in any case while
women can be just as superficial as men
can be when it comes to looks and both
genders are typically superficial in
direct proportion to their perceived
optionality women tend to be not so
monom maniacally focused on physical
appearance in fact a lot of what makes a
man attractive to a woman has to do with
his life style his status his wealth his
Network his emotional maturity and so on

[02:00]
Network his emotional maturity and so on
and this gives men an opening in the
sexual Marketplace the issue is that any
one of these things can take a great
deal of time to develop to any
appreciable degree so the men who
haven't hit the genetic Lottery can't
hope to compete successfully
overnight however if they haven't made
bad choices in their 20s and if they've
been working diligently on cultivating
that lifestyle to building their ship to
use my metaphor then the game starts to
change
in the late
20s and it's typically right around this
time that these decent hardworking
unattractive dudes begin to receive
their first taste of female interest and
they are completely unprepared for this
like they may not have received any kind
of positive attention from a woman since
their grandma told them they looked
handsome in The Tuxedo they rented for
junior prom and now suddenly and without

[03:01]
junior prom and now suddenly and without
having made any significant changes
within their own subjective experience
they are now receiving interest from
women as I discuss in my book this is
because the age of 30 is the Turning of
the tide it's when the average man's
sexual Marketplace value exceeds the
average woman's sexual Marketplace value
for the very first time her looks are
starting to decline but his fortunes are
on the rise a hardworking man with a
good job an attractive income no
children never married is a good
provider option a woman might not have
given him a Second Glance 10 years ago
but now with the last vestages of her
youth fading away her priorities have
shifted sure he's not the most
attractive guy but listen to me
carefully to certain women at certain
stages of their
lives that's a
plus why when women actually start to

[04:01]
plus why when women actually start to
get serious about settling down they
often don't Target attractive men this
is because attractive men are too hard
to
Wrangle they enjoy too much optionality
and they either are not willing to pay
the costs associated with entering into
a quiet domestic life and or the
particular woman proposing said life
does not represent a sufficiently
attractive option for them so when women
are really serious about getting married
they often Target less attractive men
because boy oh boy are they easy
pickings if you appreciate the insights
on this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice

[05:02]
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook Audi book and
paperback formats the links are in the
description I see this all the time I
call it the Feast of
crumbs in which men get like the
smallest hint of affection and interest
and suddenly she's the one and on some
level why wouldn't she be she might
literally be the first unrelated woman
who has ever been nice to him it's very
easy to spot these guys because their
description of their woman's Behavior
doesn't match up with their tone like
their tone is so adoring and effusive
but what they're describing is frankly
just run-of-the-mill girlfriend Behavior

[06:00]
just run-of-the-mill girlfriend Behavior
stuff that you can reasonably expect
from anyone you're in a relationship
with it kind of sounds like this you
know Orion I get it I get that there are
a lot of problems
but she treats me so well like for my
birthday last month she got me a
cake and my name was spelled right on
the cake and everything like no typos at
all and the cake had candles
and she lit the
candles and after I blew them out she
she cut a piece of the cake from me I
didn't even have to ask like I feel she
really cares about me and I'm worried I
might not find this again and it's like
okay dude let's not discount the effort
she made it's good that your girlfriend
remembered your birthday and she did
something to make you feel special we
don't have to invalidate
that but let's be honest

[07:01]
that's kind of standard girlfriend
Behavior like you should reasonably
expect your girlfriend to remember your
birthday however that doesn't
necessarily mean that you make a
lifetime commitment to a woman who
bought you a cake you know what I'm
saying those two things don't match up
they're not in the same ballpark they're
not even the same [ __ ]
sport but because so many men have gone
so long without any interest or
affection or kindness from women the
slightest whiff of that can make some
guys feel like they've hit the jackpot
and of course because they've never had
it before they're worried that they will
never have it again and this scarcity
mentality often motivates them to invest
in women when it's probably not in their
best interest to do so now some of you
might think well Orion what's the
problem these women are looking to get
married and have kids just like me they
might want the attractive guy but they

[08:01]
might want the attractive guy but they
can't get him so on some level his loss
is my game what's the issue here turns
out there are a lot of issues here but
in the interest of time I'm going to
discuss just the biggest one namely
these men get used now to be fair these
men often participate joyfully and
enthusiastically in their own
exploitation but they are used
nonetheless they are being used by these
women for certain things and once they
receive these things they make
themselves
redundant and
unnecessary in the absence of real
attraction these relationships are
basically perpetually maintained by
giving the woman what she wants it's
like happy wife happy
life isn't completely wrong it's just
the refrain of less attract Ive men who

[09:01]
the refrain of less attract Ive men who
understand on some level that their
woman isn't going to stick around if the
provision of value dries
up these men are basically hostages who
continually have to pay their own Ransom
or suffer the consequences like I say in
the book no one continues to pay the
plumber before the toilet is unclogged
the plumber is in very high demand
however after the clog has been revealed
resolved there is really no reason to
keep the plumber around and you
certainly don't keep giving him
money I've seen this happen again and
again a guy will receive interest from a
woman sometimes even an attractive woman
and he'll be over the moon because she's
showing him more attention and
consideration than he's ever experienced
in his life it's often just crumbs of
affection but that's more than he's ever
tasted and he'll give her the ring and

[10:00]
tasted and he'll give her the ring and
the house and the kids he might even
smugly think that he's a good man for
doing so because apparently the other
Jokers she was previously involved with
weren't willing to do so though a
prudent man would spend some time
considering why that might be the
case the issue is that at some point
he's going to run out of things to give
her and once that point is reached that
woman is only going to stay out of a
deep authentic and abiding emotional
connection a connection that's greatly
facilitated by attraction which on some
level is the felt experience that you
can't do better and a woman who doesn't
feel that way will take the last thing
you're in a position to give her a
severance
package that's the last bit of utility
that guy can potentially provide for her
I've seen this play out hundreds of

[11:00]
I've seen this play out hundreds of
times so my dudes that's the danger of
getting involved with a woman who is not
very attracted to you you delay your
emotional evisceration by 10 years 15
years if you're lucky and hopefully this
is a powerful reminder to invest in your
own attractiveness we can't all be
supermodels but we can all be more
attractive than we currently are and the
more attractive you are the more
attention and interest you will receive
from the opposite sex and this
experience and optionality will help you
to not get carried away whenever another
person shows you the smallest signs of
affection keep your feet on the ground
and make good choices gentlemen because
no one will care if you
bleed what do you think does this fit
