i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is
don't be harmless don't be harmless
look the basis of respect
in any relationship whether it's
personal or professional
the basis of respect is fear
we don't like to talk about this but
that's the basis of respect
that i'm afraid potentially of
what this other person could do
to negatively impact my life i'm afraid
of being rejected
i'm afraid that if i escalate this it
will lead to a physical altercation
i'm afraid of being fired this person
has some power whether it's a physical
presence
whether it's authority over me within a
certain relationship
or hierarchy this person has the power
to create harm

[01:01]
to create harm
that's the basis of respect
what makes a good person a good person
is not being harmless
it's being it's cultivating the capacity
for harm
and simply choosing not to exercise it
or choosing to exercise it only under
very restrictive conditions
it's like think about all the
superheroes
that exist in our popular culture it's
like take superman
that guy could become an unstoppable
super villain
he's got he's nearly indestructible he
can fly around at the speed of sound
nothing stops him he can shoot laser
beams and heat waves it's like
that guy could take over the world in a
in a week
if he wanted to and he simply chooses
not to because of his moral or ethical
principles his values
but if he didn't have all of those
powers which could have the potential to
create harm for other people

[02:01]
create harm for other people
he wouldn't be a hero and he certainly
wouldn't command respect
a person who is harmless cannot create
good the inability to do harm
does not make you good it just makes you
harmless
it's like a rabbit a rabbit
is a prey animal it doesn't create a lot
of problems for people but it doesn't
create a lot of good either
so those people the rabbits
they the harmless individuals they often
struggle with feeling disrespected in
their relationships well that's why it's
like what's the basis of respect what
could they do
that would command that respect what's
the power that they have
so if we want to be successful in our
relationships
in our lives we want to cultivate our
power which is
paradoxically our capacity to do harm
because the same capacity to do harm
when it's applied in a different context

[03:01]
when it's applied in a different context
or in a different aim actually creates
good
so it you know that's something to keep
in mind
don't try to be harmless don't try to be
nice don't try to be agreeable
cultivate that side of yourself that has
the potential
to create real harm for others and
choose to use it
beneficially because then you actually
create value you actually create
goodness
so that's my thought on the matter uh
please like and subscribe we'll talk
more in future episodes
