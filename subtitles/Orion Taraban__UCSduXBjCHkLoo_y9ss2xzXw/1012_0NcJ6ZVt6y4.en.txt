A lot of pornography
is wish fulfillment. And if you look at
a lot of the pornography that men use,
it's very transgressive. It's
transgressive in a couple ways. It could
be actually violent or aggressive. Some
of it can border on non-consensual or
be, you know, in the play of it being
non-consensual. Or it's just really
aggressive and the guy is just drilling
her. Or it can be, let's say, socially
transgressive, which is that this is
taboo. We shouldn't be doing this. these
boundaries shouldn't be crossed and yet
they're being crossed. So in both cases,
the wish fulfillment of transgressive
pornography is power. It's I'm powerful
enough to take what I want and to not
suffer the consequences. I'm powerful
enough that women who shouldn't be
[ __ ] are me cuz they can't resist me
and they're going to suffer the
consequences. The wish fulfillment of
most pornography of men is power and
that's because most men are powerless.
When you look at the fantasies of
powerful men, it's not the same as the

[01:00]
powerful men, it's not the same as the
vast swath of male humanity. You get the
opposite is that they want to experience
what it's like to be abashed and
humiliated and put in their place and to
be potentially dominated. Again, this
isn't a universal thing, but it does
tend to that direction where people want
to experience what they what they
haven't experienced yet, what they don't
get in other parts of their lives.
