i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to show your partner respect
now to begin with i'm going to
acknowledge that respect is a tricky
word because we can use it to signify
several different concepts in this
episode i'm not talking about respect in
the form of basic human dignity for
others like we should respect all people
i'm talking about respect in the form of
esteem or admiration as in we respect
certain people for their effort skill or
ability i'm talking about earned respect
today all right
and the ability to show your partner
respect when your partner does something
respectable is extremely important in
relationships if for no other reason
then respect is typically a reinforcer
so communicating respect to your partner
increases the likelihood that they will
manifest that respectable behavior in

[01:00]
manifest that respectable behavior in
the future which will likely benefit you
as well
now to understand how to show your
partner respect
you need to watch espn
has respect down pat
and what do i mean by that
okay
look at the word respect
re again
spect
look at as in spectacle
respect literally means to look at again
and again and again and that's what espn
does
they show the same play again and again
and again and again from different
angles in slow motion from above from
below in reverse they can't get enough
of it and what are the commentators
doing they don't just say
nice or that was good job
the whole time they're making very
specific and accurate observations about

specific and accurate observations about
what they're looking at moment by moment
you see how he pivots on his left foot
here which gives him the torque he needs
to execute the spin move bringing him
into the gap in the defense creating a
pass opportunity for the quarterback
that is a well-executed line
that's how you show respect
you make specific and accurate
observations about your partner's
excellence again and again
this communicates admiration and esteem
for demonstrated competence and it's
experienced by most people as intensely
rewarding give it a shot what do you
