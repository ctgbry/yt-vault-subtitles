[00:02]
hi everyone I am very excited to be once
again sitting down with Dr Sean Smith my
friend and colleague Sean thanks for
joining us today Ryan it's good to see
you again and um congratulations on all
the success of the channel it's it's
just blowing up and as it should oh
thanks man yeah it's been kind of a a
banner year for psyx and I'm cautiously
optimistic about the
future I'm not cautiously optimistic I'm
just plain old optimistic I think you're
going to hit a million I I predict by
the end of the year before then probably
well before then I hope I can handle the
the success the celebrity yeah something
like that um do you get recognized when
you go out on the streets no I'm a
master of of being the grain man and and
I can I can walk through a crowd and and
it's like I was never there and I kind
of prefer it that way there are
definitely pros and cons to one's
ability to blend in right yeah well one

[01:02]
ability to blend in right yeah well one
of the reasons why I wanted to have you
on the show today besides just catching
up is I want people to know that you've
written yet another book which number of
book is this now Sean you've written at
least three right I think this might be
six I know I've read three books in my
life and I've written six I think yeah
that's Quite a feat that you've written
well one of them was The Hungry
Caterpillar so I don't I don't know if
we count that one so six books one of my
all-time favorite books in the space is
the Tactical guide to women and your
newest book is right here it's called
gatekeeper and I think we can consider
this something of a followup to Tactical
guide do you think that's fair yeah
although you know I think about it as
the book that I probably should have
written first because it's much more
about um you the reader and the
relationship patterns that that you're
on course to uh keep enacting unless
unless you make a different decision but

[02:01]
unless you make a different decision but
yeah it's it's a followup to the
Tactical guide was there something that
was left unsaid in the Tactical guide
that necessitated this book yeah there
there was the Tactical guide and I you
know it's nice when you can look back on
a book that book's about 5 years old now
I think or six and it's nice when you
can look back at a book and not hate it
um because you you look at at least for
me if you look at something you've done
in the past I tend to see nothing but
the flaws and I certainly see flaws in
the Tactical guide but I also still
think it's it's a good book it's quality
product and then apparently the market
agrees with me and so I'm pleased with
that book that book focused a lot more
on the character of the women that
you're bringing into your world and
touched a little bit on on the
relationship Dynamics gatekeeper is much
more about men guarding their own future
looking at their past determining where
they're headed unless they if they stay
course or change or change course and
the the type of relationships that they
were taught about that they're going to

[03:00]
were taught about that they're going to
continue but it's not a lot of
psychologist relationships speak it's
very nuts and Bol hey this is here this
is how things work these are the
pitfalls these are some of the um the
the ways I've seen men approaching
relationships throughout my 20 years of
of training and practice here's what
I've seen work here's what I've seen not
work so well and uh you sort of a nuts
and bolts guide to making sure that you
don't destroy your future with the wrong
relationship and yeah that's about it
okay so it's on some level not enough
simply to avoid toxic women who manifest
red flags in the relationship like
obviously that's desirable but that's
not sufficient to securing a highquality
secure long-term relationship well
there's an inherent um problem with red
flag list and everybody has frag red
flag lists and you should have red flag
lists but the problem with them is is
that you can memorize 50 red flags and

[04:02]
that you can memorize 50 red flags and
then you can get blindsided by number 51
that you never even thought of and so
the alternative to that is knowing
yourself and and understanding how you
operate in relationships because that
makes your radar bulletproof if you know
where your strengths and vulnerabilities
are in in the way you invite people into
your life then you don't need to walk
around with a list you know a bunch of
bullet lists in your head you can you
can examine the Dynamics as they unfold
and make good decisions you think it's
possible for a man to get that kind of
accurate self- knowledge about what
really works for him in a relationship
without being in relationships nope I
don't so does that besp speak that there
might be some sort of asymmetry between
men and women that in order for men to
have successful relationships they kind
of need to have experience in the sexual
Marketplace in a way that maybe women
don't that's an interesting question in

[05:00]
don't that's an interesting question in
the way that women don't yeah I suppose
in the sense that men and women are
looking for slightly different things in
general and so yeah there there's always
that difference
but I'm of the mind that we get good at
what we practice and so if a if a
guy wants to have a relationship the
type of relationship where he's building
something with another woman and I have
no agenda I don't care if guys get
married don't get married you just your
life you do what you want I'm not in the
business of advising people how they
should live their lives I'm just in the
business of if this is what you want if
you want to build something with a woman
a family an Empire whatever it is that
let's look at what works and let's look
at what doesn't work and so in order to
be good at and skilled at relationships
is like being good and skilled at
anything else if you're going to be good
at tennis you got to play tennis if
you're going to be good at
relationships you better know how
relationships work is and I don't you
know there's there's so many guys out
there that get into relationships and
this was me at one point in my life
where it's like you've you've bought
this high-end vehicle but you have no

[06:02]
this high-end vehicle but you have no
idea how it works why not learn how the
thing works before you try to drive it
and that's where my stance on
relationships if you if you want a
relationship then figure out how they
work which means figuring out how you
so that makes that makes a lot of sense
to me besides the relative lack of
experience what do you think is
men's obstacles towards that kind of
accurate self- knowledge about what
works for them in
relationships the things that the common
obstacles are the mostly the things that
they grew up around so the relationships
that they saw among the adults as they
were growing up the relationships that
they experienced with those adults the
relationships that they experience with
other kids that's really you know when
you're when you're young the
relationship patterns set in and then
you start flying on autopilot like
learning how to tie your shoe you have
to put a lot of energy into learning how
to tie your shoe first and then
eventually you're not even thinking

[07:00]
eventually you're not even thinking
about tying your sh you're having a
conversation while you're tying your
shoe and that's sort of how the
relationship patterns unfold as well you
spend a lot of time upfront figuring
them out and then you go on autopilot
until you decide to turn the autopilot
off and and take things into your own
hands yeah I think that fits with my
personal and clinical experience we get
these we s i could call them love
templates or relationship templates from
observing the adult relationships
closest to us when we're young typically
our parents and I think the natural
tendency is to inappropriately
overgeneralize from that limited data
set that this relationship that I
observed or experien is basically how
relationships are or should
be and people more or less move out into
the sexual Marketplace in their young
adulthood with that assumption I think
until they experience sufficient
friction or failure or rejection or
difficulty and potentially only

[08:00]
difficulty and potentially only
after years of it not working do they
entertain the possibility that their
fundamental models about relationships
or their assumptions about women might
be
flawed do you think that that's fair
yeah and by the time they have that
realization they've been practicing
those patterns over and over and over
again and solidifying
them so is there a way to
realistically um help young guys get
there faster without having to go
through this process of Pain by which
they ultimately disabuse themselves of
their models of relationships I think
there is that's why I wrote both of
these books um because you know one of
the first things I noticed in my
practice and I started off my practice
working in particular I worked a lot
with anxiety disorders and I started
working with couples too because that
was really fun but you I started
noticing guys making these blunders in
their love lives that just destroyed
their lives we've all seen we've all

[09:00]
their lives we've all seen we've all
seen it and it's not fun for women
either when a relationship doesn't work
out and so that's why I started looking
at this data and and putting these books
together but I do think that there's a
way to avoid the mistakes that other
people have made and primarily it is to
look at the mistakes that other people
have made compare them to yourself and
that's a good starting point you know at
least you don't need to repeat the
mistakes that other people have made you
can look at the good decisions that
they've
made
yeah I'm glad you said that I'm working
on my own book right now and I talk
about in any certain game it's generally
better in the beginning to learn how not
to blunder than it is to make better
moves because 50 fantastic moves in a
row can be undone by a single blunder so
what you think might be some of the
biggest blunders that tend to Blindside
men early on in their dating histories
well there there's blunders and there's

[10:00]
well there there's blunders and there's
lack of knowledge and blunders are
things like moving in too early shacking
up and getting entangled with somebody
who turns out to be kind of a disaster
that would be a blunder um but it might
be a blunder because you don't know any
better so in the realm of things that
we're not taught there's what do good
relationships look like and so many
people out there have no idea just the
the basic bare barebones minimum of what
to seek in a woman which is what the
tactical guide was about and the
barebones minimum of what to seek in a
relationship which is what the the what
gatekeeper is about because you're
bringing this entity you know this
relationship into your life it's like a
job it's like a house it's like it's a
major commitment and it has huge
implications and we're just most of us I
would venture to say almost all of us is
particularly men we're not giving it
we're not giving explicit lessons on
here's how you choose a woman here's how
you choose a relationship ship we kind
of have to look around and try to figure

[11:01]
of have to look around and try to figure
out what works and so we're left with a
lot of wordless Impressions about how
relationships function and when you
start to put words to what works and
then put words to what you're doing and
the principles by which you operate then
suddenly you can avoid those blunders
and you can avoid the most of the things
that you were never taught because now
you're starting to put words to it
starting to figure it
out I think maybe one of the reasons why
a lot of
never learned this is because the men
around them didn't have the knowledge to
impart to them because right they were
never taught by their own fathers or
uncles or friends yeah I think that 100%
we're in in an interesting moment where
I think more than ever before that
information is becoming more and more
widely available to men unfortunately at
the same time it's also mixed up with a
host of all kinds of information of
various quality
validity some of it is very low quality

[12:02]
validity some of it is very low quality
it's actually it's never been easier to
access this information in the history
of the world but it might also
paradoxically never be more difficult to
find it among all the low resolution
information that is circulating yeah
yeah that's a good point there's a lot
of
noise all right
so I think one of the main takeaways
that I got from reading the book
is that sometimes you can have a woman
who is
perfectly good like a but just not good
for
you that seems like it would be a very
hard thing to walk away from especially
if a guy up until that point has had
difficulty even meeting an engaging a
decent woman does that make sense yeah
makes a lot of sense
I think one of the things that makes it

[13:01]
I think one of the things that makes it
difficult for men to have
standards with respect to women in their
relationships in general is a lack of
optionality would you agree a lack of
optionality or a perceived lack of
or I don't know what's what's your
thoughts on how much of it is perceived
and how much of it is real in
general I think it's very rare for young
men to have actual optionality MH um the
vast majority of young men don't have
the things yet that most women are
selecting for in terms of a long-term
partner we know that women tend to
Value emotional maturity resources
status prestige a stable lifestyle and
almost by definition when you're 22 you
don't have those things you might have
optionality with respect to sexual
access if you have some game confidence
and physical
attractiveness but but most of those
women won't consider you as a viable

[14:01]
women won't consider you as a viable
option for a long-term relationship
which might be okay because a lot of 22y
old guys don't want to settle down yet
anyway um but I do think that that's
where a lot of guys get trapped in their
late 20s which is when things start to
shift with respect to the relative let's
say power imbalance between men and
women in general is women are starting
to kind of Their Stars starting to
decline whereas men's Stars continuing
to R
and potentially the first woman who
shows any kind of real interest who
seems to be decent and acceptable is the
woman that he ends up marrying and
committing to in his late 20s or early
30s well yep we've all seen it yeah and
and I would add that yes it's normal
that men in in their early 20s don't
have these things necessarily that women
are looking for I would add that that's
not new that's as old as Humanity

[15:00]
not new that's as old as Humanity
okay so this is not a new problem for
men as far as I can tell it's not a new
problem so what do you make out of let's
let's kind of zoom out a little bit what
do you make of sort of the social moment
in which it seems like more and more
young men seem more and more hopeless
and disenfranchised especially with
respect to dating and relationships yeah
that's that's a really complicated
answer and I I don't think there's one
thing that we can point to and I when I
when I Venture into social media and so
forth I see people trying to pick the
one answer trying desperately to find
you know how do we solve this problem so
they'll point to tnder they'll point to
feminism they'll point to you know any
number of things and say this is the
reason young men are struggling and I
don't think it's a I think it's all of
the above I think there are many things
that men are struggling with right now I
think every generation in humanity has
had something that they were struggling
against against not to minimize what

[16:00]
against against not to minimize what
guys are struggling with now um it's it
is kind of rough out there and I know
that the online dating apps have really
complicated things for young men how
so what I I have been off I've been off
the market
for have you ever used online dating
apps or did you use your wife well
before this happened no when no when I
was well I've been with my wife for 20
something you know high 20s and we've
been married for 25 G great but yeah
there was no there are no apps back then
there might have been the the first
beginnings of something like e-harmony
but doesn't matter when I'm hearing from
young guys these days is that there is
sort of this Marketplace I'm seeing two
marketplaces there there's a maybe we
talk about that a minute but there's
this marketplace where there's this
online you know these these online
dating apps like Tinder and so forth
Bumble hinge where most men are
tremendously
disadvantaged um because as far as I can

[17:00]
disadvantaged um because as far as I can
tell the things that women look for
behaviorally don't really show up on
those ass particularly Tinder all it
shows up on apps is on most apps is a
little description and a picture as I
understand it and so the things that
women you know I might have been able to
use to my advantage when I was younger
and I did use to my advantage things
like humor and and a little bit of
swagger and um just the ability to to
make eye contact and sort of have a
little game and a little bit of
playfulness that's very difficult to do
on an app I think it's harder to do or
at least it requires a different set of
skills yeah like I do think it's still
important to show that you have Swagger
but you might have to do that indirectly
through your pictures for example in a
way that maybe you were going to do it
with your accessories and when you meet
met on a date in person or something
like or your
personality you can you go on a if you
went on a date back in my day back in

[18:01]
went on a date back in my day back in
the you know early 1800s or whenever it
was you could um you know I could go on
a date with a woman and she wasn't just
seeing me she was seeing how I
interacted with people she was seeing
how I carried myself she was seeing how
I walked she was seeing how I dealt with
things like some some little thing not
going right like all of those things
mattered those are difficult to
convey those things might still matter
to a woman and she might look for them
on a date but you still had to get that
date
to begin with just like the guy on
Tinder to
get access to the real life person so
isn't kind of the same problem sort of
but I I think back in my day I wasn't
competing with Tinder even if I hadn't
been on Tinder if I was working
someplace for example or I was doing a
service job and I was encountering all
kinds of women um I wouldn't be
competing with this silent enemy over
here called Tinder where her her
attention is divided between the real
world and Tinder now we know that not
every woman's on Tinder it's a very

[19:00]
every woman's on Tinder it's a very
actually very small percentage of the
population is on Tinder but we we seem
to blow that data way out of proportion
but my point being that the competition
was just different and I think it's much
more complicated these days well I think
even more so than these traditional
dating apps um maybe you've heard that
the biggest dating app in the world
right now is Instagram according to many
folks because there are ways of
searching for folks and direct free
access to those people by just sliding
into their DMS so on some level because
of social media even more so than
traditional dating apps men are
competing against all men everywhere for
any given local woman's attention and
affections and that's that's very
difficult like it's hard enough to be a
big fish in a small pond it's next to
impossible to be the biggest fish in the
biggest pond like very very few men can
do that and they of course get the Lion
Share of sexual opportunity in today's

[20:02]
Share of sexual opportunity in today's
Marketplace in that Marketplace I think
there are two Marketplace well at least
two marketplaces I think there's that
Online Marketplace which is not a
singular Marketplace because there are
the apps but then there's also meeting
people organically through social media
you know Twitter Facebook whatever it is
the way you might meet somebody
organically in the real world so even
the Online Marketplace it's not just
that people are meeting each other with
the intention of hooking up or or you
with the intention of hooking up or a
relationship through an app they could
just be they could just encounter each
other and decide that they like each
other that's one but then there's this
other Marketplace that doesn't seem to
get much pressed today which is the real
world because there are a lot of people
who aren't interested in the dating apps
and they're not participating in that
and that seems to be resemble much more
the traditional old pre- dating app
Marketplace yeah but I think my
understanding is that fewer and fewer
men are initiating and approaching women
in in real life yeah uh whether it's set

[21:01]
in in real life yeah uh whether it's set
Singles bars or you know around the
workplace or in their friend groups so
and women still
seem entrenched in their unwillingness
to approach men even men that they are
attracted to and interested in forming
relationships with so it seems like the
real world marketplace is kind of on Ice
these days it kind of is and you could
frame that as a bad thing and or or you
could frame it as an advantage if if I'm
out there if I'm 25 and I know that none
of the other guys are approaching anyone
in real life or very few are approaching
women in real life well and I've got a
little bit of an edge I guess I would I
would agree with that I think on some
level it's never been easier
to be more confident and masculine in
most contexts for the vast majority of
men because a lot of that is going
underground a lot of that is going
online and so you actually have to make

[22:02]
online and so you actually have to make
less of an effort than you ever had to
in the past in order to beat out more of
your intersexual competition in real
world marketplaces I think it's
definitely a skill set that's worth
learning for most guys yeah it's it's a
skill set that generalizes once you get
over that anxiety and it's a visceral
anxiety that men have about approaching
women because that rejection for most
guys is is powerful and once you get
over that you conquer that anxiety
conquering anxiety is a skill that
generalizes to other areas so the next
job interview is going to be easier the
next public address is going to be
easier you know everything gets a little
bit easier when you conquer some piece
of
anxiety okay well let's also talk about
why the possibility that relationships
are down not simply because of
competition from Instagram or online
dating apps but because it might be
easier and cheap cheaper to secure the
goods that people would traditionally

[23:01]
goods that people would traditionally
secure in relationships in other ways
like for example I did a consultation
earlier this week with a guy
who's they were he was having an
argument with his wife who apparently
told him that it wouldn't matter if they
broke up because he could be replaced by
Tinder and task
rabbit and I that was a pretty cutting
blow on her part but there might be some
truth to what she said yeah kind of kind
of vicious if it was recounted correctly
um yeah but I I talk about this in an
episode in the past which is that it's
certainly necessary for women to have
men around like men build everything
more or less they make Society run they
create the apps that on they create the
phones and that bring all the goods that
Arms Reach to these women but it might
no longer be necessary for women to have

[24:00]
no longer be necessary for women to have
a particular man in their life and
potentially vice versa men might need a
lot of women around to keep the
population sustainable and Etc but they
might not need a single woman at least
not a single woman for the rest of their
lives um how would you respond to that
yeah I would say yeah it's you can get
by on your own these days but most
people don't seem to want to most people
seem to kind of like being in
relationships MH is that because
they get something from relationships
that they might not be able to get in
the marketplace otherwise I think we're
we're social animals and we want to be
we most of us want to be connected in
some way to some degree and you know
some people want to have families and
kids and and they want to have that
liveliness around them and they want to
know that when they hit 70 and 80
they'll be able to look back on some
meaningful connections and and have some
people around them hopefully that care
about them MH and yeah I don't know why

[25:00]
about them MH and yeah I don't know why
just I guess you could get into
evolutionary psychology and it's being
attached to each other is what what
helps our species progress no that makes
sense it I think it might be a tough
sell for a lot of folks in their 20s
though I mean I'm 41 now I never thought
I would live this long and you were
talking about looking back at 70 or 80
which basically seems like an eternity
away when you're in your early 20s yeah
it is a tough sell for guys in their 20s
but luckily I'm not here to sell that
because that would be a tough sell I
come in when where people are um
starting to build their relationships
and they're trying not to destroy their
lives yeah okay so uh that's some
interesting stuff about dating and
relationships from Sean um one of the
thing I'm going to transition here okay
um one of the things that we discussed
prior to this conversation was for me to
reach out to my community to let them
know that I would be talking to you yeah

[26:01]
know that I would be talking to you yeah
we did a group project yeah and to ask
them if they had any kinds of topics or
questions that they would enjoy the two
of us discussing and we got nearly I
think 200 responses which I went through
and I picked out some of the questions
that I personally felt would be most
interesting to discuss with you in
particular given your experience and
skill set you want to give this a shot
and discuss some of these topics from
some questions okay great I really liked
this one uh the comment read would love
to know your personal experiences with
women that made you feel very cared for
and loved I want to do a good job caring
for the men around me so presumably from
a woman um she wants to know how do men
feel loved and cared for I think that's
a great question food and sex what's
your
answer I think those are are both good
things I I am a little bit more nuanced
I feel cared for

[27:02]
when when a woman shows that she's been
listening and paying attention in the
sense
that if I'm talking
about to use a very prosaic example if I
mention that one of my light bulbs have
burned out the next time I see that
woman she's brought me a light bulb to
replace it with so it's it demonstrates
that she's paying attention and it
demonstrates that she wants to make my
life better in an instrumental Way by
helping me both make my lifestyle more
comfortable and helping me move in the
direction of My overall mission in life
and to do that without being asked or
told to do it it's just like she's just
there to help out and to chip in when
it's necessary that makes me feel very
loved and cared for yeah this this is
one that um I struggled with more more
than others because I as when I read
this question I started thinking back on

[28:00]
this question I started thinking back on
on my career and uh what have men told
me about what works in terms of you know
feeling cared for and what doesn't work
and I had a hard time identifying themes
I would say one theme and this is this
is a don't this is not a do and don'ts
aren't as helpful dos are more helpful
but you know don't ride our asses is one
of the things that that I think I've
heard as a trend throughout my career
meaning you you're you're walking down
the street you see attractive woman she
catches your eye you don't you don't
want to pursue her she just catches your
eye because you're a man and then to
have to um answer for for just having a
sort of normal biological reaction to a
woman and and then turning your
attention back to your own woman that
that being an example or you know just
sort of
nagging and uh making things difficult
and harder than they need to be I think
that that is a trend that I have heard
over the last 20 years from men is we do
not feel most men do not feel cared for

[29:01]
not feel most men do not feel cared for
when a woman is making things harder
than they need to be the flip side of
that I think the thing that um the flip
side of that coin is being someone who's
Pleasant to come home to and that goes
both ways like but if you're a woman and
you want to make your man feel careful
just be pleasant to come home to let him
look forward to walking in the door and
getting a hug and a pleasant greeting
and a kind word um that goes a
tremendously long way and so that that'd
be my answer I guess I I I think that
already assumes a more traditional
relationship though I I guess in that
framework the woman is at home waiting
for the man to return from work
metaphorically speaking maybe you're
home and she comes home and but the
point is that when you reunite that it's
a pleasant experience and it's not
something that he's dreading because he
knows that he's in trouble for some
stupid thing or whatever that he's in
trouble for some stupid thing thing or
that he has to serve as a surrogate

[30:01]
that he has to serve as a surrogate
therapist or counselor to listen to her
vent about her day or to provide
emotional support for you know dealing
with another work-related frustration
Etc I I think that in general it's a
good idea to bring as little stress and
negativity as possible into
your primary relationship and if you
have confidence or therapists or close
friends to kind of do that kind of
emotional processing there to keep the
space between the two of you as clean
and pristine as
possible do you think that that's fair
I'm thinking about that one I'm thinking
about you know handling problems
together and I I think if there's a
distinction to be drawn there it would
be that it's impotent complaining and
endless complaining versus um a woman
saying you're my man I need to bend your
ear for a little bit maybe I need your
guidance at the end of this maybe I just
need you to listen but there being some

[31:02]
need you to listen but there being some
balance between the the all the bad news
and all the good news and that there's
more positivity far more positivity in
the relationship than negativity and
that if there's a stream of of endless
problems from work for example that
there can be some solution to that that
we're not going to spend the rest of our
lives just me listening to you complain
about work that yeah I'll listen to you
try to make sense of the problem and try
to work it out but if this is the rest
of our lives you know you complaining
and me sitting here absorbing no that's
that's not going to work and it wouldn't
work the other way either okay cool I
think that was an interesting response
to that question shall we move on yeah
all right number two I got do you think
depression is actually a mental illness
or just a temporary condition that gets
way overdiagnosed in talking with
clients do you notice a big difference
in how it affects men versus

[32:00]
in how it affects men versus
women this one got me kind of fired up
you you want me to start on this one
yeah absolutely what you have to say
well first of all let's come up with a
an operational definition of depression
so when researchers look at animals and
and they're looking at depression in
animals the way they measure depression
in animals is does the animal slow down
so it does does it do less of the things
that that animal normally does sniffing
exploring grooming eating humping
whatever all the all the things it does
when the animal starts to get smaller in
its behaviors and we call that depressed
and I think that's not a bad way to
think about depression in humans that
our behavioral repertoire shrinks a
little bit our world gets smaller we get
smaller now for men in particular it
doesn't always look sad and slow and
depressed with men it can often look
depression can often look irritated and
agitated and and sort of energetic but
even then you see a diminishing a
diminishment in functioning at work in
relationships and the way they take care

[33:00]
relationships and the way they take care
of themselves so this idea that um
depression shrinks you down and makes
you less than than you could be and that
you want to be I think is a fair fair
enough definition for discussion would
you would you go with
that I think those are the most reliable
signs of depression the vegetative signs
I think is what they tend to call them I
also think that male depression tends to
manifest itself as irritability or
restlessness I think that that's fair
which which I'll I'll just interject
here that that makes it hard to
recognize because if a guy's acting like
kind of a dick it's hard to to recognize
that he might actually be suffering but
go ahead yeah many angry men are
actually very sad men yeah and I think
it's often easier for men to access
anger and it because on some level it is
deceptively it gives them this deceptive
sense of a more powerful experience I

[34:00]
sense of a more powerful experience I
mean anger is like
inflating uh I think it's deceptive
because when you actually give into the
anger you're surrendering your own locus
of control and whatever has succeeded in
making you angry is now like the Matador
waving the cape and you are potentially
the charging bull and that generally
doesn't end up very well for the bull at
the end of the
match okay so I think we agree on those
definitions okay
so the next the next point I guess would
be that I think we have collectively as
a society been duped into thinking about
depression as a disease that you catch
it's even in the question um is it just
an illness or a temporary condition so
we we talk about depression as if it is
this thing you catch like
chlamydia and it's largely through the
efforts of and they're not evil efforts
necessar neily but through the efforts
of pharmaceutical companies and
insurance companies that we think of

[35:00]
insurance companies that we think of
depression as a disease but you and I
know that depression can be secondary to
any number of things it could be
secondary to physical problems like um a
thyroid problem or bad diet or lack of
exercise it can be it can come from
ongoing problems in your life it can
come from something that happened 30
years ago that you don't even think
about anymore but it's thinking about
you and it's driving your behavior so
depression can come from all sorts of
different situations which makes it a
symptom not a disease when you think
about it as as a symptom like a fever a
fever can be caused by a thousand
different things but a fever isn't a
disease a fever is just a symptom and so
if you frame it as a symptom rather than
a disease then you get a couple of
options and the first one is is
difficult that is that you know this is
a symptom of something going on so you
get to do the hard work of diagnosing it
and then coming up with the treatment

[36:00]
and then coming up with the treatment
plan and then following through on that
treatment plan and that's a lot of work
and one of the things that really sucks
about being depressed is that it sucks
your energy so you don't want to do
these things that you you that you could
do under this first plan the second plan
is you take a pill and in my 20 years of
doing this work it seems to me that
family physicians in particular
wonderful people in general but hand out
ssris like their candy and they don't
talk about the tradeoffs now I'm not
opposed to ssris they're just a tool but
every tool has its tradeoff and and you
know every time I talk about the
trade-offs of SSR somebody gets deeply
personally offended so if you found
ssr's useful good you know go with that
but Physicians will hand this stuff out
and they don't talk about the fact that
there is no free lunch when it comes to
neurochemistry every time you Tinker
with your brain chemistry your brain
adjust and so with ssris the way your
brain adjusts is by downregulating the

[37:02]
brain adjusts is by downregulating the
synapses that are affected by the SSRI
and so you get a window and in my
experience it's 6 months 12 months
something like that where the fever is
reduced got a little more energy and the
problem will either resolve or you get
the energy to resolve it you figure out
what's going on you know ssris can be
Lifesavers in that sense that they take
the edge off enough that they can get
you moving or if that doesn't happen
then you're left as that window closes
with doing what so many people do which
is switching to another medication or
you stay on the medication just to avoid
the withdrawal of going off of the
medication and so some people have been
on medications for years it's not really
doing anything because their their brain
long ago went back back to Baseline but
they're just avoiding that withdrawal
and so I'm just going to I'll close this
out by saying depression is a symptom
you'll get a lot further thinking about
it as a symptom than you will as a

[38:02]
it as a symptom than you will as a
disease yeah I think that was all well
said anybody who really wants to get
into this issue in depth I would
recommend Whitaker's anatomy of an
epidemic which was written maybe 10 or
15 years ago and it's a mck breing
expose of this pharmaceutical Industries
influence in the evolution of our
conceptualization of mental illness
about a hundred years ago Depression was
seen as more or less a temporary
condition one of the nasty Secrets is
that most of the illnesses that are
populated in the
DSM including depression tend to
spontaneously remit even in the absence
of therapeutic treatment or
pharmaceutical Intervention which
basically means I think with depression
that the vast majority of depressions go
away by by themselves in 6 to 10 months

[39:00]
away by by themselves in 6 to 10 months
now it can be a very challenging dark
difficult 6 to 10 months and so
potentially the ssris or other
medications can elevate a person's mood
and give them the energy and Clarity to
take constructive action during that
window of time that you dis discussed
but you're absolutely correct is
that changing your brain chemistry over
time creates
sometimes irreversible changes in your
neuroanatomy and your
neurophysiology and that once the
medication is discontinued A syndrome
that in many respects can mimic the
initial
problem reappears and too often
according to Whitaker this rebound
depression gets misdiagnosed as the
original depression returning as opposed
to let's say a withdrawal Syndrome from
the psychiatric medication yeah and of
course in in many in many cases the

[40:03]
course in in many in many cases the
individual then goes back on either that
SSRI or an equivalent medication and
this the problem is just sort of
worsened over time now I do agree that
depression
is largely a symptom and it can be a
symptom of many different things the
thing that I think depression is a
symptom of in the vast majority of cases
in
men is it's a symptom of being low
status and I don't think you mention
that it's like it's possible for a man
to be confident and contented and happy
and clear when he has no sexual
optionality when he has no money or a
secure livelihood or a
comfortable lifestyle it's possible but
it's extremely difficult to be happy and

[41:00]
it's extremely difficult to be happy and
contented and confident under those
conditions and I think that is the
natural state of things when most young
men enter into the world is there the
lowest person on every totem pole women
typically don't want them because they
don't yet have the things that women
filter for in their selection process
and most men don't really want them
because they don't have skills they
don't have experience
they're kind of a liability they can
only be helped they can't really help
the team in their mission so it's very
very difficult for a lot of young men
and they don't yet have a place in the
world and I think that their depression
is often a manifestation of
that low status and the the issue there
is that can become like a trap like the
if the low status creates the depression
and depression is associated with let's
say hopelessness and despair that young
man May then inappropriately

[42:01]
man May then inappropriately
overgeneralized and say it's always
going to be this way there's no way out
um it's all [ __ ] anyway you can't do
anything about this but that could very
well be the depression talking and we
see this in you know non-human primate
studies that as male primates Elevate in
their stat respective status hierarchies
a lot of those vegetative symptoms of
depression tend to disappear
what do you think about that yeah I
think you I'm I'm with you 100% on how
difficult it is to be a young man and I
think women have no way of comprehending
how difficult it is to be a young man
and it's only a handful of men who seem
to remember how difficult it was being a
young man but so much of the behavior
that you see from young guys where
they're they're being Reckless and
they're they're abusing substances and
they're they're out causing trouble some
of that is just because they're they're
Knuckleheads and their brains haven't
grown in yet but some some of it is
because of this situation they're in
where the world is demanding that they

[43:01]
where the world is demanding that they
start providing the world probably
demanded a long time ago you said you
start giving more than you take Mister
but he doesn't have the skills to do it
he doesn't have he doesn't have the
juice he doesn't have the influence and
he's he's sort of stuck and he's
floundering for a few years and that's
where the places like the military are
really good for a young guy because they
say all right you got a you got a
purpose starting today and that jump
starts that sense of having a purpose in
life I can see that not just a purpose
but you also have a set a Cadre of
comrades as well so you have Team you
got a hierarchy you got a place in the
hierarchy even if it's at the bottom if
you know where you are and you know what
your job is that's good enough for 99%
of young guys it can be difficult but
also I think in those hierarchies where
you are very clear about where you stand
there's also also there's also generally
a pathway
that everyone understands to to move up

[44:00]
that everyone understands to to move up
that hierarchy as well yeah like most
folks know what it takes to go from an
E6 to an E5 when they're in those sort
of military hierarchies yeah if you go
on Twitter Twitter um or Facebook or
Instagram those places places like that
you will see a lot of men telling other
men you don't need therapy you need to
go the gym and I think this is the
problem that they're trying to solve
they're trying to talk to young guys and
say you got to get moving because guys
get immobilized in this state and if you
can get yourself to the gym and at least
start seeing some progress there then
you're starting to develop a skill set
of establishing progress and and I'm
convinced that when I hear guys say you
don't need therapy you need the gym well
okay sometimes you need more than one
option in life some you know therapy is
good for some problems of gyms good for
other problems but I'm I'm convinced
that it's guys trying to help other guys
just get out of this morass that we get
stuck in in our early early 20s yeah I
think it's much harder it's not

[45:01]
think it's much harder it's not
impossible but it's much harder to get
depressed when you're successful when
you have built a life worth living when
you have found your purpose and you're
enabled and incentivized every day to
move in the direction of that purpose
absolutely yeah and I think
that it it may even be difficult for
young men who are mired in depression to
work towards that for another reason
which is that it can be
comforting
to remain admired in the
inertia one of the things that I
remember experiencing when I was younger
is I was really cautious about investing
in
myself and building a life worth living
because I knew I was afraid of having it
be taken away which felt like it would
be even more painful and difficult than
if if I never had it to begin with does
that make sense
yeah so yeah don't try you can't get

[46:02]
yeah so yeah don't try you can't get
hurt
yeah that wasn't true like once I
finally made the decision to go for it
and invest in a career and to take self
accountability and to improve my
lifestyle my life only improved and even
though I know on some level that
everything I've been given will be taken
away from me one day I don't in any way
what soever feel like that is a
liability with respect to the life I
would otherwise have been
living it's hard to see that though when
you're stuck in in those early 20s late
teens you you don't have any context to
to put that in you know it's easy
relatively easy for us to look back and
you know I have a similar story where I
I was stuck for a while and had stuck
for my own reasons and now I can look
back and see well I shouldn't have been
stuck you know I should have had a much
bigger mindset than I did well that's
interesting so what personally got you
on stock do you
remember not not a single thing

[47:02]
remember not not a single thing
certainly part of it was being on a team
um one of my first jobs I was I was a
mechanic at this place I was a mechanic
trainee I was nothing I was just
learning how to turn wrenches and but I
was a part of a team there were like 10
guys managing these machines and just
being part of that team I got some hard
lessons about what it is to be on a team
some some hard lessons about what it is
to be in the hierarchy and develop some
great relationships with these guys and
I think that placing myself in that
situation where I was accountable to
other men that was a huge experience for
me H I think for me it was observing
some of my close friends relative
success in my friend group I was
probably one of the latest bloomers and
I was
still living a bgeo hedonistic lifestyle
in my late 20s when I was working as a
actor in New York City
but by that time a lot of my friends had
either finished law school or medical

[48:01]
either finished law school or medical
school they had secure well-paying jobs
they weren't living in
the subsidized housing that I was in
Brooklyn they were they had nice
Apartments where they were buying houses
they had
stable relationships that had a high
future potential for family and
stability like they they had a lot of
good things in life and hanging out with
these folks became increasingly awkward
to be honest it's like these guys
invited me out to for some drinks
because they were making money they
wanted to go to the place with like the
$15 cocktails which was way outside of
my um budget and I felt increasingly
awkward because I didn't want to be the
guy who dictated where we went because
of my limited means and I certainly
didn't want my friends to be buying me
drinks out of pity for instance so or I
would go over to their houses and my

[49:01]
would go over to their houses and my
friends never you know rubbed it in
their face when when they were improving
their lives or becoming more and more
successful but I felt this widening Gap
um between me and them which I
was like I I I didn't want to ad admit
that I I was feeling envious of some of
the things that they were able to
achieve and I hated that I felt that way
because my friends I like my friends I
wanted to be 100% completely happy for
their success but there was this there
was this
unintentional emotional response that
like prevented me from being wholly
positive and supportive um at least
emotionally
internally um but fortunately I think
that that Envy motivated me to examine
myself and say hey wait a minute I've
known these guys for years and years and
years they're no better than me it's

[50:02]
years they're no better than me it's
like the these guys aren't special I I
grew up with these guys if they can do
it I can do it like there's absolutely
no reason that I I can't have the same
good things that my friends have been
able to secure for themselves and it was
actually their
modling that encouraged me to kind of
dream bigger for myself or to grow
up I I wonder if there's a commonality
in the two things that we're describing
here and that is that if you're a young
guy caught in this this normal
depression that you go through in your
early 20s that you're probably not going
to fix it in your basement you're going
to have to go out and be amongst other
people and develop relationships and
something about those relationships is
going to pull you in a Direction that's
that's probably going to get you
unstuck I think that's really wise
because I think it reveals what I would
call the int psychic fallacy of

[51:01]
call the int psychic fallacy of
depression which is that depression is
just something that exists between your
two ears right it's it's like an
attitude or a set of thoughts or
feelings that can be fixed simply within
yourself which wouldn't require you to
leave your basement right if it were
entirely based inside of your own um
mind now it's very much about your
relationship to the world yes your
relationship ship to the world and your
place within it and I think that that's
where depression is most reliably and
effectively addressed and I think that
you would agree yeah cool I think that's
a really important topic and I'm glad
that we discussed that anything more you
want to say on that
one nope okay this one I'm excited to
ask you the question is if you and Shawn
had young daughters well I don't have
any children but I do know that sha has
a young daughter a teenage daughter so
I'm gonna have him speak to this if Sean
had young daughter which he does at what

[52:02]
had young daughter which he does at what
age would you suggest they prioritize
marriage or to ask a more general
question what kind of advice are you
actually giving your teenage daughter
about man in
relationships when I first read this
question said if you and shod had young
daughters and I thought you know I
consider Ryan a good friend but not my
type um so we're probably not going to
have kids but I hope that doesn't break
your heart um but
no here's what I have told my daughter
she's she'll be graduating high school
one of these days she's a great kid and
we've talked
about tradeoffs in life
and I think one of the
cruestv LIE is that we're telling girls
that they can have it all that they can
do it all that there are no tradeoffs
and I think what that translates into
the minds of a lot of women is you can
party in your 20s you can have

[53:00]
party in your 20s you can have
adventures and you can build a career in
your 30s and then at some point you can
start to have family and this is such a
nasty lie because I think this is new we
were talking earlier about things that
might not be new I think this is
relatively new that we're seeing a lot
of women hit their late 30s and panic
because now they're realizing that oh
they they'd like to have a family they'd
like to have kids around they'd like the
the the pitter of little feet and the
fighting over toys and going to a high
school graduation someday and having
grandkids someday like this just hits
like a ton of bricks for some women not
all women and so I've been watching this
seemingly increase over the last few
decades and I've been very careful about
talking to my daughter and and telling
her that look whatever you decide to do
with your life I'm going to back your
plate because I know you're a good kid
you're going to make good decisions I'm
in your corner 100% but there are
tradeoffs and nobody's telling telling
you this no you know well we send our
kid to a good school but if you go to a
public school you're not getting this
message you're getting the message if

[54:01]
message you're getting the message if
you're a girl you can have it all you
get it from school you get it from
movies you get it from songs you get it
from your classmat it's just this
barrage of information that there are no
trade-offs and I think men are better
young men are better at understanding
that they're are trade-offs in life if
only because nobody has fed us this line
of [ __ ] that we can have everything
um so what I've told my daughter is
be mindful of the decisions that you
make early in life because they're going
to compound if you want to have a career
cool you're going to have a career but
that's going to come at some kind of
expense down the road you can you're G
to have to make tradeoffs in life and if
you for example want to become a
surgeon you're trading off the first 15
years of your adult life for this career
and at some point you may realize that
it's time to get started on a family but
it might be too late by then so just be
thoughtful this is interesting this is

[55:00]
thoughtful this is interesting this is
coming right when I'm working on a
chapter of the book that discusses
optimal dating strategies for both men
and
women
and I'm been struggling with the
effectiveness of some of this advice
coming from me as a man like this all
makes sense to me I think it would be
worthwhile for women to hear it do you
think that the fact that we're men would
compromise the ability of some of these
young women to hear the
message I don't know I mean facts are
facts and you can you can listen to or
not and not that I what I just said as
facts necessarily it's my impression
that there is an increasing number of
women hitting their 30s and and getting
hit with a ton of bricks that's my
impression maybe there's some data out
there you can ignore me or not well
everything is a there are no Solutions
there only tradeoffs that sounds you
sound like Thomas soul Who's Thomas Soul
he's the guy that says there are no

[56:00]
he's the guy that says there are no
Solutions there're only trade-offs he's
he's a brilliant Soul yeah's he's a
brilliant man he one of the best
thinkers in in in the last hundred years
congratulations thanks for telling me I
I was unintentionally going to
plagiarize this guy so I guess I have to
go back and credit this no but you
didn't you didn't plagiarize you came up
with it on your own so you were at least
as brilliant as he is ah yes liet and
Newton inventing the calculus um so
uh
okay so women can do everything but they
can't have everything is that fair to
say I I wouldn't even say you can do
anything my daughter's not going to be
she's not going to play on the NBA alth
well maybe these days she could she
could she could transition and throw a
hisy and play for the NBA but there are
certain things you no not everything is
Within Reach and this is another thing
that I think men seem to understand a
little bit better because we didn't grow
up with a bunch of movies Disney movies

[57:00]
up with a bunch of movies Disney movies
telling us that everything is within our
reach because everything is not within
our
reach
how can a young woman
realistically and objectively assess
what is within her
reach that's a good question I think you
the same way well I think you go out and
you try things
and you pick a path that that feels like
it's consistent with your values and you
you start trying things that's what guys
have to do in this chapter that I'm
writing I talk about a little bit the
influence of that let's say feminist
ideology on women's dating choices that
they can do everything and that there
are no trade-offs but I also talk about
one of the reasons why a lot of modern
women are behind the eightball with
respect to their meeting and dating
options these days is the relative
absence of fathers in their

[58:00]
absence of fathers in their
um in let's say their their
courtship you nodded when I said that um
what do you think about that absence of
fathers yeah it's it's the plague on
society and maybe it always has been you
know this is certainly not the first
generation to have a a shortage of
fathers but yeah it has such a
tremendous effect on young women and
young men maybe in in slightly different
ways
I see it in a few different ways one is
that I think a few Generations ago every
young man who was courting a young woman
would expect to have a conversation
about what are your intentions with my
daughter at some point right um and I I
think that a lot of women are only
learning the value of that gatekeeping a
bit later in life when they're in their
30s and on their apps and they say what
are you looking for on this app and it's
it's it's almost like once they realize
that their window is closing and they're
running out of time to potentially

[59:01]
running out of time to potentially
secure a partner for a family it's
almost like they get stricter with
respect to their filtering and their
gatekeeping which may actually be
counter productive at that point but
like yeah some level women might need to
act as their own fathers because For
Better or For
Worse their fathers aren't really
involved in their courtship decisions
anymore yeah yeah and it might get to
jump back at your point you just made it
might be more difficult later in life
just because the family-minded men have
all been snapped up and they have
families and so if you're raising your
standards while the supply is going down
you're sort of spiraling into this you
lonely
[Music]
Abyss but still suggesting that that
women lower their standards uh to
secure a relationship is a pretty tough

[1:00:02]
secure a relationship is a pretty tough
that's a grim option
too so I guess getting back to this
question you know when do you start
talking to your your daughter about
prioritizing marriage I think you have
the conversations early and you know I I
don't I don't tell my daughter how to
how to live her life I certainly guide
her you know I'll show her how to rotate
the tires on the car and and we have
lots of conversations about how
relationships are unfolding around us as
far as the decision she's going to make
that that's up to her and I'm smart
enough to know at this age that I if I
tell her to do something she's still
going to do what she wants and she
should do what she wants but you can't
have those those conversations too early
about trade-offs and about how
relationships work and and even though
you can't wrap your head around it at
your age at someday at some point you're
going to be 40 and it's going to come
very quickly and the decisions that you
make now are going to compound and and
they're going to affect you pretty
profoundly when you're

[1:01:00]
profoundly when you're
40 okay well
said let's talk about the next question
why women terminate relationships more
often I love this question um I you want
to jump in on
that well we know for a fact that women
terminate marriages more often than men
they terminate about 70 to 80% of them
these days
I think that women terminate fewer
non-marriage
relationships but they still terminate
more of them relative to men I think it
really comes down to two things is that
most women have more optionality than
most men do and so when a woman is
dissatisfied with the relationship for
whatever reason I think that she has a
potentially objectively correct
assessment that it won't be as difficult
for her to find herself in another
relationship before too long um maybe

[1:02:02]
relationship before too long um maybe
she even has male orbiters that she can
warm up most women have not just a plan
b or a plan C but a
DFG um or at the very least they can put
on some heels and a tight dress and go
sit down by themselves at a at a bar on
a Saturday night and get some interest
from the local male population so I
think it's it's generally easier for a
woman to replace a man because they have
more passive optionality than most men
do I would say for younger women yeah
older women gets more complicated I
would
agree uh with respect to why women
initiate more divorces than men I think
it's because they're often they often
have perverse incentives to do so given
the fact that they can still potentially
secure
the same
lifestyle and a sizable income without

[1:03:02]
lifestyle and a sizable income without
having to deal with particular man's
demands
or
obligations okay that's those are my two
senses what do you think I'll I'll
disagree with part of that and agree
with part of it and then it'll be
interesting if people see people Slug It
Out in the comments but um I agree with
the optionality for younger women and
particular
I I don't know statistics on dating
relationships breaking up who ends what
and when you kind of expect dating
relationships you expect most of them to
not work out you expect you would expect
99 out of 100 maybe to not work out you
when you're looking for that that one
person who's going to make a good
partner not to say that there's a one
but you're looking for for the good
candidate you got to go through a lot of
people so kind of expect that and and
yeah as far as what you said about women
having more option ity particularly in
the teens and 20s maybe early 30s
absolutely it starts to change pretty
dramatically after that it's a lot

[1:04:01]
dramatically after that it's a lot
harder for women
um where where I would differ with you
is in ending
marriages um we know that women file for
divorce more frequently than men and I
agree with you that there are perverse
incentives I think that if a guy a guy
wants to avoid family court
because he knows that he's if somebody's
going to be treated poorly it's probably
going to be him although I have seen
women get the short shifted in I've seen
women get mistreated in Family Court the
reason being that family court is a [ __ ]
show it's unaccountable judges it's
capriciousness there's no juries there's
no oversight it's just it's just a
freefor all it's a disaster but a man
can go in relatively confident that if
somebody's going to be mistreated it's
probably going to be hin in terms of
custody and that sort of thing there
have been great improvements recently
like in Florida with alimony laws but
but um a woman can go into family court
with some confidence that if somebody's
going to be mistreated it's probably not

[1:05:01]
going to be mistreated it's probably not
going to be her so I agree with the
perverse incentives as far as why women
file for divorce more
frequently it's not fun for women to get
divorced women don't get divorc for
sport and I know that you're not saying
that some of the red pill guys out there
seem to think that women divorc for
sport they're all just sociopaths and
that they're like sharks going through
the water looking for the next meal and
again I know you're not saying that but
women don't divorce for sport we know
why why people get divorced and we have
epidemiological data going back decades
and it's pretty prosaic stuff it's
conflict it's um cheating it's substance
abuse it's physical abuse it's just you
know the inability to get along together
they they're very basic reasons for why
people get divorced so the fact that
women file for divorce doesn't
necessarily mean that women are causing
the divorce and I think this is where
people like the red pill crowd really
really get tripped up they see that
women are filing for divorce and I don't
know if it's 70% but it's more than men
and they say oh well then women must be

[1:06:02]
and they say oh well then women must be
causing the divorce and they must be
causing the divorce for my favorite
reason which is hypergamy that's that's
the red pill
guys but we also know that men are more
prone to the types of behaviors that
cause divorce like cheating and
substance abuse that's just it's just
kind of how it is so you can't draw a
straight line between women filing for
divorce and women causing divorce it may
actually be men a lot of times who are
causing the divorce and the woman saying
I've had enough I've I've I've tried and
I've tried and I've tried and I'm
done okay I think that some of the
epidemiological data will need on this
subject will need to be interpreted
cautiously because before no contest
divorce if you wanted to leave it had to
be for a significant reason it had to be
because of infidelity or physical abuse
which certainly happened in the context
of marriages in the past um but if

[1:07:00]
of marriages in the past um but if
that's your way out then and you have to
nominate something in order to dissolve
the
relationship then maybe there are more
false positives there if there were no
other way to dissolve a marriage for
instance I think that that's reasonable
I don't know to what extent there would
be false pauses but I think that we
would expect that at least some of them
would be
um you know I've dealt with a lot of
guys in my clinical practice moving
through divorce Sean and I mean I only
hear one side of the story so that's
something to
consider um but I don't know of a single
man I've worked with who have gone
through divorce who's told me yeah I
beat my wife so I get it or yeah I
couldn't stop drinking and so I
understand why she left what are the if
you had to draw some Trends what are the
trends that you hear from guys about the
reasons for they for divorce um it's
it's something along the lines of she's
not happy and she's she doesn't she

[1:08:00]
not happy and she's she doesn't she
hasn't felt happy for quite some time
that's actually another Factor that's
that's important to put out there is
that women are more prone to they're
they're higher in trait neuroticism than
men generally speaking and so they are
more prone to being unhappy so I'm sorry
go ahead no it's it's it's that so um
it's not so much that there are there's
abuse or infidelity or significant stral
problems to the relationship it's that
they're not in love we're kind of we're
kind of bickering so conflict sure but
it's this just vague sense of like is
this going to be the rest of my life and
I think that's where those perverse
incentives differentially affect men and
women I would agree with that yeah and
so that you know I I would agree with
you that the vast majority of women
don't divorce for sport I think that
there probably are some sociopathic
women out there absolutely who
I mean get married because as far as I
can tell that's the only way that you

[1:09:00]
can tell that's the only way that you
can get divorced and divorce can be a a
very lucrative
profession um if you do it right as a
woman yeah but I think my sense here is
that if if both parties are kind of
vaguely dissatisfied or unhappy with a
relationship but ending the relationship
is more likely to be financially
beneficial to one party versus the other
we would expect that under just benal
conditions of vague
dissatisfaction the one who is likely to
benefit is going to be
more likely to initiate a termination of
the relationship all things being equal
and I think that's what we see yeah I
think that's a factor and I think it
also comes down to whether we're talking
about you know that big chunk in the
middle of the bell curve with just sort
of boring run-of-the-mill div divorces
versus the extremes where you do have
people who are acting very badly on both

[1:10:00]
people who are acting very badly on both
sides and some of those people are women
and some of those women are just
opportunistic sociopaths but they're
these stram they're not the they're not
the middle of the bell curve which is
what I think a lot of guys um comfort
themselves by believing you
know that the extremes represent the
middle
so where does this create any kind of
confidence for men because
yes men can control their behavior they
can say Okay I I I've never I'm not
going to hit my wife I'm not going to
abuse substances I'm not going to cheat
on her and yet that gives him no real
protection
against divorce which is basically an
you know know marriage is now and at
will relationship and the man could
potentially
be haved with respect to his wealth and

[1:11:02]
be haved with respect to his wealth and
status as a consequence of a woman's
being vaguely dissatisfied could be yeah
yeah so this the reason I wrote that's
the reason I wrote Gaye keeper it's also
the reason I wrote the Tactical guide to
women but you know the the way to
avoid the way to minimize risk and I
think I'm I carefully point this out in
the Tactical guid you can't eliminate
risk you can only you can only minimize
it you can manage it as best you can and
one of the ways to manage risk in
relationships is to really understand
your relationship patterns so that you
know what you're vulnerable to and you
know it takes a lot of work it's it's a
lot easier to just memorize a list of
red flags but the red flags list will
only get you so far and if you're
willing if you want to have that sort of
relationship which I don't care if a guy
has that kind of relationship or not but
if you're going to you're well served by
learning how they

[1:12:00]
work does that mean that you might
excuse me encourage men to delay even
considering entering into marriage until
a certain time of life maybe in their
30s um I hear that advice and I don't I
think that's fitting for some for some
guys I don't think it's necessarily good
blanket advice and I think it depends a
lot on community and culture for one
thing if you come if you come from a
community where you're dating within
that Community say it's a religious
community and you're both on the same
page you're both you both embrace the
religion in in this example you both
know where you're headed you you have a
purpose and that you collectively you
two are pursuing then I don't know that
you need to wait until you're in your
30s I think what you wait for is making
sure that you have a good long reliable
Baseline on her behavior on what the how
the relationship functions and how well
you do in the relationship and that

[1:13:02]
you do in the relationship and that
takes a lot of time um couple of years
you know but the the guideline that I
give in the Tactical guide is if you
really want to get to know somebody you
wait until at least a year after the
infatuation phase because during that
infatuation phase you're not seeing
clearly and she's not seeing clearly
nobody's seeing clearly you're both
drunk but if you give it you know a year
just as a good round number after you're
no longer
infatuated and you've got lots of life
experiences with this person then that's
that's starting to establish a
baseline fair enough let's move on to
this next question I like this one it
says why is it so hard for men to have a
strong moral code and enforce
it what do you think about that that one
I struggled with and I thought I'd ask
you well if you have thoughts on that
one I do I think that it's
it is difficult for men to have strong
moral codes and to enforce them it makes

[1:14:00]
moral codes and to enforce them it makes
me this question made me think of the
classic film 12 Angry Men did you see
that one Sean I did not so that is a
courtroom drama and it takes place in
the jury deliberation room that's the 12
Angry Men and the protagonist is Henry
Fonda and they're all deliberating on a
murder
trial and
in their initial vote Fonda is the only
guy who believes that the accused is not
guilty so the initial vote it's 11 to1
and the story is
basically him you know holding firm on
his conviction and in the face of this
strong opposition from these other men
and eventually moves them in the
direction
ofid and this is an old movie it's an
old story story I think came out in the
in the'
40s and I think it's a testament to like
holding firm to what you believe in even

[1:15:01]
holding firm to what you believe in even
in the face of opposition and what I
want to point out is
that in this story which is held out as
sort of an arch typle of individual
self-confidence in the face of
opposition Henry Fonda only had to face
off with 11
guys versus world that was an
accomplishment that we made a movie
about it and a story about it we still
tell that story today versus how hard is
it to stand against millions of people
which is more or less what a lot of
folks have to do given the internet and
social media and things like that like
the the willingness to
publicly say this is what I believe in
these are my convictions and to
withstand the opposition that may come
down upon you if if it's a tough cell if
it's rare for one person to do that
against 11 I mean how much rarer must it
be in today's day and age that's that's

[1:16:00]
be in today's day and age that's that's
what that question made me think about
well sure and especially if if your
livelihood depends on it for example
sure you know you say the wrong thing
you could lose your job yeah and so
there's all the external forces and then
there's the internal forces I I face
this minor um ethical quandry in my
practice this week there was there was
something that I really wanted to do was
it was a positive experience I really
wanted to do this but ethically I knew
it was not something that I I should
participate in and um you you know
nothing um nefarious or anything just
just sort of a joyous occasion that that
I was invited to go to and um I I
flashed back on an Ethics Professor I
can't remember the person's name but he
started off one of the ethics classes I
took by saying there's probably never
going you're probably never going to
face an ethical dilemma you're just
going to face of a situation with an
answer that you don't want to hear you
know what's right you just don't want to
do it and I had to remind myself of that

[1:17:01]
do it and I had to remind myself of that
this week because it would have been so
easy to slide on on this little ethical
um just just this little ethical thing
probably would have had no consequence I
could have very easily Justified it but
when you start letting yourself slide on
the little questions then it gets easier
and easier to start sliding on the big
questions one of the ways I
conceptualize having values is that
values have value and therefore they are
expensive and sometimes to uphold your
values can be very costly it can cost
you a relationship it can cost you a
friendship it can cost you your
livelihood it could cost you your peace
of mind or even your
security like your physical security um
and the unwillingness or the inability
to pay those costs suggests that that
value is only held more or less in name

[1:18:01]
value is only held more or less in name
only I think a lot of people especially
in today's day and age with our pension
for virtue
signaling people might think it's enough
simply to espouse the right beliefs to
to say the right things and they might
be unprepared for paying those costs
when the rubber hits the
road in terms of the blowback that
they're going to get or yeah the
blowback from specific
people antagonism in their relationships
maybe friends turning their backs losing
job
opportunities like the stakes have never
been higher and never
before maybe not never before but like
in today's day and age it's not
enough to Simply like just do your job
well you know now that's the ability to
do your job is mixed mied up on mixed up
with you know do you have the right
beliefs like I might not be able to was

[1:19:00]
beliefs like I might not be able to was
it's not enough to just be a good actor
or a good Baker or a good Carpenter it's
like we've dredged up some information
about your conduct and your personal
life and and now you've been cancelled
or you've been barred from effective
action in The
Marketplace that's that's very difficult
to stand up against I would think it is
and it takes a special combination of
fortitude and intellect and um Drive I
think to to overcome that and I think
you're a good example of somebody who
has stepped outside of that system
because you have this channel where you
say things that people in our profession
are not supposed to say
and I won't say you become uncan but
you're not subject to HR you know you're
not subject to the Mob uh you know
ruining your life in the way that they
might ruin the life of somebody who has
a job where they could get in trouble

[1:20:01]
a job where they could get in trouble
with
HR let's hope not I'm not trying to
court any kind of controversy here yeah
and and we're all subject to the Mob I
guess you know but but you have stepped
outside of the system and I not
everybody can do that not everybody's in
a position to do that
um I don't actually now that I say that
I don't know how true that is what do
you think I think I think people can
step out but it's not like what I've
been able to build for myself I could
construct overnight like I've been an
entrepreneur for 20 years yeah um and
one of the reasons why I went down that
road is because I have put myself in
position where other people were
empowered to either give me things or
take them away at their own pleasure and
I didn't like that yes um so I went
through the trouble and the expense and
the toil of building something that I
had more direct control over and could
protect from the capriciousness of
others and other I I don't think I'm

[1:21:01]
others and other I I don't think I'm
unique in doing that in any way but it
it does take a
certain temperament to be able to do
that you have to be able to assume a
great deal of risk um you have to be
willing to be completely
self-accountable um and you also have to
be able to compete successfully in the
market Marketplace I mean one of the
benefits of being an employee is you
don't really have to think about
anything you just get hired you show up
there's a there's an office to go to
there's a desk there like someone
actually furnished you with supplies you
didn't have to scr up a customer the
business already did that they just
email you to say hey take care of X Y
and Z you work for a predetermined
amount of time and then you get to go
home and not ever think about your job
again I mean there is a lot of Pros to
Simply being an employee everything just
sort of gets taken care of for you um
that's certainly not true when you're an

[1:22:01]
that's certainly not true when you're an
entrepreneur and you run your own
businesses can everybody be an
entrepreneur probably not probably not
no I I don't know how well society would
function if everybody was an
entrepreneur um certainly society would
look very different but what I'm
suggesting is that most a lot of people
don't have the temperament or the skill
set to be a successful entrepreneur
right and that's that's fine we don't
need a world full of entrepreneurs so
getting back to the question are are you
are you making the case I would make the
case are you making the case that being
an entrepreneur puts you in a position
where it's easier to live by your moral
code yeah I think so because I don't
have to compromise my values in order to
ensure the Goodwill
of my

[1:23:00]
of my
employer that's not entirely true that's
why I kind of slowed down like when I
first started out let's say as a
clinician I had difficulty filling my
practice and it was in those moments
when my clients were more were basically
my employers and it became harder in in
the beginning
[Music]
to to implement the kind of boundaries
with respect to my practice that I
wanted to
implement because I didn't have a full
practice let alone a weit list so if one
person decided that you know this time
didn't work for him or this is the how
he would prefer therapy to go like I
would have felt that loss like I might
have needed that client more than that
client needed therapy and that's not a
good position for that client to be in
like that's actually kind of a dangerous
position for that client to be in yeah
so one way to be kind of honest and

[1:24:02]
so one way to be kind of honest and
virtuous is to not need any particular
opportunity in in its specifics so what
would you say to a young guy let's let's
say that the guy who wrote this is 23
years old and he's wrestling with um you
know how to create a moral code and
enforce it and he's one of these 23 year
olds we were talking about earlier where
he doesn't have his his act together
yet well I I think from my own
experience it just means being willing
to pay the price for what you believe in
and sometime to play kind of the other
side of the coin here doing so also lets
you learn
to pick your battles I think when I was
younger I was even
more punctilious with respect to my

[1:25:00]
more punctilious with respect to my
value system what does that mean you
know exacting okay if not even
self-righteous okay about certain things
and that
often made it difficult to be in
relationship with me both men and women
I thought that it was my my you know
high moral code and my standards for
myself and others other people just
probably found me to be difficult to
deal with
and like there's a time to stand firm
but that might mean losing access to
certain types of relationships and
opportunities and you then have to kind
of weigh in your estimation like what is
this worth like could I is this really
worth ending the relationship sometimes
it is if if going back on that spe or
compromising that specific value on some
level significantly compromises the

[1:26:00]
level significantly compromises the
relationship you're going to lose the
relationship one way or the other but
some of those values were really just my
own I don't know self-righteousness or
intolerance to be honest and I could
certainly have learned to navigate those
relationships more
flexibly um does that make sense yeah it
makes sense because I you know I had
some similar experiences and I think
maybe one of the takeaways here is that
when you're a younger guy it sometimes
is a little confusing that to to know
where you're being moral versus just
being pigheaded or self-righteous and
maybe that's where moral you know moral
structure comes in like religion maybe
that that helps with this sort of thing
but um you know I think if you're a
young guy you give yourself a little
grace to learn and adjust and figure out
that okay that that wasn't my morality
operating that was more my ego operating
okay so I'm I'm going to adjust next
time and I've learned a little something

[1:27:00]
time and I've learned a little something
about my morals from this incident I
like that all right well we got time I
think for one more question what do I
have
here this one also you're in a better
position to answer than I is it really
possible to retain or even increase High
erotic sexual desire when one is married
SL together for years and decades and if
is how does one achieve that what do you
think Sean yeah it's possible absolutely
it's possible I don't know if it's the
norm honestly um and I don't know if
it's not the norm but it certainly is
possible to keep the sex life going
throughout your marriage and it takes a
little bit of effort but um you know
there's there's some data out there that
says married men have more sex than than
single men more and better sex there's
there's data that says that there's
probably data that says the other way
too but um it's certainly is possible
and I think it
takes a certain amount of it takes a
certain amount of effort to stay
involved and and to make that a priority

[1:28:02]
involved and and to make that a priority
I'm starting this is all starting to
sound like you
know something that any um Instagram
psychologist would say it it takes some
a little bit of effort to to keep it
going and what does that effort look
like can you give any actionable advice
playfulness um yeah it's if I had to
boil it down to word it would just be
playfulness keep flirting with your wife
keep flirting with your woman and um you
know game game doesn't go away game is
forever and game should be fun game in
my estimation game shouldn't be
manipulative or or um yeah it shouldn't
be manipulative it should be a fun thing
um back when you when I was a kid Prince
was the musician Prince was really big
and you could you could watch Prince's
if you watched his his mov movie Purple
Rain or and I saw him in um in concert a
couple of times and Prince was really
good at just playing with an entire

[1:29:01]
good at just playing with an entire
Arena of people and flirting with an
entire Arena of people and it was kind
of it was kind of interesting to watch
how this this tiny little guy would hold
an arena in in the palm of his hand by
um giving a little bit and then pulling
it back and then joking and then and
then making fun of you and then just
doing all these little playful things
that that you might do in a relationship
and then might have been part of why he
was so successful but if you let those
things die away and I I guess I would
say the other thing is probably taking
care of yourself you know my wife and I
had we made an agreement when we got
together that we were going to take care
of oursel and it wasn't an ultimatum it
wasn't hey if you get fat I'm leaving it
was each of us volunteering that I know
I'm going to get older but I'm gonna do
my best to to stay presentable and to
stay as attractive as possible for you
and if I don't
I'm going to understand if you want to
renegotiate because part of this is
about
sex I don't know if everybody's up for

[1:30:01]
sex I don't know if everybody's up for
that kind of
agreement it might be in the best
interest of both of you though to kind
of create some sort of accountability
structure like yeah it might mean that I
can't ever relax completely into a
Totally Secure Arrangement but maybe
that lack of complete Security is not
just good for
you because it motivates me to be more
presentable and attractive to you but
it's good for me because it motivates I
also acre benefits from that by being
healthier and by being more vital and
energetic I think that that makes a lot
of sense I think any kind of agreement
that can't ever be Rec Ed is prone to
more abuses than one they
can um and I think that there are ways

[1:31:00]
can um and I think that there are ways
that you can create those
accountabilities into a committed
relationship and that too
much like permanent security may not be
in the interest of the relationship or
the individuals
involved I'm with you I heard a rabbi
say one time that the Spectre the
possibility that's different the
possibility of divorce is actually a
very good and healthy thing for a
marriage and that where there is no
possibility of divorce like we see in
certain cultures that's when marriages
get really miserable that's when people
can be abusive with abandon no fear of
consequences men in particular you know
men in certain cultures if they know
that their wife can't leave they they
tend to get kind of abusive and and you
just turn nasty not all of them but when
there's a possibility of divorce on both
sides then there's this this incentive
to you know take care of yourself take
care of them treat them well and and be

[1:32:02]
care of them treat them well and and be
a good partner and I think it affects
effort and I think it affects effort
beneath the threshold of conscious
awareness like there is no way that
anybody is going to put in more effort
at a job if he feels that he could never
be fired that at a job in which he has
to be accountable for his employment
like the man might be the most
disciplined virtuous person in the world
but that structure will insidiously
affect his effort in ways that he's
probably not even consciously aware of I
agree yeah you might see that for
example in places like the federal
government where jobs are pretty cushy
and
secure folks tend to take it easy you
might see that if one were inclined to
look in that direction yeah
well Sean I think that is good for now
that was about 90 minutes I enjoyed the
conversation um I'll plug your book it's

[1:33:03]
conversation um I'll plug your book it's
called gatekeeper the Tactical guide to
Commitment it's shant T Smith's sixth
foray into the literary sphere I've read
it I really like it I think it's
a I think it's
a successor to the Tactical guide to
