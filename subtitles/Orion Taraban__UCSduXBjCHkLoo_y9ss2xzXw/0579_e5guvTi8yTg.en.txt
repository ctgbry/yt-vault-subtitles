I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is body
count and sexual jealousy so this is
going to be a spicy episode and I'm
going to say some things on this subject
that I'm sure some men out there are not
going to agree with and that's okay my
primary thesis here is that when it
comes to body count the actual number is
not as important as a lot of men out
there believe and I'm going to be
discussing
why I believe that to be true in today's
talk first of all I'll preface this by
saying men you are allowed to want
whatever you want if you want a woman
with a low body count that is your right
if you want to marry a virgin that is
your right it might be very difficult to
find in today's sexual Marketplace but
if that's what you want I don't have a
problem with your preference I hope you
find what you're looking for that said
it's not immediately obvious why why men

[01:00]
it's not immediately obvious why why men
want women with a low body count this is
because the actual number is generally
understood to be a proxy for other
things that men do want which tend to
fall into two informal clusters on the
one hand low body count is presumed to
incite less sexual jealousy and disgust
on the other hand low body count is
presumed to facilitate pair bonding and
emotional attachment now let's talk
about each of these things in turn
so men can and do get jealous of a
woman's past that's why I generally
advise men to tread into the territory
of a woman's sexual past only with a
great deal of discretion there might not
be anything that you learn by prying
into her past that will make you feel
better or will improve your capacity to
make an informed decision this is
because if you want to know your you're

[02:00]
because if you want to know your you're
already emotionally invested which means
on some level you've already made your
decision men who are not emotionally
invested do not care about a woman's
past it doesn't incite jealousy or
disgust in fact if you're just looking
to smash then her experience with
short-term relationships is to your
benefit it means that she's open to the
possibility of a casual relationship in
a way a virgin probably wouldn't be on
the other hand
men who care about a woman's sexual past
are more interested in a long-term
relationship typically typically because
they've already made the decision to
emotionally invest at which point any
information about anything that she's
done with anyone is subject to creating
unnecessary pain and this of course is
why women generally lie when it comes to
this topic and here's my point men's
emotional reac action to a woman's

[03:01]
emotional reac action to a woman's
sexual past often has less to do with
the sheer number of her previous sexual
partners and more to do with what she
has done or not done with you relative
to what she has done or not done with
anyone else the emotional reaction is a
response to an awareness of an
unfavorable economic
Exchange in order to explain I'll use
some simple and slightly exaggerated
example
to demonstrate what I'm talking about
according to the data women in the west
have a lifetime average of seven sexual
partners so let's say that you meet a
girl with a relatively high body count
like 15 this woman has slept with 15 men
before you but let's also say that she
made each of them wait two months before
she slept with them and only after each
made an exclusive commitment to her and
they only ever had standard intercourse

[04:01]
they only ever had standard intercourse
that she didn't
enjoy and let's also say that she was
willing to break all of these rules and
precedence with you she's so attracted
to you that she wants to sleep with you
right away without an exclusive
commitment and no sexual activity is off
the
table how are you going to feel now if
you're like most men under the
circumstances you're not going to feel
disgusted that this woman has had twice
the number of the average number of
sexual partners you're going to feel
attractive and flattered and proud that
she is apparently willing to break the
rules for you that she applies to
everyone else those other men aren't
going to be as problematic and you
certainly are not going to perceive them
to be threats in your
relationship now on the other hand let's
say you meet a girl and she's only been
with one other man in her entire life
but that one one man was a division one

[05:01]
but that one one man was a division one
athlete who went on to have a lucrative
professional career you probably know
his name she slept with him on the first
date went on to have all kinds of wild
hot sex with him and didn't mind if he
slept with other women maybe she did
things with him you thought only women
in porn were willing to do however when
you started dating her she made you wait
two months before you had sex demanded
an exclusive agreement and wouldn't do
anything beyond standard intercourse in
this case
how are you going to
feel if you're like most men under these
circumstances you're not going to feel
relieved that this woman has had only
one single sexual partner you're going
to feel like a total schmuck which you
will likely defend against by becoming
angry or
disgusted why because you transacted for
a less attractive sexual opportunity for
Far More Time energy and emotional
investment than this this other guy this

[06:01]
investment than this this other guy this
information is going to make you feel
like you overpaid for a good that you
could have gotten for much less and
that's going to make you feel that she's
not as attracted to you as she was or
still is to her ex this man will likely
be a problem and you will almost
certainly perceive him to be a threat as
long as you are in a relationship with
this woman do you understand the
emotional significance of Body Count has
less to do with the actual number and
much much more to do with how favorable
you perceive your transacted
relationship to measure up to her
previous transacted relationships men
correctly perceive a woman's sexual
enthusiasm for him to be a general
litmus test for her interest and
attraction which is why as I've said
previously it's important for women to
be the nastiest [ __ ] versions of
themselves with with the men they want

[07:00]
themselves with with the men they want
to secure relationships from so that's
the first thing now before I go any

finally if you're thinking of going to

program at Stellar
g.com okay let's get back to it the
second thing is that low body count is
presumed to be associated with the
ability to pair bond and form an
emotional commitment both of which are
vitally important for long-term
relationships and I would say that there
is some truth to that for instance a
woman who has slept with dozens of men
by the time that she is 30 might reach

[08:02]
by the time that she is 30 might reach
that age without any experience
whatsoever being in a stable committed
relationship she's been practicing
something else and so she's gotten
better at that something else she has
been practicing this other kind of
relationship and so she hasn't gotten
better at that a woman with a relatively
high body count is also much less likely
to be securely attached and much more
likely to be anxiously ambivalently
attached
these women often use sex as a means of
securing interest and attention from a
man which works at least temporarily as
a means to validate their self-worth and
stabilize themselves emotionally and a
woman with an unstable self-concept and
who has difficulty regulating her own
emotions is extremely difficult to have
a relationship with for instance it's
very difficult to pair bond with a woman
who is constantly afraid that you are
going to leave her what's more such

[09:00]
going to leave her what's more such
women might not like you as much as they
like attention which is easily replaced
so it's the psychology that's really the
issue here the high body count is
potentially just a sign of those
problematic underlying
Dynamics however there's another way to
think about why a high body count might
make pair bonding difficult that doesn't
get a lot of airtime which is why it
might be important for me to mention it
we live in a world where much of the
advice around maintaining a relationship
has to do with effective communication
and emotional vulnerability and Love
Languages and so forth and so on However
the fact of the matter is that one of
the best ways the best ways to secure
loyalty and long-term commitment from a
woman is to [ __ ] her really
good that is just the truth and how good
you [ __ ] her is all always going to be

[10:00]
you [ __ ] her is all always going to be
at least somewhat relative to all of her
previous sexual
experiences and just so you don't think
I'm being inappropriately crashed here
let's consider just two pieces of
evidence taken from David bus's the
evolution of Desire quote whereas only
3% of women who were often or always
orgasmic with their husbands expressed
an interest in extramarital sex 10% of
women on the low end of the orgasm scale
orted interest in having sexual affairs
with other men that's fact one here's
Fact Two quote
94% of the married women who experienced
frequent orgasms with their husbands
reported that they still love their
husbands as much now as during their
newlywed year
61% of the less orgasmic women reported
feeling comparable emotions of spousal
love what does this mean apparently if a
woman is not sexually satisfied with you
she is three times more likely to cheat

[11:01]
she is three times more likely to cheat
on you and if a woman is sexually
satisfied with you she is 50% more
satisfied with the relationship in
general gentlemen those are huge [ __ ]
numbers and the relationship
satisfaction stat is particularly
relevant here because we know that men
and women pursue extra partnerly asons
for different reasons namely there is no
difference repeat no difference in
relationship satisfaction between men
who cheat and men who don't
cheat just the way it is however women
who are not satisfied with their
relationships are far far more likely to
cheat than women who are like why do you
think women go back to that toxic ex of
theirs because he's good at sharing his
feelings now here's the bitter truth if
a woman's sexual satisfaction is related
to to her loyalty and her commitment and

[12:01]
to to her loyalty and her commitment and
her sexual satisfaction is at least
partly related to her previous sexual
history the more partner she's had the
less likely you're going to be her best
all other things being equal like if
she's just had 19 other lovers then the
likelihood that you're going to be the
best she's ever had is at 5% not
impossible but the odds are definitely
stacked against you so that's the
underappreciated reason why high body
count is associated with the long-term
success of a relationship the more men
she's had the harder it will be for you
to be the best she's ever had and this
will R down to her loyalty and her
emotional investment over time gentlemen
[ __ ] your women well is one of the
single best things you can do to ensure
her commitment her investment and her
overall satisfaction it's also fairly
fun to do something to consider what do
