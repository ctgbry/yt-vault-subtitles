a lot of you ladies create these really
complex and elaborate funnels that make
it harder and harder for you to receive
the love that you say that you want and
just like the business with the
complicated sales funnel that is
ultimately to your detriment I have
heard women say that they felt unloved
when a man didn't read a book she
recommended or when he didn't notice her
new manicure or when he didn't want to
watch a show with her or when he
wouldn't listen to her problems without
offering Solutions or etc etc etc these
frustrations and disappointments reveal
a complex evolving and often unconscious
system of requirements a woman is
subject to imposing on her relationships
if we were to work backwards it would
suggest that in order for this woman to
feel loved which presumably is something
that she wants she needs a man to read
her book recommendations notice her
manicure watch her shows listen to her
problems without offering Solutions all
this does is unnecessarily complicate
her love funnel which will absolutely
result in her receiving less love not
more
