I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is
limitations make you better so this is a
very important subject for all men to
consider when I say limitations what I'm
talking about here is a self-imposed
extrapolated ethical framework it's
self-imposed because you got to do it
yourself and it's extrapolated because
you really got to think it through and
it's an ethical framework because it
informs how you make decisions As you
move through the world let me explain
why this is going to be worth the
trouble for better or worse the vast
majority of men out there have not
chosen to surrender to a specific
philosophical or religious framework in
a Catholic way I don't mean Catholic
like the Catholic Church Catholic means
whole so a Catholic framework is one in
which all the doctrine is preserved
whole you don't pick and choose which
rules you're going to follow and which
rules you're going to ignore and it

[01:00]
rules you're going to ignore and it
could very well be the case that certain
Traditions actually know more than you
do I mean some of them have thousands of
years of accumulated wisdom behind them
and when you place yourself above them
by picking and choosing then you will
likely deprive yourself of at least a
portion of that knowledge in my opinion
it's better to completely surrender to a
framework for as long as you can and
then to leave the framework entirely
when you can no longer do so for
whatever reason now without this ethical
framework people are more or less just
making it up as they go along and this
means that every decision is
functionally based on emotion and
self-interest they like it so it's good
they don't like it so it's bad this is
how infants navigate reality however
many people have not matured past this
stage because doing so takes effort and
discipline and Clarity that said the
consequences of not doing this are
considerable just look around modern
life is a constantly shifting chaos of

[02:03]
life is a constantly shifting chaos of
inconsistency what is bad and wrong
today might have been good and right
just a year ago which is an absolutely
insane way of going through the world
it's crazy making on the other hand an
extrapolated ethical framework is like a
North star it's something by which we
can navigate the ambiguities of everyday
life and if we're not going to surrender
to an external framework in a Catholic
manner then in my opinion we have the
ethical duty to create that framework
for ourselves and it's all right if this
framework is a chimera you can take
something from the stoics and something
from the Buddhists and something from
the Christians and something from the
existentialists and so on however
eventually you're going to want to
create a system that you'll be willing
and able to surrender to
wholeheartedly and this will perforce
require you to set limits on yourself
limitations are necessary they're like a

[03:00]
limitations are necessary they're like a
skeleton which not only protects but
facilitates Locomotion as it allows us
to move through the world with some
degree of confidence and equinity people
don't always like limits but there's
really no way around them now there are
two really important ways in which the
limitations inherent in an ethical
framework will help you out first this
framework will help you not
self-destruct once you become successful
in many cases the limitations inherent
in an ethical framework are less useful
when you're not successful this is
because the reality of your
circumstances already places limits on
your action there's kind of no need to
use an ethical principle to restrict
Behavior if that behavior is already
restricted by scarcity it's one thing to
moralize about infidelity when nobody
wants you for instance it's quite
another when hundreds of beautiful women
are throwing themselves at you every day

[04:01]
are throwing themselves at you every day
however it's important to consider how
you would want to live if you could
actually do whatever you wanted and to
start practicing that way of life
today why because we're going to start
off by assuming that we're going to end
up there one day like start with the end
in mind right so if we assume that one
day we will have enough success and
optionality to functionally do whatever
we wanted and if we don't start putting
limitations on our actions now before we
need them then it's extremely unlikely
that we will be able to reign in our
behavior in the absence of the external
restrictions to which we have
effectively delegated our
accountability and this is a problem
because our lives will likely go off the
rails at that point and we won't be able
to enjoy the fruits of all our extensive
efforts just look at the rock stars and
the celebrities what tends to happen to
them when they arrive at the point where

[05:00]
them when they arrive at the point where
they can functionally do whatever they
want self-destruct is not hyperbole it's
very easy to moralize about these
people's behavior but it's probably more
useful to assume that these people are
really no better or worse than you are
while they may have an extraordinary
talent in some respects they may be very
normal in all other regards so their
lives are often a testament to what
happens when Ordinary People attain to
extraordinary power and influence
without an extrapolated ethical
framework start practicing within those
limitations

description all right let's get back to
it now the second way in which the
limitations inherent in an ethical
framework are important is that
limitations make you better so this is
the title of the episode right so how
exactly does this work the easiest way I
found to explain how this works is to
talk about
Batman so Batman is actually Bruce Wayne
the handsome brooding billionaire and
this guy can pretty much do what
whatever he wants he's jacked he's rich
and he puts on a costume and flies
around the city he lives above the law
which is a conscious choice on his part
to do and which kind of puts him
constantly at odds with the police but
that's how he's decided to live now
Batman's Nemesis is Joker and despite
their differences in appearance the two
are actually fairly similar Joker also

[07:00]
are actually fairly similar Joker also
puts on a costume and flies around the
city and lives above the law as a
conscious choice and Joker pretty much
uses every opportunity he can get to
remind Batman of this fact and this is
dangerous for Batman because were he to
cross a line a line that really only
exists because he drew it himself and a
line that no one could really hold him
accountable for crossing anyway his
precarious relationship to self would
crumble into chaos so Batman has self
imposed rules that separate him from
Joker on one hand Batman doesn't have to
have these rules in the sense that no
one is forcing them on him but on the
other hand he does otherwise the ethical
basis for his action in the world would
flounder into incoherence without these
rules he would be no different from
Joker or rather he would be worse than
joker as he would be a self-righteous
diluted hypocrite at least Joker doesn't
have any Illusions about himself in any

[08:01]
have any Illusions about himself in any
case Batman has a few Batman rules like
he doesn't use guns and he doesn't kill
people those are two of the rules that
he has chosen to operate by and he's
going to hold himself accountable to
those rules because they help keep him
on this side of
Sanity that said these rules do create a
liability for Batman why because due to
these self-imposed rules rules that
joker has not imposed on himself it's
now actually easier for Joker to win
than it is for Batman to win Batman now
has fewer win conditions than Joker does
for example for Batman to win he needs
to capture Joker without killing him
however for Joker to win he could not
only capture Batman without killing him
he could just kill him or even more
perversely provoke Batman into killing
him which paradoxically would allow
Joker the ultimate moral victory over
over Batman so there are more ways for

[09:01]
over Batman so there are more ways for
Joker to win which all other things
being equal increases the likelihood
that he will win this means that if
Batman and Joker were exactly the same
skill and power level Joker would win
Batman wouldn't have a chance if the two
were evenly matched the victory would go
to the one who could win more easily
Batman understands this however and
Batman's understanding of the
liabilities created by his self-imposed
limitations force him to become more
skilled and more powerful than he
otherwise would be this is because the
only chance Batman has of successfully
competing with Joker under these
conditions is to become significantly
better than his enemy he must be
stronger and smarter and tougher to
overcome his handicap and the kicker is
that he probably wouldn't have become
better unless he needed to and it was

[10:00]
better unless he needed to and it was
precisely his self-imposed limitations
that created the necessity for him to
improve so I encourage all you men out
there to Define your Batman rules what
are the limitations that you are going
to choose to apply to your own lives not
because you need to not because you will
be punished if you don't but because you
understand that applying these
limitations will force you to become
better than you currently are
hopefully that makes sense what do you
think does this fit with your own
experience let me know in the comments
below I'd love to hear about some of
your Batman rules as always I appreciate
your support and thank you for listening
