So, this is going to sound a little
weird. However, I believe that even
though we're all born into human bodies,
we don't all become full human beings.

archetypal such journey for men. In the
story, Pinocchio undergoes an ordeal
that transforms him from a mere puppet
to a real boy, which could be considered
a transition from the potential of

from hardship. Certainly men can fail
and succumb in a variety of ways or they
can overcome and rise to the challenge
but they kind of can't avoid it
altogether. together.
