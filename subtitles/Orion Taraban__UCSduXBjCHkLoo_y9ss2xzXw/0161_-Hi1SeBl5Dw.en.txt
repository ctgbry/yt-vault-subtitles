i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is a
life and the concept of the game
so this is something that i've given a
great deal of thought to
and i've come to understand this
construct the game
is a fundamental lens through which we
can view life and even existence itself
life is a series of nested games
let me explain what i mean by that
a game
is anything with a goal
and rules
and anything with a goal and rules is a
game
that's it
you need both for a game to exist
if you only have a goal and no rules
then you just have chaos and confusion
and things tend towards dissolution
on the other hand if you only have rules
and no goal
then things tend to become restrictive
and ossified and that tends to strangle
life
so at both extremes is death
too much order is death and too much

[01:01]
too much order is death and too much
chaos is death
but if you put the goal in the context
of a set of rules then you have a game
and that's where life happens now when i
say that life is a game
i'm not suggesting that life is trivial
or frivolous games can be played very
seriously and they could also be played
with very high stakes
but they remain games nonetheless
let me explain what i mean by way of an
example
while we're alive we all have to play
the game of survival
and one of the many rules of that game
is that you have to keep 10 pints of
blood inside of you at all times
if you violate that rule you will lose
the game of survival you can argue about
how this shouldn't be the way that it is
or that you wish it were different but
that's just how it is and we know that
through observation that if you want to
continue to play the game of survival
you have to keep at least 10 pints of
blood inside of you that's why the 10

[02:01]
blood inside of you that's why the 10
pints rule is a rule we derive the rule
through induction
now survival isn't the only game we're
playing at any one time
within the game of life are many
many many other games
and we're often playing several of those
games simultaneously
and this is one of the sources of a good
deal of misunderstanding and suffering
on this planet you can win one game
while losing another and vice versa
by way of example people can also play
the game of honor
and one of the rules of that game is to
uphold your duty and commitments if you
violate that rule you will lose the game
of honor makes sense
now a person might find himself in a
situation where he is forced to choose
which of several competing games he
wants to win
and which of several competing games
he's willing to lose
for instance this person might be in a
situation such that his best bet of

[03:00]
situation such that his best bet of
keeping those ten pints of blood inside
of him is to betray his duty and flee
from the front lines of battle
in this case he would win the game of
survival but lose the game of honor
on the other hand if he stays in fights
he might win the game of honor but lose
the game of survival he can win one or
both or lose one or both but he can't
avoid playing
the number of games
is too many to mention there's the game
of physics there's the game of chemistry
there's the game of relationships
there's the game of money there's the
game of sex there's the game of
friendship there's the game of health
there's the game of kindness
and all of these games
are nested inside of the overarching
game of being alive
and we're playing many many many of
these games simultaneously whether we're
conscious of it or not
now i'm going to talk more about the
concept of the game in the future and
i'm putting this out as a general
introduction so people can understand
where i'm coming from stay tuned
