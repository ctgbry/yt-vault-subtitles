I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is dating is
like buying a car what does this mean
what you have to understand is that
every relationship is actually a
sustained negotiation between two people
what are we going to do together for
instance I might approach a woman with a
proposal let's have this kind of
relationship and she might counter with
no let's have this kind of relationship
ship who if anyone is going to get what
they want this has to be negotiated one
way or the other if the relationship is
to move forward now before I unpack the
ramifications of this observation please
remember to like this episode And
subscribe to the channel it takes less
than a second costs you nothing and I
would definitely do the same for you so
do the thing now if you accept the fact
that relationship that negotiation in
relationship is inescapable and

[01:01]
relationship is inescapable and
unavoidable you paradoxically have a
much better chance of getting what you
want this is why I tell my clients that
they should approach
dating and relationships like they would
approach buying a car you need to do
business with someone to buy a car and
in the beginning those business
interests are probably not really
aligned that is I want to buy the car
for the lowest price that I can and the
dealer wants to sell the car for the
highest price that he can our interests
are not aligned H but we still might
want to do business with each other
anyway now imagine I really wanted to
buy a car and I've been going around all
day from dealership to dealership and
I'm starting to get hopeless over the
prospect of ever finding a
car I like where have all the good cars
gone other people seem to have good cars

[02:00]
gone other people seem to have good cars
are there any good cars left why is this
so hard and then on the point of Despair
I walk into one final dealership and
wonder of Wonders I find this beautiful
car this high-powered muscle car that
checks all of my boxes and I decide yes
this is the car for me I will make it
mine I am not going to walk into that
dealership and say oh my God that is the
perfect car I absolutely love this car
just tell me what I have to do to get it
you want cash I got cash you want a
check just who do I make it out to do
you need to prove do you need me to
prove that I'm I'm worth it that I can
afford it well here are all my
financials I'm ready to buy this car no
matter what I would be putty in that
dealer's hands seeing my enthusiasm he
may even jack up the price of the car
because really what's his incentive not

[03:00]
because really what's his incentive not
to at that point and I might end up
pricing myself out of a good option
because of my own
ineptitude do you understand what I'm
getting at no matter how interested you
are in that car you need to walk into
that dealership and seem
indifferent oh
that yeah it's a nice car I guess I
don't really love the color is that a
dent I mean
we might be able to do something if the
price is right but I do have a few other
places I got to check out first that is
how you negotiate a good deal for your
car even if that car checks every single
one of your criteria you kind of have to
strategically pretend that it doesn't
because doing so puts you in a better
position of getting what you want people
have no problem doing this if it saves
them a few hundred however suggest that

[04:02]
them a few hundred however suggest that
they do the same thing in dating which
where the cost of getting a bad deal is
infinitely more expensive and people
suddenly become one big scruple this is
stupid this is stupid because it
indicates that they're willing to do
more to save a little money on a car
than they are to have the kind of
relationship they want to have with the
kind of person they want to have it with
don't be stupid now to continue the line
of thought from my previous episode The
reason why indifference works on people
is surprising think back to the
fundamental Law of Attraction people
want what they want not what wants them
this means that you cannot want someone
into wanting you and one of the reasons
why this is true is because if I'm
wanting you intensely I'm not really
giving you the opportunity to Want Me

[05:03]
giving you the opportunity to Want Me
intensely and that's a bad deal for
you why because if you don't want me
then I can't give you what you want
which is what everybody wants people
want to get what they want and by
pulling back and assuming indifference
you create the opportunity for others to
want you which is a prere isite for them
to get what they want it's also the only
real reason anybody is ever going to
take the trouble to deal with you at all
to get what they want if you're wanting
them more then the best they can do is
to give you what you want that is not an
attractive offer to most people because
people want to get what they want create
opportunities for this to occur what do
