The drive to do difficult, uncomfortable
things requires some pentup sexuality.
Civilization was not built by dissipated
libertines. That said, one of the goals
of civilization is to reduce discomfort
and make life easier. Our technologies
typically aim to satisfy our desires
more easily, more cheaply, more safely.
And of course, one of the technologies
that was bound to be invented by
sexually frustrated men is pornography.
By making relief from sexual frustration
cheap and available, we've inadvertently
undermined the drive to civilize and
conquer. Now, both of those actions are
problematic in today's day and age, to
say the least. So, no one is really
losing sleep over the absence of
conquering men. Conquering men are,
after all, dangerous men. But that same
drive to conquer a nation might be
related deep down to the drive to
conquer one's weakness, one's vice,
one's cowardice. It is the same drive to

one's cowardice. It is the same drive to
transform raw nature into something
useful and productive. So while we may
be relieved that there are fewer
Napoleons walking around these days,
many of us also seem to be asking where
have all the real men gone. The two
phenomena might actually be related to
the same forces.
