i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the reason why you exist
one way or another we all have to come
to grips with some of the existential
realities of being alive on this planet
what is the point of life what am i
supposed to do
why do i exist at all
now i'm not saying that i can
definitively answer these questions i'm
not really sure anyone can
but here's a perspective that i've
developed to provide a reasonably
satisfying response
people tend to get stuck on existential
questions when they introduce
unnecessary complexity
i'd like you to consider
that the point of life is to
experience life
what if it's that simple
we come here to this planet so that we
can fall in love and swim in the ocean
and feel the sunlight and experience
friendship and understand betrayal and

[01:00]
friendship and understand betrayal and
know the thrill of adventure and the
glory of triumph and the joys of
contentment and the pains of grief and
the brilliant intensity of midday and
the gentle warmth of dusk and to feel
very very big and very very small at the
same time
in short
we come
incarnate in life
in order to experience life
that's why you exist
a metaphor i often use with clients is
that life is like disneyland
the point of disneyland is to go on the
rides you go to disneyland to experience
disneyland you don't get anything else
from going
you can't win or lose disneyland you
can't do disneyland right or wrong
you can't do it perfectly and you can't
screw it up
if you want to go on the tea cups 50
times in a row because by god that's
your favorite ride you didn't do
disneyland badly by the same token if
you want to ride every single ride in

[02:02]
you want to ride every single ride in
that park you don't get a gold star
you didn't do disneyland well
in both cases you did what you wanted
and you had your experience
so life is like being in the park
which offers us this multiplicity of
experiences
we can ride the thrilling rides or the
gentle rides we can even spend our whole
time watching other people ride the
rides
each experience is different
but on some level they're all equally
existentially full
they all constitute
one day at disneyland
that's it
and at the end of the day
we all go home
there's no way to do it right there's no
way to do it wrong
there's no way to win there's no way to
lose
life is just a theme park of experiences
and when evening comes hopefully we'll
be able to leave with some good memories
