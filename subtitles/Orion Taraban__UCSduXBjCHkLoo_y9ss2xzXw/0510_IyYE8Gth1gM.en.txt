there was always something about the
passport Bros movement that felt a
little Sleazy and pathetic my
perspective was similar to the
prevailing attitude which was something
like this movement was for guys who were
too low status or unattractive to beat
out their intr seexual competition here
they couldn't get late in the states so
they basically engage in geoarbitrage to
leverage a relative advantage that
wouldn't exist in their home country I'm
not a fragile guy I'm not a loser who
can't get laid I'm not a guy without
options I don't need to travel halfway
around the world to have satisfying
relationships with women but I now
understand why it's in men's best
interest to seek out the most
advantageous marketplaces it's like
regardless of whether you're a novice or
a master fisherman if you want to catch
a certain kind of fish it makes sense to
go where there are more of those fishes
high value men who have lots of sexual
opportunity in the west will still
travel to other places where they can
get more of what they want more easily
