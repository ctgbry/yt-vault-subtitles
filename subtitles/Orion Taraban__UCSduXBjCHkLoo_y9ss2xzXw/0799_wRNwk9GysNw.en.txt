the metaphor I use for the sexual
Marketplace is that sexual Marketplace
is like this old timey dock where all
these ships are moed and at every
slippage there is a ship and a captain
standing in front of that ship and that
person is trying to attract passengers
on board and the passengers are walking
up and down the dock trying to find
let's say the most comfortable
affordable passage to where they want to
go so there's a kind of complimentarity
to captains and passengers but there
there's also a fundamental antagonism
they need each other but they're not
really aligned with their goals on some
level just think about kind of
commercial airlines think about the
relationship between how they handle
their business and how you buy a ticket
like they would just want to cram as
many people into their cabins as
possible for as much as they can get
away with and they just want you to like
shut up be docile and be taken to where
they wanted you to go on some level
passengers on the other hand they want
the most affordable ticket so the way
that they approach making a decision is
kind of antagonistic but they both have
to kind of make concessions to the other
if they want to do business with each
other
