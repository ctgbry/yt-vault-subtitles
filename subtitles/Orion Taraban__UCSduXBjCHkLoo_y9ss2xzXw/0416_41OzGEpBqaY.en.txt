I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of a day's short talk is why time
seems to move faster as we age this was
something that had long been mysterious
to me but today I'm going to share my
personal Theory with respect to why this
is the case
I believe that the subjective
acceleration of the passage of time is
largely a consequence of the overuse of
top-down cognitive heuristics as we age
okay let's do a quick review of what all
that means so there's kind of two ways
that human beings can perceive reality
we can perceive it bottom up or we can
perceive it top down
what does that mean bottom-up processing
means that we form our perceptions of
reality from raw sensory data collection
with few to know preconceptions of what
we are perceiving children for instance
can't help but be bottom-up processors
since they've never encountered much of

[01:02]
since they've never encountered much of
what they're experiencing before they
don't have many preconceptions of that
phenomena that's why when they're
presented with something new they try to
get as much raw sensory information as
they can they look at it from different
angles they smell it they put it in
their mouth they throw it around they
rattle it next to their ears children
are very curious about novel phenomena
this allows children to have let's say a
more direct experience with reality than
most adults and this is partly why
children tend to be more emotional than
adults as the experience of reality in
adults is mediated through their
conceptual Frameworks which tends to
remove them somewhat from direct contact
with reality mitigating their emotional
responsiveness however since children
tend to lack those conceptual Frameworks
their sensory experience is translated
directly into emotional reactivity
without any mitigating factors
Over time however humans kind of can't

[02:02]
Over time however humans kind of can't
help but rely more and more on top down
top down processing we get better at
perceiving reality so we need less raw
sensory data from which to extrapolate
our conceptual Frameworks most adults
aren't really paying attention
they're just paying enough attention for
their top-down processing to kick in
after which the blanks left by an
absence of sensory data are filled in
with what they expect to experience
in this way most adults are not
generally engaging with reality but with
their own extrapolated models of reality
generated through top-down processing
this allows them to move through life
more or less on autopilot which most
human beings are doing don't believe me
just go to the grocery store and look
around most people are just going
through the motions but their minds are
somewhere else entirely and this is a
fascinating phenomenon because like

[03:02]
fascinating phenomenon because like
these are their lives people will fight
for one more day of life but they're not
even present for that life most of the
time
why wouldn't people pay more attention
well before I answer that question if

super thanks button and tip me in
proportion to the value you feel you've
received from this episode I really
appreciate your support
well the reason why people increasingly
adopt a top-down processing style is
because it saves so much time and energy
relative to bottom-up processing think
about it it would be really really hard
to get anything done if we approached
every phenomenon like an infant action
would be difficult and inefficient if we
had to reinvent the wheel at every
moment because we weren't able to make
certain perceptual assumptions this

[04:01]
certain perceptual assumptions this
isn't a conscious Choice the mind just
kind of decides to take shortcuts so it
can free up those cognitive resources
for other tasks this is top down
processing
now it's my theory that the expenditure
of cognitive resources is related to the
subjective experience of time
I think we all kind of understand this
relationship from a purely mechanistic
perspective like when does time move
more quickly when you're relaxing on the
couch or sprinting on the treadmill
well
I think the same is true with respect to
cognitive resources meaning the fewer
cognitive resources are applied to
processing less information
the faster time seems to progress
in this way a night's sleep can seem to
pass in a few moments of unconsciousness
and those who fall into a coma are often
shocked to learn that months or years
have passed these of course are extreme
examples but they do Accord with the

[05:00]
examples but they do Accord with the
general rule level of cognitive
processing is inversely correlated with
the subjective passage of time
another extreme example that illustrates
this is a near-death experience this is
because almost everyone can be jolted
instantaneously into bottom-up
processing by the sudden imposition of
novelty or danger
this has been the case in my own
experience I've had a couple of
near-death experiences in my life one of
which involved getting swept up in a
river crossing in Kings Canyon National
Park
time was flowing regularly like it
always did until the instant I lost my
feet and I was swept up in the currents
instantly time slowed dramatically like
the river was barely moving I could see
drops of water suspended in midair as
they arced across the sky while the
internal experience of my thoughts
remained unchanged
I felt like I had all this time to take
in my situation and make a decision as

[06:01]
in my situation and make a decision as
to how best to get out of it though I
imagine the whole experience only lasted
a few seconds
this was not something that I
consciously did I had just never been
swept up by a river before so the
novelty of that experience effortlessly
switched me over to bottom up processing
which allowed me to pay very close
attention to the actual experience
circumstances I was in not the
circumstances I thought I was in but the
actual circumstances I was in and that
perceptual overdrive slowed down my
experience of time and this seems to be
a common experience among those who have
passed through similar situations
so how do we combat the acceleration of
the subjective passage of time without
risking Our Lives well in the first
place you might consider responsibly
injecting some danger into your life I
made an episode on that a long time ago
increasing the stakes generally wakes
people up however another way to do this
is to practice mindfulness

[07:01]
is to practice mindfulness
you can do this in a sitting meditation
but the stuff of your life is actually
better material for mindfulness practice
you can practice while you're working
you can practice while you're driving
you can even practice while you're at
the grocery store this is because
mindfulness is functionally a bottom-up
processing exercise in which you learn
to pay closer attention to the actual
moment-to-moment experience of your
Consciousness for longer periods of time
the more you practice mindfulness the
more you will train your mind to be able
to flexibly adopt a bottom-up processing
modality which should slow the
subjective experience of time
finally you can experiment with doing
less
time moves faster the busier you are
there are a lot of people out there who
are shocked shocked that it's may
already and we're almost halfway through
2023 and where does that time go
the biggest enemy of mindfulness is not

[08:02]
the biggest enemy of mindfulness is not
laziness it's not ignorance it's
busyness
and busyness is the decision to mistake
the ten thousand insignificant things
that you have to do every day as
actually important
be real with yourself is anyone going to
die if that doesn't get done
is the world going to fall apart
choose busyness as a lifestyle and your
life will pass you by I guarantee it
therefore to combat the acceleration of
the subjective passage of time you will
want to increase the amount of time
spent utilizing more of your cognitive
resources in bottom-up processing you
can do this by increasing danger or
challenge
improving your mindfulness practice and
combating busyness in your day-to-day
life
do this and you'll have twice as much
life without living an extra day
