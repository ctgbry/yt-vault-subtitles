when you think about I mean maybe the
last 20 30 years or so you know a lot
more women have been going into the the
workplace and they've been making equal
or more money than men right which I
think is a great thing but there's also
a trade-off there there's a huge
trade-off which is I think that most
women will only seriously consider a
long-term relationship if they stand if
they perceive that they will
significantly benefit I think that if
it's kind of a wash it's actually a loss
because they foreclose on future
opportunities that might be better and
if it's not going to improve their life
it's just like a automatic no-o for the
vast majority of women but what that
means as women become more successful
both in terms of their educational
attainment and their income and their
Lifestyles it's harder for men to offer
them a significantly better offer and a
lot of women I think understandably
might prefer to be single and
unpartnered than to be partnered with a
man that they perceive to be a liability
