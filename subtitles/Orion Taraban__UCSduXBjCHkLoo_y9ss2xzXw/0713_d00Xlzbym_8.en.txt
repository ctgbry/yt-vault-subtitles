I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is a horse
in the rain this is something of an
enigmatic title so I'm going to explain
where it comes from at the top of the
episode for a few years I had a gig as a
professor in a graduate psychology
department and I taught a class called
cognitive and effective bases of
behavior which is basically an
exploration of why people do the things
they do based on what they think and how
they feel a very important class
especially for clinicians and definitely
my favorite subject and over the course
of the semester We examined all the
different emotions that people are
subject to experiencing how they are
created and more to the point how to
dismantle them after all if you deeply
understand how emotions are created then
you will also understand how to uncreate
them which means that you don't really
ever have to experience an emotion that

[01:00]
ever have to experience an emotion that
you would prefer not to experience and
who wouldn't want to know how to do that
it's a powerful Suite of skills to avoid
unnecessary suffering and I remember one
semester on the last day of class A
student asked me a question he said Dr
taban we've spent the last three months
talking about emotions and all the
various ways to reduce the unnecessary
suffering associated with them but what
if you can't get away from it like what
if the suffering is necess necessary and
unavoidable what's the proper response
to that it was a great question and my
response was a question in
turn have you ever seen a horse in the
rain and he said yeah and I asked what
is that horse doing and he
said nothing and I said
exactly the proper response to
unavoidable human suffering is to do
nothing

[02:00]
nothing
to act like a horse in the rain this
entails both a radical acceptance of the
situation that doesn't give rise to
futile and potentially harmful attempts
to escape the inescapable and a
commitment to not make the situation
worse than it already is in your mind
what does that mean well a horse in the
rain isn't pitying itself it's not
seething at the Injustice of being wet
it's not catastrophizing with respect to
how the storm is going to go on forever
and it will never feel dry again for the
rest of its life it's not envying the
horses that get to stay in the barn but
it's also not masochistic he wouldn't
force himself to stay in the rain if
there were a shelter available he's not
torturing himself unnecessarily when
accessible and realizable solutions are
at hand nor does he succumb to despair
over his capacity to access and realize
those Solutions he's not furiously
running around trying to step in between
the rang drops do you understand he's

[03:00]
the rang drops do you understand he's
just standing there in the rain being
wet
correct we can learn a lot about
patients by examining animals and to my
mind a horse in the rain is about as
good of a symbol for patients as they
come ever wonder why we call people in
hospitals patients because what
primarily defines their role in that
setting is the necessity for them to
abide in suffering there's only only so
much doctors can do to accelerate the
healing process so the principal virtue
of a patient is
patience IE the willingness to abide in
suffering long enough for the treatment
to take effect and the suffering to
diminish and a big part of patients is
not doing anything to make your
situation even worse than it already is
which is exactly what you will succeed
in doing if you attempt to avoid
unavoidable suffering it takes a kind of
radical acceptance to be able to

[04:01]
radical acceptance to be able to
consider the possibility that at least
for now things are bad or painful or
unfavorable to action a horse that beat
the ground and thrashed against the
fence and tried to outrun the storm will
not only still be wet but will be wet
and injured or
exhausted if you appreciate the insights
on this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the

[05:03]
description now the good news here is
that the weather is going to change like
no matter what you are going through it
will change this is why the proper
response to necessary human suffering is
to do what you can to tolerate the
situation and wait in Hope for the
moment to pass because it will no matter
what it is for better or worse it will
there is no place on earth that is
perpetually rainy nothing persists
indefinitely and everything is in a
continual process of becoming what it is
this is very important if you ever find
yourself in the jaws of life then you
need to stop thrashing thrashing about
only digs its teeth deeper into your
flesh a better strategy is to accept for
the moment that you're in the jaws of
life and to wait in hope for a more
propitious moment to escape which might
occur as the situation changes and an

[06:02]
occur as the situation changes and an
opportunity presents
itself radical acceptance occurs when we
stop fighting like internally fighting
our circumstances it's a form of
strategic surrender it's a decision to
stop insisting on your preferences
whatever they might be for the present
moment and this significantly helps to
reduce the avoidable component of
suffering that often gets projected onto
the unavoidable component which just
tend to exacerbate the problem take
physical cold for instance people shiver
because they want to be warm I know that
sounds simple and kind of dumb but it's
true on the other hand if you can like
breathe in the cold and embrace it and
let it seep inside of you and accept the
fact that you are going to feel cold
then you often will stop shivering in
the majority of cases shivering is more
of a psychological response than an
involuntary AR biological reflex this is

[07:01]
involuntary AR biological reflex this is
because most of the time when people
shiver they're not actually in danger of
freezing like their lives are not at
stake so they're not shivering to stay
alive they're shivering because they
prefer to be warm and are therefore in
conflict with the present moment if for
whatever reason warmth is not possible
in that situation then surrendering the
preference for warmth is adaptive and
will allow you to suffer less than you
otherwise would and once you master this
you can take it to the next level by
choosing to be cold or choosing whatever
present conditions you are dealing with
this will cause your attitude to
radically shift in relation to the
present moment and will Forstall a good
deal of the judgments that are actually
responsible for our suffering are
entirely avoidable and are too often
conflated with the unavoidable
circumstances of the present moment
choosing the present moment often allows
you to pass through the difficult
experience more quickly this is a lesson

[08:01]
experience more quickly this is a lesson
we can learn from the American Bison who
will instinctively walk into a blizzard
this is because storms move quickly if
the Bison were to turn around and try to
outrun the storm they would just be
overtaken by the blizzard and this would
mean that the Bison would actually spend
more time in the storm overall on the
other hand by walking into the blizzard
bison decrease the total amount of time
in the storm as it will pass over them
more quickly as a result pretty smart
huh it's a wonderful image of Reliance
and perfectly illustrates how our
attempts to escape suffering can often
endanger us even further so that's what
I have for you today be a horse in the
rain radically accept your situation
choose it if possible or at the very
least be very cautious about your
judgments with respect to how you would
prefer things to be as this is the
mainspring of the avoidable suffering
that tends to arise around unavoidable

[09:02]
that tends to arise around unavoidable
suffering abide in the hope that the
moment will change in time and hang in
