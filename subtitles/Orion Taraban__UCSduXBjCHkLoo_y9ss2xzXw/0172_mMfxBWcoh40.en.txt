i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
update your browser
so this is a metaphor i often use with
my clients in which i ask them to
examine whether or not their operating
system that is the beliefs that
determine how they interact with
themselves other people in the world
are up to date
updating your browser is annoying
when the notification pops up
most people reflexively just postpone
the update it's inconvenient it takes
time it interrupts our process i get it
however it's also absolutely essential
to the efficient and effective operation
of that browser here's the thing
most people generally come to their
beliefs honestly most folks aren't crazy
their beliefs are extrapolated
generalizations based on their actual
lived experience
the issue
is that these beliefs are often
generalizations from a very limited data
set especially if they come from

[01:00]
set especially if they come from
adolescence or childhood
many of these attitudes that people
carry about men or about women or about
relationships or about life in general
are based in a small subset of
experiences
during certain sensitive periods in
their lives like childhood and
adolescence
those beliefs might have been valid
extrapolations from that data set
but it might also be inappropriate to
expect that those beliefs remain valid
decades later in light of new
information
the way to deal with this problem is
similar to the way that we train
machines in machine learning if a
machine arrives at invalid
generalizations based on a skewed data
set
the programmers correct this problem
by flooding the machine
with better more reliable data
the skewed or bad data never really go
away
however over time these bad data becomes
sufficiently insignificant to affect the
overall architecture of the program
and that's kind of how it is in life too

[02:02]
and that's kind of how it is in life too
we can't really permanently delete those
experiences that may have led us to
extrapolate certain beliefs but we can
have more positive experiences or
disconfirming experiences and
extrapolate more generally appropriate
beliefs from this larger data set
and this is what we do when we update
our browsers we examine whether our
beliefs still hold true in light of new
information and experience and in the
vast majority of cases this is an
effortful intentional process it's not
fun but it's something that
we we got to do from time to time what
