How should men be approaching the modern
dating marketplace to maximize their
success? Well, I made an episode
recently called How to Meet Women and I
talk about how in 2025 there are four
ways to meet women. There are dating
apps, cold approach or pickup, social
circle, which is like where you work,
where you pray, where you live, where
you play, and social media. And it's not
an mutually exclusive thing. Like on
some level, if a man is really serious
about finding someone, he's spinning up
all four of these wheels at the same
time. And each one has their pros and
cons. Each one requires a different
approach if you're really going to
master it. It's like what works on
LinkedIn doesn't always work on
Instagram and vice versa. Um, but the
fact is that it's like there's good
women everywhere
&gt;&gt; because there's so many people
everywhere. But you might have to be
very specific about what you're looking
for. You might have to be more strategic
in your approaches and you might have to
go on a lot of dates, a lot of dates
before you find really uh what you might

before you find really uh what you might
be seeking. Like there there are plenty
of good women out there, but they're the
minority. Just like there's plenty of
good men out there, but they're also the
minority. But fortunately, there's
billions of people. So even if they're
the minority, there's still millions of
options.
