In terms of cold approach, what are your
thoughts on that? Cold approach again
has its pros and cons. I do think that
it's very useful for a man to feel like
he can do that. Like it's fantastic for
his confidence and his self-esteem to
have the felt sense of success that I
can go out and make something happen if
I need to. Like I can approach a woman.
I can engage her emotions. I can have a
conversation and I can successfully, if
I choose to, direct the interaction in
the direction of a sexual encounter.
That does wonders for a man's
confidence. And that's a virtuous cycle.
The more confident becomes, the more
likely he's going to be successful in
that approach. Again, one of the
liabilities is cold approach can take a
long time to get good at. It's a skill
and you have to suffer through a great
deal of rejection. It's kind of like
becoming a master telemarketer, I would
think. It's like, how many times are you
going to get hung up on? How many times
are you going to get yelled at? How many

are you going to get yelled at? How many
times are you just going to be told no,
no, no, no, no, and have the door slam
in your face. Like, you have to get
through that period of suck in order to
develop any kind of mastery in any skill
set. The issue is that's a pretty hard
cliff for a lot of guys. And so they
just shy away from ever mastering that
skill. Or even worse, they just do it
here and there. And so they don't get in
enough reps and all they get is negative
feedback. And that really spoils their
perception of women and the dating pool
in general.
