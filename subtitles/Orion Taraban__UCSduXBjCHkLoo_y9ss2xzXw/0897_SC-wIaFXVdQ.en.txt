The simplest way to explain what women
want in general terms is this. Women
want what other women want. There it is.
Women want what other women want. It's
true, but kind of unsatisfying.
Especially because we very quickly run
into a chicken and the egg type of
problem. Namely, if women want what
other women want, how do those other
women decide what they want? In response
to this, we might have to consider
female desire to be a kind of emergent
phenomenon that is normatively rooted in
a certain time and place. Consider
women's fashion. Yes, the designers in
Milan and New York already know what
they're going to be pushing for the
spring lineup 2 years from now. They're
attempting to influence taste, but they
cannot dictate it. Despite their best
efforts, the particular look that will
go viral in any given season is still
anyone's guess. It just kind of emerges
out of the profusion of individual
choices at the population level. And

choices at the population level. And
once that look gets established because
it's adopted by a critical mass of
women, it becomes the standard against
which individuals are compared for as
long as it remains the norm. And this is
how in a given time and place, a sizable
majority of women always seem to kind of
look the same despite the fact that
their fashions are constantly changing.
