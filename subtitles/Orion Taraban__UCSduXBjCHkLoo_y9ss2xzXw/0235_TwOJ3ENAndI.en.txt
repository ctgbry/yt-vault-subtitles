I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
be careful about asking for advice
so I learned this lesson the hard way
there was a time in my life several
years ago when I was feeling very
confused and uncertain and so I went to
some of the mentors in my community and
asked them what I should do and because
I was so panicked and desperate in that
moment I ended up asking the advice of a
lot of people maybe 10 people in total
and this was a problem because lo and
behold when I asked 10 people for advice
I received 10 different responses to
make matters worse some of those
responses were mutually exclusive I mean
intelligent folks that I respected gave
me completely contradictory Direction
and this just added to my trouble
because now even if I were to follow the

[01:00]
because now even if I were to follow the
advice of one of these folks the other
nine are going to look at what I
ultimately do and think what the hell
I sat down with Orion I listened to his
troubles I went out of my way to give
him advice that he asked me for and he
still didn't follow it
those folks are understandably going to
be less disposed to help me out in the
future because they saw how I treated
their advice in the past
and this was really my fault I got
myself into a situation where I could
not fail to disobey some of the advice
that I was given because I just asked so
many folks for help
so the lesson here is that you need to
be very careful about asking for advice
you should only ask advice from people
who already have what you want or who
already know how to do what you want to
be able to do
and you should limit the amount of
people from whom you ask advice to avoid
the situation that I found myself in

[02:02]
the situation that I found myself in
and finally you should avoid the
question what should I do entirely
a much better question to ask these
folks is what would you do if you were
in my situation
this is an excellent question for two
reasons in the first place to the extent
that they can empathically put
themselves inside of your circumstances
they're going to give a response that
reflects their own self-interest and
oftentimes what people would do in their
own self-interest
doesn't exactly align with how they
believe other people should behave
for instance a dirty secret of the
medical profession is that most
oncologists would not undergo
chemotherapy if they had cancer
themselves
so it's also a great question to ask
your doctor
and in the second place by asking what
would you do if you were in my situation
you're not bound as rigidly to follow
the advice as you might have been if you

[03:01]
the advice as you might have been if you
had asked what should I do
the response here won't be an explicit
direction to you personally so it gives
you some space to accept it or not as a
suggestion
