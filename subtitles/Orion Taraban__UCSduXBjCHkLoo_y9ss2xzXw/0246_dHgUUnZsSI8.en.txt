in my recent episode how to be
extraordinary in life
fxtr dr4
expressed that while these were noble
sentiments that's a recipe for being
taken advantage of
and i would have to respectfully
disagree i don't believe that it is
possible to take advantage of true
humility
now if someone is acting humble because
they believe it will help them get what
they want or keep them safe or to
achieve some other desired end
they would be wrong
in many cases
in in which case they might be taken
advantage of because they were operating
under a covert contract they believed
that by giving or foregoing in a certain
manner they would have
the right to enjoy certain outcomes and
that's not necessarily true
true humility however is a gift that is
given spontaneously expects nothing in
return and therefore cannot be taken
advantage of
