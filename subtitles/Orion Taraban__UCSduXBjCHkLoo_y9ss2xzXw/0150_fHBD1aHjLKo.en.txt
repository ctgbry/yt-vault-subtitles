i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
you will never have enough
have you
ever seen
enough money
i
haven't i don't know if enough money
exists in reality and if it doesn't
exist it's not something you can have
same goes for the other things that
folks generally chase after enough love
enough sex enough pleasure enough
achievement enough power
enough
is something that doesn't exist in the
extensive universe it exists in the
intensive universe it exists inside of
us it's a psychological quantity
diogenes that punk rock cynic
philosopher once said that he who has
the most
is the one who is contented with the
least and i think that's a really useful
way of evaluating the concept of enough
enough is when we mentally decide to

[01:02]
enough is when we mentally decide to
stop wanting more
when we perceive our present
circumstances as sufficient
our needs as humans are actually very
very simple the vast majority of us have
what we need and then some and while our
needs are limited our wants our desires
if undisciplined are subject to being
unlimited
think about it
the mind left unchecked is never
satisfied
the body which is often more connected
to reality is satisfied but the mind is
not the mind will crave more food when
the body says it's full
the mind will desire sex even minutes
after the body says it's been satisfied
the mind will want more and more money
even after all of its desires have been
paid for
left undisciplined and unchecked the
mind will continue to want and to want

[02:01]
mind will continue to want and to want
more and these uncurbed desires are the
source of so much suffering on this
planet
the perception of sufficiency which is a
core component of contentment is a
decision
it requires our will
which imposes limits on unlimited desire
so that it can be more aligned with
reality
and doing this actually allows us to
live in abundance
if our desires are not curbed by our
wills then we will perpetually believe
that we don't have enough
which is scarcity mentality on the other
hand if we restrict ourselves and limit
our unlimited desires then we will find
ourselves in a world of abundance
where there's more than enough to go
around
