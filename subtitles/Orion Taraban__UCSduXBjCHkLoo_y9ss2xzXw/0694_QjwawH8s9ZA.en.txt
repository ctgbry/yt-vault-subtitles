I think women still want to enter into
relationships that will significantly
improve their standard of living and
because they're doing so well that
diminishes the pool of potential
candidates that they're likely to main I
think you've done videos on this where
you talk about like how women have
priced themselves out of the data market
and there's this sort of Chasm that
exists where you have all these female
captains now and then you have male
captains and male captains don't really
need a female Captain they certainly
don't want their boat if they have a
better boat what is the solution to this
void that like this Chasm that's being
created you know between men and women
cuz women have have been told go out
there put off having a family climb the
corporate ladder get a degree is there
anybody out there talking to women and
giving them useful actionable advice so
that they can get what they want earlier
on in life with respect to their
long-term goals not that I'm aware of
most of the content that I'm aware
that's directed towards women is about
getting what they want at that stage in
their life which in their 20s is
generally not about starting a family
and finding a long-term partner For
Better or For Worse
