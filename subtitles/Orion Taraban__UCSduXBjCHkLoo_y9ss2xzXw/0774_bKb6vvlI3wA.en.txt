the emotional connection starts to
disappear when you begin to prioritize
another Bond ahead of the one you
cultivated with your ex and when your ex
apparently succeeds in doing this first
it can really hurt what I've discovered
and this is especially true for guys is
that men typically do not grieve a
relationship when it ends they grieve it
when they learn that their ex is now
seriously involved with someone else
this is because you don't lose someone
when you break up with them or stop
talking to them or start dating other
people you lose them when they begin to
move on with someone else when you learn
through her decisions that another man
is now enshrined in her heart and this
happens gradually you don't lose someone
all at once it's this knowledge and the
pain it can create that can motivate men
to urgently and desperately seek to
preserve a bond that they feel is
slipping away this could be months or
even years after the official
termination of a relationship and it's
why programs that purport to get your ex
back constitute a billion dooll industry
