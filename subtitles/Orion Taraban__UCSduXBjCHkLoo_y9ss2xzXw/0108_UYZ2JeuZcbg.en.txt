i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the town liar lies
so this is a concept that i like to keep
in mind whenever i'm personally dealing
with or helping someone else deal with
the frustrating or disappointing
behavior of others and the metaphor that
i like to use in these situations is
the town liar lies
that's what the town liar does the town
liar lies if you go to the town liar
expecting to hear the truth
at a certain point it's your own damn
fault if you get your feelings hurt over
being lied to
that's because the town liar
lies by definition the town hater hates
the town cheater cheats the town whiner
whines and the town gossip gossips it's
what they do
now when i present this metaphor to my
clients often i get a little bit of
pushback at this point
typically in the form of a moral
rebuttal well

[01:01]
rebuttal well
they shouldn't do that they they
shouldn't lie
well
i'd like to argue that a liar should lie
lying is what makes the liar a liar the
cheater should cheat
if the cheater didn't cheat the cheater
wouldn't be a cheater
if the whiner didn't wind the whiner
wouldn't be a whiner and so this line of
reasoning makes no sense
liars should lie haters should hate and
so on
and then we get to the real crux of the
problem
disbelieving that the town liar is
actually a liar that the town gossip is
actually a gossip etc
there's a refusal to accept reality in
this regard
and my response to that is generally
look
if it looks like a duck
and walks like a duck
quacks like a duck
it's probably a duck
so if this is someone who talks like a
liar and acts like a liar
and lies like a liar

[02:00]
and lies like a liar
then it's probably a liar more likely
than not right
believing that something that looks and
walks and quacks like a duck could be
and should behave like an eagle or a
penguin or an ostrich makes no sense at
all
at bottom of this frustration we
discover as is often the case an
unwillingness to accept a certain aspect
of reality this is what gets us into
trouble
however by continuing to increase our
acceptance of reality of what is over
and above what should be
we typically become less frustrated and
more effective
and that's what i got to say about that
