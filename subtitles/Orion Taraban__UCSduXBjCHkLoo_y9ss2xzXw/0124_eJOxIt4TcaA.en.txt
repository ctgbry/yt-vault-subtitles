i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
thoughts
aren't private
it took me
a long time to figure this out
when i was younger i used to believe
that my mind was something like a sealed
off laboratory where i could think
whatever i wanted in the privacy of my
own consciousness without consequence
as long as i didn't speak or act on my
thoughts i believed my thinking to be
hidden from the rest of the world
i no longer believe this to be true
and there are two main reasons why
the first is a corollary to my episode
on feelings are impersonal
you are free to think whatever you want
but you are not free to feel however you
want as a consequence of what you choose
to think
so for example if you think a lot of
self-loathing self-deprecating thoughts
you're not really free to feel confident
and self-assured or on the other hand if

[01:00]
and self-assured or on the other hand if
you think a lot on the oppressive
injustice of the world you're not really
free to feel peaceful and content
how you think in large part dictates how
you feel and those feelings are
generally observable so our thoughts are
disclosed through our emotions makes
sense
now there's a second reason why i
believe that thoughts aren't private and
that has to do with the fact that i'm
just not a good enough actor
if i harbor negative judgments about
other people it's really only a matter
of time before my unconscious
communication betrays the presence of
those judgments the betrayal could be in
a glance it could be in a word choice it
could be in a gesture it could be in a
tone of voice
but over a long enough timeline we can
expect that it will be something
personally i'm just not a good enough
actor to control all aspects of my
behavior all of the time in order to

[02:02]
behavior all of the time in order to
prevent the disclosure of that attitude
to someone who is even remotely
sensitive to nonverbal communication
this is really really important
especially with respect to people who
you have to interact with on a regular
basis
if you start to think ah this guy is a
clown or i i gotta talk with this joker
then the more likely it will be
that those attitudes will subsequently
be betrayed by your unconscious
nonverbal communication better to
challenge them in c2
using the block and replace technique
