i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is fouling
is part of the game
so it's easiest to introduce this
concept through the metaphor of sports
do you think that a basketball team
could be competitive in the nba
if they made an organizational
commitment never to commit a foul
that is if they were to commit to
playing by the rules of the game as
strictly and honorably as possible
it would be almost inconceivable for
such a team to remain competitive
against other organizations of
comparable talent and ability that
didn't restrict themselves so
unnecessarily the fact of the matter is
that the top players
know the rules of the game
intimately
and
they also know when to break these rules
strategically
fouling is part of the game
if you refuse to foul out of principle

[01:02]
if you refuse to foul out of principle
then you are condemning yourself to
sub-optimal outcomes
now just to be clear i'm not suggesting
that you foul randomly or flagrantly
however i am very much encouraging you
to foul purposefully and intelligently
we need to exercise prudence and
discretion here and to strive for
moderation
too much rule following and obedience
can be just as counterproductive as too
much rule breaking and disobedience
optimization lies in the sweet spot
somewhere between the two extremes
but what do you think feel free to drop
