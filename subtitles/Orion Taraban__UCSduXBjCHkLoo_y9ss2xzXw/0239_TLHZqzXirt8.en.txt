i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the truth about commitment
this is an ugly truth as it's one of the
factors that's primarily responsible for
the sorry state of modern dating
it's not exactly that commitment no
longer exists
however
if you objectively examine our culture's
standards for romantic relationships
these do not even approach the idea of
commitment in any reasonable capacity
it comes down to this
if you are committed up until the point
that you are not
you are never committed to begin with
like benedict arnold was committed to
the americans up until the point that he
was committed to the british
and we don't really hold him up as a
paragon of loyalty and commitment do we
on the other hand we say that he was a
traitor
even though he was loyal to the causes

[01:00]
even though he was loyal to the causes
he fought for while he was fighting for
them
the vast majority of us are in at-will
relationships that can be ended at any
time without any real consequences
even our most committed relationship the
institution of marriage is an at-will
relationship that can be broken at any
time
unilaterally by either one of the
parties for no fault of the other
and can come not only with no negative
consequences but often with significant
benefits
to the party who breaks the agreement
and this is the outcome that occurs more
than half of the time
to my mind the commitment that i just
described
is not worth the paper that it's printed
on
if anything it's a liability because it
gives people the illusion of security
the illusion of commitment that's just
not supported by the reality of the
agreement

[02:00]
agreement
so the vast majority of quote unquote
committed relationships in my opinion
aren't actually committed
because they can be broken at will at
any time unilaterally by one party with
no consequence
so if people are committed until they're
bored or until their feelings change or
until they find a better option
i mean let's call a spade a spade that's
not commitment that's opportunism
and we would all probably be better off
if we had the moral integrity
not to masquerade the one for the other
okay so does that mean that commitment
doesn't exist in the modern age no it
doesn't mean that but if you're
searching for commitment in the verbal
or written agreement between two people
you're barking up the wrong tree
as i've already said those agreements
are not real commitments
the real commitment that continues to
exist today
is a promise with yourself
potentially before a higher power

[03:02]
potentially before a higher power
to behave in a certain way
this is the decision to abide by a
certain standard of conduct that is
voluntarily embraced and continuously
renewed by the person in question
while rare this commitment does still
exist in fact it's the spiritual core of
marriage
which is a solemn vow of the individual
not to someone else but before god
it has little to do
with the contracts and agreements that
people make with each other which are
broken every day of the week
so if you're looking for a commitment
it's better to look inside yourself
than to look to the other
the other person can declare their love
from the rooftops and give you a ring
and sign the papers
and none of those things is actually a
reasonable guarantee that that person
will be there a year from now
when circumstances might be different
that might sound jaded but just look

[04:01]
that might sound jaded but just look
around
if we're going to have any semblance of
trust and sanity we need to open our
eyes and accept the reality of our
institutions
