I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is emotions
are never irrational
that's right emotions are never
irrational and that's because they can't
be it's not possible for an emotion to
be irrational only attempts at reason
can be rational or irrational it's also
not possible for an emotion to be
illogical only attempts at logic can be
logical or illogical emotions make no
claim to either reason or logic so they
cannot be irrational or illogical any
more than they can be rational or
logical here's the thing behind every
emotion is a thought now I'm using the
word thought in its widest possible
sense thought could be a conscious
cognition or an unconscious belief or a
perception or judgment
but in almost all cases there's some
form of thought that precedes the
emotion you think something you validate

[01:02]
emotion you think something you validate
it as true and the body produces the
emotional correlate of that thought in
fact that's one way to think about
emotions they're embodied cognitions
this is why at the core of every hyper
emotional person you'll find an
overactive mind
now once an emotion is present calling
it illogical or irrational is useless it
has already manifested itself so this is
just a kind of name calling that refuses
to accept reality
and all feelings are valid like
regardless of the emotion anxious or
angry or jealous or proud that emotion
exists and your experience of that
emotion existing inside of you is valid
but here's the thing not all emotions
are Justified
valid and Justified are two different
things all emotions are valid not all

[02:00]
things all emotions are valid not all
emotions are Justified what does this
mean
if behind every emotion is a thought and
thinking can be irrational or illogical
then it's entirely possible that we
might be experiencing a valid emotional
reaction
to an irrational or illogical thought
in fact it's probably safer to say that
the exception is when this doesn't
happen
the objective truth of the matter is
irrelevant the mind can believe anything
is true and once it does so the person
will experience the emotional correlate
of the content of that belief actually
it's probably true to say that the
person can't not experience the
emotional correlate of the content of
that belief
in short emotions are valid but the
thinking on which those emotions are
based might not be entirely aligned with
reality in fact big emotional swings are
generally a sign that one's thinking is

[03:01]
generally a sign that one's thinking is
not well aligned with reality as reality
doesn't tend to change significantly
from one moment to the next it more or
less continues on as it always has so
the more a person's thinking is in line
with reality the fewer egocentric
emotions tend to fluoresce which is
generally experienced as peace
in any case it can be difficult to
determine within the subjectivity of our
own Consciousness whether our feelings
are Justified the best way I found
around this problem is to run my
thinking through emotional specific
protocols let me explain what I mean
with a concrete example
an emotion that a lot of guys struggle
with is guilt this is especially true of
nice guys who often experience intense
guilt reactions when they consider
disappointing or saying no to a woman
now there are many reasons why they may
have become possessed of the belief that

[04:00]
have become possessed of the belief that
saying no is transgressive most likely
having to do with their experiences in
childhood and their relationship with
their mothers but that's neither here
nor there for the purposes of this
conversation my point is that the
experiences of these men
are valid they really do feel guilty
regardless of whether they should feel
that way but that their emotions might
not be justified

now guilt exists for a reason there is a
reason why we evolved over millions of
years to be able to experience guilt

[05:01]
years to be able to experience guilt
just like every other emotion
the overarching reason is that emotions
when they are Justified are incredibly
useful in motivating adaptive Behavior
take guilt
throughout most of human history humans
have lived in tribes and small
communities breaking our commitments to
the community or violating the moral or
ethical standards of the tribe would be
subject to punishments including Exile
which was functionally a death sentence
even in the Modern Age it would be very
very difficult for individuals to
survive on their own in the wilderness
so guilt is both a warning that those
commitments or standards may have been
violated and a powerful impetus in
motivating adaptive Behavior which in
this case would look like expressing
remorse and making amends
these behaviors might appease the social
forces that might otherwise boot the
individual from the tribe which would

[06:01]
individual from the tribe which would
threaten the individual's survival so
that's why guilt exists
all right so what we have to understand
is that for Guilt to be justified there
has to be a violation of a commitment or
a breach of an ethical standard
generally this looks like not doing
something you were committed to do
something you are committed not to do or
transgressing the express ethical or
moral code of the relationship
organization or society in which you are
operating
those are the justifiable reasons to
feel guilty
so when I'm working with someone who's
feeling guilty I say okay that's how
you're feeling that feeling is valid but
let's take a look at whether that
feeling is Justified
and we run that feeling through the
guilt-specific protocol
do you did you not do something you
committed yourself to doing
no
did you do something you committed
yourself not to do
no
did you violate the explicit moral or

[07:02]
did you violate the explicit moral or
ethical code of your relationship
no
if the answer all three of those
questions is no then that feeling is not
justified
the guilts likely manifested due to a
deeper possibly unconscious belief about
say how men should behave relative to
women in relationships which was not
entirely based on reality because it was
neither predicated on negotiated
commitments or explicit responsibilities
in this case the guilt would be
unjustified and inappropriate and of
course if the answer to any of those
questions is yes then the guilt might in
fact be justified and appropriate and
the individual should move forward with
his impulses to remorse and amends
making
and what should you do if you run an
emotion through a protocol like this and
reason that the feeling is unjustified
easy just consider how the feeling is

[08:00]
easy just consider how the feeling is
telling you to behave and behave in the
opposite way
nahan calls this opposite action and
it's very effective so if guilt is
telling me to apologize and make amends
but I reason that my guilt is
unjustified then I need to make a
commitment not to apologize after all
just because a person might be upset
with me doesn't mean that I've
necessarily done anything wrong
and to kind of double down on my
position and stand tall
either way Mike guilt should start to
Abate with time if I reason that my
guilt is Justified and I relent to the
behavioral impulse to make amends then
having satisfied the emotional impulse
the feeling should start to fade
and if I reason that my guilt is not
justified and I consciously Implement a
commitment to opposite action then the
feeling should also Fade with time this
is because behaving at odds with my
emotional experience produces cognitive
dissonance which is almost always

[09:00]
dissonance which is almost always
eventually resolved on the side of
behavior because it's what we're
actually doing that is the most accurate
barometer of how we should actually feel
so either way the emotional experience
should diminish with time just keep in
mind that if you're not used to opposite
action the emotional experience will
likely get more intense before it starts
to abate
I used guilt in this specific example
but there is a protocol for literally
every emotion that a human being has the
capacity to feel
the key here is to understand that while
no emotion is irrational emotions are
often produced from irrational thinking
and this thinking can be more frequently
recognized with protocols like this
