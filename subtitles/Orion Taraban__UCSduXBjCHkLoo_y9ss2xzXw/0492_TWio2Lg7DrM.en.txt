I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is
understanding frame
frame is a very important concept and
its existence often invisibly lies at
the core of all relationships it can
also be kind of hard to Define for the
time being think of frame as the world
in which the relationship exists are you
living in her world or is she living in
yours
now to illustrate this concept I'd like
to offer an anecdote from a recent
consultation I had with a listener I've
changed some details to protect his
identity and I'm offering this anecdote
not to shame or belittle the guy because
the fact of the matter is that I take
this call almost every day but because
his case is so emblematic of a situation
that probably millions of men on this
planet are experiencing right now the
details might change from person to
person but the core issue is extremely

[01:02]
person but the core issue is extremely
prevalent
so I get this call from a 30 year old
guy living in Washington state he tells
me that his situation is very urgent
can't wait he has to speak to me right
away and that he needs to make a
decision in the next week apparently
he's been in a long distance
relationship with a 36 year old woman
living in Indiana for several years at
this point the woman was more or less
demanding that he moved to Indiana and
start a family with her as she was
approaching the end of her reproductive
window
the guy was a mess he told me that he
loved and cared for the woman and he
didn't want to lose the relationship it
was the second relationship with a woman
he had ever had that said he told me
that they had broken up and gotten back
together several times over the last few
years and that he had no interest in
living in Indiana he was concerned that
without any friends or family of his own
in the area he would functionally have
to spend what little time he had left
over from work and the baby with her

[02:00]
over from work and the baby with her
friends and family
at the point at which he called me he
was considering moving forward with the
agreement as long as he could secure a
promise from her that he could have an
hour or two to himself every day
and after about 10 minutes I just told
him to stop stop talking
the man was so fully anchored at the
woman's offer so fully in the woman's
frame and so unaware of this reality
that he would consider himself fortunate
if he was allowed an hour of his own
life every day for himself
he was negotiating for scraps and he
couldn't see it
and he also fully bought into the
fallacy that it was either the offer the
woman put on the table or Nothing at All
which just isn't true though if it's
successful it's a powerful negotiation
tactic
this guy was so behind the eight ball
that he couldn't see anything beyond the

[03:01]
that he couldn't see anything beyond the
limited options presented by this woman
which probably more than anything else
is emblematic of a man who has
completely abdicated frame
and a lot of guys find themselves in
this situation
now this is going to sound harsh this is
going to sound cold but what I counsel
men to do in this situation
is to ignore what the [ __ ] the woman
wants like pretend even if just for a
second you don't even know what the
woman wants erase her wanting from your
memory
and ask yourself what do you want
and you know what
a lot of guys have never asked
themselves this question before at least
as it pertains to women and they don't
usually have a ready answer
in fact they often respond with this
look of disbelief on their face that
says
you mean I have a choice
yes my brother you have a choice you do

[04:02]
yes my brother you have a choice you do
have a choice and you don't yet feel
like you do because the only way that
you've been able to secure your limited
access to women is by catering to their
desires
but this is not the only way not by a
long shot
now before I get any pushback for this
suggestion let's briefly consider what
this woman is actually doing in this
situation she is functionally demanding
on the threat of revoking the
relationship that this man give up his
life and enter into hers in Indiana she
has her house and her job and her family
and her friends and she wants babies on
her timeline and the presumption is that
the man continued to work to bankroll
this lifestyle to pay for what she wants
she's not going to take care of him for
his sacrifices the reward for his
sacrifices is that he gets to take care
of her

[05:00]
of her
what's more this woman knows this man's
reservations and reasonable concerns
knows that he has no interest in living
in Indiana
and she's demanding all of this anyway
while I'm asking this man to imagine
what he would do if he was ignorant of
This Woman's desires this woman is
actually behaving like she could give a
single [ __ ] about what this man wants
this isn't hypothetical this is actual
and she's doing this with total impunity
like she might not even think that what
she's doing is selfish or unusual after
all she's got to do her
this thought experiment works because it
invites men to consider how they would
live
if they could live like a woman

and you can also hit the thanks button
it's in the lower right hand corner

proportion to the value you feel you've
derived from this message
it's support from viewers like you that
make all this happen I don't have a lot
of product placements or endorsements I
depend on your support to keep things
going and I really appreciate it thank
you
so how to respond to all of this
the first step is for men to seriously
consider how they want to live their
lives it's not for me to tell people how
to live each person has to figure out
that for himself or herself and I say
their lives I mean that in all of its
aspects not just as pertains to women or
relationships ask yourself the following
questions is there a woman in my vision
if so what is she doing there what is
her role in your life are there children

[07:00]
her role in your life are there children
in my vision
if so how am I going to raise them what
values do I want to bring into their
lives Etc
and once the man has figured out what he
wants once he has built his resources
and extrapolated his lifestyle he can
then flip the script and make an offer
to a woman
and just to be clear this is not a
simple role reversal this is because in
order to compensate for the sacrifices
she might make to enter into his frame
the man typically provides provision
protection and a better lifestyle than
the woman could hope to provide for
herself
these compensations are what typically
differentiate women's offers from Men's
women's offers are generally come into
my world and take care of me
This Is Why women's offers generally
suck
on the other hand men's offers are
typically come into my world and I will

[08:00]
typically come into my world and I will
take care of you
big difference
okay back to my anecdote later in the
session I told this guy look imagine you
were ignorant of what this woman wanted
imagine you didn't know that this woman
was approaching the end of her
reproductive window and really wanted
children in the near future
in the absence of this awareness is
starting a family something that you
yourself would want for your life in the
next year or two would you be thinking
about this on your own
and when I ask this question it's like a
light bulb turned on above this guy's
head because in that moment he realized
that none of this was his idea
moving to Indiana was not his idea
becoming a father next year was not his
idea spending all of his time with this
woman's friends and family was not his
idea all of these ideas were put into
his head by the woman
he would never even have been thinking
about these things if it weren't for
this woman she and these ideas had been

[09:01]
this woman she and these ideas had been
insinuated into his mind so long and so
effectively that he had forgotten that
they weren't his ideas
and it was easy for him to slip more and
more into her frame because he didn't
have a strong conscious frame of his own
with which to counter
however in that moment he remembered his
own ideas and his response was immediate
no I'd want to get my life in order
start a business develop my social
network and explore relationships with
different types of women that's what he
told me
there you go that's what he wanted
my brothers if you ever find yourself
thinking yeah maybe I could do that
that thought is not your thought
it didn't come from you it's not
representative of your authentic desire
with authentic desire there is no maybe
see it from the woman's perspective
she's not thinking maybe I could want

[10:00]
she's not thinking maybe I could want
you moving to Indiana to take care of me
maybe there's no maybe here she's very
clear about what she wants so clear that
she's demanding it take a lesson from
women men and learn the difference
between your own authentic desires and
those that have been insinuated into
your mind by other people
men you thrive when you're in your frame
figure out what you want and get to work
get your life in order figure out your
mission your lifestyle your living
situation your money your health your
friends and your Social Circle
get those things squared away
and then when you meet a woman you like
you can say
this is me
this is what I can offer if you like
what you see then come along for the
ride
