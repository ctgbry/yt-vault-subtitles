I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology on the
topic of today's short talk is
recognition is a poor man's currency so
this is something that can trip up a lot
of folks especially in the context of
their professional lives
a lot of people are looking for
recognition and a lot of people
experience a great deal of frustration
and resentment when they believe that
their efforts are not sufficiently
recognized by their employer their
organization Etc
and I can totally understand that I have
felt those feelings in the past but I'm
here to tell you that recognition
is a poor man's currency
but before I explain what that means
please remember to like this video And
subscribe to this channel it takes less
than a second costs you nothing and you
can consider it your good deed for the
day
so do the thing
let's put it this way
the importance of recognition is
inversely proportional to the degree to
which you are paid in other ways

[01:02]
which you are paid in other ways
so to give you a very concrete example
what if in exchange for one of your
brilliant ideas
I will give you one million dollars
on the condition that no one could ever
know that you came up with it would you
be okay with that
leaving aside some Fantastical Fringe
cases I would be okay with that I would
keep my mouth shut for a million bucks
I'd rather have the million than the
recognition
this is obviously a hyperbolic example
but it kind of proves my point which is
the greater the value of the other forms
of payment you receive the less
important recognition becomes
on the other hand recognition becomes
really really important
when your efforts don't result in making
you much money when they don't result in
making your life easier when they don't
result in increasing future opportunity
in these cases because you're not being
compensated in other ways you're really

[02:00]
compensated in other ways you're really
going to want to be paid in recognition
so recognition is a poor man's currency
and that's because rich men get paid in
money
rich men get paid in having their lives
improved rich men get paid in increasing
opportunity when I was a starving artist
how did the producers pay me in exposure
when I was an unpaid intern how did
directors pay me in experience
and in both of those cases recognition
for my efforts was significantly more
important to me than it is today
what else did I have
I would encourage listeners struggling
with this problem to seek out better
compensation in other ways because at
the end of the day recognition is kind
of an ego based Drive which means that
it's something of a trap
a trap that in this case can ensnare you
in poverty and pettiness and envy among

[03:00]
in poverty and pettiness and envy among
other things
what do you think please let me know in
