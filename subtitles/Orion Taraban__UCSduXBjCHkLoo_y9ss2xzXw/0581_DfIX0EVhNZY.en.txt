I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
keep your cool with women so this is
what I call an emotional survival tactic
it will get you through the toughest
moments of a disagreeable interaction
with a woman relatively
unscathed now one of the obvious reasons
why people hurt the ones they love is
that they have access to their
vulnerabilities almost every man has had
the experience of something he shared
with his woman in trust and confidence
being used against him in a quarrel
months even years later I call this
weaponized intimacy and it is done to
inflict a concentrated amount of
emotional pain for a variety of reasons
women's attacks can also take the form
of hurtful and untrue statements things
like you don't love me or I hate you or
you never cared for me at all

[01:00]
you never cared for me at all
Etc now leaving aside the entire
question as to why you're in a
relationship with a disrespectful woman
who talks to you in this way which has
been the subject of other
episodes this episode is about how to
get through this particular moment when
a woman is personally attacking you
without making your situation any worse
than it already is this is because if
you the man get suckered into her anger
it's probably not going to end well for
you not only do you surrender your
emotional control and become
disregulated which is not a very
pleasant experience you are much more
likely to say and do things in Anger
that you might ultimately regret and
their consequences might long outlive
this particular unpleasant
interaction so when you're dealing with
an actively hostile woman the first rule
of thumb is to not make your situation
even worse

[02:00]
even worse
and guys often make the situation even
worse by becoming
defensive defensiveness is tricky
because it basically acknowledges the
reality of a valid attack so it kind of
admits that there is at least some
degree of Truth to what she is saying
that must therefore be responded to so
defensiveness unfortunately tends to
validate the perspective of the attacker
which generally
emboldens attackers for example if a
woman says something like you don't love
me most men will start listing out
counterfactuals that disprove the
assertion like what are you talking
about I gave you the ring the house the
car I put up with your parents every
Thanksgiving and I took you to the
Bahamas just last month how could you
possibly think that so men who do this
are functionally trying to prove their
innocence which of course is only really

[03:01]
innocence which of course is only really
necessary in the face of a grounded
accusation just like how running away
from certain animals triggers their
Predator Instinct and they will come to
see you as prey as a result becoming
defensive in response to others
accusations triggers their aggression
which can create a nasty positive
feedback loop so rather than become
defensive men need to learn to keep
their cool with women and I'm going to
share with you how I've been able to do
this albeit imperfectly I can tell you
that this emotional survival tactic has
saved my life and it might even save
your life one day as well I guarantee
that you can perform this tactic right
now as you are with no special training
necessary here it is no matter what
woman you're dealing with a and no
matter what a woman tells you to you to

[04:00]
matter what a woman tells you to you to
the extent that she becomes
emotional you need to mentally create a
verbal sandwich around her words that
means you're going to add something to
the beginning of what she says and add
something to the end of what she says
we'll do the beginning part first and
the end part second but before we go any

the first thing that you have to
mentally append to the beginning of a
woman's statements are the words I
feel I feel no matter what she says you
need to mentally put the words I feel at
the beginning you don't love me which is
probably not an accurate statement and
motivates men to correct this inaccuracy
through defensiveness becomes I feel you
don't love me
which could very well be a true
statement that accurately reflects her
emotional reality you're a terrible
person becomes I feel you're a terrible
person I hate you becomes I feel I hate
you which though hard to hear emphasizes
the transient nature of the hate Etc and
of course this is very likely what she
is actually attempting to say however
people in general become less effective
communicators when they become emotional
and they tend to leave those parts out

[06:00]
and they tend to leave those parts out
the point is that by adding these words
it's easier to remember that you're not
actually dealing with a personal attack
but a confession of her emotional state
and you can't really argue with that
like that is how she feels which means
that it's completely true that she feels
that you don't love her or that she
feels that you're a terrible person Etc
and really what is the point in arguing
about something that is obviously true
remembering that this uncomfortable
moment is actually a confession of her
emotional state and is therefore a true
reflection of her feelings can help you
not get bent out of shape in that moment
what's
more like what's it to you like she has
a right to feel whatever she wants to
feel she's a full-grown adult if she
wants to feel angry and vindictive and
hateful that's her right I mean I I

[07:01]
hateful that's her right I mean I I
wouldn't choose those things for myself
I don't prefer to feel that way but if a
woman wants to feel those things for
some reason I'm not going to stop her if
for no other reason that I'm not
interested in assuming responsibility
for how another grown adult feels like
I'll be responsible for me because I
alone am in a position to respond to the
precursors of my emotions and you'll be
responsible for you of course if those
feelings give way to angry vindictive
and hateful Behavior that's another
story but if she wants to feel those
unpleasant emotions then let her you
can't really stop her anyway in any case
appending the words I feel to her words
will help you to remember that you're
dealing with an emotional confession as
opposed to say a declaration about
reality all right and what about the
second part of the sandwich the other
slice of bread that you mentally append
to the end of whatever she says are the

[08:00]
to the end of whatever she says are the
words right
now right now and this makes sense
because if you're dealing with an
emotional confession well those feelings
are going to change maybe in as little
as an hour or two they're going to be
completely different this means that you
don't necessarily have to understand
what she's saying to be an objective
observation of a reality that is
permanent and endar enduring definitely
not endearing a reality that's permanent
and
enduring you don't love me becomes I
feel that you don't love me right now I
hate you becomes I feel that I hate you
right now you're a terrible person
becomes I feel that you're a terrible
person right now appending these words
at the end of what she says will help
you remember that you're dealing with an
ephemeral phenomenon so you don't
necessarily have to do anything or say
anything to keep that necessarily
transitory emotion state in existence

[09:00]
transitory emotion state in existence
longer than it absolutely needs to be
and you will absolutely increase its
lifespan if you choose to engage with it
in kind and at face
value and how can you escape this
uncomfortable situation even more
quickly than non-engagement I'm so happy
you asked the answer is accurate
reflection accurate reflection is such
an underrated communication tactic
especially if you're looking to
deescalate
an emotionally charged situation when
people don't feel heard they get louder
and more
aggressive on the other hand when people
do feel heard they tend to get quieter
and more reasonable so what does this
look like well if your woman were to say
you don't love me one effective response
might be to say something like you feel
that I don't love
you that's it she might then say yeah
because you never help out around the

[10:00]
because you never help out around the
house and you can then respond you think
I don't help out around the
house like Don't Be Clever keep it that
simple three or four of these exchanges
are enough to take the heat out of
almost any interaction and keep in mind
that reflection is not agreement it's
not approval and it's not a commitment
all you're basically doing with
reflection is communicating message
received and this works because people
generally don't persist in sending
duplicate messages now once the emotion
is gone you might want to consider
discussing what happened and addressing
any underlying issues but now is not the
time to do that for the time being just
focus on getting out of this escalating
exchange and o one final note it's
actually also important for men to
append these words to women's positive
emotionality as well well this is going

[11:00]
emotionality as well well this is going
to hurt but when a woman says I love you
or you're the most amazing man I've ever
met you need to add the sandwich I love
you becomes I feel I love you right now
you're the most amazing man I've ever
met becomes I feel you're the most
amazing man I've ever met right
now I understand that this might be hard
to hear but mentally adding these words
to the beginning and end of a woman's
emotional statements will help you keep
your feet firmly planted on the ground
where they
belong this will allow you to assess the
reality of the claim and wait its
significance
