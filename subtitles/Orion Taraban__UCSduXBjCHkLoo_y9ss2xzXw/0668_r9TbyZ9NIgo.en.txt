I can understand why women are insulted
when men just proposition them for sex
from a woman's perspective such men are
trying to get value for nothing however
women demanding a significant
relationship upfront is even more
ludicrous as male commitment is far more
expensive than female sexual opportunity
in today's dating Market from Men's
perspective such women are trying to get
a lot of value for nothing so what's the
upshot because of the differences in
their subjective experiences while using
dating app and because of the
differences in their gendered incentives
to engage in the sexual Marketplace what
ends up happening is that men and women
are growing increasingly Divergent in
their valuations of sex and commitment
men think sex should cost this much
women think sex should cost this much
and they're both right at least within
their respective subjectivities but
here's the thing when people get too far
away from each other in terms of
valuation they can't do business with
each other
