is it better to be loved or to love I
think that it's a very good thing to
learn how to love I think that something
that every person would benefit from
experiencing but it is not what people
think it is love will turn you inside
out it will destroy who you think you
are in the same way that the Cocoon
destroys the caterpillar what happens in
there isn't pretty the caterpillar
actually gets liquefied it's like a
slurry in there for days or weeks to
that caterpillar the Cocoon repres is a
tomb it does not have an understanding
or a conceptualization of what a
butterfly is in my opinion goes in there
to die without hope because the
caterpillar never emerges but what comes
out of that is something that I think no
entity that goes into the Cocoon can
predict and once you make the decision
to sacrifice your own happiness and
well-being voluntarily for the loved one
you find out who you really are you find
out a lot about yourself because that's
when the rubber really hits the road
