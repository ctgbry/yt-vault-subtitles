I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
have a fulfilling sexual relationship
well too long didn't read the way to
have a fulfilling sexual relationship is
to partner with someone who has more or
less the same libido as you do this is
something that generally doesn't change
you can do all the therapy you want you
can have all the conversations you want
but if somebody wants sex significantly
more than the other partner
that is probably not going to work out
in the long term one or both of those
partners are going to be frustrated with
whatever negotiated compromise or tacit
agreement they hit upon so the way to
have a fulfilling sexual relationship is
to choose someone who is interested in
having sex more or less the same amount
you are and who ideally has worked
through whatever baggage he or she might
have around sex and physical intimacy
because boy do people have baggage

[01:00]
because boy do people have baggage
around those things
now contrary to popular belief it's not
always the fact that men have a higher
libido than women do it can absolutely
be the other way around however I would
say that in general men want sex more
often than women do with men sex is a
drive with women sex is a mood a drive
is a Relentless impetus to action a mood
is something that kind of comes and goes
all right so in general men want sex
more than women do so if there is a
frustration in asexual relationship it's
usually because the man wants more sex
than the woman does not always but
generally so
how do you navigate this
guys if you want to have a fulfilling
sexual relationship with a woman you
have to establish consequences early on
in the relationship it is much harder to
do this further down the road due to the

[02:02]
do this further down the road due to the
presence of established reinforcement
protocols and likely explicitly
negotiated commitments it's possible but
it's much harder so much better to start
early and what exactly do you do
well wanting sex from a woman who is not
in the mood is kind of like showing up
at your favorite restaurant a minute
after they close
like let's say they serve until 8 pm and
you show up at 801.
and when you walk in the door they say
something like oh so sorry but we're
actually closed our kitchen is closed so
please come back tomorrow
now just like in a romantic relationship
if you were in this situation in real
life it would be absolutely ludicrous
and entitled to insist that you be
served it's only a minute after closing
time but it is technically after closing
time whether it's an inch or a mile out
of bounds is out of bounds and expecting

[03:02]
of bounds is out of bounds and expecting
that an exception is going to be made
for you is a little narcissistic and
absurd that said
it would be just as ludicrous and
entitled for the restaurant to expect
that you're not going to eat until
tomorrow just because their kitchen is
closed
so what do you do in this real life
situation you say oh absolutely
completely understand enjoy the rest of
your night I'm gonna see what else is
open at this hour and I'll come back
another time
and you take your hunger where people
are willing to serve you it's that
simple
now before I go any further if you're
liking what you're hearing please

me in proportion to the value you feel
that you derived from this video I

[04:01]
that you derived from this video I
appreciate your support
now I get where women are coming from
having sex when you're not in the mood
is kind of like eating when you're not
hungry food just doesn't seem very
appetizing but turning down a man's
advances doesn't diminish his desire
just like saying your kitchen is closed
doesn't make that customer's hunger
disappear
all it does is communicate that he will
need to go elsewhere for satisfaction
and well no one would bat an eyelash at
a diner eating dinner elsewhere the idea
that a man would not just sit there and
be hungry if her kitchen is closed tends
to give some women pause
why well let's go back to the restaurant
metaphor there is a difference between
some random dude who shows up at 801
expecting to be fed in a good regular
customer who shows up at the same time
the one is not equivalent to the other
in both cases the restaurant loses the

[05:02]
in both cases the restaurant loses the
profit on one meal but in the latter
case it potentially jeopardizes the
profit on an indefinite number of future
meals
now let's be real that restaurant
probably is not going to go out of
business if that one regular customer
takes his money elsewhere
but in general it's not wise to alienate
your regular customers so if a woman is
liking a man if she likes his attention
if she likes his lifestyle if she likes
his affection
and he is now considering taking his
sexual appetite elsewhere not in a hurt
or vindictive way but in the measured
and rational way a hungry customer would
look for a place to eat at dinner time
then she has to consider the possibility
that he is going to take all those other
things with him
and this will give many women pause and
they might start to think well
it is a minute after closing time but
it is only a minute after closing time

[06:02]
it is only a minute after closing time
maybe we can make something work in fact
maybe I can get even more out of you
like a big tip by making it seem like
he's a special exception to my usual
business practices
so in the early stages of relationship
this is the leverage that men have you
cannot force a restaurant to serve you
if they are closed for business that's
the way it is however you can absolutely
take your business elsewhere
and if you exercise this option you
should do so in a completely
non-petulant way like hey totally
respect your decision that's fine but I
got to do something about this so I'm
gonna head out enjoy the rest of your
night and we'll get together some other
time
just like in the legal system precedents
have meaning and relationship and
especially early on in the courtship
process one of the many things that the
two of you are doing is tacitly
negotiating the price of sex
guys there is nothing wrong with just

[07:02]
guys there is nothing wrong with just
cuddling up to your lady if she turns
down a bid for sex however don't be
surprised if you're having much less sex
than you would like to further into the
relationship this is because you've
basically communicated that the same
degree of attention affection lifestyle
and commitment can be secured with less
sex which makes sex a more valuable
relative commodity in that relationship
and I say in that relationship because
no matter what time of day it is there
is generally a restaurant open somewhere
and the price of food on the open market
is a more accurate reflection of its
true value than the menu prices at any
particular restaurant
