i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
compromise versus sacrifice
i'm not a big fan of compromise
especially in the context of romantic
relationships
when i think about compromise
i think two people not getting what they
want
well this might not be how it's supposed
to work it's often how it does work in
practice
in a lot of relationships
compromise is a way of keeping score
about unhappiness
it kind of goes like this
well i don't really want to spend next
saturday with your parents but you
really want me to be there
so i'll agree to be unhappy for your
sake in this case
and that earns me the right to expect
that you'll agree to be unhappy for my
sake at some future date when i want you
to do something that you don't
and in this way the couple moves forward
into the future and both participants

[01:00]
into the future and both participants
increasingly spend their time doing
things that half the couple doesn't want
to do
and i'm not entirely sure how such an
arrangement ultimately serves the
individuals in that relationship
so i'm not a big fan of compromise for
this reason
on the other hand i am a big fan of
sacrifice
the difference between compromise and
sacrifice is that in a compromise you
expect something from your partner in
return for your compliance
namely future reciprocated compliance
however in a sacrifice you voluntarily
choose to alter your behavior for your
own sake
usually with the hope that you will
receive more benefit for yourself as a
result of the alteration
let me illustrate this with an example
so imagine that one day your partner
comes to you and says i've noticed that
you've been playing a lot of video games
you play until 2 2 a.m you play 20 30
hours a week
and i'm not sure this is really good for
you
a compromise might be something like

[02:01]
a compromise might be something like
okay
if i promise not to play during the week
will you agree to get off my case or
if i'm not playing video games then you
have to stop going out with your friends
as you can see the heart of compromise
is negotiation
and one partner generally sells
compliance for some future benefit from
the other
on the other hand if you were to take
some time to examine what your partner
said because that person may in fact
have a point
and you independently conclude that
playing video games like that isn't
really good for you that for example
it's interfering with some of the other
things you want to do
then you can choose to voluntarily
change your behavior for your own sake
in this case you would sacrifice playing
video games in the hope that doing so
will accrue benefit to yourself
in the form of say
increased opportunity to pursue other
interests
sacrifice is saying i choose to give

[03:01]
sacrifice is saying i choose to give
this up because i hope to benefit
contrast this with compromise which says
i agree to be unhappy because i hope to
secure compliance from you
consequently in sacrifice you don't
expect reciprocity from your partner on
some level your partner isn't even
involved in this decision it's a
decision between you and yourself
it's a selfish decision
and the fact is that by making such a
selfish decision you potentially improve
the interpersonal space in which the
relationship exists
you're choosing to change and expect
nothing from your partner
how does that not improve freedom and
respect in a relationship
from a certain perspective selfishness
is exactly what is necessary to keep a
relationship healthy as it doesn't
implicate the other in the unhappiness
debt swapping of compromise
in fact relationships become effortless
to the extent that they're based upon
complementary selfishnesses
