i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is
how to keep your cool
when someone makes you angry
not easy for even the best of us to do
right
the important thing to keep in mind here
is that offense is taken
it's not given
the truth of this statement is actually
supported by our idiom concerning
offense namely
i take offense of that sir
it's not so much that the other person
is giving it
as it is that we choose to take it that
way
and here's how we know this to be true
if you've ever had the displeasure of
actually having an enemy that is someone
who is openly and unapologetically
antagonistic towards you someone who is
often trying to provoke you with their
language you know
that you have some measure of control
over whether or not they are successful

[01:00]
over whether or not they are successful
for example if you can't avoid
interacting with this person you may
choose to give yourself a pep talk
beforehand reminding yourself not to
take the provocations personally
it's okay
we don't have to engage
and often
you see some measure of success with
that strategy such individuals our
enemies may be unabashedly trying to
give offense
but if you enter into such an
interaction mindfully you can guard
yourself against taking it
and if you succeed in not taking it you
don't get offended
it's actually not possible for those who
intend offense to give offense
without the complicit ascent of the
offended party
and
in point of fact i found that the vast
majority of offense taking occurs not
with those who intend it
but with those who don't
in most cases people aren't actively
trying to provoke us
to give offense however it can be taken

[02:00]
to give offense however it can be taken
nonetheless
this is important because if we can
understand
that taking offense requires our
complicity
then we enjoy some measure of control
over it
offensiveness
is a judgment that we complain that we
conflate or confuse with certain verbal
behavior and that judgment not the
behavior and certainly not the intention
behind the behavior is primarily
responsible for our taking offense our
judgment that this is offensive as
opposed to the actual words or tone
utilized if we remove this judgment of
offensiveness then no offense can be
taken it's just a non-starter and this
helps us to remain equilibrated in the
guardians of our own emotional states
even we're in when we're in let's say
sticky situations
