if you wanted to win a war without any
one of your soldiers dying you would not
be able to do so it would be impossible
you'd be far too conservative and
cautious and that pattern would be
quickly exploited by your adversary
Victory would just not be possible on
the other hand no General in good
conscience would throw a man's life away
callously it's no small thing to order a
battalion into a skirmish with a low
chance of survival because of the
Strategic Advantage it affords however
these sacrifices are almost always
necessary to secure the ultimate goal
which in this case is to win the war
what does this have to do with women
just like the generals men need to
approach mating and dating through the
lens of some overarching purpose if the
generals weren't fighting for something
they believed in then even the smallest
sacrifice might not be worth the price
of Victory and there are things that you
can do with a woman that justify
acceptable losses Chief among them is
starting a family and creating a legacy
for yourself and there are others that
depend on an individual's goals and
inclination
