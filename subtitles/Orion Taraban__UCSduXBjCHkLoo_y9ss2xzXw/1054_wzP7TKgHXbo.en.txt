You see couples?
&gt;&gt; No, I don't.
&gt;&gt; You don't see couples? I thought, okay,
you just see
&gt;&gt; individuals, but I see men and women.
&gt;&gt; Meet men and women.
&gt;&gt; Um, there was something you said about
99% of the relationships where you see
them, the woman is in charge.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And this is just not only
professionally, but in my own personal
life among all of my friends and family,
it's like the woman is the more powerful
person in the vast majority of marriages
that I've personally seen.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Is there a possibility the reason
why you see couples where 99% of the
time the woman's in charge is because
the couples where men are in charge are
less likely to come see you.
&gt;&gt; It's quite possible. Like I've said that
&gt;&gt; I've seen thousands of marriages up
close both personally and professionally
and I can count on one hand the number
of marriages that I wouldn't mind being
in. And what all of those marriages have
in common is the man is the more
powerful.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Okay. Yeah. I didn't hear you talk
about that part. So that's that's really
interesting.
&gt;&gt; I haven't said that before.
&gt;&gt; It's a hard pill for some people to
swallow, but I do believe that in

swallow, but I do believe that in
general men leading in a relationship is
better for women and men.
&gt;&gt; Sure. I talk about that on the channel
and in the book using the idea of the
balance of attraction where there is the
adored and the adorer. And in general, I
think it's better for the women to be
the adore and for men to be the adored.
Yes. And there's more power and control
in being the adored.
