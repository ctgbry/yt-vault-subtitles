I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk
is understanding
men ladies this is an episode for you
unfortunately it has come to my
attention that some of you might need
some education with respect to the
opposite sex so I'm here to explain a
few things to you today with respect to
getting what you want from men if you
take what I say under consideration I
assure you that you will have a much
easier time in your dealings with us
let's get to it perhaps you've heard it
said that in business you can have
things good you can have things fast and
you can have things cheap but that you
can only choose
to this is very true if you want it fast
and cheap it's not going to be good if
you want it good and cheap it's not
going to be fast and if you want it fast
and good it's not going to be cheap

[01:00]
and good it's not going to be cheap
makes sense and fits with your
experience doesn't it now there's a
similar principle at work with respect
to men here it is a man can be rich a
man can be attractive and a man can be
loyal but you can only get
two Max and I say Max because the fact
of the matter is you'll be lucky if you
get
one my apologies if that sounds cynical
but it's true for instance most men are
not rich which is why people will say
that a woman is fortunate if she finds a
rich husband by the same token most men
are not attractive they are dull and
insipid and do little to inspire
authentic desire and finally most men
are not loyal at least not in their
heart of hearts you might meet the
occasional guy who swears up and down
that he is monogamous by Nature however
when you meet him you'll usually find

[02:01]
when you meet him you'll usually find
his wife with an earshot or a suspicious
lack of admirers that makes his loyalty
less a virtue than a given and this is
why women can only get two of these
three Goods Max there's an economic
principle that no one will pay more than
they need to and any one of these three
things is extremely expensive like being
rich High status and successful takes an
incredible amount of work
by the same token being attractive not
just in the sense of being 62 with good
ABS that that certainly doesn't hurt but
in the sense of being interesting or
thrilling or fun or charming or a good
lover or witty or a pleasure to be
around also takes a great deal of work
and while being loyal can also take work
this only really takes work after a man
becomes attractive or rich as it's only
then that he attains any optionality to

[03:00]
then that he attains any optionality to
speak of to tempt his loyalty in any
case any one of these three things is
extremely expensive which is why most
men don't have any of them and why
hooking a man with even one of the three
is considered fortunate so if possessing
even one of the three already puts a man
ahead of most men then possessing two of
the three easily places him in the top
percentiles as a result possessing all
three would be over kill and a waste of
necessarily limited resources since a
man can clearly compete successfully
with just two but let's get back to
these Goods you may not believe me
ladies but most men start off by
offering
loyalty this is because it takes a lot
of work to be rich or attractive and not
a lot of work to be loyal when you're
neither rich or attractive and Men
understand that if you're not Get Rich

[04:00]
understand that if you're not Get Rich
or attractive they had better be loyal
because very few if any women are going
to be interested in getting with a man
who has none of the three Goods in
question so most men start out loyal
because it usually takes a good deal of
time an effort to achieve the other
two if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
also provide a lot of actionable advice
on how to get and keep more of what you
want in the sexual Marketplace once you
read the value of others you'll never
look at relationships the same way again
now available in ebook audiobook and
paperback formats the links are in the

[05:02]
description now I'm going to let you in
on a secret ladies most men don't want
to be loyal like they'll find a way to
be loyal if they have to but most guys
don't want to have to they want to be
able to have sex with the women they
want to have sex with and most of them
Envy women's ability to do this so
easily however in the absence of the
other two goods men have to present at
least the semblance of loyalty in order
to access any woman whatsoever and even
this in many cases won't be enough most
men have had the experience of sincerely
pledging their love and Devotion to a
woman only to be passed over for a man
who is either more attractive or more
successful this is how men learn from
women that of the three Goods loyalty is
the least

[06:00]
the least
desirable men realize that the way out
of this difficulty is to cultivate at
least one of the other two goods
attractiveness or wealth having either
one will open up more and better sexual
opportunities for a man and having both
puts them in a world that most men can
only dream of women might want all three
but getting just two is a stroke of
supremely good luck and a woman must be
in some sense extraordinary in order to
catch such a man in general it's not
enough to merely be beautiful she must
also play the game of Seduction
extremely
well now let's briefly take a look at
these three archetypes of very desirable
men let's start with a man who is loyal
and attractive that's the archetype of
the Romeo Romeos can be extremely
exciting and passionate

[07:00]
exciting and passionate
because they are themselves so pleasing
and Charming a woman is transformed into
a queen when she receives their focused
and piercing attention they can be fun
and bold and devoted however they
typically haven't developed much in
terms of a lifestyle and as a result
Romeos tend to make fantastic short-term
lovers as it's difficult to maintain
that kind of dynamic
indefinitely once the magic wears off
women eventually discover that the
emperor has no
clothes next up is the man who is Rich
and
loyal that's the archetype of the patron
patrons Pride themselves on their
discernment and taste they are lavish
with their spending and take pains to
demonstrate their ardor for the objects
of their devotion think the Taj Mahal
patrons ensure that their women are
comfortable even pampered sounds good
right the downside of course is that

[08:01]
right the downside of course is that
they're not attractive patrons might
only want to have sex with you but women
might not feel any authentic desire for
them turning their love making into a
transactional chore women generally
don't their fans and the more
adoration and security patrons provide
the more uninterested women can often
become as a result patrons tend to finds
V disrespected and unappreciated as time
goes
by finally we come to the man who is
Rich and
attractive that's the archetype of the
Playboy Playboys are sophisticated and
charming and well spoken and debbon air
they're no stranger to the good things
in life and they're happy to share them
with the women who catch their fancy
there is never a dull moment with a
Playboy as he knows how to stimulate a
woman's emotions
and possesses the resources to actually

[09:02]
and possesses the resources to actually
realize his audacious designs and don't
let the public censure of Rees fool you
women love Playboys how else could they
find so many willing lovers if you
capture a Playboy's heart expect
investment not exclusivity and if you
can't do that then at least enjoy your
time while it lasts hopefully he'll
leave you with some exciting memories to
enliven your responsib
Domesticity and what of the man who is
Rich and attractive and loyal that's the
archetype of the prince charming which
is why we're not going to talk about him
Prince Charming is a fairy tale he
doesn't actually exist and unfortunately
too many women come to that realization
too late in their lives and then punish
the men who do engage with them for not
living up to an unrealizable ideal

[10:00]
living up to an unrealizable ideal
ladies the sooner you can disabuse
yourself of that bedtime story the
better in any case I hope that was
enlightning whether or not you want to
engage with men is up to you but this is
how you can do so in reality a man can
be rich or attractive or loyal and most
of you will be lucky if you get one if
you have the Good Fortune to land a man
with two then you better not rock the
boat plenty of women with better sense
will be more than happy to take your
place what do you think does this fit
