i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the gift
of becoming
i've talked to a lot of guys in my
practice over the years and some of the
men that i've spoken with are extremely
accomplished and successful
many of them have amassed fortunes of
tens of millions of dollars have
completed advanced degrees have a wife
and children and have established
themselves socially in the network of
human relations
and it's not uncommon for these same
folks to tell me that the happiest days
of their lives were when they were young
broke single and striving
that is they were happiest before all
their success and achievement
when they had a purpose when they had a
mission when they had a vision of the
future that they hadn't yet attained
this was when they were hustling and
building and sacrificing and struggling
they were in so many words in the
process of becoming
and this happiness is the gift of
becoming

becoming
this is a dirty little secret about
people
they're generally happiest when they're
in the process of becoming not when they
accomplish what they set out to become
people are typically more fulfilled when
they are struggling up a mountain than
they are when they arrive at the summit
when folks are in the process of
becoming they're hopeful for the future
focused in the present and motivated by
their past
they acquire meaning because meaning is
generally associated with a renunciation
a giving up
rather than an accumulation showing up
once you attain to that which you set
out to become then you just are
and your work is to reap and maintain
until you embark upon your next process
of becoming
if you're currently feeling unfulfilled
in your life despite whatever
accomplishments you've already
accumulated you might consider creating
an opportunity for yourself to enter
into a new process of becoming
so that's what i have for you today
