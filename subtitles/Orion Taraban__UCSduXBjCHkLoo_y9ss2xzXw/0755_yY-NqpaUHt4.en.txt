I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is
holders and
sniffers so this should be a fun one in
this episode I'm going to argue that
there are two fundamental ways of
approaching relationships and that
individuals can be sorted into these two
categories according to how they respond
to a very basic problem that will
inevitably arise over the course of
their Rel relationships on the surface
it's going to sound like a very silly
problem but as we'll see these two
categories actually correspond with two
diametrically opposed attitudes toward
approaching relationships on a deep
level and just what is this problem
simple what do you do with your
farts everybody farts and everybody
thinks that they farts smell less bad

[01:01]
thinks that they farts smell less bad
than they do to other people so what are
you going to do with your farts in a
relationship do you hold them in and try
not to fart around your partner or do
you let them rip and let the chips fall
as they may are you a holder or a
sniffer now farting can be a literal
problem in a relationship but much more
commonly it's a figurative problem
that is farting is a metaphor for all
the unpleasant realities about you and
your partner whether you like it or not
there are unattractive unpleasant even
disgusting aspects of our natures and
personalities people are selfish lazy
arrogant defensive stubborn
self-righteous aggressive victimizing
and ignorant just to name a few

[02:01]
and ignorant just to name a few
pretending that these qualities don't
exist or insisting that they shouldn't
exist is insane these attributes exist
in all of us you could even consider
them to be our shadows so with this
understanding the question becomes what
do we do with these aspects of ourselves
do we repress and hide them or do we
open up and share them and it's an
honest question one approach is not
better than the other and there are pros
and cons to each however irrespective of
which side of the fence you find
yourself on I found that it's a very
good idea for folks to partner up with
like-minded individuals in general
holders need to be with other holders
and sniffers need to be with other
sniffers it's very hard for a holder and
a sniffer to navigate a satisfying
long-term relationship and this is
because holders and and sniffers are

[03:00]
because holders and and sniffers are
fundamentally prioritizing two different
but reasonable
values on the one hand holders are
trying to prioritize Harmony in their
relationships and on the other hand
sniffers are trying to prioritize
authenticity in the same now both of
those things sound good right like
you're going to be hard pressed to find
someone against either Harmony or
authenticity the issue is
like so many things in life it is often
necessary to make hard choices with
respect to our priorities and this is
especially true given the fact that
these two values are kind of
antithetical to each other like in
general the more Harmony you want the
more you might have to repress
authenticity and vice versa I wish this
weren't the case but as long as people
aren't enlightened Saints

[04:00]
aren't enlightened Saints
the one is going to come at the expense
of the other it's just the way it is now
let's take a look at each group in turn
first the holders holders understand
that there are unpleasant and
unattractive aspects of the self and
other however they have chosen to do
their best to keep the relational space
as clean as possible and to maintain a
presentable if not attractive front in
order to do that they repress or hide or
obscure certain parts of themselves and
in return for doing so they are
compensated with smoother more agreeable
more harmonious
relationships this is akin to
approaching relationships like rols just
like we expect a certain measure of
professionalism from those with whom we
do business holders expect a certain
degree of courtesy from those with whom
they enter into relationships

[05:00]
they enter into relationships
in both cases this potentially requires
doing some violence to your authentic
impulses and this can be difficult and
painful like it's hard to hold in your
farts over a long enough timeline
they're eventually going to come out one
way or the other right and that's why if
they go down this path holders need to
create space in the relationship to
relinquish that role at certain
intervals like no one is expected to
live at the off office right they work 8
10 hour shifts during which time they
are expected to enact their professional
roles and then they get a chance to drop
that role without this release holders
will likely feel suffocated by the role
restriction and they may resort to
increasingly strange or dysfunctional
tactics to create the space they feel
they need in the relationship so those
are
holders if you're interested in taking

sniffers on the other hand want the real
deal they also understand that there are
unpleasant and unattractive aspects of
the self and other however they feel
that hiding or repressing those aspects
is a kind of fake love sham love and
that love in any case is about being
unconditionally accepted by their
Partners sniffers would prefer to fight
honestly than to get along under what
they would consider to be false

[07:00]
they would consider to be false
pretenses and in return for doing so
they are compensated with more raw more
vital more authentic
relationships the issue here is that no
one's farts smell better than to the
person doing the farting who wouldn't
want to be loved and accepted
Unconditionally by their partner that's
not the problem the problem is loving
and accepting the other
unconditionally in return and one of the
things you might have to love and accept
in the other is their tendency to become
disgusted frustrated and judgmental
which is a kind of farting in response
to your own farts when people complain
that their Partners don't accept them
they themselves are not accepting their
partner's
non-acceptance which more than anything
else highlights the difficulty inherent
in this approach to

[08:01]
in this approach to
relationships you just being yourself
could be gross and infuriating and
completely unattractive to your partner
and while everyone is different there
are certain traits and behaviors that in
general tend to corrode attraction and
diminish desire you can do whatever you
like but you certainly can't expect
people to respond in the way you would
prefer when you do whatever you like
and the fact of the matter is that while
you can love
anybody some people are much more
difficult to love than others in order
for two people to just be themselves in
a relationship a few criteria are
required these folks typically need to
have a very secure relationship a mutual
commitment to talking things out
frequently strong communication skills
and a fair amount of emotional

[09:01]
and a fair amount of emotional
maturity that is if they don't want to
devolve into unproductive unproductive
conflict on a regular basis and I hope
you can appreciate that's actually a lot
of things many problems are much more
easily avoided than confronted but it
can be difficult for sniffers to hold
their tongues as that would be doing
violence to an authentic
impulse my point is that it's painful
either way it's painful to hold your
farts and it's painful to smell other
people's farts so you have to be real
honest with yourself about the flavor of
pain you're more willing to tolerate
because you're going to have to deal
with this problem one way or another in
fact one of the best pieces of
relationship advice I've ever received
was from a mentor who told me Orion you
got to like the smell of her
farts I think what he was saying is that

[10:00]
farts I think what he was saying is that
everybody farts in the sense that
everybody has these less than ideal
aspects of their personalities however
some of these aspects for whatever
reason are going to be easier for you
the particular individual to tolerate
some farts are Charming quirks others
are disgusting deal breakers and this
categorization varies from person to
person this is important to consider
because even if you're dealing with
holders the farts are going to leak out
eventually by the same token sniffers
differ significantly with respect to the
frequency and intensity of their
flatulence so if you're someone who
values authenticity then at least try to
find those who have already made an
effort to clean up their
acts what do you think does this fit
