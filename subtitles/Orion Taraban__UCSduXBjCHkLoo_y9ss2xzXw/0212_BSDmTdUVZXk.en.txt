in my video how to love without
emotional attachment ashy kitty asks how
does this affect the vow of marriage in
fact several people wanted to know how
you can love without emotional
attachment within a committed
relationship and the answer to that
question is you do exactly the same
thing
if you're in a committed relationship
even if you're married if you stop
putting out good milk
consistently over time
that's going to degrade the quality of
your relationship and endanger that
commitment
so even though you have this explicit
arrangement with you and your partner
that doesn't excuse you from the
responsibility
to continue to put out good milk and to
continue to allow your partner to choose
you every day
your partner's going to do what he or
she is going to do you don't want to
police them you don't want to be their
warden you don't want to be their spy
let them come and go and choose you
every day within that commitment
