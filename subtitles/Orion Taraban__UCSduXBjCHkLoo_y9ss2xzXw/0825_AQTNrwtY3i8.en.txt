I had a question I wanted to ask you
regarding I had this thought that if
you're trying to equate how two people
are acting in a relationship to achieve
an equal relationship maybe in terms of
respect or something you will have let's
say the two partners are trying to give
each other equal amounts of respect but
then you might have both Partners
perceive respect in different ways is
that kind of what you're talking about
well what I say is that the basis of
transaction is the exchange of unequal
Goods of comparable value both things
kind of need to be true we actually want
to exchange unequal Goods like if I said
hey Joseph will you give me a dollar for
a dollar like that's a useless
transaction and in fact we've lost a
little bit of time and opportunity if we
actually went through with transacting
it that's why that doesn't happen people
actually don't transact equal things
they transact unequal I.E different
things but those different things have
to be of comparable value the more that
the perceived value of those unequal
things is different the less likely a
transaction is going to occur
