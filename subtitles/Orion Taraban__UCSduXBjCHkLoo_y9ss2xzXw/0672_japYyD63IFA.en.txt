in today's day and age sex precedes
commitment and in a Marketplace full of
free samples you can't reasonably expect
to charge for a taste under such
incentives the question is not why by
the cow when you can get the milk for
free it is why buy the cow if you have
to pay for the
milk if buyers have a choice between
buying the cow or buying the cow and the
milk why would they Pur the latter
option it's too expensive as there are
now two incurred costs instead of one
like what is so special about your milk
that you can possibly expect people to
pay for it when vendors all around you
are handing out free
samples you can argue about whether this
is how things should be until you're
blue in the face but it's not going to
change anything this is the reality of
the Contemporary sexual Marketplace and
it's probably not going to change
anytime soon
