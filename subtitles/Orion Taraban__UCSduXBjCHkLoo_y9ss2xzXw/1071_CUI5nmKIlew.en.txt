When you talk about the sexual
marketplace, it seems to be older women
don't have a problem with it. Younger
women certainly don't have a problem
with it, and men don't have a problem
with this idea, but it's middle-aged
women who seem to have a problem.
They're my biggest critics, for sure.
&gt;&gt; Why would that be?
&gt;&gt; Well, I think that no one surrenders
power willingly. I think that's part of
it. And why do younger women tend not to
have a problem? Because in the economic
model, it would be very difficult, if
not impossible, to argue that the
average younger man is more powerful or
more attractive than the average younger
woman.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. like the average woman's sexual
marketplace value is in their 20s is
much higher than the average man's
sexual marketplace value and no women
are protesting for equality under those
circumstances. You know what I'm saying?
And we could say that after, you know,
later in life and they get into their
grandmotherly roles and they've accepted
that they've aged and this is a new
chapter in their life, they can see
things a little bit more objectively.
But in the middle, it's a loss of power.
It's a loss of privilege that in many
respects was unearned. We talk about
unearned privilege in recent years. It's
like that woman just had her jeans mixed

like that woman just had her jeans mixed
up in a certain way. Clearly, she took
care of herself. She knew how to apply
the makeup and to dress c a certain way,
but like a lot of that was kind of done
for her. And now she's not getting the
same kind of attention and privileges
and power than she once enjoyed. And
that would be difficult I think for any
human being to experience.
