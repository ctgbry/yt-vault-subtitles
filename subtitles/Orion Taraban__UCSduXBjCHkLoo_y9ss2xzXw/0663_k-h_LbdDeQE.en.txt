when a man has the good problem of
having multiple women in his life he
should never ever under any
circumstances make the mistake of
comparing them with each other besides
being the thief of Joy comparison
generally leads to suboptimal outcomes
why well let's say that in your mind
option A is slightly better than option
b that is you compare the two options to
each other and found option A to be
superior well once you make the decision
option b evaporate as a basis of
comparison and you'll have to deal with
option A on its own merits and at that
point it may not be all that helpful
that the option you chose was slightly
better than the option you didn't what's
important is whether the option you
chose is sufficient with respect to
whatever your goals happen to be moving
forward in these situations the question
is not do I go with a or b the question
is do I go with a or not a and
independently do I go with b or not b
