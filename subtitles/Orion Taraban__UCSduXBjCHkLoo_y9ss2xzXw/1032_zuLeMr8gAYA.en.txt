So basically the the men who don't need
any more sexual interest from women are
the ones getting the vast amount of
sexual interest. Most guys when they're
growing up they know this. It's like in
high school there's like two or three
guys who were very very popular and all
the girls were gunning for them. Um this
is also why when I talk to men they tell
me that they get a huge uptick in female
interest after they get married which
they always find very frustrating and
confusing. But they say that the ring
really draws women to them. And there
could be a number of reasons for that,
but vis what we're talking about. One of
them could be at least one woman in the
world said, "This was the very best man
that I could possibly get and I thought
I was safe and excited enough to move
forward with a lifelong commitment to
him." So at least one person did
significant vetting with respect to this
one man. And if you can scope that
woman, even better. Because if she's a
very attractive woman, that's going to
suggest that she has lots of different
men that she could have chosen from and

men that she could have chosen from and
this was the very best one that she
could get, which is going to make that
man look really good. There's going to
be a huge target pointed on. So, it's
always easier to kind of like it's like
recruiting. Sometimes it's easier to
poach someone from a competition than to
train them yourself from scratch, which
can take a lot of time. And time is
something that is generally more limited
quantity with respect to women and uh
reproduction and mating and dating.
