I did an episode on the standoff between
men and women where women are basically
looking at men and saying do better guys
you can't expect us to be enthusiastic
about this kind of relationship based on
how you are and men are increasingly
looking at women say come on you know
look at what you're doing this is what
I'm overpaying for a used good here so
it's like both sides kind of want the
other side to Blink first and that's
fine if the two parties were kind of of
equal power level and could persist at
an equal power level over time the fact
of the matter is is that men's and
women's sexual Marketplace value tends
to change at differential rates as a
function of time it generally
deteriorates faster for women because
their sexual Marketplace value for
Better or For Worse is so heavily
focused on their physical attractiveness
and their fertility and reproductive
cues this is a liability for men like
men are so monom maniacally focused on
these things it's bad for them and they
can forego really good partners and
commitment relationship opportunities
because they are just so focused on the
physical but that's not going to change
anytime soon
