we can talk about how relationships
today are so superficial but you know
when the guy couldn't provide anymore
and that led to the end of the
relationship that's kind of superficial
too they just couldn't get divorced as
much back then that doesn't necessarily
mean that their relationships were any
better yeah I think that's a really good
way of thinking about it is that men
have to remember that they need to
provide value and you really need you
can't let yourself off the hook as a man
ever like the you can't ever nope you
can never just let go and I think that's
something where we have been raised in
this disi version of love that we
imagine as men that love is going to be
this unconditional thing like the way
your mother loved you and some people
some people didn't have that but other
people might have gotten there sorry to
interrupt that once you find someone
that you're done and you can just stop
pushing yeah that's a that's a really
dangerous idea both for men and women
but I did make an episode about this a
while ago that men's most romantic
belief is I can be loved for who who I
