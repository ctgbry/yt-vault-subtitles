if it's true that nice guys finish last
then is it also true that women prefer
that's sort of our cultural
understanding of the matter
but I'm here to argue that that's
actually not the case it's not the case
that women consciously sort for the most
disagreeable selfish men in their
environment
that wouldn't make a lot of sense from
their let's say biological imperative
and also in terms of optimal Game Theory
but rather this idea that men I'm sorry
that women love is a
consequence of
something else entirely which has to do
with what women actually sort men for in
terms of potential partners
