i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to be disciplined
so this is something that i often talk
to my clients about
they have an idea of quote what they
should do
they have a notion of quote what they
want to do
but for whatever reason they feel like
they can't do it that they can't stay
focused that they can't stay consistent
that they can't exercise sufficient
discipline to cultivate the new behavior
totally understandable
it's very difficult to cultivate a new
behavior if it were easy i probably
wouldn't have a job
now this is how i think about it
the main reason why people get into
trouble with discipline is that they
assume that discipline has an emotional
component
that is they know what they should do
but in the moment when they might need
to execute that behavior they allow
themselves to think
well i don't really feel like doing it
or

[01:00]
or
i don't really want to do it etc
they allow emotion to enter into the
deliberation on whether to execute the
intended behavior
now in my conceptualization discipline
has nothing to do with emotion
rather discipline is a duty
it is an obligation that you surrender
to
discipline is like a meeting that your
boss puts on your calendar you may not
want to go but that's irrelevant if you
want to keep your job you show up where
and when you're instructed
my model for discipline is the united
states postal service
neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom
of night stays these couriers from the
swift completion of their appointed
rounds the postman doesn't wake up in
the morning and ask himself do i feel
like delivering the mail today do i want
to deliver the mail today oh it looks
like it's a little wet out does that
mean i don't have to deliver the mail
today none of these questions even enter

[02:01]
today none of these questions even enter
into the conversation the disciplined
person doesn't allow them to he's
decided that he's a postman he delivers
the mail
period his emotions are irrelevant it's
a duty and he surrenders to his duty
so
the idea here is to create the structure
that you can surrender to
and to treat that structure like an
externally imposed duty with the same
force of a contractual obligation
that way when it's time to do your duty
you just do it it's really that simple
cultivate discipline by channeling your
inner postmen
