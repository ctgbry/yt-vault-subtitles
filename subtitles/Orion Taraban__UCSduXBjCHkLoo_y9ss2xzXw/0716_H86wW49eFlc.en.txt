crisis that all nent relationships must
pass through and on some level the
relationship doesn't even begin in
Earnest until couples go through the
Cris of disappointment where either
through one significant betrayal or the
accumulation of small inconsistencies
the fantasy on which the relationship
has been based up until that point
shatters and the person is really no
different from who he or she was the day
before but he or she's going to feel
completely different it's almost like
the scales have dropped from your eyes
and you're seeing this person and maybe
what seemed cute and lovable and
adorable just a week ago now is
completely infuriating and difficult to
live with sometimes the very things that
we're most attracted to tend to be the
things that we dislike most about our
partners further down the road it's just
cruel irony so interesting when you talk
about this moment that some
relationships go through where they have
that sudden disappointment where the
kind of honeymoon effect the halo effect
of this person kind of shatters and you
say that's when the relationship
actually begins well yeah because it's
at that point where you have the
opportunity at long last to see the
other person for who he or she is and
you couldn't see that before you just
saw what you wanted to see
