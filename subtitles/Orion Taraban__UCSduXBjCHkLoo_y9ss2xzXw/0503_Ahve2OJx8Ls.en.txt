as I said there's only one thing you
need to understand to have an effortless
relationship with a woman and here it is
all you need to do is to be her
perceived best option if it sounds
simple it's cuz it is however that
doesn't necessarily mean that it's easy
now why does this work okay women treat
men the way men treat jobs right so if
you've previously had challenging or
unfulfilling experiences in the
professional Arena once you find an
interesting meaningful high-paying job
with great benefits you are going to be
employee of the Mone the same is true in
relationships even a woman with limited
dating experience has a pretty decent
idea of what is out there if you have an
emotionally compelling lifestyle if
you're interesting and fun and fit and
can provide her with high value
experiences that she may not be able to
find anywhere else trust me she is not
going to do anything to rock the boat
she understands that all of the things
being equal If this relationship doesn't
work out it's going to be a step down
for her
