Another thing to keep in mind is that
when Crarapelin first began to
conceptualize mental illnesses in the
early 20th century, I think he only
recognized three mental illnesses by his
analysis both of the culture that he
lived in and through the historical
record. Those were dementia preox, which
we might call schizophrenia, manic
depressive illness, which we now call
bipolar, and we might call like
excessive melancholia or severe
depression. like there are examples of
all three of those mental illnesses in
the historical record of almost every
culture that has left a record. And so
those seem to be the ones that have the
greatest likelihood of having a more
genetic basis to them. But that said,
they were exceedingly rare. Like there
was no historical culture where one in
six people suffered from melancholia or
dementia preox or some whatever it was.
You know what I'm saying? Nowadays, the
DSM5 has over 300 mental illnesses. And
they also from the DSM4 to the DSM5
moved away from categorical diagnosis
which is like you either have let's say
ADHD or you don't to a spectrum based

think among other things only increases
the cachment of people who would be
appropriately diagnosed. system.
