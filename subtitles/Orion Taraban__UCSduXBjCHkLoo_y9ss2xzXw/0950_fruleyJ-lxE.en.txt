Like I've seen personally and and in my
clinical practice thousands of marriages
and relationships up close. And I do
believe that in 99% of them, the woman
is the more powerful person in that
relationship. And it might not have
started that way, but it became that
way. I think part of that is that most
guys don't really have relationship
goals. Like they probably never thought
they were going to get this far on some
level. Their goal was maybe to get laid,
but the woman had other designs. She's
the one who says, "Okay, I I have a
timeline and after a certain amount of
time, I want to move in together and
then after a certain amount of time, I
think you should propose to me and then
in another, "Have you thought about the
wedding venue? Here are three that I
researched." And she's like driving the
relationship forward. And in most cases,
the guy's like, "Okay, I guess if that's
if that's what you want, sure, I'm I'm
okay with that." Or she threatens to
leave if she doesn't get what she wants,
the marriage ultimatum. And then the guy
out of scarcity mentality or fear or
even love and attachment says, "Okay,
you know, I'll give you what you want."

you know, I'll give you what you want."
Even though it might not be a
self-motivated desire on his part. And
that over time,
the power shifts, and she's the one on
some level dictating the direction of
the relationship and the operation of
the relationship on a day-to-day level.
And it's to the point where the husbands
are asking permission to leave the
house.
