i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is money is incentivized altruism
now freud once said the whole point of
psychotherapy
is to enable people to love and to work
those two things he believed are the
foundation of a successful adult life on
this planet the ability to love
and the ability to work and in my own
clinical experience
it's the fact that people generally
reach out to me when they're
experiencing difficulties
in one or the other domain on the one
hand
issues attracting quality partners or
maintaining satisfying relationships
on the other hand career dissatisfaction
and financial concerns
so i actually talk about money a lot
with my clients as i think it's often
very clinically relevant
and in the scope of my practice i have
encountered some individuals
they're generally young people in their
20s who have very negative beliefs about

[01:01]
20s who have very negative beliefs about
money
things like money is the root of all
evil money corrupts people
money turns people into slaves and that
the world would just be a better place
without it
and in my opinion money is inherently
none of those things
inherently money is sort of neutral it's
potential
and certainly that potential has been
and continues to be used in
inappropriate ways
however in the vast vast majority of
cases
money is used very very constructively
money is functionally used to
incentivize
altruism if you look at the world
and the billions of people going about
their jobs
people picking up your garbage and
making your clothes and growing your
food and building your furniture and
healing your wounds and teaching your
children and producing your leisure
all of these jobs are focused on
providing a service to
other people often people that they

[02:00]
other people often people that they
don't even know
now if we were to take the money out of
the equation
we would call these people saints in
their devotion to serving others
but because they're getting paid for
their work we generally think they're
just doing their job or they're just
doing it for money
but money is just a piece of paper or
increasingly some ones and zeros it has
little to no inherent value
money is a socially fabricated fiction
that we all collectively choose to
believe in because it generally
motivates pro-social behavior
it's such a cunning trick of the mind
tell folks they're working for something
called money
and they spend all day helping other
people
now i don't know about you but on my day
off in my spare time
i'm not volunteering at the local
orphanage i'm not building
houses for the homeless i'm typically
not helping other people at all
i don't know about you but if you're
like me i generally devote that time to
my own self-interest and pleasure
and i believe that's how most people

[03:01]
and i believe that's how most people
also choose to spend their free time
or how they would choose to spend all
their time if they were liberated from
the quote necessity
of earning money it's not like most
people would naturally just
go around helping other people out and
the few who chose to
would not be able to help other people
out at anywhere close to the same scale
that most of us currently enjoy in
modern civilization
you hear what i'm saying so without
money
that fiction that incentivizes altruism
the whole system which has now become a
global network with
billions of interconnections falls apart
the vast majority of the global economy
is based on helping other people
either by providing them with a needed
service or by offering them a product
that solves one of their problems
someone i don't know someone i probably
won't ever know
grew my food and made my clothes and
built my house
and that's actually kind of a beautiful

[04:00]
and that's actually kind of a beautiful
thing
people helping others without even
noticing who's benefiting from their
actions
if you can see money as the fiction that
it is
then suddenly the world becomes a vast
network of people helping people
and the only way this could ever happen
without money on this planet
is through the threat of force either
direct violence
or indirect ostracization and that's
what we see occurs in communist
societies
the fact the matter is people just
aren't that motivated to be pro-social
and altruistic
of their free and spontaneous will need
proof
just look at your own behavior how do
you spend your free time
you're probably not out there serving
other people so there needs to be some
sort of motivating factor
the carrot or the stick as for me
i much prefer the carrot so money can be
considered a
social good because it creates the
fiction
that incentivizes altruism

[05:02]
that incentivizes altruism
so those are my thoughts for what
they're worth if you have a topic you'd
like discussed in a future episode or
