This is it. The day of days. My
psychological novel Starry Nights is now
available in ebook, audiobook, and
paperback formats. You buy it now, you
get it right away. Except in the case of
paperback, it should be shipped to you
via Prime very, very quickly. I am so
happy and proud and accomplished to be
making this post today. This represents
over a year of dedicated effort and it's
the realization of a project that I
actually started when I was 19 years

The links to all three of those formats
are in the description to this short.
