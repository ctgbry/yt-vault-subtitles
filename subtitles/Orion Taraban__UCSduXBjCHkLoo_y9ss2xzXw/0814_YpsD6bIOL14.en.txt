it's not uncommon for young career
oriented women to go on like two three
dates a month at 2 hours a date this is
4 to 6 hours a month devoted to dating
compared to 160 hours a month devoted to
a job and 320 hours a month devoted to a
career so if you do the math the woman
with a job is spending 32 times the
amount of time energy and money on her
job and on dating and the woman with a
career is spending a whopping 64 time
times the amount of time energy and
money on her career than on dating
ladies when one bet is 64 times larger
than the other it's not your hedge
that's your primary bet the Hedge is the
small bet you're making to offset a
catastrophic downside this means that if
we're being honest women aren't
investing in their careers in order to
hedge against a husband leaving them in
midlife without any skills or experience
what it means is that women are treating
marriage as a hedge against no longer
wanting to work
