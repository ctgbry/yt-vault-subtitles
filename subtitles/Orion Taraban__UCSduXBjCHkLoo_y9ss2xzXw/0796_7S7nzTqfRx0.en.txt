I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is women
don't close I'm not saying they can't
close I'm saying they don't close when
it comes to relationships women are not
very good at sealing the deal and today
I'm going to address this issue which
should help women get more of what they
want from the men they want to get it
from so let's get to it to begin with
you have to understand that functionally
everything that tends to work in sales
also tends to work in
seduction and that's because the
fundamental premise is the same in both
cases you are trying to sell something
the fact that it's a product or a
service on the one hand and an
experience or a relationship on the
other is irrelevant what works in one
domain tends to work in the other now
women listen listen closely a

[01:01]
women listen listen closely a
fundamental premise in sales is that you
have to lead with what the other person
wants you don't lead with what you want
you lead with what the other person
wants can you imagine how successful a
Salesman would be if she led with what
she wanted imagine getting a call from a
telemarketer like this like ring ring
ring ring is this Orion Orion I would
love to talk to you today about making
my commission I get 10% of the value of
every sale and I'm saving up for a new
car so I'd really like you to buy a lot
today
so Orion are are you there can you
imagine like I get it everyone has to
make a living that salesman wanted money
so do I who doesn't want money but what
does her desire for money have to do
with me the desire for money is
completely impersonal it has nothing to

[02:01]
completely impersonal it has nothing to
do with my particular needs and wants
and interests and preferences and it
predated her interaction with me like
her desire for money is what motivated
her to call me to begin with it has
nothing to do with me
whatsoever now men come up against this
too in their desire for sex the desire
for sex is actually very impersonal a
man can just see an attractive female
and want to have sex with her this has
nothing to do with the woman like the
person inside of her body in this
situation he just kind of wants the
woman to give him access to her body in
the same way that our hypothetical
salesman just kind of wanted me to give
her access to my money and this approach
understandably wrinkles women women
might understand that men want to have
sex who doesn't but what does men's
desire for sex have to do with her her

[03:00]
desire for sex have to do with her her
it has nothing to do with her particular
needs and wants and interests and
preferences and it predated even his
laying eyes on her that desire for sex
is like genetically programmed it's
about as impersonal as it gets so men
learn pretty quickly though some faster
than others that if they want to get
laid they can't lead with what they want
to be successful they have to lead with
what the woman wants and what women want
more than anything else is an emotional
experience that's why in order to close
men learn to be funny or charming or
witty or dangerous or mysterious or bold
these approaches all generate emotional
experiences which is something of value
to
women and this is something that women
have taught men that they value because
they respond to it so a good salesman

[04:00]
they respond to it so a good salesman
leads with what the other person wants
and if she's a very good salesman she
leads with the solution to an important
self-relevant problem which is something
everybody wants the trouble is that
everyone doesn't have the same important
self-relevant problem but trust me
everyone has an important self-relevant
problem and if you can offer a solution
to that problem if you can insinuate
that the means to that solution is
simultaneously the solution to your own
problem then you have grounds for some
kind of collaboration you can do
something together however in the
absence of that it's going to be very
difficult to seal the deal and this is
precisely what so many women are
terrible at they don't know how to close
and to my mind this is largely a
consequence of the fact that they
haven't needed to close or even to
initiate for much of their lives like
the world comes to the young woman but

[05:01]
the world comes to the young woman but
that interest Fades with time many of
the women I've spoken to were
uninterested in getting married and
having children in their 20s however
when their priorities shifted in their
30s they often didn't appreciate how
much more difficult it would be to
secure the same offer that they once
received at this stage of the game most
women can't simply sit back and wait for
their meat cute and the men who do show
interest
are much more likely to entertain a
casual relationship than a long-term
commitment so what's to be
done if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 pages I delve deep into my
economic model of relationships and
explain the behavior of both men and
women in the game of mating and dating I
I also provide a lot of actionable

[06:01]
I also provide a lot of actionable
advice on how to get and keep more of
what you want in the sexual Marketplace
once you read the value of others you'll
never look at relationships the same way
again now available in ebook Audi book
and paperback formats the links are in
the
description in so many words these women
need to get better at sales too often in
the sexual Marketplace women leave with
what they want which if the woman is
attractive enough is a decent strategy
like men will line up to give beautiful
women what they want if they believe it
will improve their chances of securing a
sexual opportunity the issue is that
most women are not attractive enough to
do this but their girlfriends and their
society at large insist that they are
this is not true no one has to encourage

[07:00]
this is not true no one has to encourage
customers to buy a good affordable
product if the sales aren't coming in
it's often because the product is either
not very good or not very affordable
remember a bad business blames its
customers and the cat decides what milk
is good in any case too often women lead
with what they want which is terrible
salesmanship they will sit down with a
man on a first date and say I'm looking
to get married
I want a committed relationship I'm
searching for a real emotional
connection and it's like that's great
sweetheart but what does that have to do
with me like you had those desires
before you even knew I existed they are
completely impersonal I can empathize
with you validate your emotions and
respect your
desires but that doesn't mean that I'm
going to give you what you want because
you want it after all you don't just
give sex to Men Who desire you and this

[08:02]
give sex to Men Who desire you and this
is because it costs nothing to want and
something to give the desire to get
married is very impersonal like
functionally any two adults can go down
to the courthouse and get a license the
desire to have children is very
impersonal like it's in our DNA
functionally any man could put sperm
inside of you and give you a baby and an
emotional connection paradoxically is
also very impersonal it's functionally
possible to make an emotional connection
with anyone and your ability to do that
frankly has more to do with you than it
has to do with me so all of these are
impersonal desires that you're asking me
to personally satisfy they pre-existed
even knowing that I
exist so what's in it for
me and what's in it for most guys let's
be honest is not love or partnership or
even material gain like I love some of
my friends but I'm not going to sign a
lifelong contract establishing our Union

[09:01]
lifelong contract establishing our Union
I love some of my family but I'm not
going to invite them to live with me
what in it for most guys is a sexual
opportunity men will do all kinds of
things for the people they want to [ __ ]
that they wouldn't do for anyone else on
this planet women take advantage of this
lead with what the other person wants
offering rich and creamy milk is what
lowers resistance and opens the gate to
the city and in this way people enter
into particular Relationships by
satisfying the other person's impersonal
need in order to satisfy their own this
is how you close ladies you have to put
yourself in the shoes of your potential
customer what problems do they have that
I can potentially solve with a product
or service that I control lead with that
solution and very important ensure that

[10:00]
solution and very important ensure that
your price tag is commensurate with the
importance of the problem or the scope
of the solution do this and I guarantee
that you will have far more success in
getting what you want from
men what do you think does this fit with
your own experience let me know in the
