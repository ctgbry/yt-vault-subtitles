i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is don't eat crumbs from your own
table so this is something that i say
often
to my clients particularly with respect
to their professional difficulties
look we we commonly say that there's 24
hours in a day
and there's seven days a week and i'm
you know on one hand obviously that's
technically true but on a more practical
level
it's not true we don't have 24 hours a
day we have at most 16 hours a day
because generally we're getting about
you know seven or eight hours of sleep
and again let's be honest in that 16
hours of wakefulness
there's those hours are not equal with
respect to how
energetic and focused and productive we
tend to be
i think that there's a golden period
every day that lasts around five or six
hours for some people it's first thing

[01:01]
hours for some people it's first thing
in the morning for some people it's
it's in the early afternoon but there's
generally about
let's say four to six hours every day of
golden time
when you're going to be focused when
you're going to be productive
when you're going to be at your most
sensitive
in the sense of like perceptive and
engaged
and that's really where you're at your
peak
mental and emotional functioning any
given day
so let's say you really only have four
to six
high quality high value hours every day
okay who are you giving that time to
what are you doing during those four to
six hours if you're like the vast
majority of humanity you're giving them
to your job
you're giving them to your employer and
i know that
you know likely you're going to be
compensated for that but
i wonder if you're getting a fair trade
out of that

[02:00]
out of that
it's like generally what happens is
people give the best hours of their day
for the best years of their lives to
somebody else
and what they have left is maybe they
have an hour after dinner
maybe they are weekend warriors and they
squeeze in a little trip or an afternoon
getaway
they eat crumbs from their own table
they content themselves
with what's left over after they give
the best of their time to someone else
and the issue with that is generally
i mean what happens at the end of the
day when you have time for yourself
you're generally so exhausted um
so fuzzy with your focus that you don't
really have a lot of energy
to to be engaging to be productive to be
creative to be outgoing
and so a lot of people just plop down in
front of the screen
because that's kind of what they have
the energy for
and that creates kind of a cycle because
when they do that they often start to
judge themselves it's like oh what am i

[03:00]
judge themselves it's like oh what am i
doing with my life i'm just sitting in
front of netflix i'm watching more
youtube videos
playing more video games whatever it
seems to be when really they're just
tired because they're giving the best
hours of their life
to other people so i strongly
counsel you who are watching this video
to examine you know whether you're
getting a fair trade for those
those hours um and to potentially
to consider putting yourself first
that's all i have to say please like and
subscribe we'll talk more in future
episodes bye
