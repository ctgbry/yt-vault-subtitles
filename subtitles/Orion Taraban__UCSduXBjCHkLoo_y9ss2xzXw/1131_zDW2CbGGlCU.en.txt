One way to think about the spark is in
conjunction with attachment styles.
Whether we like it or not, we all carry
a certain template inside of us with
respect to how sexual relationships are
supposed to look and how they're

largely based on observing the
relationship or relationships of your
primary caregivers during your
childhood. This observation seems to be
a kind of instinct in that the creation
of such a template is both unconscious
and inevitable. And this kind of sucks
because it takes at least another two
decades for people to begin to become
aware of their templates and to respond
to them as necessary. In any case, if
the template is unconscious for most
people, how are they to make use of this
information in order to navigate through
life? Enter the spark. The spark is a
kind of signal that the unconscious mind
has observed a match between a given
stimulus and its relevant template.

conscious has been recognized. And this
is why the spark can feel so intense.

approach because the unconscious mind
perceives an opportunity to recreate the
templated dynamic that was impressed
upon you in childhood which for better
or worse your mind believes constitutes
your best chance of reproducing.
