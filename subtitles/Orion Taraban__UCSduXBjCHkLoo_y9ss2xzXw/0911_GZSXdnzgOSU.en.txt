Gone are the days of complimentarity in
which men and women functionally moved
in separate orbits. The modern woman is
in her masculine and she has chosen or
has been forced or has been incentivized
depending on your perspective to enter
into historically male social domains
and carve out a space there. They want
money and power and status and
recognition. And to get those things,
they have to beat out the men who also
want those things. The issue is that
just like on Survivor, the alpha males
are extremely difficult to beat in
direct competition. Like even the other
men couldn't beat them. So these men
have to be removed from the game if
women have a chance of occupying the
highest positions of power and
authority. And the play for the last
several decades has been to make all the
traits and attributes associated with
these alpha men morally reprehensible.

these alpha men morally reprehensible.
This has been done by controlling the
narrative of what makes for a real man
or a good man and increasingly through
moralization masked as medicalized
language. Only the most strong willed
and disagreeable of men are able to
resist this, especially if it is fed to
them from the time they are young boys
as yet incapable of critical Thought
