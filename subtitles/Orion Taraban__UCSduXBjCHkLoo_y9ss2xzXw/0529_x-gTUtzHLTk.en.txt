emotional Detachment is an incredibly
useful skill in fact it might be the
most important emotional survival
strategy of which I am aware and I
approach the concept of emotional
Detachment through a Buddhist lens
namely through the realization that the
universe is in a NeverEnding process of
becoming everything in this world is
ephemeral even now the present moment is
changing is dying is transforming into
something else which will itself change
die
and transform within this understanding
everything that we have will eventually
be taken from us so why cling permanence
is an illusion in the world Under the
Sun your property your relationships
your incarnate being you'll lose them
all in the fullness of time so how will
you respond when it comes time to let
them go will you give back what you had
with gratitude for the time that you
were allowed to spend with it or will
you cling to it with an attachment that
is as tenacious as it is futile
