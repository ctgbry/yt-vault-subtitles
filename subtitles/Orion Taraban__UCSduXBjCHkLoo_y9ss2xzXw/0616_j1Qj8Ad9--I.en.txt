I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is what most
people don't understand about mental
illness the business of suffering so
this is the second part of a two-part
episode so be sure that you listen to
the first part first let's jump back in
as I mentioned at the end of the first
half the biggest issue associated with
the reification of mental disorders is
that it Fosters dependence on a
privileged class of Specialists who
enjoy a monopoly on the indicated
treatment in the popular
imagination okay what the heck does this
mean now I'm a clinical psychologist
that means that I talk to people about
their problems and advise them on
Solutions on the level of their own
self-experience this means for example I
might recommend say Activity scheduling
or behavioral activation to
interventions within an individual's
domain of control associated with high
rates of success for someone who comes
in feeling depressed these are solutions

[01:00]
in feeling depressed these are solutions
that the individual in question can even
do for himself much like a person who
wants to lose weight can eat less and
exercise more without necessarily hiring
a nutritionist or a personal trainer I
might help people get there faster than
they might otherwise on their own but
I'm not necessarily doing anything that
they couldn't at least theoretically do
for
themselves however that's not how the
majority of mental illness is treated in
this country do you remember who writes
the DSM it's the American Psychiatric
association now at this point you might
reasonably ask but Orion why do
psychologists and counselors and
therapists of all Stripes people who
primarily use Psychotherapy and human
level solutions to address suffering in
the mind and in the heart why do these
people use the diagnostic categories and
formulations of
psychiatrists who are medical doctors
and I would say that that is an
excellent question worth exploring in

[02:02]
excellent question worth exploring in
today's day and age there are a lot of
different degrees out there MD PhD Sid
LCSW mft and many many others it's
difficult to navigate and even people in
the industry don't always know the
differences here however for our present
purposes let's just compare
psychologists with
psychiatrists they both have doctorates
and are both the top of their respective
fields in general psychiatrists can do
anything that psychiatrist can do with
one important exception which serves as
the biggest practical difference between
these two professions namely a
psychiatrist being a medical doctor can
prescribe
medication that's kind of their Racket
and they guard it very jealously because
it's extremely lucrative to keep this
particular intervention monopolized
under their
control now if you have a human problem
like feeling down or on edge you might
be amenable to Human Solutions like like

[03:00]
be amenable to Human Solutions like like
talking about your problems or
disciplining your thoughts however if
instead you have a medical problem like
major depressive disorder or generalized
anxiety disorder you're going to need a
medical solution and the medical
solution that the psychiatric Community
has functionally decided upon is
pharmacotherapy pills if you hang around
a barber you're going to get a haircut
by the same token if you go to see a
psychiatrist you're probably going to
leave with a prescription why it's kind
of what they do and this is not an
intervention that people can do for
themselves because the mechanism of
action is kind of outside people's
domain of control and this creates a
dependence on this class of Specialists
people need psychiatrists to treat
mental illness in the same way that
people needed the church to perform
exorcisms they're presumed to be the
only people with the Neary tools for the

[04:01]
only people with the Neary tools for the
job all right so what does this have to
do with the reification of mental
illness discussed in the first part of
this episode ever notice how there are
more and more mental illnesses with each
passing addition of the DSM or what's
more how the thresholds of pre-existing
illnesses continue to be lowered to
increasingly pathologize the normal
range of human emotion and behavior like
for example how it used to be the case
that someone couldn't be diagnosed with
major depressive disorder if they were
grieving you know because feeling
depressed is a normal understandable
human response the loss of an important
relationship but how the latest edition
of the DSM removed this bereavement
exclusion from the diagnosis of MDD ever
noticed how over the past few decades
we've radically overextended what
constitutes a mental disorder under the
prevailing diagnostic
conceptualization kind of strange don't
you think now

[05:00]
you think now
I'm sure this has nothing to do with it
but psychiatrists decide what constitute
a medical disorder and psychiatrists
typically treat medical mental disorders
with pharmaceutical
medications now in order for the FDA to
approve a psychiatric medication that
new medication needs to be demonstrated
effective in treating the symptoms of a
specific disorder and if a particular
medication has already been approved for
that specific disorder the thresholds of
demonstrated Effectiveness for the new
medication are even higher than they
otherwise would be and this is certainly
unfortunate from a business perspective
because FDA approval of a new drug can
result in billions of dollars in new
revenue for pharmaceutical companies and
those who prescribe their products of
course one way around that problem would
be to I don't know create a bunch of new
disorders that don't don't yet have FDA

[06:00]
disorders that don't don't yet have FDA
approved treatments as a way to keep the
money
flowing however despite the fact that it
would clearly be in their financial best
interest to do so and despite the fact
that given industry capture of certain
Regulatory Agencies it would clearly be
feasible for them to pull this off I'm
not arguing that they actually do this
as that would be extremely unethical and
corrupt wouldn't
it I'm just noting that hypothetically
it would be possible for this to occur
now you might think well Orion what's
the problem with that what's the problem
with more new medicines to treat new
problems as we discover them and I would
respond are we discovering them or are
we creating them remember according to
the psychiatrists themselves there is no
conclusive diagnostic assessment for any
one of their mental disorders so how can
you really prove that a drug is
effective in treating a disorder when
you can't even prove that the disorder
objectively exists in the first

[07:02]
objectively exists in the first
place and if objective corroboration of
any new disorder is
unnecessary then we're basically now in
the realm of
metaphysics we're arguing functionally
how many angels can fit on the head of a
pin it used to be two now it's 300 and I
guarantee we'll find more ways to fit
even more angels on that pin with each
passing year because why not since there
were relationship with objective reality
is tenuous already we can continue to
split the categories even finer that way
the new conceptualizations can be
medicalized and a new pharmaceutical
solution for that conceptualization can
be brought to market after all it
doesn't really work if you sell the
solution and then create the problem
does
it okay but what's the problem with
giving people who are suffering
medication Orion do you want them to
continue to suffer of course not the
problem with doing this is that it

[08:01]
problem with doing this is that it
largely doesn't work which is to say
that at both the individual and
population level these interventions
often create more problems than they
solve if Pharmaceuticals conclusively
improve mental health outcomes that
would be one thing however the United
States has some of the worst mental
health outcomes in the entire world not
just in the industrialized world the
entire world like Z babwe has better
outcomes associated with schizophrenia
than the United States does and how much
more expensive is the American treatment
than the Zimbabwean treatment the
American public has largely been sold at
bill of sale with respect to mental
health treatment they pay more for Less
to quote the National Library of
Medicine the United States has some of
the worst mental health related outcomes
in the world including the highest
suicide rate and the second highest drug
related death rate and on some level we

[09:00]
related death rate and on some level we
all know this after all if these
interventions were
effective shouldn't we see fewer people
with mental illness kind of like how we
see fewer people with say measles
following the widespread use of the
measles
vaccine kind of makes you think now
before I go any further if you're liking

description okay let's get back to
it as noted previously today one in four
people in the United States has a mental
illness some of these are mild cases but
many of them are not like there's

[10:00]
many of them are not like there's
something called SSDI which is Social
Security disability insurance which is a
government monthly stipend issued to
people who are so disabled that they
can't work according to the National
Institute of Health quote people with
psychiatric impairments constitute the
largest and most rapidly growing
subgroup of Social Security Disability
beneficiaries in 1999 which I guess is
the most recent year for which
statistics are available which is kind
of odd quote 34% of working adults
receiving SSI and 27% of s SSDI
recipients had a primary psychiatric
impairment this means that one in three
people who receive this kind of
assistance are too anxious or depressed
or Autistic or psychotic to work that's
an enormous number and as the NIH
reminds us it's rapidly
growing but Orion isn't that number

[11:01]
growing but Orion isn't that number
growing because it's catching up with
the true number of mentally ill that
have always been with us like it's not
that more people are actually mentally
ill today it's that we've increased our
awareness of mental illness and improved
our ability to screen it right now I've
already addressed the issues with
spreading awareness in my episode
understanding the symptom pool so I
won't repeat myself here so let's talk
about the screaming argument for a
minute this can't be the reason behind
the recent explosion in the prevalence
of mental illness why as we've discussed
multiple times there are no laboratory
findings that are diagnostic of any of
the disorders that have been identified
and you can't screen something if you
don't have a reliable test for detecting
it can you by screening what we actually
mean is people coming in and filling out
checklists which can be interpreted in a
lot of different ways let's look at the
criteria for ADHD again shall

[12:00]
criteria for ADHD again shall
we often fails to give close attention
to details oh yeah absolutely sometimes
I have to read something two or three
times in order to attend to all of the
detailed information in the
text often has difficulty sustaining
attention oh yeah my mind definitely
wanders during those boring work
meetings often does not seem to listen
when spoken to directly you know it I
mean I forget people's names all the
time like as soon as they're told to me
holy maybe I have ADHD I had no
idea giving people who are already
primed to think that they may have
something wrong with their attention a
checklist like this and you dramatically
increase the likelihood that they will
interpret the criteria in light of that
priming and of course the standard
treatment for this issue is to change
people's brain chemistry now you might
think if brain chemistry were the issue
we would have objective laboratory
evaluations capable of observing

[13:00]
evaluations capable of observing
abnormal levels of brain chemicals
before we prescribe the
medication but we don't so you'd be
forgiven and it's certainly the case
that these medications do change the
levels of certain brain chemicals and
that the brain can become habituated to
these chemicals through repeated use and
this would mean that once habituated
people might have to continue to take
that medication
indefinitely especially since in the
absence of objective assessment there
would be no clear indication that the
issue has ever been effectively
resolved and this is how people become
lifetime consumers of psychiatric
medication and how do you think that
would impact outcomes our mental
illnesses more or less prevalent among
lifetime consumers of psychiatric
medication obviously that would be a
correlation not a causation but it would
be interesting to note right what do you
think it would look like if millions of
people started changing their brain

[14:00]
people started changing their brain
chemistry sometimes in irrevocable ways
in order to solve problems that the
prescribing doctors themselves cannot or
could not reliably link to brain
chemistry might this have some
risks might this create more problems
than it
solves something to consider what do you
think does this fit with your own
