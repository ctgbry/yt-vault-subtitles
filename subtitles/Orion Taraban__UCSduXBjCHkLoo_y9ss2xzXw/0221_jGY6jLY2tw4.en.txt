i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the fear of commitment
now this is a judgment that is usually
leveled by women at men
when men don't want to enter into a
relationship with them
and while it is certainly true that
there are some men out there that are
legitimately afraid like
fearful of commitment
i'm here to tell you that the vast
majority of men are not in fact afraid
of commitment and in this episode i will
explain why
men understand that in order to
accomplish anything great in life
you need allies
you can't send a rocket to the moon or
manage a billion dollar investment fund
all by yourself you need partners you
need to be a part of the team
this is a part
this is true of my own experience as
well
i have committed to many things over the
years in order to accomplish things i
couldn't do alone i've committed to a
course of graduate study that required

[01:00]
course of graduate study that required
120 hours of work a week for years
i've taken out several substantial loans
and paid back every penny
i've
served as an elected official on the
boards of nonprofits and local
governments
i've developed virtual products with a
team of web developers on the other side
of the world
to be sold on the global market
i go to the gym every other day whether
i feel like it or not and my word is my
bond if i say i'm going to do something
you can consider it done
i've accomplished a great deal in my
life through discipline forbearance and
commitment
i have no problem with commitment
and yet i too have been accused of being
afraid of commitment from specific women
when i've turned down their invitations
for a relationship
you may not want to hear this but here's
the ugly truth
if a guy turns down an invitation for a
relationship
it's probably not because he's afraid of
commitment

[02:00]
commitment
it's probably because
your offer isn't good enough
plain and simple
consider the same scenario in a
professional context
i have a private psychotherapy practice
but just for fun i note on linkedin that
i'm open to job offers from recruiters i
like to see what else is out there to
stay relevant and every once in a while
i'm called by a recruiter and it's
fascinating how these conversations go
they tell me the compensation and i'll
respond that i make three times that
they'll tell me it's a 40 hour a week
job i'll tell them that i work 25 hours
a week they'll tell me that i have to
report to the clinical director i'll
tell them that i'm my own boss
they'll say i have to come into the
office i'll tell them that i get to work
from home
they'll say i would get four weeks
vacation i tell them that i take all the
time off that i want
and they look at me
and i look at them
and we obviously don't do a deal
but i guarantee that they don't go away
thinking
that i have a fear of employment

[03:01]
that i have a fear of employment
it's that what they have to offer isn't
better than what i've already got
on the other hand if their offer
improved my situation i would have no
problem signing the contract i've signed
many contracts in my time
look a commitment is a sacrifice
it's a relinquishing of significant
opportunity and usually requires a great
deal
of time energy and money
there has to be some upside some
compensation involved and if the
compensation associated with this
commitment is less
than what i can expect to enjoy from
either remaining a free agent or from
another commitment i can reasonably hope
to enjoy in the future
it would be foolish of me to take that
opportunity
rejecting such an offer isn't a fear of
commitment
it's exercising prudence with respect to
allocating my limited resources
so if you're having trouble ladies if
this is the situation in your life you

[04:00]
this is the situation in your life you
might have to take a long and hard look
at what you have to offer the specific
man you're inviting into a relationship
you have to make an offer
that he would perceive as a significant
improvement
over his current situation
or else you're not going to get a deal
he is not afraid of commitment he is
telling you that your offer is not good
enough
that may sound mean but
it's meaner to pretend that that's not
the fact
something to consider
