So, this is something that I'm not
infrequently asked about. It's like,
Orion, can you give an example from
popular culture, a book, a movie, a TV
show of a relationship that you feel
actually works that you could hold up as
a kind of model for a positive, healthy,
functional relationship? You seem kind
of down on relationships in general. So,
what does a good relationship look like?
And it's true. I'm often not very
optimistic about relationships. They're
just so hard to do over the long term.
I've seen hundreds of marriages up close
and there hasn't been any that I've seen
where I've said to myself, "Man, I wish
I could change places with that guy."
Now, I thought about this question a
bunch because I want to help people. I
want to be able to hold up a model of a
good marriage. But there really aren't a
lot of good examples in our popular
culture. In most of the content
produced, which it should be remembered
is ultimately for entertainment
purposes, the guy is kind of hopeless
and dumb and ugly and the woman is the
competent and attractive one. When the

competent and attractive one. When the
relationship works, it kind of works in
spite of the guy and because of her
efforts. And this is just not how things
operate in reality. More competent women
do not end up with less competent men.
And even when they do, they certainly
don't stay with those men. and the
relationship is generally pretty
unsatisfying until they leave. We know,
for instance, that women who outearn
their partners are significantly more
likely to file for divorce. And this
isn't entirely or even mostly due to
male fragility or whatever nonsense
explanation is circulating in the
popular consciousness.
