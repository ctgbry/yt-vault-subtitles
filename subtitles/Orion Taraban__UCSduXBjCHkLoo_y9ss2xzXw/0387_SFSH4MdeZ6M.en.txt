I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and
today we'll be doing another sponsored
episode so these formats are a bit
different I'm going to read the email
that I received from the sponsor and
then sort of Riff on the themes
contained therein so let's get right to
it so this one is coming from RP Mentor
Tokyo
and his question is
a good question
uh where have all the good men gone
you hear this as a complaint among women
when they're looking for sexual partners
specifically somebody to have children
with
I think we've all heard this at one
point in our lives
and uh in providing relevant context he
included this quote from
social psychologist Roy bum Meister
who wrote

[01:00]
who wrote
for women throughout history and
pre-history the odds of reproducing have
been pretty good
later in this talk we will ponder things
like why was it so rare for a hundred
women to get together and build a ship
and sail off to explore unknown regions
whereas men have fairly regularly done
such things
but Taking Chances like that would be
stupid from the perspective of a
biological organism seeking to reproduce
they might drown or be killed by Savages
or catch a disease for women the optimal
thing is to do is to go along with the
crowd be nice
play it safe
the odds are good that men will come
along and offer sex and you'll be able
to have babies all that matters is
choosing the best offer we're descended
from women who played it safe so there's
a number of themes in here that I've
touched on in previous episodes
for example all that matters is choosing
the best offer that fits very well with
my episode women treat men the way men

[02:00]
my episode women treat men the way men
treat jobs which is a way for men to
kind of
acclimate emotionally to the idea of
female hypergamy without taking it
personally
it sounds like this quote
I think what the sponsor is getting at
is potentially some of the more virtuous
and masculine traits that we associate
with men that the Daring Do the Courage
the adventuresomeness the the boldness
the strength on some level they get
weeded out of the gene pool because
those men are more likely to go off and
get themselves killed by having an
adventure
whereas maybe some of the Meeker more
feminine men stay at home and they're
the ones who actually end up reproducing
with the women
and so over time a lot of our uh
strongest masculine traits sort of get
evolutionary they get select naturally
selected out of the gene pool and I
think that there's probably some some
truth to that
um
women have more children than men do

[03:02]
women have more children than men do
throughout history for precisely that
reason it's much more likely for a woman
to reproduce than a man for instance but
the other side of that coin is that if a
man goes off on an adventure and he
comes back
with treasure and loot and fame he just
hit the jackpot and there's a very good
chance that he is going to be a very
successful uh reproducer from an
evolutionary standpoint
um we might not think of him as very
virtuous or kind but I think it's true
that Genghis Khan is the direct
descendant of one out of 200 men on the
planet today
so he was one of History's Greatest
evolutionary success stories from the
standpoint of actually reproducing his
genetic material and so that's that's
kind of why I think Bob meister's
perspective sort of gets balanced is
that yeah a lot of this gets weeded out
but if you actually are the

[04:00]
but if you actually are the
adventuresome guy you come and you come
back you can make a huge impact on the
female population and your genes can
redound throughout history so it might
end up being like six of one half a
dozen of the other though of course
there are fewer Big Winners if you're a
man which means that there's probably
less genetic variability with respect to
this kind of thing so it's an
interesting point
for me the question of where all the
good men have gone
has less to do with genes and has less
to do with natural selection or
evolutionary pressures and it has much
much more to do with culture it has much
much more to do with learning
and I think it's fairly fair to say that
a lot of what we consider to be
traditional healthy masculinity is under
attack in the west I don't think that
will come as much of a surprise to many
of the people listening to this channel
um and it's important to understand that
a culture

[05:00]
a culture
can go extinct in three generations
grandparent to parent parent to son or
child if that culture is not transmitted
across those three generations the
fourth one
it's it's gone it's it's almost
Irreplaceable at that point
so what we have to understand is that
it's not that so much that good men have
gone like they've left
as it is that fewer good men are being
created with each subsequent generation
because it's under masculinity is under
attack from a great deal of social
institutional pressures in the West in
particular
so I I think that
and this is especially important for the
women out there to listen to and to pay
attention to
because the same woman
who might be complaining about boys
Rough and Tumble play or

[06:00]
Rough and Tumble play or
um potentially the patriarchy they might
also be wondering where all the good men
have gone
and the way that women raise their
children will end up being the fathers
and husbands of the Next Generation
and on some level it behooves women to
raise boys in a way not so that they're
obedient and compliant children
but so that they can become
they can grow up to be the men that they
themselves
would desire in a husband and a father
that's sort of a woman's a mother's
greatest success in raising boys
is not
to make nice boys but to raise good men
and this requires the adult mothers to
examine some of their beliefs about men
and women and power and masculinity and
femininity and these can be very fraught

[07:01]
femininity and these can be very fraught
ideas and Concepts in today's day and
age they don't have to be but they are
so it's really important to be
very cautious and calm and sober minded
as we examine uh these these Concepts
because
when they are not when they're allowed
to operate behind the scenes they can
exert an enormous unconscious impact on
the things that we do don't do what we
say and don't say and who we allow
ourselves to be and who we choose to
become
so that's kind of what I have for you
today RP Mentor Tokyo I hope that
suffices
um it's definitely more to talk about on
this subject and I hope we can do so in
future episodes so thank you so for your
support and if you're listening in you
yourself we'd like to sponsor an episode
