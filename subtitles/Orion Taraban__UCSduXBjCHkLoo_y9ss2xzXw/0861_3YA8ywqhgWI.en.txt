I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the
beginning of the end so I'm going to be
talking today specifically to the men in
the audience gentlemen I'm going to help
you prevent your relationships from
going off the rails let's get to it now
everybody is different and every
relationship is going to be unique to
the individuals involved but if you've
following my work you know that in
general I believe that relationships are
more successful and sustainable when the
man is the captain and the adored and
when the woman is the passenger and the
adorer if you're unfamiliar with these
terms then you should read my book the
value of others where I go into these
Concepts in extensive detail and I
believe this because when the man is in
this position he maintains frame frame

[01:01]
this position he maintains frame frame
in this context is authority vested with
power to dictate the terms and structure
of the relationship how it is arranged
how it unfolds what it entails who does
what what are the Privileges and
responsibilities of each
Etc when men control the frame
relationships have a much better chance
of being mutually satisfying and
enduring and regardless of the mixed
messages
that they give men these days the vast
majority of women still want a guy that
they can look up to to be The Confident
leader that initiates and directs the
relationship however in about
99% of the relationships that I've
personally examined the woman is more
powerful than the man which means that
she controls the frame of the
relationship and I think this has to do
with why despite the fact that I've

[02:00]
with why despite the fact that I've
looked at hundreds and hundreds of
relationships I can count the number of
relationships that I would consider
happy like relationships that I
personally would want to be in on one
hand and I don't think it's a
coincidence that in every one of those
relationships the man was more powerful
than the
woman so if relationships are more
satisfying and enduring when the man
retains frame for both the man and the
woman why is it the case that women so
often control it now there are two main
ways that this occurs in the first case
it happens right from the beginning the
man who may not be a full-fledged
Captain seeds control of the
relationship to the woman as an
enticement to enter into a relationship
with him in the book I call this the
sexual strategy of the fairy boo Captain
this is how less attractive men beat out
their intersexual competition they offer

[03:00]
their intersexual competition they offer
women privileges that their more
attractive counterparts wouldn't
ultimately the frustration of not
getting more of what they want from more
attractive men in combination with the
gratification of getting more of what
they want at least in the short term
from less attractive men can motivate
women to enter into relationships with
less attractive men where they can more
or less dictate terms from the GetGo
whether they're aware of it or not these
men understand that happy wife happy
life is the cost of doing
business however this is not the only
way that women come to control the frame
of a relationship in some cases the man
enters into the relationship as a
full-fledged Captain invested with the
legitimate Authority such a position
enjoys by the woman in
question but over time slowly and
insidiously the balance of power shifts
so completely that the man no longer

[04:00]
so completely that the man no longer
recognizes his own life and can't quite
remember how things turned out this
way in point of fact most men control
the frame at the beginning of the
courtship process and lose it through
small concessions as the relationship
progresses consider your first date with
your girlfriend or wife chances are good
that you approached her with a plan I'd
like to take you out let's meet at this
time time at this place on this day and
this is what I'd like the two of us to
do and that she agreed to that plan you
created an experience for her to enter
into that's frame it's very unlikely
that you would have been able to secure
that opportunity without creating such
an experience and it's even less likely
that she went through the trouble of
creating an experience for you to enter
into so most relationships begin with
the man in charge and just so we say the

[05:00]
the man in charge and just so we say the
quiet part out loud that's why the
woman's there women reward men who use
frame to create an experience for them
to enter into they do not chase down men
who don't or won't do this this is
important to keep in mind throughout the
duration of the relationship as men will
be tempted to surrender frame in a
variety of ways over
time this temptation occurs in two
primary ways sometimes
it's the temptation to escape an
uncomfortable emotional situation
created by the woman in a bid for more
power and control as I discussed in the
Easter egg hunt these bids typically
follow the PSA system of emotional
manipulation or pity shame anger PSA no
matter the particular thumb screw the
woman applies emotional pressure on the
man who then seeds frame as a a way of

[06:00]
man who then seeds frame as a a way of
buying his way out of a difficult
dynamic as I discussed in the book in
its extreme manifestation this takes the
form of an attempted hijacking in which
the woman threatens to leave or divorce
if her demands are not
met if you appreciate the insights on
this channel I would highly encourage
you to get your hands on a copy of my
book the value of others over the course
of 432 Pages i d deep into my economic
model of relationships and explain the
behavior of both men and women in the
game of mating and dating I also provide
a lot of actionable advice on how to get
and keep more of what you want in the
sexual Marketplace once you read the
value of others you'll never look at
relationships the same way again now

paperback formats the links are in the

[07:00]
however the temptation to surrender
frame doesn't always come from the
outside many if not most men seduce
themselves into doing so however this is
only possible if the man becomes
emotionally invested which induces a
distortion in his thinking typically by
activating his latent
Romanticism this Romanticism in turn
either motivates him to sacrifice more
and more of his life for his one and
only or tempts him into the ideal of
equal
partnership this might sound surprising
but as I've discussed previously
partnership is the most prevalent male
romantic ideal in our culture
today this might sound appealing in the
abstract and many might disagree with
their words but most women don't want to
be either
pedestalize or
partnered think back to what I said just
a few moments ago about the early stages

[08:01]
a few moments ago about the early stages
of courtship the woman is there because
the Man created an experience for them
to enter
into most likely the experience did not
occur at her convenience which is what
would be necessary if being
pedestalize nor did it occur as the
result of some collaborative process
which is what would be necessary if
partnership were preferred it occurred
because the man invited the woman into
an experience that he created using his
power autonomy creativity and
resources women teach men that this
works by responding positively to this
structure and Men deviate from what
works at their own risk so how exactly
does this happen I'm going to describe
the moment when the man begins to seed
frame to the woman so that you can
recognize it and respond resp to it

[09:00]
recognize it and respond resp to it
appropriately I call this moment the
beginning of the end because failing to
respond appropriately puts the
relationship on a slippery slope toward
dissolution or Worse an expensive
unsatisfying marriage this occurs when a
the man is sufficiently emotionally
invested and B the woman directly or
indirectly wants something from the man
that he authentic Al doesn't want to
give the request could be big Let's Get
Married let's move in together or small
let's go antiquing on Sunday let's go to
brunch with all my couple friends but in
general the requests start small and
escalate over time now if the man
weren't emotionally invested this this
wouldn't be a problem he would just say
no because as I talk about in women are
a role of the dice he isn't G Ling with
more than he can afford to lose however

[10:03]
more than he can afford to lose however
once he crosses a certain point he comes
to believe that he can no longer say no
even though he would like to because he
fears the consequences of doing so he
fears the discomfort that will arise in
himself in seeing his woman angry or
disappointed he fears the pain that he
would experience were she to leave him
once that fear takes takes hold which is
the consequence of his overinvestment he
is no longer a free man and he
increasingly abandons his authenticity
in favor of emotional defensiveness he's
trying to protect
himself the issue of course is that this
doesn't
work that fear is a liar it lies it only
takes like 10 seconds to see through the
LIE namely if you actually needed to
give a woman certain things that you

[11:00]
give a woman certain things that you
don't authentically want to give in
order to prevent her from leaving then
she would have left by
now you haven't given her those things
in the past and you've gotten this far
you've abided in your authenticity and
she was attracted to you because of it
so on some level if it ain't broke don't
fix it man there is no evidence that not
doing something you feel conflicted
about will threaten the basis of the
relationship and a lot of evidence that
doing what you authent i al want to do
will secure the levels of success and
stability that you've enjoyed up until
now so that's how the fear
lies just like the initial stages of
courtship it's generally a much better
idea for men to maintain frame over the
course of the relationship this is what
I'll do this is what I won't do and
allowing the woman to either opt in or
out as she so
chooses of course not getting what they
want in the short term can be
frustrating and disappointing to a woman

[12:00]
frustrating and disappointing to a woman
and that's okay that's okay she's
entitled to her feelings and you don't
have to make her feel differently let
her feel how she's going to feel it's
not going to kill her and it won't kill
you to let her experience her emotions
she's an adult she can handle her
feelings you do not need to make her
feel better and you do not need to give
her what she wants just to avoid this
experience that said there may always be
a PLL in men to do one or the other
however I bring this up because it is so
so much easier to resist these emotional
impulses when they first present
themselves as difficult as it may be it
is always better to fight these battles
when they are still small because they
will only get bigger and more difficult
to win with
reinforcement we don't like to talk
about it but being in a position of
power often means that you have to deny
and reject

[13:00]
and reject
others consider a professional
relationship between an employer and an
employee can you imagine a company in
which the employees were allowed to
dictate their own compensation
packages since everyone pretty much
believes they deserve more than they
receive it's very likely that that
strategy would make that company
insolvent very quickly and then everyone
would be out of a job including the
employer whether employees are aware of
it or not their continued employment
often depends on their not getting what
they
want of course this is a balance give
people everything that they want and you
threaten the basis of the relationship
it becomes insolvent however give people
too little of what they want and they
protest and leave that said while the
second option is potentially
inconvenient it should be preferred to
the first as it doesn't also result in
the destruction of the company so it's

[14:02]
the destruction of the company so it's
better to air on the side of giving too
little than too much in general the
price of getting most of what you want
is the willingness to forgo getting
everything that you
want remember a woman who sees you as
her best option is not going to leave
her when you tell her no on the other
hand the more you tell her yes that is
the more you give her what she wants the
more expensive and difficult the
relationship will be come for you
catering to her desires usually due to
emotional overinvestment increasingly
transfers control the frame to the woman
which often signals the beginning of the
end of the
relationship however this can be
prevented by recognizing and tolerating
your own fear and choosing not to
surrender to its behavioral
impulses what do you think does this fit
