the correct opinion about things one way
or another like in order to maintain
your relationships with your friends and
your relatives and your colleagues and
your communities it has become
increasingly necessary to hold the
correct read same opinion as those
around you the necessity is not just to
have an opinion but to have the correct
read same opinion as those around you
this necessity is directly responsible
for making Society more polarized and
