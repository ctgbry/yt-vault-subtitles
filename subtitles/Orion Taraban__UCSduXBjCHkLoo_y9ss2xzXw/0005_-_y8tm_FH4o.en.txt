i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology so
today in the short video we'll be
discussing
um believe it
to see it believe it to see it
so we have in english this idiom that
uh you got to see it to believe it or
i'll believe it when i see it
which basically means that something is
sort of incredulous and i i want proof
that it exists before
i kind of uh admit the possibility of
its existence
which is belief and people who
who demand this level of
let's say certainty before they're
willing to believe in the possibility of
existence of something
they they generally don't
they don't expand their conception of
the world
very readily the fact of the matter is
is that in general on the contrary we
have to believe something first

[01:01]
have to believe something first
we have to believe it in order to see it
there's there's a couple of reasons for
that one
is that if we don't believe that
something even exists
why would we go looking for it that
doesn't make
any sense whatsoever if you don't
believe that
bigfoot exists for instance you're not
going to go
searching for evidence one way or the
other that's something of a frivolous
example but if you don't believe that
let's say there are any good women in
your area
you're not going to go looking for them
or you don't believe that
you can find a faithful committed man
you're not going to go looking for them
and the mind is a hunter what it
searches for
it finds which means that we have to be
very careful about what we go looking
for because we tend to find it one way
or the other
we have to believe it in order to see it
and this is because
site generally become it begins
with an internal vision we have to know
what we're looking for
in order to be able to find it finding

[02:01]
in order to be able to find it finding
is really recognition
you know if i'm looking for my my
glasses
it's because i have a conceptualization
of what they are and then when i find
them on the table i recognize them and i
motivates me to stop looking it's like
aha there they are which means on some
level i had to believe that the glasses
existed
and i had to believe that i could find
them in order to go looking for them
and then of course i needed to have some
vision about
some understanding of what those glasses
look like to be able to recognize them
when i found them that's the other thing
is sometimes people
people come across things but they don't
recognize
that this is actually what they were
looking for and so they just keep
searching which is
somewhat tragic so we have to believe
before we see it because the believing
allows us to see it it creates the
capacity to
recognize that which we encounter as
that which we might be searching for
without that belief ships in the night

[03:00]
without that belief ships in the night
we can
pass right by without any kind of
awareness whatsoever
so we'll talk more about this in future
