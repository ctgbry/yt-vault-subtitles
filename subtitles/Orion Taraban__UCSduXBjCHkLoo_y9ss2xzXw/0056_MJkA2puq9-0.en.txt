i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
what if
now behind every feeling is a thought
and it's often the case that behind an
anxious feeling is a thought that begins
with the words what if
what if i lose my job
what if she says no
what if i get sick what if i get someone
else sick what if they all think i'm
stupid what if i don't have anyone to
talk to at the party what if what if
what if
if you've listened to some of my other
episodes you'll know that i often talk
about becoming more mindful of the
cognitions that give rise to unpreferred
emotional states and utilizing the block
and replace method to actively resist
these cognitions and substitute more
reality-based alternatives
and with respect to anxiogenic
cognitions thoughts likely to give rise
to anxious emotions the replacement
thought for what if is almost always
some variant of so what

[01:02]
some variant of so what
that's the attitude i would ask anyone
suffering from anxiety to consider
cultivating
what if i lose my job
well so what
that might be a blessing in disguise if
i found this job i can find another and
potentially one that better suits me and
avoids some of the hassles associated
with my current situation
what if she says no
well
so what that would be her loss i just
wanted to get to know her and if she's
not interested that's okay i'll find
somebody else i like who would also be
interested in spending time with me
what if i get sick well
so what
it's not like i haven't gotten sick in
the past i know it's not the end of the
world i feel bad for a certain amount of
time i pass through some discomfort and
i emerge more resilient on the other
side
so what
i will either find a way or i will make
a way
try it out for yourself
