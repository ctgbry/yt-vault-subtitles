in this world men nothing is handed to
you everything of value must be obtained
through effort and struggle however this
process beset as it is with tests and
trials is often disparaged by the
individuals involved many would prefer
that the good in question the money the
woman The Virtue were just handed over
to them on a silver platter and they
kind of resent the necessity of having
to prove their Worth to others in order
to get what they want unfortunately as
far as I can tell this necessity is
necessary it's unavoidable and since it
is unavoidable it is useful to reframe
this reality to accommodate a growth
mindset and the best reframe that I've
personally been able to come up with is
that a test is not necessarily an ordeal
rather a test is an opportunity to
demonstrate Your Excellence or show your
Merit or exhibit your talent or show off
your Mastery in point of fact many of
these things are only ever revealed
through tests and they might otherwise
remain buried within the individuals in
question had the pretext for the
Revelation not presented itself
