i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is
functional hopelessness is a term that
to my knowledge i invented
and it's a concept the application of
which has helped me deal with other
people
what i've discovered both in my own life
and in the lives of many of my clients
is that the disappointments that we are
that are subject to arising in our
relationships with others
are often due to the fact that we
believe others to be capable of more
than they currently seem to be
we often see in them the potential to be
better than they currently are
usually this means that we project our
own standards onto these people and then
measure them against their will or even
their knowledge against these same
standards
the result of this is that we typically
become disappointed when these folks
fail to quote become who they could have
been

[01:00]
been
which is generally just a roundabout way
of saying who we wanted them to be
we look at other people and we see their
potential and we're frustrated and
disappointed that they haven't yet
manifested in its entirety that
potential
functional hopelessness basically means
that you give up hope that the potential
associated with that particular person
will ever be realized
this potential might not even actually
exist within that person technically it
exists only within your own mind and is
being projected into this other person
you cannot see potential it cannot be
sensed with the eyes you cannot hear
potential it cannot be sensed with the
ears you can only think potential it's
something that can only be apprehended
by your mind
functional hopelessness means that we
divest ourselves of the fallacy that the
potential of others exists anywhere
outside of our own consciousness
and what i found is that practicing

[02:01]
and what i found is that practicing
functional hopelessness while difficult
in the beginning can dramatically
improve one's relationships with others
for instance it's very hard to become
frustrated with someone when you have no
expectation that they will be different
from how they actually are
in this way functional hopelessness
facilitates the acceptance of others on
some level you can't accept other people
for who they are until you're able to
disabuse yourself of your own projected
expectations of them
and people generally become less
defensive and ornery when they feel that
other people aren't trying to change
them
which on some level is always somewhat
invalidating and disapproving
now just for the record acceptance is
not the same as approval
sometimes accepting people for who they
are
means that certain relationships have to
end
and this happens because you begin to
more clearly separate who people are

[03:00]
more clearly separate who people are
from who you want them to be
once you do this you can make better
decisions about the appropriate
placement of certain individuals in your
life now this is easy to say and
challenging to do but see for yourself
if functional hopelessness can't help to
improve the quality of your
relationships
