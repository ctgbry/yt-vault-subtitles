i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
the game of small talk
there are very few people i've ever met
who enjoy small talk
i'm not one of them
i like to have authentic grounded
interesting conversations with people
but the fact of the matter is that you
generally don't know what topics are
going to facilitate that kind of
conversation with someone you've never
met before so on some level small talk
is a necessary evil but it's an evil
with a point
the point of small talk is to get out of
small talk as quickly as possible
what i've discovered is that there's
something of a game to small talk and
that you can get good at playing this
game i learned this in the course of my
work as a therapist which is a job in
which i basically get paid to talk to
people
there are conversational tactics that
you can practice and master that make it
easier to open a conversational partner
one strategy is to approach small talk
like it's a game

[01:00]
like it's a game
and a great metaphor for just such a
game is the popular word game wordle
where you have to guess a five letter
word in six tribes and after each
attempt the game gives you some feedback
like this is the right letter in the
right position or this is the right
letter in the wrong position and you use
this feedback
basically as a pathway toward guessing
the actual word now
what does this have to do with small
talk
well when you play wordle you assume
that the word actually exists like there
really is a valid five letter word that
you're trying to guess but that you just
don't know it yet
by the same token when you're talking to
somebody else
you can assume that there actually is an
authentic shared interest the two of you
have in common but you just don't know
what it is yet
assuming the shared interest is there
will help motivate you to search for it
which will obviously help you to
discover it
so assume that you and your conversation
partner have an authentic shared
interest and that this authentic shared
interest is discoverable

[02:00]
interest is discoverable
in six attempts
just like in wordle where we get six
chances to guess the word you should
with practice be able to hit upon that
authentic shared interest in six
exchanges
and the best way to do that is to be a
generous communicator
what does that mean
being a generous communicator means
giving your conversation partner several
opportunities to progress the
conversation in each exchange so for
instance if someone were to ask me where
are you from
i could answer matter-of-factly
las vegas
but that's just a factual piece of
information i'm kind of forcing my
partner to do a lot of the work this is
already starting to feel like an
interview
on the other hand if i were to be a more
generous communicator i could respond
you know i was actually born and raised
in las vegas a few miles from the strip
which was made for a pretty interesting
childhood but i've spent time in seattle
new york i now live in the bay area
though who knows for how much longer how
about you

[03:00]
about you
in this response i've given my
conversation partner so many pathways
forward i mentioned four different
places
signaled i was open to discussing my
childhood experiences and left an open
question with respect to my future plans
and if none of that was interesting they
could ignore it and just talk about
themselves what about you
now this person has several
possibilities to move the conversation
forward and my partner is likely going
to pick the pathway that is closest to
something that he or she actually
resonates with which represents an
authentic interest
you may not get there on the first try
but like in wordle if you pay attention
to your partner's feedback you can feel
out whether you're moving closer to your
goal it's kind of like a game of hot and
cold
and if you model generosity in
communication this often invites the
other person to reciprocate at that
level of generosity
keep this up and within a few back and
forth you won't be making small talk
anymore you'll actually be talking about
something the two of you authentically
care about that's an interesting

[04:00]
care about that's an interesting
conversation and the crazy thing is with
practice you can reliably get there in
less than a minute
and then maybe you won't dread small
talk so much
assume there is an authentic shared
interest that you can discover be a
generous communicator and practice
practice practice
