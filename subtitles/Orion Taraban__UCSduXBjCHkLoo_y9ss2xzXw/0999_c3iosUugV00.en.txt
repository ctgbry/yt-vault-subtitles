The idea is that adults who spend a
certain amount of time together under
family-like conditions tend to
experience diminished sexual attraction
or even sexual aversion to each other.
And this is certainly what occurs in the
modern marriage archetype. Two people
largely isolated from their extended
families and communities who spend an
inordinate amount of time together. If
I'm correct, then this familiarity would
produce a kind of sexual decoexis in
which desire is removed from conscious
experience as a result of a vest
mark-like effect. And this might help to
explain why in most traditional
communities, men and women don't
actually spend a lot of time together.
The men spent their time with other men,
hunting and tool making, and the women
spent their time with other women
raising children and preparing food. A
group that intermixed too much would
likely experience a decrease in sexual
desire, which might prove detrimental to
the growth and/or sustainability of that

the growth and/or sustainability of that
community. And this kind of makes sense.
Attraction kind of depends on a lack of
familiarity, which is why people hide
behind screens of all kinds in the
courtship process. Women hide behind
makeup and mystique. Men hide behind
boldness and charm. Remove those screens
too soon and the attraction evaporates.
