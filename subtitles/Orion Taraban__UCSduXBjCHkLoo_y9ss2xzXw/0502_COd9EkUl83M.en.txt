I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the best
that life has to offer so I recently got
back from spending a month in Japan and
I was inspired by my time there to share
with you one of my favorite poems don't
worry it's very short in fact it's only
three lines long it's a translated Haiku
and it goes like this oh snail climb
Fuji but slowly
slowly I love this poem because there is
so much wisdom contained in those three
lines and I think a lot of this wisdom
ultimately pertains to the best that
life has to offer now if you don't see
that yet allow me to explain three very
important teachings contained within
this poem the payoff is the third
teaching so be sure you listen all the
way to the end first of all

[01:00]
way to the end first of all
it's important in life to
dream big when it comes to most people
their problem is not that they're
arrogantly overestimating what they're
capable of accomplishing it's true that
there are some people out there who have
an inflated sense of self-worth and
competence but even when it comes to
such people the ends to which they hope
to apply that inflated sense of
self-worth are so petty and pathetic
that they are unlikely to produce a
great deal of fulfillment to say nothing
of happiness for themselves or others
though as I talk about in my episode why
I talk about sex and money they may have
to attain those things first in order to
facilitate Their Own
disillusionment no what I love about
this poem is that we're addressing a
snail oh snail right now the idea of a
snail climbing Mount Fuji is ludicrous
on the surface Mount Fuji so big little

[02:01]
on the surface Mount Fuji so big little
snail so small right but that's better
than the alternative it's better for a
snail to aim at climbing Mount Fuji than
it is for a snail to content itself with
immediately achievable goals it's
important in life to dream big because
spoiler alert that's actually what life
is for life is for the attainment of our
dreams so why not climb Mount Fuji live
and epic life okay now the second piece
of wisdom pertains to how the snail is
going to go about his task oh snail
climb Mount Fuji but
slowly of course the snail is g to climb
Mount Fuji slowly it's a snail so the
second piece of wisdom contained in this
poem is that you have to do things in
the way that you can do them the poem
doesn't say oh snail soar to the top of

[03:00]
doesn't say oh snail soar to the top of
Mount Fuji or swim to the top of Mount
Fuji or leap to the top of Mount Fuji it
says to climb slowly because of whom
it's addressing a snail so the first two
things are kind of in jux opposition to
each other the idea is to dream big to
Aspire beyond your capacities but to
achieve that dream within your
capacities both things are actually
possible the goal is beyond you but the
means are within you
okay the poem is an acknowledging that
the only way for a snail to climb Mount
Fuji is slowly by analogy the only way
that you can achieve your dreams is in a
manner amenable to your nature you can
only achieve your dreams in the way that
you can achieve them you're not going to
do it the way that I'm going to do it or
your parents did it or your girlfriend
wants you to do it or your Society tells
you you should do it okay you're going

[04:00]
you you should do it okay you're going
to do it in the way that you can do it
do you understand the idea here is to
become very very clear with respect to
your nature your preferences your
abilities your capacities what really
works for you what you really want and
to align your means with that nature
because this is going to greatly
increase the likelihood that you succeed
that you actually get somewhere now

[05:00]
you
now the third piece of wisdom is
actually the most important and it has
to do with the final word of the poem Oh
snail climb Mount Fuji but
slowly now the first slowly has to do
with the fact that we're addressing a
snail like of course it's going to climb
slowly but the second slowly seems kind
of redundant doesn't it poetically the
repetition is an intensifier in the
sense that slowly slowly me something
like very slowly but I think it's unfair
to the poem If we stop our
interpretation there now what you have
to understand here is that the poem like
many Haiku is actually an allegory in a
literal sense Mount Fuji is the highest
point in Japan but in an allegorical
sense it represents the highest goal to
which a little snail which dwarfed by
the immensity of nature represents you

[06:00]
the immensity of nature represents you
or me could possibly
Aspire that's what the poem is exhorting
us to do to aim for the highest goal we
can possibly
conceive and to achieve that goal in a
means aligned with our true
natures and if we do all that then
really what's the point in hurrying
think about it there's no higher point
in all of Japan so so if you actually
get to the top of Mount Fuji then all
that's left for you to do is to come
down there is no higher goal so the idea
here is to orient ourselves toward the
highest goal we could possibly conceive
and to spend as long as possible in the
attainment of that goal and with this in
mind the best possible goal is an
infinite goal one that can't ever really

[07:00]
infinite goal one that can't ever really
be attained but that gives us the
pretext to eternally climb towards it
because this my friends is where
happiness and fulfillment lie not in the
gaining not in the achieving but in the
climbing if you ever actually achieve a
goal then either the whole journey ends
or you have to suffer the decline that
inevitably follows remember the worst
part of a road trip is a
so the idea is not only to climb Mount
Fuji slowly because us little snails how
else are we really going to do it but to
do so slowly
slowly if we're doing it right it's
gonna take us a
long time to get where we're going but
it's really the only show in town so why

[08:00]
it's really the only show in town so why
are you in the hurry to get to the
credits and this process of moving in
the direction of our highest conceivable
goal just might be the best that life
has to offer there is by definition
nothing higher such that if we actually
attain this goal it's either the end of
all life or the beginning of a decline
so the best that life has to offer is
something like endlessly striving toward
an infinitely receding goal of the
highest virtue and
magnitude not bad for a three-line poem
huh we are happiest when we're climbing
so if you're in a rut if you're not
feeling very good then maybe you either
need to start gaining some elevation or
to seek out a higher mountain to climb
look around you what's the highest
mountain you can see that's your goal
and once you found your goal you'll
discover who you are as you climb it and
this knowledge will inform how you climb

[09:00]
this knowledge will inform how you climb
it's reciprocal there's no hurry because
there might not be anything better life
has to offer once you're done what do
