[00:02]
hi everybody hopefully you can hear me
all right I am happy to be here today as
you no doubt can see I am calling from a
different location today I am not in my
home where I usually record my episodes
and live streams I am traveling but I
brought some of my equipment with me
because I thought I might want to do
something on the road and so here we are
um hopefully my Jerry rigged setup is
going to work I notice that things are
shaking so I'm going to try not to touch
anything okay so thank you all for
joining me I'm really excited to be here
and to respond to some of your questions
that is the point of today's live stream
so we'll give it a few minutes for some
of the others to start to join us
hopefully that will happen
soon um some housekeeping stuff so I am

[01:02]
soon um some housekeeping stuff so I am
really excited to
announce that my member Community has
now been
launched uh it's called the Captain's
Quarters we'll talk about that more
later in the episode today but I am very
excited by the turnout so far and by
some of the things that we have lined up
already this theme has got me interested
in discussing purpose and fulfillment
and Mission
self-development because the member
Community isn't exclusively about
relationships there's a lot of questions
about relationships that are happening
in the bulletin boards and I assume in
the consultations as well we'll have our
first one next week um but it's not
exclusively about that because I want to
speak to the whole person and obviously
relationships are very important for us
but they're not the whole story

[02:00]
but they're not the whole story
so this is a place to come together to
ask questions and to grow into to
network about business and success and
health and general happiness because
that's really what I want to Foster is a
place where people can continue to grow
and become their the best versions of
themselves so that's when I was inspired
to launch this live stream today to talk
about questions on that topic if you
have any um usually I respond to the
super chats because there's already a
lot of
um comments in the chat and it would be
very boring if I just read through all
of them like that um so I will
prioritize the super chat questions and
I hope we get through as many as we can
in the time that we have
together
so what's going on what can I do for you
guys

[03:03]
I don't see anything so far
so oh yeah some of you have figured out
where I am uh I'm in Japan I'm in Tokyo
which is one of my favorite places in
the world and so I have been um doing a
lot here it's been a unusual trip it's
not what I was expecting but it has been
a good trip so far
um among other
things I came here to begin writing
another book which I sat down to do for
the first week or so that I was here I
have a pretty good idea for what I'd
like this book to be but when I sat down
to actually write it it wasn't really
coming out the way that I wanted it to I
enjoyed the content but it was coming
out a little too complex a little too
intellectual which I didn't think would
fly for the project that I had in mind

[04:02]
fly for the project that I had in mind
so I struggled with that for a while and
then I decided that maybe the content
wasn't fully incubated yet I found that
when I fully understand something it
tends to just sort of come out of me in
a more simplified form and the fact that
this was kind of a struggle and was
still fairly complex to me suggested
that it wasn't quite ready
for um putting out into the world so
I've t that idea for now I have a few
other ideas for projects that I'd like
to be working on but then I switched my
attention to building Community which is
something
that um I'm very excited
about
okay all
right I still no super chats oh here we
go we got one let we have
here oh somebody just uh wanted to send
me a little bit of cash I guess $4.99
hovo 50 thank you very much if you have

[05:01]
hovo 50 thank you very much if you have
a question that would help to move this
live stream forward I'm here for you
guys okay here we go Voodoo 2130 thank
you for kicking it off good day Orion
thanks for another Q&A my question is
how do you cultivate emotional intimacy
with a woman in the early stage of
dating h
okay so I assume by the fact that you're
talking about early stage of dating that
you haven't yet slept together so we're
talking about emotional intimacy as
opposed to physical intimacy with women
in general emotional intimacy tends to
proceed the physical intimacy it's one
of the keys that can unlock the physical
dimension of a
relationship emotional intimacy is not
that difficult to do though if another
person doesn't want to join you in it
there's not much that you you can do to

[06:00]
there's not much that you you can do to
entice them into it it's sort of like
you can lead a horse to water but you
can't make a drink kind of a thing the
best way that I found of inducing
emotional intimacy is to be emotionally
vulnerable yourself and to see what the
other person does with that now
vulnerability is something that gets a
bad wrap I don't love the word myself
because it's wrapped up in these
associations of weakness vulnera means
wound in Latin so it it feels like a
weakness a wounding and it doesn't have
to be that what I would say that the
best form of vulnerability for a date is
what I would call self-involving
self-disclosure which is where you just
make it
known that kind of how you're feeling
and you take risks to share your
emotional state with your date and this
will also prompt her to potentially
match your level of intimacy it's like a

[07:00]
match your level of intimacy it's like a
dance you don't want to just dump your
purse out in the table and start sharing
all of your childhood traumas with
somebody you just met that's a bad idea
that's like going from zero to 6,000
right so you want to do it gradually
step by step and you do that by
revealing a little bit about yourself
you can do this just by talking about
your day there's a way that you can make
pretty much
anything um fod for emotional connection
for example a lot of guys would answer
the question what' you do today very
factually be like okay I woke up I went
to work I came home I went to the gym I
read a book it's just like a list of
activities and the issue is that doesn't
really tell me much about the person
who's going through those activities
like do you love your work was there
something surprising that happened how
are you feeling after the gym do you
have specific goals in mind so it's like

[08:00]
have specific goals in mind so it's like
you can take that question and begin to
put a little bit more uh transparency
and openness
into your response and that will likely
stimulate that kind of emotional
disclosure in the the date right so an
example of that could be like oh you
know I woke up today it's one of those
days I just wish I could have just
pulled the covers back up and stayed in
bed you know what I mean uh but when I
got out of bed uh I saw that the Sun was
shining and I was like oh [ __ ] this is
actually beautiful um went to work it's
been a little stressful at work today
but you know I'm really happy with the
progress that I've been making on this
project um I it's one of the first ones
I've been psyched about in a long time
um I went to the gym it was kind of hard
to go to gym but you know I forced
myself to go because that's really
important to me you see this is I'm
you're sharing a lot which is also being
a generous Communicator right uh which
is something that I talk about on the
channel and which gives your
conversation partner a lot to work with
and you're ALS Al like training this

[09:00]
and you're ALS Al like training this
person to say this is kind of what I
expect I want this conversation to be
about the person inside of the facts
right otherwise it just becomes an
interview where are you from what do you
do how many siblings do you have that's
really boring and you could just fill
that out on a survey at home and if like
dating really had to do with the answers
to those questions those factual
questions you wouldn't even have to meet
the person at all you know it could just
be some checklist and a picture right
and we know that doesn't really work
people don't like that so hopefully that
answers your
question okay all right got
some new questions coming in let's do
this
okay Edward scfi thank you for your
support have you studied General
semantics H I don't know if General
semantics is a specific term actually
I've studied some
semantics
um but not in a formal way I'm I'm
interested in lots of different things

[10:00]
interested in lots of different things
so kind of a yes no question I think
semantics are important I don't think
I've ever ever done any kind of specific
course study in
that
okay Barrett Melton thank you for your
support you claim women trade sex for
relationships however women enjoy sex
too never said they didn't doesn't that
balance the scales such that women
sacrifice almost nothing compared to men
Finance support for intimacy
doesn't that balance the scales such
that women
sacrifice almost
nothing compared to men for
intimacy well it depends on how you look
at it okay so women definitely enjoy sex
too there's this really great story
from Greek
mythology where there was this Prophet
called I think he was tyresius who once
angered Hera Zeus's wife by helping him

[11:02]
angered Hera Zeus's wife by helping him
hide one of his Affairs and I believe
she turned him into a woman so this
person lived for a time as a man and as
a time as a woman and this was I think
the only human at that time who has had
that kind of experience sometime later
the gods got into some argument about
who enjoyed sex more was it men or was
it women and they figured that no one
could really answer that question
because they didn't really have the
experience except for this person
tyresius right so they called tyresius
to settle the matter and Tyresa says
that the woman enjoys the sex nine times
as much as the man does like the woman
gets nine times as much pleasure as the
man does and uh this pissed off Hera who
I think punished him again in some kind
of a way so um absolutely women do enjoy
sex they get a lot of pleasure out of it
when it's done well um but that's

[12:02]
when it's done well um but that's
something that I think women kind of
want to keep on the DL for some reason
now that it could be a social shaming
thing and they're trying to protect
their
respectability um it could also be a
strategy in the game of please no even
if it's an unconscious one namely if I
if you know how much I really want
something that's going to increase the
amount I'm probably going to have to pay
for it that's why when go into a car
dealership you're like you don't walk in
and go like oh my God this is the best
car I've ever seen holy [ __ ] I love the
color I love the sheen I love the wheels
you're like yeah you know it's okay it's
okay car I could take it I could leave
it um and that gives you a more
advantageous bargaining posture right so
there could be many different reasons
why there's this
General unwillingness to talk about how
much women enjoy
sex um does that balance the scales that
women sacrifice almost nothing compared

[13:00]
women sacrifice almost nothing compared
to men for intimacy well it depends on
who they're having sex with my dude so
um there's plenty of women who have one
night stands like men have one night
stands because there are women who have
one night stands with them now some of
those interactions the women don't know
are going to be a one night stand or
vice versa I mean women Stand Up Guys
after sleeping with them as well
especially in today's day and age so but
sometimes it is
uh when a woman interacts with a guy
primarily from the point of view of
having a pleasurable sexual
experience then it does kind of balance
the scales the guy's like hey I think
you're cute she's like hey I think
you're cute let's do
this and the guy doesn't really lose
anything not much except for like the
time and the opportunity and vice versa
so that that's pretty
balanced however what we're talking
about potentially that makes it more

[14:00]
about potentially that makes it more
imbalanced is
when men begin to take on the provider
role because they believe it will help
them secure guaranteed sex I I've been
guilty of this before I I lived with a
girlfriend a long time ago and I thought
to myself wait a minute are are you
saying that I could move in with my
girlfriend and and she'll help pay some
rent I I'll pay less rent and I'll get
to sleep with my roommate every night I
mean like this is the best deal in the
history of deals dude and it turns out
uh it doesn't really work that way for a
number of reasons so the the issue is
that some guys begin to take on more and
more uh provide
provision because they are so focused on
the sexual dimension of the relationship
whereas the woman now when she sees how
much that is valued can now kind

[15:01]
much that is valued can now kind
of consciously or not take advantage of
the situation
so I think that's what we're talking
about when it comes to the
support um I'm sorry that's what it
comes to with the balance of the scales
is sometimes it's balanced when both
parties going in specifically and
intentionally to enjoy a sexual
experience but sometimes it's imbalanced
where the people are using proxies
indirect means to access the sexual
experience and and generally that's
where men end up paying a lot more for
sex hopefully that answers your question
Bohemian granny 500 yen awesome I'll go
get a one cup later thank you very
much okay Edward corfield okay he's back
um General semantics was developed by a
man named
Alfred corsky he is one of the most
avoided figures in the 20th century uh
avoided for good reason or he's like he

[16:02]
avoided for good reason or he's like he
doesn't have the fame and attention that
he deserves unclear the expression based
comes to mind when getting into General
semantics okay cool well I i' never
heard of the guy so maybe that's what
you mean he's not well known um I'll
take a look when I have some time thanks
for bringing my attention
Edward okay Carl dine thank you for your
donation what are your thoughts on short
men in the dating game smv and by short
I mean 55 and shorter it's tough
man uh it's tough
like height is a is a real thing Less in
less in real life than on the dating
apps a lot of guys will set all kinds of
filters um with respect to
their matches on these swipy things and
women do the same thing and I think more
than anything there's age that guys come
up against so age guys can definitely

[17:02]
up against so age guys can definitely
age out of dating apps um but there's
also the height thing that they can come
up against and you don't want to lie
about that because that's going to put
yourself out on the wrong foot if when
you do eventually meet each other um
it's unlikely it's going to lead
anywhere so
um this is problematic for women as well
because there's a lot of things that
women will tend to disqualify men for
right off the
bat and these are some the same things
that often they have in their some of
their friends have or some of their
family members have people that they
care about and they love they don't mind
these things in them because the care
and the love came first and then they
found out some of these other things or
they're more willing to pass over or
give generous interpretations to these
things however when it comes to a
complete stranger I found that women can

[18:01]
complete stranger I found that women can
be
very um
prematurely uh you know yeah next kind
of a thing I saw a comment in the thread
before we really got started about
politics on this level not that's the
same kind of
issue is I guarantee that every woman
out there knows
somebody that they love and care about
who is a trump
supporter they they might not know that
that person is a trump supporter for
example but I guarantee that every
person knows and loves and cares about
somebody who
is
so the issue so the question when they
come out of the gate and say no no Trump
supporters no Republicans no people on
the
right I mean if they were to apply that
consistently to everybody in their life
that would lose some of their valued
relationships and if it were really that
important they would put that Criterion

[19:00]
important they would put that Criterion
ahead of their own family or their
friends some people unfortunately do
from time to time but most people aren't
that nutty so I think that what we have
to understand is that the caring
generally needs to come first and then
some of the disclosure on more sensitive
subjects can occur further down the road
that's why I would recommend strongly to
steer clear of discussions of politics
or religion or really anything all that
cont ious on the first several dates I
mean this is just about like can we have
fun do we have chemistry do we like each
other that those kinds of things you
want to talk about with respect to
somebody that you want to like have kids
with because those concerns only become
real with respect to raising children
like for example if you're a Christian
and your partner is Muslim okay
how do you raise your kids do you take

[20:00]
how do you raise your kids do you take
them to church you take them to mosque
you take them to both you take them to
neither it's like some things you can't
really compromise on but there's no need
to compromise when it's just two
consenting adults in a relationship I
can be Christian you can be Muslim I
don't have to make you Christian you
don't have to make me Muslim but with
the kid like we have to make a decision
about how we're going to raise this
child right so these really serious
questions they really only become
relevant and Salient when it has to do
with raising kids otherwise you just can
respect people's differences which is
part of the fun thing about getting in
relationships is meeting people who are
a little bit different from you right
sorry I got a little away
from the hype thing so what what I'm
getting at here uh Carl is that
it short guys probably aren't going to
find a lot of luck on the apps they have
to get out there in person and they got
to um
build that kind of Attraction and
intimacy and connection with women and

[21:01]
intimacy and connection with women and
once that's established then these
things that might be automatic deal
breakers to total strangers you might
then become the
exception right because the feeling and
the caring has now come before the
Criterion which is I guess how it should
be right at least how it was in many
cases before online dating came into
being uh I think it's also a good idea
to make yourself as attractive as
possible in the ways that you can
control which have to do with your
physique and your
fashion and if you
are you know jacked or at least slim and
taken care of yourself and you have some
fashion sense and maybe you're you're
witty or you're intelligent or you're
funny I mean like you might have to put
in a little bit more effort to get the
same result comparable to the 63 guy you

[22:00]
same result comparable to the 63 guy you
know what I'm saying is that fair I
don't know but it's the way it is okay
so short guys aren't out of the running
but they do they definitely have a
little bit of a a handicap but those
handicaps can be
overcome good
question
okay uh
ehi hope I got that right thank you for
donation just wondering as a guy how can
I tell if my my standards are too high
looks wise still single at 41 it's got
to be me had a few interest in dating me
but they are never the ones I'm
attracted to Tia I don't know what that
means
um
well I mean that's often the case that
the ones that you're not as attracted to
are the ones that are interested in
dating you that's true for a number of
reasons first of all um women who are

[23:02]
reasons first of all um women who are
less physically attractive they do tend
to initiate
more like that's starting to shift when
I would go out in San Francisco I got
hit on by women sometimes but it was
never the most attractive women in the
bar because no one was hitting on those
women so those women have kind of
figured out that if they want to make
something happen they can't just sit on
the bar stool and wait for the world to
come to them which is true and you got
to kind like reward the effort a bit and
appreciate that they're they're going
out there and and kind of bucking the
trend to try to make something happen
for themselves that's great love it but
it's not the most beautiful flower a
beautiful flower gets to stay rooted in
one place and everything comes to her
right that's the whole That's The Power
of
beauty um it could also be the case that
when you are less attracted to a woman
you're far more confident you're you're
more likely to be your authentic autic
self you'll share things because you

[24:00]
self you'll share things because you
won't care what the other person thinks
about you or whether or not it's
attractive or whether or not it's going
to get you laid and that often leads to
you being more authentic confident and
you bring the other person into your
confidence more and those women often
will fall in love over time um so that
could also be part of the case I talk
about that in the episode men do the
right things with the wrong women
um are your standards too high looks
wise well that depends are you not
attracted to any women whatsoever are
you like walking down the streets and
like there's nothing here or are you
actually attracted to women that you
encounter and you're just not dating
them or they're not interested in dating
you I think
those I'm not sure about that um most
likely there are women out in the world
that you think are attractive but
they're not the ones that you you
have access to I suppose that could be

[25:03]
have access to I suppose that could be
an issue of where you're located that
could be an issue of putting yourself
out there more
um if you're just not interested in
women I mean that's
okay could make life very peaceful in
any respects um if you want to have
family or you want to have a
relationship obviously that's going to
make things more
problematic um I've noticed that as I've
aged that has started to shift like when
I was a young man my God all I really
cared about was how physically
attractive the woman was and that has
definitely shifted as I've aged and
that's actually been really Pleasant and
has been very helpful to having better
uh relationships with the women in my
life which is um which has been great
hopefully that answers your question
Astro Pa thank you for your donation

[26:01]
Astro Pa thank you for your donation
what do you think of women who are
friends with their past lovers or exes
and giving an ultimatum to end it oh
okay so this is a good
question all right so in general I don't
think it's a good idea to be giving
ultimatums ultimatums are forms of uh
it's their power play and even if they
work it tends to create a lingering
resentment in the person if you continue
to relationship so even if they work
that is in this case if the woman in
question to keep you from leaving stops
talking to or seeing their their exes
she's probably going to feel not so
great about that and you're going to
feel that in your relationship so it's a
puic
victory in general I think that love
demands Acceptance in many respects and
if you don't have to like everything
that your partner does
but you kind of want to accept them for

[27:01]
but you kind of want to accept them for
who they are because you would like to
hope that they're going to do the same
for
you and everyone's also entitled to
their deal breakers there are some
things that for whatever reason you are
do not want to or you are not willing or
you are unable to accept that's okay but
in that case it's like find somebody
that you can accept and move on that's
my general perspective on the matter um
and I also think with respect to the
first question that it
depends um I think
that this is really a caseby case
basis what is the nature of the
communication is it still flirty is it
still sexual how long ago was this x
when they speak about them uh what's the
like the tber in their voice and their
tone do you get the sense that they're
still emotionally attached to this

[28:01]
still emotionally attached to this
person
um
or and in particular is this person also
in a relationship with somebody
else um not always a practical defense
against um mate poaching but it often is
one um or is this person kind of single
and orbiting and waiting in the wings
for you to [ __ ] up
in any case um what I would potentially
do if you're uncomfortable with what
your partner is doing is instead of
giving an ultimatum share that with her
and be like hey you know um you're going
to do what you're going to do you're an
adult I just want you to know that when
you talk to this guy or when you go out
with this guy makes me feel really
uncomfortable and I don't really like it
um now a woman who is
very attracted to you and sees your

[29:01]
very attracted to you and sees your
relationship as a high priority will by
her own valtion want to change your
behavior because a woman who loves a man
and who makes him her highest priority
with respect to relationships isn't
going to want that person to be unhappy
and
uncomfortable and upset so she's likely
going to change the behavior if on the
other hand you say that hey you know it
makes me really uncomfortable I don't
like it when you do this and she says
well that's that's kind of your problem
um I'm going to do what I'm going to
do I
mean there's a that's yeah she is an
adult she's going to do what she's going
to do and you can do what you're going
to do right so that's part of like the
acceptance so can you accept this about
this person she's clearly in this case
second case she's not going to change is
this something that is a deal breaker
for you if it is rather than try to
change the person exit the

[30:01]
change the person exit the
relationship okay that's my practical
advice okay what's up next Joo clot hope
I'm saying that right thank you for your
donation I'm 26 making six figures in a
third world country wow that sounds
tough 5'8 and in shape but I have a baby
son okay will having a Sun affect my
deing life negatively and if so
significantly or not new world for me
Tia what does tia mean someone's got to
tell me
um I mean it depends what I found I I
don't have a kid so I can't speak from
my own personal experience but from my
friends and from the people that I've
consulted I found that being a single
father is far less detrimental to dating
than being a single
mother a lot of guys will just
completely swerve on Single Moms the
attitude is sort of like uh you know I
want to I can't be the priority in your

[31:01]
want to I can't be the priority in your
life because you have a kid and
potentially something must have happened
for some man who made a baby with you
and potentially married you in front of
God and all of his friends and family
decided that I can't do this anymore so
that's kind of a red flag for a lot of
guys right
with uh with women it's less so because
what I found is that a lot of women see
a single dad and they think think oh
he's open to kids maybe he'll have more
of them with me it's like one of the the
struggles that a lot of modern women
face is getting a guy to settle down and
start a family you already have done
that so there's like proof of concept
here with
you she might be jealous of that child
at times or with your baby mama if she's
still in the picture and she might want
to make another baby with you to kind of
balance the scales as it were and to

[32:00]
balance the scales as it were and to
solidify her place in your life but I
don't think it's necessarily a problem
it just might make things more
logistically complicated depending on
you know the child care support that you
have but I don't think having a kid is
necessarily a deal breaker for a lot of
women
okay e aano hope I'm saying that right
thank you for your donation I'm losing
attraction to my boyfriend because my
needs aren't being met
security I know he's still building his
ship aspiring actor but I want to plan
for the future how do I know when to cut
my losses
H
well first of all I'd like to suggest
respectfully that that's probably not
why you're losing attraction for your
boyfriend why do I say that because you
probably had even less security when you

[33:02]
probably had even less security when you
first started dating and you probably
had much higher attraction for this guy
then than you do now otherwise it
wouldn't be lower now right security is
something that generally increases over
the duration of a relationship in fact
um right so the fact that you're not
getting something that you haven't
gotten shouldn't really impact your
attraction
because you didn't have it in the early
phases when you were attracted to him
hopefully that makes sense so there
could be other reasons why you're losing
attraction and I think that's likely
it's not mentioned here but likely
having to do with a cost benefit
comparison analysis that's either going
on consciously or
unconsciously maybe you've come into
contact with some guys that you think
might be
um more successful and potentially can

[34:01]
um more successful and potentially can
give you what you want on a shorter time
frame right so it's hard to know when to
cut your losses and to leave um the fact
of the matter is is that most
relationships won't be the one that you
have for the rest of your life that
that's just what it is For Better or For
Worse um a relationship that ends is not
necessarily a bad relationship or or a
failed relationship I think that we can
all do better at changing our general
attitude towards that um because if we
don't we we rob ourselves of a lot of
our life because we spend a lot of our
lives in relationships that don't last
for the rest of our lives and we can be
grateful for the time that we've spent
with this other person
potentially
um so I he's still building a ship
aspiring actor I I don't know like
security generally doesn't make people

[35:00]
security generally doesn't make people
more attracted right it's like you don't
go into a club and offer
security um so I don't I don't know why
you're losing attraction it could be
that
um some of well one of the things I talk
about on in the in the book or in the
channel I forget which one is that some
of the things that we are initially
attracted to once the limerance wears
off are the same things that annoy the
ship out of us so for example if he's an
aspiring actor maybe he was
um you know very like fun and carefree
and spontaneous he didn't have a lot of
responsibilities so he you know he's
aspiring actor so he had go to a lot of
parties he was
socializing
um but you know after some time maybe
that like spontaneity and fun might Now
read as irresponsible and immature and
now you're questioning whether you can

[36:00]
now you're questioning whether you can
build a foundation with somebody who
looks
different but the issue is that oh yeah
I talked about this in the lens of
Attraction which just came out a little
bit ago the issue is it's the same guy
it's the same behavior the the fun and
spontaneous guy is the irresponsible
immature guy it's the same guy it's the
same behavior what's changed
is the level of attraction the same
behavior gets interpreted in a more
negative way as the raction dips but
it's not that he's doing something
different it's the same behavior right
so other things must be lowering your
attraction um and I think it has to do
probably
with this feeling that you could do
better and that could be because there
are some other guys who have entered
into the picture or you talked to your
girlfriends or you heard something on
the media and now you're kind of looking
at your options in a different way and
you no longer feel like this guy is your
best option
okay that's what I got for

[37:05]
you okay Elliot Wade thank you for your
donation I like how sensitive you are
towards everyone I try I fail a lot but
I try um I
don't I don't want to make the
world a more antagonistic and angry and
awful place and uh I also think that
it's okay that we don't always agree
with each other I can tolerate that so
uh I do like to try to have respect for
the human being and to take their
concern
seriously and to speak on the highest
level that I can to people um I find
that to be where I
feel like I could become the best
version of myself thank you
okay oh thanks in advance okay Joo

[38:03]
okay oh thanks in advance okay Joo
awesome dude now I know I'm learning the
lingo I'm a streamer now okay Jake
Woodruff cop 50 Grand I have no idea
where cop is though uh thank for your
donation in any case I'm 31 and making
six figures Fantastic look look at these
young guys who are just killing it
you're doing so much better than I was
at that stage of life I like the idea of
kids eventually but I'm afraid of
marriage and the commitment to one woman
for the rest of my life at this time
yeah I still have big goals that require
a lot of my time and
energy then don't get married you know
and there's something about what you
just said that um makes me think of
something I was on a trip to Morocco
recently
and
I I went on a tour and the local tour
tour guide was explaining a little bit

[39:01]
tour guide was explaining a little bit
about the Islamic culture of polygamy
and he told me that in the Quran the
prophet Muhammad calls monogamy that is
marriage to one woman a marriage of
fear and that he recommends that it's
good for a man to have two three or four
wives now there's responsibilities in
that culture and religion that come with
having multiple wives um but the idea
here is that marriage to one woman is a
marriage of fear and that can be
interpreted in a few different ways but
I thought that was
interesting
um yeah so one of the things I talk
about in chapter 12 of the book is that
I think the future of relationships come
from let's say an intentional
deconstruction of the hyper conflated
model of marriage that's a lot of big
words so what does that mean so one of
the reasons why I think marriage is
failing is because we want it to be too
many things we want it to be um a

[40:01]
many things we want it to be um a
spiritual union with our soulmate and we
want it to be a a a fun adventure with a
sexy lover we want to be uh a co-parent
and a co- business partner running a
family and raising children we want to
be your best friend and your therapist
etc etc and that's just too many roles
for one person to
discharge so the fact of the matter is
is that marriage like the legal contract
is a different
thing than co-parenting having children
like you don't need to get married to
have kids you can a lot of people do a
lot of people don't which is different
from cohabitation which is you don't
have to live together even if you're
married you don't have to live together
who says who says you have to right like
a lot of these things are just sort of
like assumptions they're just like well
I just thought that this is what you do
when you get married not necessarily
it's for the two people involved in a
relationship to decide what their
relation ship is going to look like what
structure it's going to take and I'm I'm

[41:01]
structure it's going to take and I'm I'm
kind of just done with this one siiz
fits-all attitude towards relationships
because I see it fail all the time and I
think it's time that we question the the
structure as opposed to our own failings
which is generally what happens usually
when when a marriage doesn't work out
it's
because you know some we we blame the
people inside of it as opposed to the
weight of what they were trying to carry
maybe what they were in was too much
potentially sometimes it's the
people um so what I'm saying is that you
you can begin to decouple some of these
things in your mind it's like you don't
have to live with a woman if you don't
want to you don't have to have children
with a woman if you don't want to you
don't have to marry women if you don't
want or you can like mix and match these
things obviously not all women are going
to be interested in that um women in
general just like guys are trying to get
the best possible version of what uh to
get more of what they most want
and if you offer parenting co-parenting

[42:02]
and if you offer parenting co-parenting
but another guy will offer co-parenting
cohabitation and marriage you're going
to have to be significantly more
attractive and maintain that attraction
at a high level to compensate for
getting Less on some level right because
she's going to feel that she's going to
see that and along other people get
these things and I don't get these
things and it's going to make her feel
envious so that will have to be
compensated another way so it's not
impossible but it needs to be
um compensated yeah needs to be
compensated in other ways generally by
being very attractive and um emotionally
involved and maintaining that level of
involvement in attraction but if you're
not ready to get married don't [ __ ]
get married like there's there's plenty
of time 31 I me say in the book I don't
think that guys should even begin to
consider a serious commitment until
they're 35 because it can take that long
to get established I mean it sounds like
you're doing good 316 figures okay but

[43:00]
you're doing good 316 figures okay but
there's still a lot of things you want
to do yeah as far as I can tell kids
take a lot of time they take a lot of
energy even if you're having this sort
of like decontextualized relationship
like I just described um I don't think
you want to be an absentee father right
so if you have other things that you
want to do then [ __ ] do those things
and uh it's going to be fine the more
you do as long as you don't [ __ ]
anything up as a a guy you're likely
with each passing year to to grow your
wealth to grow your prestige to grow
your achievement to get better at
relationships to get better at seduction
to get better at everything you'll have
more practice
so like you should just become a more
attractive option as you age now of
course men can age out of this just like
women can but we have a
longer timeline for Better or For Worse
so don't get married if you don't want
to get
married um
okay Brandis thank you for your donation

[44:01]
okay Brandis thank you for your donation
21 male I struggle with the idea of
relationships having an adored adorer
how can I feel emotionally fulfilled in
the prior
role as a
romantic are you asking I assume that
what you're saying here is how can I
feel emotion fulfilled as the
adored especially if you're
romantic and I would say it's tough I I
don't think you can as much it's it's
more difficult to feel emotionally
fulfilled as the adored as I talk about
in the book The adored only gets to be
loved by the one that they're with while
the adorer gets to be with the one they
love which is much more emotionally
fulfilling it's the more romantic
posture too so if you're a romantic you
might be more comfortable in the Ador
role also like I argue in the book most
people do want to be the adorers most
people want that emotional fulfillment
they feel like it's one of the most

[45:00]
they feel like it's one of the most
meaningful and
precious experiences they could possibly
have in their
lives um to be with the one that they
love
right that is the more romantic posture
it also involves putting somebody else a
bit on a pedestal to adore them which is
also somewhat of a romantic idea because
uh you know all of our gods have Clay
feet as it were so if you want emotion
fulfillment as a romantic you probably
want to be the endurer the issue is that
you're a man and that's in my experience
both as a Young Man personally and in
the thousands of sessions and
consultations that I've given to men
that's often a
liability especially as a young guy
because women generally want to be the
ones to feel that way as much as you
like that emotional fulfillment women
like that fulfillment even
more in general right and if you're

[46:02]
more in general right and if you're
getting it you're kind of robbing her of
the opportunity to get it herself and
that's going to deprive her of a
significant um benefit that she went to
a relationship to AC
crew that's going to make it more
difficult for you um in general there's
also hypergamy where women generally
want older taller stronger more
successful guys which both literally and
figury mean that they want to look up to
their men and that's going to be tough
because when you're 21 if you're like me
you got Buck all and no one really can
look up to you unless you're happen to
be very tall right so um I've also found
that that tends to change as I aged when
I didn't have very much as a young man
it was almost inevitable that I would
look up to others who had more in many
respects and let me tell you
there's some beautiful young women out
there and so they're full of this beauty

[47:00]
there and so they're full of this beauty
and this
Radiance of course and if you're like
you're not successful you're not
established you're not grounded you're
not in your own you haven't really found
yourself yet how could you not be
looking up at that radiant Beauty right
so I think that's often the posture of
young men but what I've realized in my
own personal life is that as I've grown
and I found myself and I've built
something worthwhile and I've developed
status and wealth and I've I've learned
self discipline and all these other
things and I've now become a man of of
Great
Value it's much easier not to be looking
up at every pretty girl that crosses my
path you know what I'm saying so I think
that also might be something that you
age out of though I've met a lot of very
old doting romantic men so take that for
what it's
worth Philip a thank you for your
donation Dr or is there a way for
purpose to act as a plate in spinning

[48:00]
purpose to act as a plate in spinning
plates while dating I agree with all of
the positive psychology of spinning
plates but it feels like it's chasing
women at around women woman three to
four thanks
um okay let me I'm G to try my best with
this question because I don't fully
understand it looks like there's a few
questions too um so spinning plates
means that you're dating multiple women
simultaneously yeah it's generally a
good strategy uh at around three or four
it feels like chasing them in like does
that mean it it feels like it's more of
like a job it's more of an
effort after you get three or four women
to get even more than that I would
definitely agree like um three to four
women is plenty for most guys um those
women generally each are going to
require some share of time and attention
and
energy um not always money but generally
you need money um and if you're giving

[49:00]
you need money um and if you're giving
that to four different
women like how much time do you have
left over for yourself probably not a
lot right so you have to and I've I've
seen this is that guys some can
sometimes just get Fall Fallen into this
like Mania where I just have to keep
acquiring I just have to keep chasing I
just have to keep like spinning plates
like but to what end like on some level
the the psychological benefit to having
multiple options as a guy is it kind of
keeps you in a non hungry non desperate
state where no one woman is all that
powerful in your life which allows you
to kind of like make confident directive
decisions with respect to your life and
your
relationships whereas if you put all
your eggs in one basket it can be very
difficult to choose between all of your
emotional and sexual needs
and your own self-respect or your own

[50:00]
and your own self-respect or your own
dignity or your own higher purpose right
so it's easier to do that when you have
multiple
options that's in my opinion the biggest
Roi with respect to spinning
plates but there's like uh at a certain
point if you get four five six seven
eight nine I
mean I don't know if you're you're
getting more value for the expense
that you're putting in at that point
like that's just just how it is um is
there a way for purpose to act as a
plate in spinning day spinning plates um
I mean yeah yeah I mean there's going to
be because you can really only do one
thing at once this whole idea about
multitasking is really just means that
you're doing one thing at once switching
rapidly between multiple one things
right so there has to be a dedicated
time in your life where you actually are
taking action and making progress with
respect to your Higher Goals and your
purpose otherwise it's just an abstract

[51:00]
purpose otherwise it's just an abstract
ideal which means [ __ ] all like lots of
people have well meaning good sounding
ideas in their heads well I want I'm I'm
a fan of justice and courage and I want
to build but what are they doing about
it right it's very easy to like enshrine
some of these ideas in your heart or to
think that you're a better person than
you really are it's another thing to
actually put them into action because
the world is so imperfect and so [ __ ]
up in many respects that as soon as you
start to try to put an ideal out to the
world it's going to get smashed to
pieces like it's very difficult to build
anything
um Noble or idealistic in this world
because it just has to come into contact
with reality in so many different ways
and it generally doesn't survive that
contact um so you do have to find time
to pursue your purpose and if all your
time is spent with women unless your
purpose is women for some reason which I
don't think it should be in the sense

[52:01]
don't think it should be in the sense
that um I think
that a man's or even a woman's higher
purpose needs to be
Beyond
um any specific relationship and that
can also be a a guard rail against that
all your eggs and one basket phenomenon
that I was just discussing so you don't
necessarily ha every guy does not
necessarily have to have multiple women
but he needs to have
something that he is highly invested in
that is more important than her if he
doesn't have multiple women he needs
that and those are the really the only
two defenses that I can see against a
man losing power in his relationship
with a woman okay it's either it's
spread out over multiple options or
there's something even more important
that he's it's not just an abstract idea
it's not just a good thing that he
thinks about that he's actually
emotionally invested in and he's willing
to sacrifice the relationship if need be
in the service of that higher purpose

[53:00]
in the service of that higher purpose
those are the things that keep men
safe all right what we got here
historical
Duo thanks for your
donation I'm dating an avoidant woman
who has deep
Trauma from witnessing her father's
repeated infidelity with her mother and
later Partners she doesn't she didn't
like some promiscuous actions I
displayed and I'm afraid her trauma may
stop her from falling in love with me
any advice yeah very well
might
um it it says that you're just dating
which suggests that you are in the early
stages of
courtship I
would probably walk away from that
relationship which is why I say that you
should not be very emotionally invested
anybody that you date for the first six
to 12 months of that courtship process
because
like you're not going to learn about
something on the first date this is

[54:00]
something on the first date this is
something that you might don't come up
eight months into a relationship once
you know there's some semblance of okay
this is who we are we're doing this and
then you stepped into some Gray Zone
apparently that you thought was okay and
she thought wasn't and you elicited this
response and that response wouldn't have
come
out if you were just strangers on a
second date you know it needed to come
out in the context of this perceived
betrayal which required some sort of
commitment and um security I suppose for
that to occur so it's really important
guys to keep a tight rain on your
emotion for the first six to 12 months
of a relationship because you can see
things like this that will make it very
very difficult um I have an episode
that's coming out soon it's been
recorded it's scheduled it just hasn't
been released yet it's called there is
no need to understand
so as you'll recall I often talk about
dating as an extended hiring process and

[55:00]
dating as an extended hiring process and
that you the
man are in the position of the employer
because you the man are in the position
to offer the relationship you're going
to ask her out you're going to get down
on one knee you the woman's not going to
do it you're going to give just like the
the other person is going to the
employer is going to extend a position a
job offer it's person decide whether
they accept it or not but they can't
hire themselves right so
if you're in a job
interview and for whatever reason the
interview goes very poorly if the
candidate is aggressive or bumbling or
overly anxious or socially awkward or
what have you you don't have to
understand why this person is that the
way that they are that's like not your
job you're not This Woman's
therapist um it's your job to say you
know what I don't think this is a good

[56:00]
know what I don't think this is a good
fit and thank you for your time and
we're going to pursue other options kind
of a thing so it's like you you
certainly don't have to extend a job
offer to try to work through that
awkwardness or that aggression or what
have you with the candidate that you
just
encountered
um some people need to figure some stuff
out before they can be reasonable
partners for other people just
like and I'm saying this as a therapist
like not everyone is ready to date not
everyone is in a position to have a
relationship okay and you can't tell
who's who just from looking at people
that's what that's what mental health
and mental illness is all about you you
often can't tell sometimes you can but
generally you can't right
so but that doesn't mean that they're
like [ __ ] forever not necessarily it's
just like an injury you know you broke
your leg you're not going to be on
Varsity you can't play
you have to heal you got to heal your
leg no one's going to think that that's

[57:00]
leg no one's going to think that that's
weird to say but man sometimes I get
some Flack when I say you know this this
depressed person this overly anxious
person this traumatized person maybe
maybe this personality disorder maybe
they shouldn't be in a relationship oh
my God are you saying this like it's
like yeah they're they need to heal
playing on a broken leg is just gonna
hurt it even
more that that's stupid Don't Force It
wait heal take care of what you need to
take take care of and then in a few
months you can get back in the game so
um
trauma
like trauma is also a word that gets
overused a lot so I don't know um I
think that it's often being used as an
excuse for bad behavior the other part
of this equation is what is she doing
about it it's like I mean I heard this a
lot when I was dating when I was younger
is I'd go out with these women and you
know I'd hear oh you know my ex cheated

[58:01]
know I'd hear oh you know my ex cheated
on me so now I have trust issues and I
was like huh okay what the [ __ ] does
that have to do with me it's like well
I'm on a date with you now and I want
you to to know that so I want you which
is basically saying like I want you to
accept that about me and I'm saying well
why do you accept that about you like
what are you is is your trust issues a
problem for you what are you doing about
this like if it's not a problem for
you like that that's a problem for me on
some level it's
like if she has this trauma let's give
her the benefit of the doubt like what
if she doing to overcome it or is she
just sitting there and wanting to
control your behavior so that it doesn't
get
triggered like that's not a good
situation because there's there's more
and more behaviors going to be added to
that checklist that trigger her trauma
reaction right and if she's doing
nothing then her emotional well-being
is now being made your responsibility
which it's

[59:00]
which it's
not okay thanks for
listening okay DM Linn thank you for
your donation I appreciate
it um translucent
Doo thank you for your donation I'm 38
from India I keep wondering if I should
settle down with the options I have or
keep working on myself to get the
partner I want
I do want kids in life what's your
advice I don't know man I mean you just
gave me one sentence of context it's I I
don't know
like so speaking I can't advise you I
can't tell you whether you should settle
down or get married based on just what
you gave me but I can give you some some
general um orientation here which
is uh all relationships that you commit

[1:00:00]
is uh all relationships that you commit
to are some form of settling like you
you you can't avoid that settling is
inevitable especially on a planet with
eight and a half billion people a lot of
whom are in India right so it's like in
that sea of functionally Limitless
optionality there is somebody better for
you out
there like it's just the odds that you
are with the single best person for you
are vanishingly small the question then
becomes how much
better and on what timeline you don't
know you can meet this other person
tomorrow or most likely in a thousand
years you know who knows um so the
question now becomes uh you know I want
to have kids okay so now you have this
other thing that's coming into your
decision-making process well do you want
to have kids by the time you're 40 if

[1:01:02]
to have kids by the time you're 40 if
so if so I mean you you might want to
consider one of your options that you
currently have like the likelihood that
if you were to break up with those
options and meet
somebody better than the best of your
current options in the next
year who also liked you and wanted to
have a kid with you actually pretty
small
right like this is part of the reason
why birth rates are going down is
because people forget that you know yeah
there are better options out there but
are you a better option for them and do
they also want to do the same things
that you do on a comparable timeline
like those are actually really really
rare confluences which why I talk about
in the book that most people only get
like three or four good chances in their
lives
um so you kind of have to weigh that

[1:02:01]
um so you kind of have to weigh that
like how bad do you want kids in what
timeline and do you feel like any of the
options that you currently have let's
just focus on the best option that you
currently have do you think that the
best option is somebody that you can see
reproducing with like do you want your
genes to mix with that woman's jeans and
do you think that she would be a decent
mother to your children can you get
along a lot of what I can tell having a
family is sort of like running a small
business it's not so much about love as
it is about um like can you work well
together uh sometimes it helps to love
that person sometimes it could be
infuriating when you love that person
sometimes you just have to like the
person and you need to work well
together in fact I think that would
actually solve a lot of issues issues
that we're currently facing if we just
like lowered the bar like for kids and

[1:03:00]
like lowered the bar like for kids and
marriage and things like that do I do I
do I work well with this person and do I
like this person that that can be enough
but it's up to I don't know you man so
it's up to you to know like how
important kids are on what timeline and
um I also one last thing I'll say is
that these two things aren't
necessarily mutually exclusive like why
do you have
to let go of your options that you
currently have in order to work on
yourself
like you should always be working on
yourself whether you're in a
relationship or not and it's it's the
idea that it's either I'm working on
myself or I'm in a
relationship that jeopardizes men's
relationships like you you never get to
stop working on yourself and that's a
big part of what keeps the woman
attracted and
loyal okay do a few more what we got
today Phil bear
dran I'm starting an EDD soon oh oh boy

[1:04:01]
dran I'm starting an EDD soon oh oh boy
I'm feeling imposture syndrome probably
impostor syndrome did you ever feel that
way on your sidy journey I'm 38 years
old you're the only person to pronounce
my last name correctly thank you okay
right right on
um did I ever feel impostor
syndrome I don't think I
did but let's be clear that doesn't mean
I felt confident when
I I imposter syndome because
like I wasn't a novel a novice therapist
you know what I'm saying like and
everyone knew that I was under
supervision I wasn't pretending to be
more advanced in my journey than was
imposter syndrome I think needs you have
to feel like you're you're like more
empowered or higher or more credible
than you actually like you're socially

[1:05:01]
than you actually like you're socially
recognizing that way than you than you
feel on the inside I I didn't get that
kind of
Social and um I doubt that you will
either like grad school is a humiliating
experience in many respects um it you're
you're the lowest of the low and it
would be very difficult I think to feel
like you w
um that you were like in a place that
you didn't deserve to be so um I didn't
feel imposs because of that like I I
wasn't making any errors that I was in
training that said I didn't [ __ ] know
what I was doing in the beginning I had
some ideas and I had good
intentions I remember this is a funny
story like I got my first my first
practicum was at a chemical de Clinic
atient substance

[1:06:03]
dependency and after working I think for
six months there I finally got my first
client I
got I'm so excited we still doing paper
notes back the folder and the files like
be a therapist I meet the person in the
waiting room and I escort him back into
the counseling room Clos and like even
before
I can fully sit down in the chair this
guy just
starts going at oh my God than God
you're here so it's like oh okay so it's
been six days uh left my wife um I
relapsed again and I got into my car and
I I drove into a telephone call and I
didn't know what to do so I I ran out of
the car and I've been hiding out on the
streets the last four days um and to
make money I decided so deep in the
addiction I started just having having
sex with guys like behind Park cars to

[1:07:01]
sex with guys like behind Park cars to
get a little bit money to get the drugs
that I needed and now you know my I lost
my phone I'm sure my wife is is very
concerned the cops have to have found
the car by now and I'm just
like well that sounds like a pickle you
know I was just sitting there I I didn't
even get to introduce myself I just
remember spending whole
session uh just trying not to look
surprised you know just trying to look
like oh yeah that'll happen yeah that R
out of money start having sex get more
drugs
um so it was quite a shock when I first
started seeing clients it took some time
before I you know I heard a lot of
stories you know the great thing about
my training is I just
listen a
lot now it's pretty rare it's pretty

[1:08:00]
lot now it's pretty rare it's pretty
rare at this stage of the game yes was
like St pretty hard for me to hear
something I haven't heard before you
know it happens every once in a while
but it's it's pretty rare um ton I feel
just more grounded it did take me like
five six years to kind of find my
therapist voice my clinical voice um
before then I think I was trying to be
my own therapist because that was my
only really point of reference
um for how a therapist should act up
until that time so it can take some time
for you to find your own professional
voice
um just remember that if you're feeling
an impost syndrome it's like you're
you're in training you're training and I
think everyone interacting with you
knows that and so their expectations for
you you know might not be as high as
yours are for
yourself um so don't there's no need to
pretend to be more than that you're your
path and all you do is focus on putting
one foot in front of the other and
you'll eventually arrive

[1:09:01]
you'll eventually arrive
at fully
invested
okay Elliot Wade you just blew my mind
happen so I can leave the Romantic
impulse
aside of course you can it's it's
generally not something that most
Romantics can just like flip the switch
on
try the Romantic impulse I think is
something that is deeply
cultivated by media by movies and
popular
songs it's also like I talked about the
book it's a transfigured religious
impulse which I think a lot of beings
feel there is this natural I think
organic human tendency to admire and the
the the high something larger than
yourself and like you come into this
world it's so big there's the cosmos

[1:10:02]
world it's so big there's the cosmos
it's bordered be so beautiful it's like
wow like who did that where did this
come from there's this feeling of like
awe and gratitude that I think are
natural excuse me to human beings
that correctly transfigured into
religious impulse but incorrectly
transfigured into a romantic so
I'm saying it's not just switch it's
probably deeply culturally ingrained
inside of you and may transfigured
simp but give it a shot yeah you don't
have to be a romantic anymore if you
don't want
to okay do a few more we'll call it
quits Juan Pablo narv said that right
mention that how do you decide which
emotions to
honor great
question yeah
so let's talk about this one of my
oldest videos I really like this video
it's

[1:11:01]
called why so behind every emotion is a
thought you can think of on some the
emotion to be the
embodied reflection of that
thought so for example if I think the
thought and believe it to be true I am
about to
die most likely
uh the embodied emotion reflection of
that thought is going to be fear or
P if I put that thought in 100 people's
heads people are probably going to
experience fear and panic a consequence
that it feels very personal because
you're the only one feeling afraid and
panicked but that is just a reflection
of impersonal thought which is I'm going
to die that is then you know validated
and believed to be true and these
thoughts they can be just put into all
kinds of people minds and through that

[1:12:00]
kinds of people minds and through that
the emotion dles
down so the issue is that we are subject
to all kinds of
thoughts a lot of those thoughts are
[ __ ] a lot of those thoughts are
wrong a lot of those thoughts are
irrational thing I'm talking about
feelings can't be irrational
irrationality is a characteristic of
thought only thought will be rational or
irrational emotions just
are you can
have a real emotional reaction to an
irrational
thought people do that there's a lot of
that going on but they have a real
emotional reaction to an irrational
thought this can be tricky
because it's like the feeling is real
but the thought is is not really
grounded in reality actually one of
the tests to know whether a thought

[1:13:01]
the tests to know whether a thought
is grounded in reality does it produce a
big emotion or not look around reality
kind of is what it is truck around for
billions of
years there's there's not a lot of big
dramatic things that happen they happen
from time to time most day in and day
out is just sort of like I'm along you
know what I'm saying um
so if you're having these big wild mood
swings and you're up here and you're
down there and all over the place
chances are that's not actually accurate
of what's going on around you which kind
coming along it always has so generally
people with a lot of big
emotions who feel a lot think a lot and
those thoughts aren't always in line
with if they were they'd kind of just be
you know huming
along okay so if we are subject to all
kinds of thoughts some of which are true
and some of which are not true iral how

[1:14:02]
and some of which are not true iral how
do we decide which emotions to
honor
well I talk about this video which one
it is talked about in the last live chat
actually live stream um I get this from
marshallan the creator of dialectical
behavior is you kind of
want see if the emotion is Justified
there are Justified
reasons that we have emotions for
example there's
uh there's guilt the example I use in
the video um it's Justified to feel
guilty when you've done something you
said you weren't G to do didn't
something said you were gonna do you
vial commitment like if you if your
behavior breach one of those three
things it's right should feel guilty

[1:15:00]
things it's right should feel guilty
right would be justified in which case
you should relent impulse inside of
which is make amends say I'm sorry ask
forgiveness to try to restore to how
they were before you
transgressed if on the other you're
feeling guilty but none of those three
things happened you're just feeling
guilty because somebody's upset you if
they're upset with you because you broke
an expectation that they had in their
own that's something that you agreed
to your is not justified you'll feel it
but you have to examine like I didn't
actually do anything I should feel
guilty about I just feel
uncomfortable I don't like the fact that
this person like maybe they're not upset
with me for just a few
reason you'll still feel the guilt
but the way to get rid of that
feeling when you examine that it's

[1:16:01]
feeling when you examine that it's
unjustified so if the if impulse to
apologize and to make amends and to
prepare the opposite of that is you
don't
apologize and you don't ask forgiveness
you kind of just say
hey I don't did anything wrong that
you're upset about that
um you might why you're upset about that
like is there an expectation that you
had in your mind that you now feel is
violated unfortunately I'm not really
responsible for that
expectation um etc etc so that's kind of
how you simpy that okay let's do um
three more questions and then we'll call
day okay Angel Garza thank you for your
donation how did you know that PhD was
your I'm a 19 male old entrepreneur
deciding between my marketing business

[1:17:01]
deciding between my marketing business
or going through the Journey to PhD do
you think it's possible to do both be
really tough to do both now I mean I did
work p my way through grad school but I
was working at least 110 hours a
week four years first year was year two
through five was tough like I didn't
take a day off in four years and end up
very very out which is a real thing it
took me about 10 months to recover from
that it was not a fun process but
because of that I didn't have this debt
when I got out of school which
positioned me very well for the rest of
my career and it taught me a lot about
what I was capable accomplishment so it
was a crucible that glad I passed
through that I would never ever do again
like it's
just um so is it possible yeah lots of
things are possible are you gonna like
it probably not
but not everything that hard is painful
is necessarily beneficial will help you

[1:18:01]
is necessarily beneficial will help you
grow um how did I know that psych was my
path um I didn't so when I was your age
I wanted to be an actor I was an actor I
was living in New York
and I didn't decide to become a
psychologist till I was
28 or so um it took me about and a half
between I didn't want to be an actor
anymore I wanted to be a psychologist
like it
didn't and those two things weren't the
same moment I knew that I didn't want to
be an actor anymore dis satisfied with
that life and the life me but I didn't
yet know with any degree of conviction
what I wanted to do instead so that
began this like due diligence period
that took about a year where I examined
lots of different possibilities I talked
to people who worked in those jobs I did
research on the internet I
did self inquiry because it's really
important to know what works for you and
what doesn't work you not what you think

[1:19:02]
what doesn't work you not what you think
you want to work for you
actually that's why I wanted to leave
act level it wasn't a good fit for who I
actually was function an introvert which
is part of why UNC comfortable to be an
actor for as long as I was um so it
wasn't it wasn't a good fit for me
introverts can be actors but it's just
it's it's easier to be
an so I needed something that among
other things that better fit for who I
actually was not who I
want and over time um based on that due
diligence and myself self examination
came to the fact that okay maybe I can
be a psychologist therapist and I did
Research into that process and there's
professional schools and there's
research inss these different degrees
there's the
S degrees levels these different
licensing well what I want to do so at
that point it was really important for
to begin with

[1:20:02]
to begin with
the be in
in I said to myself well I'd like to be
a therapist type of practice I'd like to
have an office I have a little side be
my
own see the people that I want to see
I'll make decent money um I'll have good
time
flexibility I'll be helping people in a
meaningful way I hope
I'll be dealing with intellectually
interesting
problems I think I
can
back
um it's very easy to know which route to
take when you know you want to
go want to go to Chicago it's very clear
that you should go down this road and
not this road right don't you're going
all the roads
look two more
oh hey Pearl I sent you a DM today I
moved to Chicago would' love to fly you
out for interview I got the

[1:21:02]
out for interview I got the
today text that way uh welcome to the
states uh definitely open to it talk
soon uh okay is that
everything I said I would do couple more
not seeing any new
okay here we go uh DM ly my girlfriend
has lots of dating kissing
pictures I told her they makeable
disrespected am I controlling if I ask
her to take them
down
like she has pictures of the two of you
kissing or like pictures of her kissing
other like her other people that she's
dating
and take them down so she's posting them
on social

[1:22:00]
media okay so I'm gonna let's say that
I'm assuming that she's taking pictures
of two of you in romantic cont she's
posting them on
social yeah I don't necessarily love
that myself I'm a very private person in
many so
um that kind of goes along with saying
earlier is
that I think you can talk about how it
makes you
uncomfortable I I would shy away from
givings you can you can ask but then but
be prepared to listen to the answer and
to accept the answer and that
answer might on some level be a sign
ofaction a level of attraction
investment in relationship and it will
also potentially be a level of your
attraction as well because when we like
someone more and we love someone more
we're willing to accept who they are but

[1:23:01]
we're willing to accept who they are but
if this is a deal break for you that's
fine then you know B her response you
might not want to be in that
relationship anymore or don't be in
those
pictures she can't post pictures if
you're not in them that's that's what
you can do and respon well so it's like
if she says no it's I can do whatever I
want you can say that's well I can do
whatever I want I don't want to be
so that can potentially cause a shift
and there might be room for some sort of
negotiation at
okay we'll do one
more okay here we go uh X CAD Trader
thank what do you think about men
just cheing out completely you said we
need to build the sun first but can one
be happy with just this sun absolutely I

[1:24:00]
be happy with just this sun absolutely I
know lots of guys happy with just like
life can be very peaceful without
limiting it for a man especially if your
life is going well if you're taking care
of yourself and you have friends and
you're healthy have an interesting
lifestyle that works for you and you
just want to sail around your heart's
content you are more than welcome my
friend it's like I say in the book
Captain don't need to have passengers to
be a
captain the captain could be the only
one on board and he can sail around the
oceans his
heart it's not the
past right these other things it's
having a boat learning to sail and
spting a
course
um it's hard to check out completely man
I mean that what generally keeps coming
back for better for worse
figure out that it's like I know so many
guys that I've canceled over the years
who after so disappointing experience

[1:25:02]
who after so disappointing experience
I'm [ __ ] done with it I just can't
take it anymore like they're done for a
month or two then they're like a man
lonely and I'm hor that's what get to
come back um for better for worse so
it's easier to check out if you aren't
lonely or
horny because those are things that tend
to make men go back to Market um but no
I don't
think in your life in order to
be not at all in fact it's probably best
if you don't go to your looking for
fillment which is what I talking about
on
top and I think more and more men are
checking out just like more and more
women are checking out as well because
our relationships these days are not
based on need as much as they are based
on
want want is a capricious thing at some

[1:26:01]
want want is a capricious thing at some
level
so there's any WR with that I don't
think necessarily that Every Man Has a
has a duty to humanity to
and
um so yeah if if you're happy living
that life you know God bless you all
right guys so that's the what I got for
you today I want to thank you for
questions there were some good ones
helpful for you and to once again talk
about my new member Community Captain SS
so one of the things I wanted to do was
to create a space that actually had some
dialogue so I do these live streams
periodically but as you can see it's
just
longing in the Captain's Quarters we're
going to do by monly twice a month group
consultations zo so I'm G to see you
you're GNA have a voice you're going to
be able to talk to me and I'm going to
be able to talk to you and to talk to
the other folks in the community as well

[1:27:01]
the other folks in the community as well
so it's a way of getting a much more
personal
involved uh take some of these issues
and to come closer to each other
and um I'm also going to be having
invited guests on hopefully on a monthly
Cas once again you can talk to and ask
question of these folks
um your answers from them directly not
just from recording videos um I do
discounts on individual consultations
for
members that's just start with I think
it's evolve over time right now it's 100
bucks which
um think is kind of pricey but this
isn't a course you know this isn't just
something that I'm turning out to get
you know 10,000
subscribers needs to be
uh otherwise people won't be able to
have a voice in the community so to be

[1:28:01]
have a voice in the community so to be
expensive keep that I do think that the
value justifies the cost like um the two
mon
consultations say that 50 bucks each
they're hour and a half so you get 33
bucks an hour
just um not so bad so if you're
interested then please check out the
community the link will be in the
description thanks for consideration and
I will see you next time all right
everybody thanks for joining me
