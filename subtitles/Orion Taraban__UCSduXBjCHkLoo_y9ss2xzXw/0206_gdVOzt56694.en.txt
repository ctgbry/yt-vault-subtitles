i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
what is a deal breaker
this is an important subject and this
episode will contain a lot of
information so you may need to listen to
it more than once all the way to the end
everyone is entitled to his or her deal
breakers when it comes to relationships
whether they're professional romantic or
familial it's not for me to say what
another person's deal breakers should be
however
some deal breakers are what i call
organic deal breakers which are
behaviors that if left unchecked
will destroy the relationship all by
itself even if everything else about the
relationship is perfect
so for example i consider alcoholism to
be an organic deal breaker
it's not possible to be in a committed
relationship with an alcoholic because
the alcoholic is already in another
relationship with alcohol
even if everything else about that
relationship is amazing the alcoholism

[01:00]
relationship is amazing the alcoholism
if left unchecked will destroy the
relationship all by itself
through the lying and the hiding and the
chaos and destruction that it tends that
disease
therefore this is a behavior that can't
go unaddressed within the relationship
and so you can approach this behavior as
an advocate for the relationship not
only is it likely that you would prefer
not to be in a relationship with an
alcoholic so you're speaking up for
yourself
the relationship literally cannot
support that behavior so you're speaking
up for the relationship you're basically
saying hey
i care about us
i care about this relationship and this
behavior will destroy it so i'm
advocating on behalf of us
on behalf of our relationship against
this behavior
and then you give the other person a
free choice you say to him or her i'm
not going to stick around to see how
this plays out i know how it's going to
play out it's going to destroy the
relationship all by itself
and so i'm going to ask you to choose

[02:00]
and so i'm going to ask you to choose
do you want to have a relationship with
me
or do you want to keep your relationship
with alcohol
and then you have to be willing to
accept whatever the other person chooses
because that person who might very well
be in his or her act of addiction might
tell you to go pound sand
and that's painful
or that person might finally decide to
take the necessary steps to heal and
recover from that addiction over years
and that's a different kind of pain
so if something is a deal breaker for
you can approach it from the position of
being an advocate for the relationship
and you can give the other person a free
choice with respect to how they would
like to proceed and then you accept that
choice for better or for worse okay
on the other hand
if you're dealing with a behavior that's
annoying that you'd prefer didn't exist
that you don't like
but that won't necessarily
destroy the relationship and that isn't
causing you enough pain to inspire your
willingness to walk away from that
relationship because of it
then you shouldn't bring it up

[03:02]
then you shouldn't bring it up
if you do you're just complaining and
you're not willing to do anything about
it
bringing up issues like these with your
partner is very similar to going out to
eat at a restaurant receiving your food
and then calling the waiter over to say
uh excuse me this chicken is undercooked
these vegetables are soggy and
everything is cold but then stopping the
waiter when he reaches for your plate to
take it away saying no
i'm still gonna eat this
i just wanted you to know that i'm
unhappy and that this food is terrible
you're just going to be the
customer in that situation it's like if
it's a problem
be willing to make a change
and this could mean sending the food
back or leaving the restaurant entirely
and if you're not willing to do that
then do your best to enjoy what you have
because if you complain about things
that aren't worth complaining about
because you're not willing to do
anything about them
you degrade the quality of your
relationship with that person and this

[04:00]
relationship with that person and this
is stupid because you have to continue
to live in that degraded relationship
you've chosen
if you're not willing to leave
then why degrade the quality of that
relationship by complaining
unnecessarily
so that's kind of how i look at a
problem in a relationship either it's a
deal breaker or it's not if it's a deal
breaker you advocate for the
relationship and you're willing to leave
if it doesn't get addressed
and if it's not a deal breaker you don't
bring it up and you work within yourself
as to why this is such a problem for you
something to consider
