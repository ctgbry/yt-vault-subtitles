i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
winners almost always quit
now you don't have to live in society
for very long before you're bound to
come up against the age old aphorism
winners never quit and quitters never
however
i'm here to tell you that nothing could
be further from the truth
in point of fact winners not only quit
they almost always quit
that is
winners quit everything else
except the game they want to win
take a guy like lebron james a strong
candidate for the title of greatest of
all time in the game of basketball that
guy had to quit everything else to get
to his level of mastery he had to quit
tap dance as a kid and he had to quit
jazz band as a teenager he had to quit
partying every night with his friends he
had to quit certain relationships that
were too demanding on his time there is
no way lebron could have gotten to where

[01:00]
no way lebron could have gotten to where
he is today one of the greatest
basketball players of all time if he
were simultaneously attempting to be
great at something else
it's not possible my friends to be a
nobel prize winning physicist
and an a-list hollywood movie star
you can't be president of the united
states and the commander of a space
mission
just think about michael jordan another
one of the greatest basketball players
of all time the fact that he was able to
play even one major league baseball game
is incredible it's extremely impressive
however
no one is going to remember him for his
time on the white sox
if you want to be truly great at
something if you want to win at the
highest levels of competition
then you have to be prepared to quit
everything else to get there otherwise
you likely won't have a chance in hell
against the guys who do
so choose carefully
if we ever do become great

[02:01]
if we ever do become great
we only really get a chance to be great
at one thing we can be good at a few
others and decent at several more
however we can only really achieve
greatness if we ever do
in one thing
