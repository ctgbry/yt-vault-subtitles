i'm dr orion tarabin and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is don't play dress-up
now this is something that i see a lot
of younger men do with respect to
important decisions in their lives
who to get into romantic relationships
with what city in the world to live in
what career path to take they don't
really have a clear idea of what they
want and so they engage in a kind of
fantasy narrative
that i call playing dress-up so
for example a guy might not know exactly
what he wants
in a romantic relationship it'll meet a
woman and he'll find a little bit more
about her
and discover okay she's one of those
high-powered
corporate types and he'll think to
himself
okay that that's not really my life but
but i can make it work
yeah she'll be out working late and so
i'll do the chores and have dinner on
the table when she comes home and

[01:01]
the table when she comes home and
and we'll go to holiday parties and
swanky bars with with
padded leather booths and we'd fly first
class to europe for a
holiday once a year and we'll hire nanny
to take care of the kids
it'll be great we'll be like a power
couple slaying it in the business world
yeah that'll be our thing or he'll meet
another woman
and learn that well she's a country girl
at heart
she likes horses and knows how to shoot
a gun and he'll be like
okay i've i've never lived in the
country but i'm willing to try it out
yeah i could learn how to fire a gun and
bail hay i'll
i'll ride a horse buy a hat we'll have a
bunch of
honest apple cheeked children who'll
help me chop the firewood yeah
i can make it work that's playing
dress-up
and these relationships are almost
always doomed to failure because they're
not really grounded in reality
they're not really grounded in a firm
sense of what a person wants

[02:01]
sense of what a person wants
and that's because a firm sense in what
a person wants
is always based on accurate
self-knowledge
at a certain point in life you kind of
have to understand
and accept who you are not who you think
you are
not who you could be not who you want to
be
but who you actually are
what you like what you don't like what
works for you
what doesn't work for you and out of
that understanding
will come authentic preferences values
and priorities and when you have this
explicit understanding
you can evaluate opportunities that you
encounter on your
path to the extent that they align with
your own criteria
about what you want so rather than
trying to fit yourself
into each opportunity that presents
itself you
begin to evaluate the likely match
between the presented opportunity and
your own desires

[03:01]
your own desires
when a new relationship or career
prospect presents itself
you assess it through the lens of what
you're looking for
and if it meets enough of your criteria
you say great let's go for it this seems
like it could work
and if it doesn't you say yeah thanks
been no thanks
and in this way you enter into
relationships and careers
that have goodness of fit and these
require
so much less effort to initiate
maintain and flourish so those are my
thoughts on the matter
