I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is
psychack's Better Living Through
psychology and the topic of today's
short talk is why men end up with train
wrecks so this will be an important
episode for the gentlemen out there the
general understanding is that men end up
in toxic relationships because they
ignore the red flags of poor character
and disordered personality early in the
courtship process often because they are
not thinking with the right head
there are plenty of videos on YouTube
about dating red flags and some of them
can be quite useful however this won't
be another one on cycls we like to go
past the obvious and deeper than the
superficial and this is a particularly
juicy subject from a psychological
perspective today I'm going to give you
three unexpected reasons why men end up
with train wrecks and before I get into
it you should understand that I'm going
to be talking from personal experience
in my teens and 20s I had a sixth sense
for women with whom I could have

[01:01]
for women with whom I could have
spectacularly destructive relationships
I could walk into a room full of people
and like sniff out the women who would
be down to ride the roller coaster my
relationships were extremely passionate
and intense were characterized by brain
melting sexual chemistry and were
fundamentally unstable and destructive
that was what I was attracted to
these women never failed to turn me on
however I would eventually get fed up
with the drama and when I did I sought
out a nice responsible emotionally
stable woman to date
who absolutely bored me to tears
I did my best but I could not drum up
any authentic interest in these women so
we would inevitably be and we would
inevitably break up and I'd go back to
find another roller coaster
repeat
eventually
I got to the place where I realized I
had two equally unattractive options
either I could go after what I was
authentically attracted to but was

[02:01]
authentically attracted to but was
absolute poison for me
or I could resign myself to a decent
woman
whom I felt nothing for
and I'm sharing this story because I
have a hunch that there are quite a few
men out there
who are nodding in agreement right now
they find themselves currently in a very
similar situation if this is you then
have courage there is a way out of this
predicament I found a way out myself
though it will likely take time and
effort to get there let me explain
one of the main reasons why I was in
this predicament to begin with was back
in the day
I was pretty messed up
I was raised in a very chaotic family my
relationship models left much to be
desired I experienced a lot of death and
loss in my teenage years I was just not
in a good place
all that is to say I had a lot of
emotional wounding
and that wound was the sixth sense I
mentioned earlier
it resonated it like came to life in the

[03:02]
it resonated it like came to life in the
presence of women with a complementary
wound
and in a room full of people there are
plenty of wounded women
I don't really understand how this works
and I know this doesn't sound very
scientific but it's like experientially
true
over and over again I found myself with
women with complementary wounds
and when we got together we would
reenact our wounding with each other in
a way that certainly didn't feel good
but that felt familiar
it felt familiar even though it was
painful if you grow up in Conflict then
conflict feels familiar if you grow up
in chaos then chaos feels familiar
understand For Better or For Worse
humans and especially children can get
used to anything
in any case what I ended up doing was I
began to heal
that inner wounding through a number of
different methods and what I discovered
was that my attraction to women
organically shifted to the extent that

[04:01]
organically shifted to the extent that
my emotional wounding healed
I'm not talking about trying not to be
attracted to what I was attracted to or
pretending to be attracted to what I
wasn't attracted to I'm talking about
what I was authentically attracted to
began to change but not overnight
slowly over months and years I found
myself increasingly attracted to
emotionally stable women for the first
time in my life and let me tell you
this was fantastic in fact it might have
been a lifesaver being attracted to
emotionally stable women solves a lot of
problems before they even arise
so that's the first reason why men end
up with train wrecks they have unhealed
emotional wounds that motivate them to
reenact that wounding with women with
complementary wounds because doing so
feels familiar

in the lower right hand corner and tip
me in proportion to the value you feel
you've received from this message
because it's your support that makes all
this happen I really appreciate your
help
here's another reason
back in the day given the privileged
perspective I had into my own
Consciousness I have to admit that I
didn't think too highly of myself
in fact I had pretty low self-esteem
and because I didn't think highly of
myself I also figured that a successful
stable intelligent loving woman
would have absolutely no interest in me
this of course was my own self-rejection
projected out into the world but that's
how I thought back then that's how I
felt and because I felt like I wasn't
the fastest lion in The Pride so to
speak I kind of targeted the gazelles

[06:02]
speak I kind of targeted the gazelles
with a limp
if you understand my meaning I went
after women with obvious defects because
I thought I was defective myself
and this basically translated into
having low to no standards with respect
to the character of the women I got
involved with the character mind you
because despite my low self-esteem I
remained as superficial as ever which
basically meant that I didn't care about
anything else as long as she was hot
now as I began to heal my wounds as I
began to build a life worth living as I
began to achieve some measure of
external success as I began to do hard
things and grow my confidence and
self-esteem I kind of discovered that I
no longer needed to Target limping
gazelles at this point I was one of the
fastest lines in the pride I could chase
down nearly any gazelle in the herd
so that's the second reason why men end
up in train wrecks their low self-esteem
tells them that they don't deserve
better

[07:01]
better
which brings us to the third reason now
this is going to sound really weird but
one of the reasons why men get involved
with disastrous women is because on some
level
these women are safer than stable women
they're safer and I guarantee that's not
the word that you expected me to use but
hear me out
we often talk about the fear of
rejection but in my experience a fear
that's just as prevalent and destructive
as the fear of rejection is the fear of
acceptance
though people don't like to admit it
meeting a person who is responsible and
intelligent and successful and
attractive and commitment-minded and
loving and single that is meeting a
person with whom there is no obvious
obstacle to your happily ever after is
threatening
St Augustine famously prayed O Lord give
me chastity

[08:01]
me chastity
but not yet
in today's day and age the prayer might
be amended to oh Lord give me a life
partner
but not yet
look at it this way
who is it easy to tell your deep dark
secret to
a stranger in a bar or your wife
in the vast majority of cases it's the
Stranger in a bar
why because you might not ever see that
person ever again in your life
so your secret is kind of safe with them
on the other hand if you tell your
secret to your wife and that disclosure
is met with judgment or hostility then
you have to look in that woman's face
and see the memory of that disclosure in
her eyes for the rest of your life
the stakes get really high when you
introduce the idea of the rest of your
life
in many respects that's why my
profession exists at all therapists are
ideally non-judgmental secret Keepers
completely separate from the rest of
your life that's what makes us safe
so if dating women with obvious issues

[09:01]
so if dating women with obvious issues
is threatening
I'm sorry so if dating women without
obvious issues is threatening as they
represent a clear and unobstructed
Pathway to the rest of your life many
men seek out women with obvious issues
and they do so because they can tell
themselves oh this is never going to go
anywhere this so this is not serious
their defects make them safe
and that paradoxically motivates men to
spend time with these women and weeks
turn into months and months turn into
years and in this way guys can end up in
relationships with women with whom they
had absolutely no intention of ever
committing to
so that's the third reason why men end
up with train wrecks they feel safe
spending time with women when they think
it's never going to last
strange but true the same thing could
even be said for women and bad boys
works both ways
so there you have it instead of five
ways to spot a narcissist I've given you
three counter-intuitive but

[10:01]
three counter-intuitive but
experientially true reasons why men end
up in bad relationships learn from my
