this is extremely important to
understand you are free to think
whatever you want in the privacy of your
own mind you can think things that are
not true you can think things that are
socially unacceptable you can think the
most fantastic exaggerated distortions
of reality you can think whatever you
want however you are not free to feel
however you want
as a consequence of what you choose to
think
so for instance if a person were to
think man no one ever likes me nothing
ever goes my way
I don't think I'm ever going to amount
to anything that person is not free to
feel confident
if another person were to think I
shouldn't have to deal with this this is
not this is a waste of my time that
person is not free to feel peaceful
what you feel is a consequence of what
you choose to think and that feeling is
mandatory you can think whatever you
want but the feeling will follow
organically from that thought
