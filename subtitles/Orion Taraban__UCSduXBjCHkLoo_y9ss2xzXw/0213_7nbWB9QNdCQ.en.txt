i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
danger and uncertainty
so this isn't a perspective you're
likely to hear all that often but it's
one that i found quite useful in my own
life and one that i often discuss with
my clients
which is that a life that is entirely
free
of danger and uncertainty
is lacking
if you arrive at a state where you have
everything that you want exactly the way
that you want it
there's often the sense that something
is missing
and it can be very hard to put your
finger on just what that something is
because on the surface everything looks
ideal
to counteract this feeling i found that
there's something really useful in
incorporating what i call responsible
danger and predictable uncertainty into
my life responsible danger
and predictable uncertainty let's look
at each one in turn

[01:00]
at each one in turn
it's important to take responsible risks
and this is because
the absence of risk
is itself risky the absence of risk
increases fragility and complacency and
decreases opportunity and growth
there is no such thing
as a completely riskless decision and so
it's important to be intentional about
choosing what dangers we believe are
worth exposing ourselves to
as opposed to trying to avoid them
entirely
being willing to cross the threshold of
danger in a responsible fashion allows
you to sharpen your edge and to tolerate
more discomfort and pain which tends to
make your life easier in the long run
danger also helps you see who you really
are and what you're actually capable of
for me i cross the threshold of danger
on my solo trips into the wilderness
among other things and these experiences

[02:00]
among other things and these experiences
allow me to know myself in ways i just
wouldn't be able to
when i'm in the midst of comfort and
security and for that reason these
experiences are very valuable to me
the second thing to consider is
predictable uncertainty now why is this
helpful well if you
if all you ever do
is what you choose to do
then you will likely only be exposed to
more of the same this is the same
selection bias that tends to create echo
chambers on social media platforms it's
important to introduce randomness or
unpredictability into your life because
it exposes you to ideas or experiences
that might be very beneficial to you but
that you would never choose of your own
volition
unpredictability also injects novelty
which is a psychological need into your
life and creates opportunities for
growth which facilitate
self-actualization the apex

[03:00]
self-actualization the apex
of maslow's hierarchy of needs
so what might this look like planned
uncertainty could be closing your eyes
putting your finger on a map and going
to that place to explore
or it could be adopting someone else's
recommendations for a course of action
which is kind of a curated approach to
predictable uncertainty
for instance i'm currently making my way
through the penguin books great ideas
series
everything i've read so far has been
thought provoking and many of the books
are ones i would never think to pick up
and read on my own
creating space for opportunities like
this broadens your perspective and
enriches your personality
