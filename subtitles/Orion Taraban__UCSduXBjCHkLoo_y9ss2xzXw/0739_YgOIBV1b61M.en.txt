if your everyday experience is just sort
of comfortable and loved and you have
all your emotional and psychological
needs met it's going to take a very
extraordinary personality to voluntarily
put yourself into risk and danger and
struggle the people who have the tough
upbringings It's almost like the
struggle is how do I put it I think this
was Marshall inan who I love dialectical
behavior therapy the folks that she
worked with often personality disordered
folks she says that they're in hell like
they're down there in the basement and
the house is on fire now she can't go
down there with them because otherwise
they both might get burned up but what
she can do is she can lower a ladder but
that ladder is made of metal and so when
she puts the ladder down there that
metal is going to get really hot and
every time you touch the ladder to try
to climb out it's going toing burn it's
going to hurt it's going to be painful
every part of you is going to want to
give up and stop climbing but the
alternative is that you stay in the
burning basement so the path out of hell
is painful
