I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is the most
toxic relationship belief unfortunately
the most toxic relationship belief is
one of the most ubiquitous on this
planet it's toxic because it appears so
benign in reality enacters of disbelief
tend to corrode a relationship From the
Inside Out
simultaneously believing that they are
entirely justified in doing so which
means that people go on to perpetuate
the same error in future relationships
externalizing blame while feeling
self-righteous happens all the time okay
so what is this toxic belief it's very
simple in fact it's so simple you might
not believe me when I tell it to you so
I'm going to ask you to please listen
through to the rest of the episode so I
can help you make sense of this
here it is
the most toxic relationship belief is
my relationship is where I am free to be

[01:03]
my relationship is where I am free to be
myself
I told you you probably weren't going to
believe me however this belief destroys
relationships now you might be thinking
Dr Orion are you saying that we should
be lying and faking in our relationships
no it does not that's a strong man
argument what I'm saying is that you are
not free to be fully and completely
yourself in a relationship
this belief is toxic because the people
who endorse it tend to live their lives
like this
their implicit framework is out there
out there in the world that's where I
have to act when I'm at my job I have to
put on a smile and do what my boss tells
me when I'm on the bus I have to
tolerate the rudeness and the body odor
when I'm with my family I have to be a
good daughter or the firstborn son and
sometimes even with my friends I have to

[02:00]
sometimes even with my friends I have to
pretend to be interested in Marlene's
latest interpersonal drama or Steven's
ill remembered recapitulation of
whatever the media has encouraged him to
think but in my relationships that's
where I get to let it all go that's
where I just get to be myself I don't
have to try I don't have to perform I
don't have to generate value my
relationship is where I get to drop all
role-playing be accepted unconditionally
and finally be myself that is a toxic
belief

the fact of the matter is that a

[03:01]
the fact of the matter is that a
relationship or at least a good
is a privilege much like a job or at
least a good job
is a privilege
nobody thinks that they should be able
to just be themselves at work
does that mean that people are lying and
faking at work I'm sure some of them are
however a better way of thinking about
it is that most people are channeling a
version of themselves at work that is
conducive to professionalism which is
what we tend to socially expect from
people occupying a professional role and
why do we expect this because it eases
the professional relationship
it is easier to do business with someone
who is acting professionally than it is
to do business with someone acting
unprofessionally wouldn't you agree
so professionalism is a version of
yourself that is appropriate to a
specific kind of role because it

[04:01]
specific kind of role because it
facilitates the transaction of value
does that make sense
the same thing is true for your intimate
relationships
boyfriend is a role wife is a role this
means that we tend to have certain
expectations of people occupying such
roles and why do we expect this because
it eases the intimate relationship
facilitating the transaction of value
which is why the people are there
and assuming that you have a good
boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or
wife it is a privilege to occupy that
role I hate to break it to you but the
only time when you are free to be
yourself is when you are alone
you may not want to hear it but it's the
truth
relationships are roles
some of that role is socially determined
and some of that role is defined by
negotiated expectations but a role is a
role saying or doing things that

[05:00]
role saying or doing things that
conflict with the expectations of that
role is going to go over
in that relationship about as well as
saying or doing things that conflict
with professionalism will at work
and the most common way that people
conflict with their relationship roles
is by slacking off
at work you have to do your job
every single day
you do not reach a point at work where
you get to stop trying
every day you have to show up and
deliver
you need some time off you take some
time off but you do not get to clock in
and not make an effort if you fail to do
so
people will fail to pay you and this is
entirely reasonable
paying you for not making an effort is
being complicit
in your own robbery
and if this is something that is
difficult for you to understand then
perhaps the privilege of a job isn't for

[06:00]
perhaps the privilege of a job isn't for
you
a relationship is no different
you have to show up every single day you
do not reach a point in your
relationship where you get to stop
trying
every day you have to show up and
deliver you need some time to yourself
you take some time to yourself but you
do not get to clock in and not make an
effort if you fail to do so
people will fail to compensate you with
the benefits of a relationship and this
is entirely reasonable
compensating you for not making an
effort is being complicit in the theft
of your time among other things
and if this is something that is
difficult for you to understand then
perhaps the privilege of a relationship
isn't for you
let me give you a very specific example
of how this commonly presents itself in
heterosexual relationships I often hear
men complaining to me that when their

[07:00]
men complaining to me that when their
woman wakes up in the morning she puts
on a smart looking outfit she puts on
high-heeled shoes she puts on her makeup
and then she goes out to work
but then she takes off that makeup and
changes into sweatpants when she comes
home in the evening when she is free to
be herself
ladies
I understand that it might be more
comfortable to wear sweatpants around
the house but I guarantee you what your
man is thinking is
why does the stranger that you interact
with professionally get to enjoy a more
attractive version of you than I do
why are you more charming and
presentable with customers than you are
with me
and given the fact that I'm investing a
lot in this relationship I'm starting to
feel hurt and cheated because you seem
to be making less of an effort
this is a small example of how a
relationship can be corroded From the
Inside Out by failing to live up to role

[08:00]
Inside Out by failing to live up to role
expectations
if you approach relationships like roles
and if you perform those roles capably
then you get to enjoy the Privileges of
those relationships and if you stop
performing those roles capably then over
time you compromise your right to occupy
that place
this means that you are not free to be
yourself in a relationship
that said you are free to express those
parts of yourself that are most
conducive to that role within your
relationship
and if you do that successfully you make
the relationship easy
which facilitates the transaction of
value
what do you think
is there benefit to approaching
relationships like roles let me know in
