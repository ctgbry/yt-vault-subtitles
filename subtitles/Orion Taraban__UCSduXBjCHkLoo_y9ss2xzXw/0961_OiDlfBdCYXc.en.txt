There's a the great uh Nishe quote that
says sometimes people don't want to hear
the truth because they don't want their
illusions destroyed. And that that kind
of sums up what you're saying. Yeah.
It's it's hard for us to accept some of
these truths that we'd rather look
around. Well, you can't dispel with
illusion entirely. Like straight truth
is like looking straight at the sun.
It's blinding and very uncomfortable and
I don't think we could survive. Like we
all need illusion to some degree in my
experience. Like maybe that's from thus
spake zerahustra. It feels like it might
be. And in that character he lives alone
in the crisp clean air of the mountain
but it's a rugged individual existence
and very few people could survive up
there. So, I think that Nichi
kind of prided himself on
dispelling as many of those unnecessary

dispelling as many of those unnecessary
illusions as possible, but very few
people can live that way. And I'm sure
that there were even some
illusions that Nichi was loathed to
dispense
