let's shift away from explaining why
successful men might use escorts to
responding to the most common objections
to this explanation something along the
lines of yeah but Orion how gross and
transactional is that relationship an
escort isn't going to love you she may
not even like you in fact it's entirely
possible that she may even loathe and
despise you and that she only masks her
true feelings for you because she's
being paid in light of this how can you
possibly Advocate men pursue this option
so how would I respond to this rebuttal
well first and foremost by reminding the
objector that I'm not advocating this
option I'm explaining it which is value
neutral remember I've never done this
myself I'm just explaining why
successful men hire escorts when they
choose to do so next I would agree with
the Crux of this objection but here's
the rub there's no guarantee of that in
a relationship either I know countless
men who are married to women who dislike
them if not outright hate them
