i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the subject of today's short talk is
memento mori and happiness
as you likely know memento mori is a
latin phrase that means reminder of
death namely one's own death one's own
mortality
we all know intellectually that we're
going to die
but the vast majority of us live in a
kind of emotional denial of that reality
otherwise how could we go about our
everyday lives
it would be very difficult to sustain
the structure of society if we weren't
in denial with respect to the
ephemerality of our existence
but this isn't something that society
does to us per se it's generally
something that we do to ourselves
coming into emotional contact with our
own mortality is kind of like staring at
the sun
it's not something that we can do for
very long
but it is helpful to look at it every
once in a while our own mortality that

[01:00]
once in a while our own mortality that
is
and to look at it as long and as
steadily as we can tolerate
and this does two things
one
is that when we remember that we're
actually going to die
in that our time on this planet is
limited
we get busy doing the things that really
matter
if our time is short
why bother spending it doing things that
in your heart of hearts you don't really
want to do
that aren't furthering your growth that
aren't making you happy that are
creating a positive legacy in their wake
in order to avoid pain and
disappointment
i mean those things are going to happen
anyway
there will be pain and disappointment in
the path you take to pursue your dreams
as well as on the path you take to avoid
them
so why not live in such a way that you
can look back and say like frankie hey i
did it my way
get busy doing the things that really
matter so momento mori first and
foremost helps us to prioritize that
which is most important in our lives

[02:00]
which is most important in our lives
and the second thing it does
is to help us let go of the small stuff
think about it
if today we're the last day of our lives
do we really want to spend it
complaining
or regretful
or resentful
or heartbroken
if it's overcast on your last day on
this planet don't complain about the
lack of sun go out and play in the
puddles
let go of all the needless suffering
about the small stuff
maybe today is as good as it gets
maybe tomorrow onward will be a slow or
not so slow decline into decrepitude in
oblivion
so do you really want to spend what
could potentially be your last best day
whining and irritable
let's hope not
so that's what memento mori does it
helps us to focus on what really matters
and allows us to let go of all the rest
