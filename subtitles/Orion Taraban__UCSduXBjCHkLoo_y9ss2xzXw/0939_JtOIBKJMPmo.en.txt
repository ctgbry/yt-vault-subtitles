Another, if you're interested, great
video series to watch. Go on YouTube and
and search for F2M testosterone. And
it's a series of interviews of women who
are in the process of transitioning into
becoming men and they start taking
testosterone for the first time. And
they are sharing their experiences on
tea and almost universally the response

understand men now. I have so much more
sympathy and compassion for them. It's

unrelenting impulse. Women don't have a
refractory period. So these
transitioning people, they're really

they get no relief from it's they say
it's like torture. There there's
something in testosterone that I think
just programs individuals to be very
keyed towards sex, sexual opportunities,
sexual characteristics in the desired
sex, etc., etc., etc.
