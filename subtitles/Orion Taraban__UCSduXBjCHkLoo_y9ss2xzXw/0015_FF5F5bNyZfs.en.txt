i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is begin where you're at so this is a
very important thing to keep in mind
when we're setting goals for ourselves
it's important to dream big one of the
dangers that i've seen
with folks when they're dreaming big and
setting goals for themselves
is they set a whole bunch of
requirements
in their path before actually initiating
effort towards their goal
maybe their goal for example is to lose
20 pounds
okay and so they think all right well
for that i need
a gym membership and for that i need to
make more money to afford the membership
then i need to get some new clothes to
be able to wear to the gym
and i probably should do some research
it's like no no
you you really don't have to do all
those things and if we're really honest
with ourselves creating these sort of
restrictions
in advance of just initiating a project

[01:03]
could be in a way a form of
self-sabotage and defensiveness
if a person wants to move in the
direction
of a desired career path but that means
that they have to be able to buy a new
computer and they need to be able to
move to a different part of the country
where there are more jobs because there
are no jobs here
you get my drift it's like it's not true
you can and you will have to start
any journey from precisely where you are
at the present moment
there's no other way you have to begin
from where you're at
and the fact of the matter is is that
there's something that you can do
today there's something that you can do
right now
that moves you ever so subtly
in the direction of your desired goal
and
that's basically the work if you pick
your direction
and you just keep plugging away at it

[02:01]
and you just keep plugging away at it
putting one foot in front of the other
how can you not arrive at your goal
my goal for example is to walk from
here in the bay area to canada as long
as i'm pointed north and i put one foot
for the other and i don't give up
it's not a question of if i make it it's
just a question of when
i make it yeah there are smarter and
more intelligent ways and routes to
getting there but
honestly if i just keep putting one foot
in front of the other it's
inevitable that i will reach my goal on
some level it's a foregone conclusion
so our work is to actually think well
with what i have right now
as limited as resources might be as
restrictive as my knowledge or
experience might be what's something
that i can do today
that can move the chain just another
inch down the field
and as long as i keep my foot moving in
the right direction
that my re the realization of my goal
is simply a matter of time begin with
where you're at stop

[03:00]
where you're at stop
putting unnecessary restrictions in the
path of initiating
the work towards your goals thanks for
