I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is turn the
other cheek so this phrase is an
allusion to a verse in the Bible namely
Matthew chapter 5 verse 39 in which
Jesus says but I say unto you that ye
resist not evil
but whosoever shall smite thee on the
right cheek turn to him the other also
now this is an interesting piece of
advice and I think there are many
different ways that we can interpret
this it's usually understood as an
exhortation to meekness or as a model
for non-violent action however I'm going
to offer a slightly different
interpretation of this saying that I
believe is actually fairly aligned with
what we might understand about human
psychology
but before I do please remember to Smite

costs you nothing and you can consider
it your good deed for the day so do the

[01:02]
it your good deed for the day so do the
thing
now one of the reasons why turning the
other cheek can be extremely effective
is that it's for the victim not the
aggressor to decide when he has been
harmed
let me explain what I mean let's start
with the idea that there is no such
objective thing as a weapon
a hand can be a tool or it can be a
weapon a word can be a tool or it can be
a weapon a knife can be a tool or it can
be a weapon Etc anything can be a weapon
if it's utilized with a certain
intention which is the intention to
inflict harm
but here's the crazy thing you might
intend to inflict harm on me
but I'm the one who gets to decide
whether I'm actually harmed
on some level you don't know if you've
succeeded in inflicting harm on me until
I wince or cry out or become outraged or

[02:02]
I wince or cry out or become outraged or
otherwise Express in words or actions
that I have in fact been harmed you
don't know until I do that
if someone uses an object with the
intention to inflict harm
and I communicate that I was in fact
harmed
then it's my response that actually
transforms that object into a weapon
and if someone uses an object as a
weapon
but I communicate that I was in fact not
harmed
then my response deweaponizes the object
and that's what turning the other cheek
effectively does it's a way of
communicating that you are not harmed
despite the intention of the others
which literally disarms them
they might still have the object but
they no longer have the weapon
and what does this accomplish well when
someone sees that a certain strategy did
not have the desired outcome

[03:01]
not have the desired outcome
that person is less likely to use that
strategy again in the future
turning the other cheek functionally
puts aggression on an Extinction
Protocol
by robbing it of its reinforcement
mechanism
the satisfaction of its intended purpose
to inflict harm
and this would generally serve to reduce
the frequency of aggression which might
actually do more to create peace on
Earth than a lot of the other things
that people are subject to trying now
there is an important caveat to this
turning the other cheek will actually
disarm a lot of situations however in a
minority of cases it can lead to a sort
of Cool Hand Luke situation that tends
to escalate
the situation by applying more forceful
methods and of course we see just that
in the story of Jesus as well
so the covab here is something like if
you're going to turn the other cheek
be prepared to turn every cheek that you

[04:02]
be prepared to turn every cheek that you
have because there's a chance that the
other person will escalate
that said in the vast majority of cases
once a person sees that their attempt to
inflict harm was unsuccessful by your
non-reactivity and your
non-defensiveness he's going to drop
that weapon and not pick it up again
because it didn't work
and that's because it's for you to
determine what is and is not a weapon by
communicating whether harm has in fact
been inflicted upon you
something to sit with
