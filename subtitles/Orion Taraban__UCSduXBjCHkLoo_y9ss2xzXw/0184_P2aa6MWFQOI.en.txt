i'm dr orion tarabin and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
find your ugly duckling
i did one for the ladies now this one's
for the men hey fellas i'm talking to
you today and i'm going to share with
you what i believe to be an optimal
dating strategy with respect to finding
a suitable female partner
as a guy i know that we're primarily
attracted to physical attributes and you
know what god bless it there's nothing
quite like a beautiful woman right
however this priority can really get a
guy into trouble
now i'm 39 years old and i've dated many
many women in my life including some
that i would consider nines and tens
like internationally gorgeous women
and while this wasn't universally the
case
many of those women
were extremely difficult to be in a
relationship with for a variety of
reasons
one of them we could call a sense of
entitlement
i remember i was once in a relationship
with a woman she was 25 years old at the

[01:00]
with a woman she was 25 years old at the
time and she told me i was the first man
who had ever told her no
can you imagine
what that would do to a person
being an incredibly beautiful woman
is kind of the equivalent of being some
billionaire scion
you just grow up with this extremely
distorted view of life in other people
do you think folks like this typically
have the emotional intelligence let
alone the distress tolerance to enter
into a normal give and take relationship
i mean temper tantrums are not a good
look at any age but they are really ugly
at 25 or 35 for that matter here's
another reason
it's often the case that when women
blossom earlier in life they can receive
the kind of attention and priority that
disincentivizes them from developing
other aspects of themselves their
personality their interests their skills
their career
the kinds of things that make them good
and interesting and lovable and the
kinds of things that make it easier to
have a relationship with them and let me

[02:00]
have a relationship with them and let me
tell you the older i get the more
effortlessness in a relationship matters
to me i have a lot going on
and the woman i'm looking for needs to
be able to seamlessly integrate herself
into that frame the more friction there
is the more the relationship draws time
energy and attention away from the great
things that we both could otherwise be
experiencing you get what i'm saying
so man
my advice to you
is to look for your ugly duckling
this is an allusion to that hans
christian anderson story about a
weird-looking duck who grew up to be a
beautiful swan
some women blossom at different stages
in life
and i've dated some very very attractive
women who didn't really come into their
own into their late 20s or even their
early 30s
i know this because i've i've seen their
pictures and i honestly think they're
better looking today than they were 10
years ago
and these women have all been
significantly easier
and more satisfying to relate to than

[03:02]
and more satisfying to relate to than
the nines and tens they are still plenty
attractive
but they frankly just have more to offer
than their looks
to find an ugly duckling you need to pay
attention to her stories maybe she never
had a boyfriend in high school where she
was reserved in college this can mean
that she was devoting time and energy to
developing herself or some other
character building exercise like
starting a business or caring for a
loved one
it also likely means that she doesn't
take male attention for granted
i get it some of those instagram girls
are total smoke shows however if you're
going after a woman like that get ready
to compete with 10 000 other guys and
now you have the same problem as the
women that are hanging out at the
winner's circle
it's probably not gonna work out and you
could waste a good deal of time energy
and money in the process
your attention will also not be valuable
to one of those women but it might be to
an ugly duckling now

[04:00]
an ugly duckling now
obviously you need to be authentically
attracted to this woman that's the
beautiful swan part of the story but a
late blooming
after a potentially awkward character
development phase can be a very positive
sign for mate selection this kind of
forces her to develop other parts of
herself independent of her looks and it
increases the value of your attention
and relationship
