Men do this all the time in the sexual
marketplace. They make themselves too
available. Would you like to go out on
Monday? I'm busy Monday. Well, how about
Tuesday? I'm busy Tuesday. Well, how
about Wednesday? I'm busy Wednesday. You
see, men show their cards too soon. Wow,
I've never met anyone like you before. I
really like you and I'm willing to
demonstrate that interest with
exceptional gestures that indicate my
desire. And men commit past the point of

of the offer, they have to interview
other applicants. They can't show all
their cards and they've got to put on a
poker face. This is really important.
Most hands in poker are but
every once in a while you get pocket
aces. When you get a good hand, you
can't start jumping up and down in your
chair and pumping your fists. That might
jeopardize your ultimate goal. If you
want to win that pot, you have to put on
your best poker face and sit with your
emotions.
