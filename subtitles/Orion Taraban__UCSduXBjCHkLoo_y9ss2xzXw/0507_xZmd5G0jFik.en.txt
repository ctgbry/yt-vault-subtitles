I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is passport
Bros and international dating so this is
a topic that has come up frequently in
the comments of several of my videos and
it's a topic that I've been requested to
discuss by many people over the last
several months if you're unfamiliar with
the subject passport Bros is the
collective term for a movement among
Western and specifically American men
who are Inc in inly pursuing mating and
dating opportunities abroad these are
guys who are flying to places like South
America and Southeast Asia and the
Middle East in order to access sexual
opportunities that they argue aren't
available in their home country and I'm
going to respond to this phenomenon
through the lens of my recent
experiences spending a month in the
country of
Japan now I'm not very knowledgeable
about this phenomenon but to be honest
there was always something about the
passport Bros movement that felt a

[01:01]
passport Bros movement that felt a
little Sleazy and pathetic Without
Really examining it my perspective was
similar to the prevailing attitude which
was something like this movement was for
guys who were too low status or
unattractive to beat out their intr
seexual competition here they couldn't
get late in the states so they basically
engage in geoarbitrage to leverage a
relative advantage that wouldn't exist
in their home country my attitude was
something like like only guys who
couldn't get what they want from women
here would need to uproot their whole
lives and travel Halfway Around the
World which kind of made these men out
to be conniving beta males that was my
attitude before spending a month in
Japan that is no longer my attitude now
having spent a month in that country I
think I better understand where this
movement might be coming from and I
definitely don't think it's just for
loser men who can't get laid in America

[02:00]
loser men who can't get laid in America
allow me to explain from the perspective
of my interests and preferences the
quality of the women in Japan was
significantly superior to the quality of
the women in the Bay Area like not by a
little by orders of magnitude let me
break down some of the various factors
that go into that statement first of all
the women in Japan are slender and
physically healthy
I spent a month in some of the largest
cities in the world and I must have seen
10 overweight women in that entire time
half of whom were little old ladies and
these overweight women weren't morbidly
obese they were like plump maybe 20 or
30 pounds overweight Max most western
women literally couldn't buy clothes in
Japan the vast majority of Japanese
women are slender and physically fit
which is appealing because it's not only

[03:01]
which is appealing because it's not only
attractive but it indicates a compatible
value as well like I want people who
care about their health second these
women are feminine they wear dresses and
heels and makeup they tend to dress more
conservatively than Western women no
tight clothes no showing a lot of skin
the feminine ideal there seems to be
like softly elegant flowing and modest
and dignified and and these aren't 1950s
Housewives these are women who for the
most part are working professionals they
have modern ideas they are educated and
accomplished but they haven't thrown out
more traditional conceptualizations of
female Beauty this is not something you
can easily find in the west anymore and
you can't find it at all in the Bay Area
at all and I find feminine women very
attractive it resonates with me and
inspires me to be even more masculine

support all right third the women in
Japan are extremely
respectful every woman I interacted with
there was extremely warm and friendly
they were receptive to conversation and
they seemed to enjoy or at least very
effectively pretended to enjoy speaking
with me even more they were solicitous
about my feelings and seemed concerned
that I should enjoy the interaction as
well I didn't experience a single
indiffer

[05:00]
indiffer
or disrespectful word tone or glance
from a woman in a month this made
approaching and talking to women in
Japan a much less fraught experience
than it is in the US the women I spoke
to seem to take pleasure in the
attention and in the dialogue nothing
about the interaction indicated they
were annoyed or offended that I was
interested in talking to them fourth
while a kind of chivalry exists in Japan
it's an inverted version of what we have
here in Japan men come first women come
second it's difficult to appreciate how
deeply the Romantic ideology permeates
our manners until you go to a completely
different culture for instance one day I
was walking towards the main entrance of
a building at pretty much the same time
as a woman my natural instinct was to
get there first and hold the door open
for her however when I did so she
refused to walk through it making a a
show of great embarrassment and I later

[06:02]
show of great embarrassment and I later
realized that in that culture it would
have been embarrassing for her if I had
allowed myself to disrespect myself in
that way for her sake another example
many years ago I spent some weeks in
Japan studying bhau dance in an
immersive program the first night of the
program at the general assembly we heard
a long speech on how the organizers
miscalculated the number of futons they
needed for the students apparent ly
there would not be enough beds for
everyone so the women would have to
sleep on the bare floor without cushions
or sheets until the problem was
rectified now there were a couple other
westerners in the audience and I
remember we were just looking at each
other in disbelief to say we were
shocked would not be an understatement
the idea that the women were going to
sleep on the ground while the men were
going to sleep in the beds felt
completely unnatural to us however our

[07:02]
completely unnatural to us however our
way of doing things is just as unnatural
to Japanese
sensibilities that's starting to change
more and more as Western ideologies
continue to infiltrate Japanese Society
but the important thing here is to
understand that a lot of what many
people believe to be the natural dynamic
between men and women is really very
culturally bounded and culturally
specific and to be honest it felt good
to be honored for being a man like it's
not a bad thing to be a man in Japan in
fact it seems to come with some
privileges that are more commensurate to
the responsibilities that men generally
take on so let's recap on the whole
Japanese women are slender and
physically fit feminine and demure
friendly and courteous and respectful
and appreciative not all Japanese women
I'm sure but the vast majority of them
as far as I could tell when I spoke with

[08:01]
as far as I could tell when I spoke with
them the feeling I got was that they
felt lucky to be interacting with me
which is a total reversal of the
attitude you generally encounter in the
west I've gone on a lot of dates in my
day and the prevailing Vibes were either
a that I should feel lucky that the
woman was allowing me to buy her a drink
or B that the woman needed to make sure
I could give her what she wanted by cond
conducting the date like a job interview
there's a lot of entitlement and
narcissism here it's all about her on
the other hand my sense is that in Japan
women feel grateful for the opportunity
to be there grateful for the opportunity
to be considered as a potential partner
it was extremely refreshing to say the
least now I'm not a fragile guy I'm not
a loser who can't can't get laid I'm not

[09:01]
a loser who can't can't get laid I'm not
poor or low status or
unattractive I'm not a guy without
options I don't need to travel halfway
around the world to have satisfying
relationships with women but I now
understand why it's in men's best
interest to seek out the most
advantageous marketplaces it's like
regardless of whether you're a novice or
a master fisherman if you want to catch
a certain kind of fish it makes sense to
go where there are more of those
fishes high value men who have lots of
sexual opportunity in the west will
still travel to other places where they
can get more of what they want more
easily that's not pathetic that's
rational and efficient even millionaires
don't like paying more than they need to
even though they could afford to do so
and Western women are extremely
expensive men here generally have to pay

[10:00]
expensive men here generally have to pay
more for Less relative to other
marketplaces so I'm much more
sympathetic to this movement after
spending a month abroad what do you
