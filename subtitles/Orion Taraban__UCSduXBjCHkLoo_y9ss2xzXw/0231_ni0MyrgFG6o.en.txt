in my recent episode what men and women
look for in sexual behaviors olga l
commented
if there is something off about the
woman's character and behavior a decent
man will get turned off no matter how
visually attractive she is
and i'm here to tell you that's not
actually true that might be how we think
it should be or how we hope it would be
as was mentioned in one of the comments
to this comment
but that's
running in the face of what we know
about healthy male sexual behavior which
is primarily visually attracted for
better for worse because to be honest
this often gets men into a lot of
trouble
there's also a subtle shaming aspect to
this comment which suggests that if a
man is not turned off by a visually
attractive woman by her behavior or
character that he's somehow not decent
again this is how we might want reality
to be but it's not actually how men
behave because they're able to
compartmentalize behavior and
personality from attractiveness
