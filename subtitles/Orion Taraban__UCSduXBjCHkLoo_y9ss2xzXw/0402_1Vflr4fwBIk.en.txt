[00:00]
presumably
male feminists would be dating female
feminists and in my estimation
female feminists or in anybody of the
post-modernist critical studies ideology
anybody who really buys into it
um is not as well prepared for
relationships as they might otherwise be
and the reason I say that is because if
you buy into
the critical theory feminism you know
the real ideological feminism not
equality not equal not feminism it says
we're all equal not that but the actual
ideological feminism then what you're
practicing over and over and over again
and this has been broken down really
nicely by people like Jonathan I hate
that you're practicing a victim mindset
and you're practicing skills that don't
translate well to a relationship so if
you're dating someone who is a died in
the wool ideological feminist if you're
mandating this woman

[01:00]
mandating this woman
and this woman has been conditioned to
believe that men are her constant
oppressors that she has really gotten
the short end of the stick you'll never
mind the guy across the street that's
building the building and the guy who
takes out her trash and the guy who
maintains her sewer and the guy who
keeps her electricity on never mind
those guys she's been taught that she
has been grossly mistreated by the
patriarchy
well
if you're the closest man guess what's
going to happen she's going to see you
as her oppressor and if you also are
prime to believe that you're her
oppressor this is a horrible footing for
a relationship because you've got
somebody who's way up here being the the
righteous victim and this other person
who's way down here who is the nasty
oppressor and ironically the victim is
oppressing the oppressor and I'm not so
that's one reason is is that men should
really probably avoid dating doctrinaire
feminists um
that you are going to be seen as the
oppressor at some point but another
reason is just the fact that this kind

[02:01]
reason is just the fact that this kind
of ideology
and there are ideologies like this for
men too but this kind of ideology where
I'm rehearsing the the notion that I'm a
victim
well what am I not doing while I'm
rehearsing that what I'm not doing is
learning how to give and take with other
human beings what I'm not doing is
learning how to have a healthy mutually
respectful relationship where we're on
equal footing I'm not practicing any of
that I'm just practicing my Victim
narrative
that's fascinating
I'm in the Bay Area and the Bay Area is
sort of Ground Zero for a lot of this
stuff and I've talked to a number of
women personally who completely believe
that marriage in particular was a
repressive
institution where the women were the
property of the men and
marriage was an instrument of
patriarchal control
and they want to get married

[03:03]
which is very boggling how do how do you
suppose they reconcile that that's my
question to you because it's like I have
yet to encounter
I've encountered many women who
can say pretty much that perspective
verbatim on the institution of marriage
but I have yet to meet one who says I
refuse to get married on ideological
grounds
that just fascinates me
like the woman I'm I'm thinking of who
said almost those exact language she I
was at her wedding like four years ago
I wonder if her husband so she's she's
dying to enter this patriarchal
oppressive Institution
it doesn't make sense to me
no
well I guess one possibility is that
maybe she doesn't really believe it's
that patriarchal and oppressive
because if she actually thought she was

[04:01]
because if she actually thought she was
entering into bondage and I don't know
would she do it seems unlikely seems
unlikely to me too let's let's take
another attack
um which is have you are you familiar
with the old Greek play list Estrada
no man I went to public school tell me
about it tell me about Alyssa Estrada
Alyssa strata I think it was written by
Aristophanes he was a uh he wrote some
comedies back in the day and this is a
very readable play
you know for ancient Greek Theater
and in summary the plot is that there's
a bunch of guys who are just interested
in going to war they're out all day
they're practicing their military
exercises they're always going out on
campaigns they're just thinking about
the next like thing that they can
conquer
and the women are pissed off because
they're just sort of left at home with
the kids they miss their husbands they
don't want to be in a state of Perpetual
conflict

[05:00]
conflict
what's that
can I ask a question are are they angry
because they want to go to war are they
angry because their men are gone and
they want their men home they want the
men at home and I I think it's from a
perspective of like I miss my husband
my husband should be spending time with
me and the family at home instead of
running around with his guy friends and
trying to kill and Conquer that's that's
the perspective
okay and so the the women get together
and they sort of devise a plan
and the plan is that
and and they had to like swear a Blood
Oath because if anyone broke it the
entire strategy would fall apart and the
strategy was
no woman would have sex with her husband
until the husbands decided to stop the
current War
and that happens in like act one and the
next like three acts are like
at first the men sort of like laugh it

[06:00]
at first the men sort of like laugh it
off haha yeah that woman will be running
back to me and my little man in a in a
week or two and that doesn't happen and
then you know the Men start to like
Weedle down certain women to try to
create some divisiveness in the group
and that doesn't work either and then
the men get angry and then the Men start
to plead and then the men eventually
agree and there's a victory and the men
decide yes this war was stupid women are
right we're gonna come home and uh the
women all their husbands so it's a
really interesting story
and I've experienced something akin to
Lisa strata while dating into the bay
area I have certainly met and dated
women who very explicitly
withheld sex or refused to date me
because I didn't agree completely with
their ideological perspectives
have you encountered that Sean

[07:02]
have you encountered that Sean
well I'm an old Mary guy but I've yeah
I've certainly heard it yeah
and it's easy for me to say from where I
sit because I have a good relationship a
great marriage with a wonderful woman
but you know my
armchair assessment is good you know
make room for somebody to actually
appreciates you see that's for sure no
real love lost there I I I'm thinking in
particular of one woman who worked as a
librarian she works in the library
system and I have thousands of books I'm
an Avid Reader but she came over to my
house and she saw that most of my
authors were male
and she said she couldn't date me
anymore because I didn't read more
female authors than male authors my
rebuttal is I generally read more female
authors than people read authors because
I read so much
but it didn't make sense to me to choose
books that I was going to spend time
reading simply because of the gender of
the author I was going to read things

[08:00]
the author I was going to read things
that were interesting to me because you
know it's my time and I should be able
to follow my own interests
um and not according to her not
according to her but I think she felt
very
um justified in doing that because I
think there is a strain of feminist
thought that says
that kind of has that list Estrada
approach which is we can't reinforce
men's disagreement with these ideologies
and the easiest way to not reinforce
that is to not have sex with them to not
date them to not give them opportunities
for dating and mating
yeah the the flaw in their reasoning is
that they're not in a small Society like
in the play they're in a big Society
where a lot of women vote for
conservatives
um so they're competing with the women
who actually appreciate men who have you
know who aren't apologetic about their
masculinity
