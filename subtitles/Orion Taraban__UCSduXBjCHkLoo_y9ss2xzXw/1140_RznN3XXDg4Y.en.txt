I do a lot of conversations with
successful guys these days and a lot of
them tell me that they're concerned that
women are only interested in them for
their money. By the same token, I've
talked to a lot of very attractive women
who are concerned that men are only
interested in them as sexual objects.
And I usually tell these people that
this is an excellent problem to have.
Why? Well, because for at least some of
these people, their wealth or their
beauty is the only reason someone might
date them. Which is to say, in the
absence of that reason, they might be
hardressed to find anyone to spend time
with them. So, at least they have that.
However, this is an excellent problem
for another reason. Namely, sex is
phenomenal bait for men and money is
exceptional bait for women. You put the
bait in the right water and you're going
to have a feeding frenzy. Now, you might
not like all the fish that bite that
bait, but that's a much better problem
than having a bait that no fish will
bite. You have a problem that's much

bite. You have a problem that's much
further down funnel than most people,
especially most men who aren't getting
any bites whatsoever.
