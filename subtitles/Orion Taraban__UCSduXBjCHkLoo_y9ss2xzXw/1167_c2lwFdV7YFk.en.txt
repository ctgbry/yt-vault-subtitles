I heard this quote from Tim Ferris which
is fantastic. He said um running a
business is a personal growth strategy
masquerading as a vehicle for
accumulating wealth that by doing things
out there in the world, you learn so
much about yourself because you crash up
against your inefficiencies and your
self-doubt and your challenges with
other people and your fears and your
anxieties. And it's like it's more like
running on a treadmill than running on a
road because the treadmill is continuing
to move at a pace and you go I I can't
slow down. I need to keep this business
going as opposed to being like ah you

bit hard today. Maybe it was easy. No
one knows like it's you don't have an
external counter of that. But when it
comes to running a business or just
testing yourself out there in the world
up against other people you do. That's
why I think one of the best little psych
hacks that a person can have is to
choose whatever happens to them. This
was something that the Stoics talked
about. They delineated everything in
terms of what was within my locus of
control and what was outside of the
locus of control. And the vast majority

develop towards these things is
indifference. And to choose it like
Epictitus talked about how if Zeus wants
me to be sick, then I want to be sick as
well. I want what fate has in store for
me. And by choosing it, you take some
degree of psychological control over it
and you can kind of wrestle with it. You
say that there's something in here that
can better me. There's something in here
that I want in almost like a masochistic
way. Like I can take this, I can
struggle with this and come out
potentially reborn on the other side of
it. Like that's of indomitable mental
