this is true of anyone men and women to
do your job really well you have to
allow yourself to be used there is no
way around it if you don't allow your
employer or your customers to use you to
use your time or your service or your
expertise then you cannot expect to get
what you want from them a highly skilled
worker who does not allow herself to be
used is useless and useless things
typically aren't very valuable the
potential doesn't count for anything the
fact that you could if you wanted to is
meaningless if you don't and it's
usually the case that you have to allow
yourself to be used in advance of
getting what you want kind of like how
you have to work two weeks before you
receive a paycheck and this means that
there's always a chance that you'll put
in the effort and not get what you want
after all no one really likes this like
everybody men and women would just
prefer to be given what they wanted and
everybody men and women are acutely
aware of the possibility that they won't
get what they hope to receive
