[00:00]
I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych
hacks Better Living Through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to see God if you don't believe
so this is something of an ambitious
topic I want to begin by saying that
there are many different paths to seeing
God and that this might be one of them
now this talk is explicitly directed
towards those folks who are agnostic or
atheistic my understanding of these
folks is that they look around and they
don't see any proof that God exists and
consequently they find it very difficult
to believe in something that they can't
see or experience themselves and it's
like fair enough without an experiential
relationship or without any empirical
evidence God really does seem like a
fairy tale
like it's a make-believe idea that I
don't know Comforts deluded people who
may not have the strength to confront
reality on their own terms
possibly

[01:00]
possibly
but today I'm going to help these folks
approach
the idea of God and I'm going to do this
by taking a roundabout route we're going
to leave the issue of whether God exists
to the side for now and spend some time
on a seemingly completely unrelated
topic namely the issue of whether
you exist
and I don't mean you the man or woman
that other people can plainly see I mean
you the self that you experience
yourself to be
the thought experiment goes something
like this imagine you're visited by an
alien from another planet this entity
doesn't know what Earth is or who people
are to this entity you are clearly alive
like a tiger or a monkey or a whale is
alive but the entity doesn't see you as
well you

[02:00]
well you
how would you prove to this entity that
the self that you experience yourself to
be exists
as we'll see it's actually going to be
pretty difficult
and to play out this thought experiment
all play the part of the entity
you might be dismissive at first like
what are you talking about Orion I'm
right here in front of you you can
plainly see me of course I exist and I
The Entity might counter well I see a
human animal and organic organism
comprised of tissues and cells but I
don't see a self anywhere in which part
of you is yourself located when I look
at your organs I see only tissues when I
look at your tissues I see only cells
when I look at your cells I see only
molecules when I observe your processes
I see only chemical reactions and
electric impulses
when I scan you with x-rays and high
frequency magnets and electrodes I see
nothing that I can identify as a self in

[03:03]
nothing that I can identify as a self in
any part of your physical substrate or
in any process contained therein
and you might argue something like well
what about my DNA sequence huh that's
uniquely me and I would counter yes that
is unique but your DNA is not you in any
meaningful sense of that word like can
your DNA tell me that you love true
crime documentaries or that you have
unresolved feelings for your ex or that
you cry more than more when you're happy
than when you're sad you don't even know
what your DNA sequence is and you
certainly don't relate to yourself like
an inanimate string of amino acids
and then you might say something like
well I'm talking to you right now
and I'm clearly making purposeful
communication who else could be doing
that if not me
and I might counter well you are clearly
making sounds but I'm from another
planet
this sounds like the clicking of

[04:00]
this sounds like the clicking of
Dolphins or the chirping of birds to me
your communication could just be the
instinctual response to stimuli birds
chirp because they're Birds after all
not because there is a little bird self
inside them that loves to sing
and then you might say well come on look
I have an ID I've got a birth
certificate I've got a social security
number you can see it right here that's
my name other people clearly see that I
exist what's wrong with you
but I would argue that those are all
scriptural arguments written by people
who already believe that you existed
they are hardly trustworthy sources
because they already see you as a self
for some reason and that's what
motivated them to issue those documents
and this can go on and on the fact is
that there's actually no empirical
evidence you could give that would prove
that you exist as the self that you
experience yourself to be

[05:00]
experience yourself to be
and that's what make this makes this
argument so frustrating like we would be
appalled and horrified if someone denied
our selfhood but the fact of the matter
is that I can't see yourself
I can't feel yourself and I can't
experience yourself
I just kind of assumed that you have a
self because I have an experience of
but of course a non-human entity might
not have a human experience of a self
and so may not assume that one exists in
US

me in proportion to the value you feel
you derived from this episode I really
appreciate your support
but now let's keep going

[06:00]
but now let's keep going
now if I The Entity were to come down
from outer space to observe humans the
way we might observe ants or cranes or
mackerel then over time I would likely
become increasingly puzzled
and that's because I would begin to
notice that despite being nearly
genetically identical despite being in
many respects phenotypically
indistinguishable
certain individual humans behaved in
meaningfully different ways
and if I were to observe these
individual humans over time then certain
patterns to that behavior would start to
emerge
and it would probably be very difficult
to explain these patterns like huh
that's odd this individual human likes
to Walk Alone by the water
but this individual human likes to spend
time in crowded places with loud
modulated sound frequencies and this

[07:00]
modulated sound frequencies and this
individual human spends hours staring at
thin strips of processed pulp covered in
lines of dried ink and if I open them up
or run them through a scan or examine
their genetic sequences I wouldn't find
anything that would reliably predict or
explain those patterns of behavior it
would just seem kind of random and
mysterious
however
if I were to posit the existence of an
abstraction like say personality
that I could not directly observe but if
I were to assume its existence would
explain my observations then suddenly
all that chaos and Randomness would snap
into order like oh this person walks
alone by the water because he's an
introvert and this human spends time in
crowded places because she is sociable
and this person stares at ink because
he's an intellectual everything starts
to make sense

[08:00]
to make sense
keep in mind that there is no empirical
thing as introversion or sociability or
intellectualism
and keep in mind that these abstractions
were circularly defined by the effects
they are purportedly imputed to cause
notwithstanding we accept the concept of
Personality because it's incredibly
useful for a number of reasons in the
first place it makes otherwise
inexplicable and chaotic Behavior
ordered and meaningful and this makes
interacting with these individuals
significantly easier because among other
things you can increasingly predict
their future Behavior
and it's these patterns of being say
that you tend to like scary movies or
that you commonly have trouble falling
asleep because you're worrying about the
future or you generally give people the
benefit of the doubt
it's these patterns of beings that

[09:00]
it's these patterns of beings that
largely constitute your own experience
of yourself
so does personality exist
well we could argue that there is
absolutely no empirical evidence to
support the idea that it does and that
it is only a mental construct that we
invented to make sense of the observable
behavior of others
but we could also argue that due to its
consistency and predictive ability it
would be really weird if it didn't
great
now let's revisit the question of the
existence of God
obviously there is nothing that you can
see or touch that you can point to and
say that's God just like you can't point
to a cell or a bile duct or a toenail
and say that's me
God is not a tree or a mountain or a
Galaxy
and God definitely doesn't show up on
any of our empirical instrumentation but

[10:01]
any of our empirical instrumentation but
again neither do you God doesn't appear
on an MRI any more than you do
and God can't even be reliably
identified from processes what one
person views as intentional
communication like speech or intelligent
design another person might consider the
dumb unfolding of mechanistic laws like
the chirping of birds or evolution
and we certainly can't prove God's
existence from scriptural evidence that
was written by people who already
believe just like you can't demonstrate
that you have a self just because you
have a driver's license
and without God the universe seems
chaotic unpredictable and random just
like humans seemed before we posited the
existence of personality in our thought
experiment
however as soon as we begin to recognize
the existence of stable patterns and
there are obviously stable patterns in
the observable universe just as there

[11:01]
the observable universe just as there
are stable patterns in individual
Behavior
we can consider the possibility that an
unobservable and potentially
non-empirical entity is responsible for
generating the patterns that we see
like self or God
and we can also conclude that on the
balance of probability it is far more
plausible that the assumed self exists
then doesn't exist due to its consistent
predictive power
like without the concept of I explaining
why anyone did anything would be a
futile and frustrating exercise
these Concepts bring order to an
otherwise chaotic profusion of
phenomenon and they allow us to interact
with other people in the universe in
meaningful ways now is God these
patterns or even the sum total of these
patterns in the observable universe no

[12:02]
patterns in the observable universe no
because there is no pattern that can
contain the pattern maker just like the
sum total of all your personality
components is not you
the sum total of say all the laws of
physics is not God
being an introvert or more to the point
being an introvert and an intellectual
and a masochist and an idealist and odd
infinitum
cannot possibly contain the totality of
yourself which like a limit in calculus
infinitely recedes
so the existence of an abstraction like
self or God always requires a leap into
the infinite which since it cannot
really be comprehended by the human mind
is essentially an Act of Faith
it is an act of faith for me to believe
that you exist
in the same way that it is an act of
faith for me to believe that I exist

[13:03]
faith for me to believe that I exist
or that God exists
and though the data clearly Trend in
that direction we actually can't arrive
at that destination on a bridge of
empiricism it requires a leap that can
never be substantiated
but I would argue the payoffs are well
worth it
so we see that the question of the
existence of God is actually very
intimately related to the question of
the existence of yourself it's
interesting
the same arguments can be used to prove
and disprove both entities and just like
once you see yourself you cannot ever
unsee it on some level once you see God
you can never unsee it
indeed once seen both seem the plainest
facts of existence in no small part
because you realize that you had been

[14:02]
because you realize that you had been
looking right at them the entire time
