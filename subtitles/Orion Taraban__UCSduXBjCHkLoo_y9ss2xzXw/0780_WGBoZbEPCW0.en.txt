my point is that one way to become a
better person is to become more
prosperous this is not something I've
heard anyone else talk about the
connection between abundance and
altruistic behavior that is it's very
likely the case that you will be able to
help others more if you can orchestrate
your life so that you have more spare
time and some discretionary income and
most importantly some peace of mind this
is true for everyone but it's especially
true for anyone who wants to join a
helping profession you can't really help
anyone else as long as your head is full
of your own problems you need to sort
through your own emotional baggage first
the reason why most people are bad
friends or Partners is not because
they're evil but because they are still
so preoccupied with their own
that they literally do not have space
for anyone else's problems in their life
they'll likely become irritable and push
back on anyone who comes to them for
help in a maladaptive attempt to protect
what little bandwidth they still have
left
