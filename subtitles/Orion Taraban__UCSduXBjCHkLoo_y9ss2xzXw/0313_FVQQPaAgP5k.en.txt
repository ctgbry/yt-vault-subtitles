I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why
people get married when they do
I think this is going to be a really
interesting episode as the answer to
this question is not only elegant but
it's substantiated across several
independent Frameworks as well
now I'm going to be building on the data
that I presented in my previous episode
Peak sexual Marketplace value in which
we looked at desirability indices in
heterosexual couplings on a dating app
check out that episode for more
information
one of the many results of that study
was that according to men women are most
desirable at 18 years old and according
to women men are most desirable at 50
years old this was a conclusion
corroborated by millions of private
Anonymous data points however as
surprising as this might be there's an
even more fascinating conclusion that
can be drawn from the data this wasn't
talked about in the paper this is my own
Theory but I think it checks out and we

[01:02]
Theory but I think it checks out and we
can always test it out as we'll see
later in the episode now before I
explain what this theory is please

all right back to the study according to
the researchers women's desirability
starts really high right at 18. and
while it sort of Falls precipitously
over the lifespan it also kind of takes
a while to do that
most significantly average female
desirability remains higher than average
male desirability for quite some time
the researchers in this study plotted
the desirability in the Seas of men and
women on two separate charts they
basically
look like this
this is the women's this is the man's

[02:01]
this is the women's this is the man's
you can see the women start high and
fall the women's The Men start low
and get higher
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
overlay these charts as if they were on
the same y-axis which plots desirability
and here's what that would look like
okay now where do the two lines cross
well as you can see they cross right
about here
right about here at
30 years old
so
who cares
well you could argue that this is pretty
much the most significant event that has
happened to the participants in the
sexual Marketplace up until that point
in their lives think about it this point
marks the moment when the average
woman's desirability her normalized
sexual Marketplace value drops below the

[03:01]
sexual Marketplace value drops below the
average man's desirability his
normalized sexual Marketplace value for
the very first time
from that point on a woman's
desirability is a depreciating asset and
a man's desirability is an appreciating
asset not just absolutely which was
apparently always the case but
relatively and that has to impact the
way men and women relate to each other
those of you who have made it this far
already know the dating game changes
significantly after 30. and this might
be why potentially for the very first
time in their lives the man might be
considered more desirable than the woman
and that's got to create some changes in
the dynamic between men and women don't
you think
now what also happens around the age of
30. well according to the U.S census in
2021 the median age for women at first

[04:00]
2021 the median age for women at first
marriage was 29. in the median age for
men at first marriage was 30 or to put
it another way marriage typically occurs
at the last moment that women enjoy a
superiority over men in terms of average
desirability
isn't that interesting
and why might that be well to the extent
that I'm correct marriage occurs at this
time because it's clearly in the woman's
best interest to do so
from a pure Game Theory perspective it's
one of the most optimal moves a woman
can make in the sexual Marketplace think
about it the longer he lives the more
desirable the man becomes on average
whereas the opposite is true for women
given that the same woman may not be
able to secure commitment from the same
man in even a few years time
securing a lifetime commitment while the
desirability Gap still favors her is

[05:01]
desirability Gap still favors her is
clearly in the woman's best interests
and it will become as it will become
increasingly harder for her to do so
with men of comparable quality as time
goes on
and to the extent that she is more
desirable
the woman would still have more power in
the relationship to dictate more
favorable terms for herself
couple this with the fact that the man
may as yet be naive to the Privileges
that come from a favorable desirability
Gap and you have a recipe for settling
down
this is why I say that all women play
Blackjack
they want to get as close to 21 the bus
card as they can without going over
and while it's not true that women are
out of the game at 30
when the desirability gap between men
and women switches it does seem true
that the average woman will be fighting
an uphill battle from there on out
so it would make sense to stand as close

[06:02]
so it would make sense to stand as close
to that point as possible this is not
only rational it's very very very smart
now this is just a theory but we can
also test it out to the extent that this
is true there are two falsifiable
predictions that we can make to test
this hypothesis in the first place we
can predict that if similar studies were
conducted in different cultures women's
age at first marriage will occur right
before the age at which the desirability
Gap switches and in the second place we
can predict that in no culture will the
woman's age at first marriage exceed the
age at which the desirability gaps which
occurs so if you want to prove me wrong
don't yell at me or give me anecdotal
evidence just find the data that's how
you can do it
so that's my theory as to why people get
married when they do if a woman
perceives that her desirability is
likely to soon fall below a man's

[07:01]
likely to soon fall below a man's
desirability the decision to push for
commitment at that time is entirely
rational and in her best interests so
this can't just be a coincidence
and people say women are the irrational
sex if that were true this is not what
the data would look like
what do you think please let me know in
