I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is Love Like
the Sun
love is a very misunderstood word this
is because we have one word to describe
many different experiences and phenomena
and in my opinion the word Love is
misapplied in the vast majority of cases
as discussed in a previous episode love
has nothing to do with relationships
relationships are the medium through
which value is transacted and love is
invaluable it can't be bought at any
price therefore it has nothing to do
with relationships this is why you don't
need love to have a relationship and you
also don't need a relationship in order
to love but you do need a relationship
in order to get other things that do
have transactable value
in today's episode I'm going to be
talking about how to love
my model for how to love is the sun I'm
not there yet but one day I hope to be

[01:00]
not there yet but one day I hope to be
able to love like the sun let's unpack
what that means it's impossible to
overstate the importance of the sun it's
not an exaggeration to say that the sun
is responsible for maintaining Life as
We Know It On This Planet if the sun
were to stop shining or were to
otherwise disappear life would face an
irreversible collapse within a matter of
hours we need the sun more than we can
possibly acknowledge or could ever repay
and that's why it's such a blessing that
the sun shines as a gift
since a gift is given through the
spontaneous generosity of The Giver
without any strings attached there's no
need to repay it
the sun doesn't shine because it expects
anything in return which is fantastic
because how could we possibly recompense
the sun if we were in its debt the same
is true of love love is a gift given
through the spontaneous generosity of
The Giver without any strings attached
it doesn't expect anything in return

[02:01]
it doesn't expect anything in return
because there is no need to repay it and
this is because love like sunlight is
invaluable it cannot be bought at any
price so it's best to make a gift out of
it do you understand
now the sun doesn't Grumble when some of
its Rays fall on people who are
ungrateful another hot sunny day this is
getting insufferable
like the sun is kind of indifferent to
how its light is received and this
indifference allows it to shine on
everyone equally it doesn't save its
light for the people who like it or
appreciate it or praise it or reward it
it kind of doesn't even notice where its
light is going it just sort of radiates
its goodness and it does this not
because it expects anything in return
which again is great because how could
we pay back the Sun but because that's
just who the Sun is
it's in the sun's nature to shine like

[03:00]
it's in the sun's nature to shine like
it can't not shine it can't not radiate
light and warmth it's an expression of
its being and it would go against its
nature to dim that light or suffocate
that warmth or dull either out partially
when practiced correctly love like light
is abundant and impartial
the sun like the true lover isn't
bothered when he isn't sufficiently
praised or acknowledged or respected
because again it's not shining for any
of these things it's shining because
it's a [ __ ] star
in it's in a star's nature to shine do
you understand
now the most essential attribute of the
Sun from a spiritual perspective is its
humility
it is by far the most important
component of the solar system and its
functionally responsible for maintaining
all life on this Earth it has every
right to be a tyrant

[04:01]
right to be a tyrant
to demand praise and sacrifice and
respect and appreciation
but what we see is the exact opposite
a humility bordering paradoxically on
invisibility
if we actually had to acknowledge our
dependence on the sun and appropriately
express our gratitude we would have to
spend our entire lives just singing its
Praises we wouldn't be able to serve
others or watch baseball games or read
books or cook souffles or take naps or
really do any of the thousands of things
that human beings love to do
this is the sun's invisibility it's
strange to think about it since it
radiates light and kind of makes all
visibility possible
but just try to look at the Sun for more
than a few seconds your vision will
start to go black you won't be able to
see it so its Radiance is actually its
modesty and its humility
and since we literally can't see the sun

[05:01]
and since we literally can't see the sun
since we can't be in a direct
relationship with it we're functionally
forced to kind of go about our business
as if it didn't exist while benefiting
immensely from its light and warmth
and you know what that doesn't bother
the Sun
the sun's humility is Manifest in its
being the most exalted feature of our
world while expecting nothing in return
and experiencing satisfaction in its own
invisibility as we go about our happy
little lives
that's love

and I really appreciate your support
thank you

[06:00]
thank you
now the closest approximation that we
have to this feeling
is the satisfaction that some parents
feel when they watch their children
playing a little in the distance
if they got any closer they would
interfere with the play and disrupt the
moment so they are content to remain
invisible and that's because love only
seeks after the benefit of the other and
thinks nothing of itself it's the
humiliated self-exultant
these parents are just happy that there
is a safe place for those children to
run and jump and sing and laugh
they don't mind that their children
aren't reciprocating comparable value or
expressing their gratitude or respecting
their Authority and that's because these
things actually aren't nearly as
satisfying and precious as witnessing a
happiness that believes itself to be
unobserved
and that's why the highest response to
love is not praise or appreciation or
even gratitude

[07:01]
even gratitude
it's Joy
and it's love that makes Joy possible
loving like the sun also means loving
abundantly love doesn't keep score or
worry that it's being cheated or being
taken advantage of even if someone were
to use or to steal some of the Sun's
light how is the sun possibly diminished
remember love is not transactional which
makes it unconditional our time energy
and money might be limited but love is
not in fact it's actually possible to
tap into the source of love and
experience it like the sun as a
functionally inexhaustible resource
there is no scarcity here because love
is abundant and inexhaustible
now if you're not getting what you want
from a relationship for whatever reason
then just move on
love wouldn't want you to suffer
needlessly out of a misguided sense of
Duty
that's a form of projected spite born
out of your own unhealed disappointments

[08:02]
out of your own unhealed disappointments
and if you feel betrayed or
unappreciated or unreciprocated then
just let go and find someone else
and there's no need to get upset you can
do this with love remember love is an
adverb it's a quality of action you can
say no thank you it's time for me to
move on with as much love as you can say
yeah let's continue to walk together for
a while
and this is especially important because
you can only really let go of someone in
love anger is a clenched fist it holds
on tight and won't let go love on the
other hand is an open hand or more to
the point of this episode broad daylight
it allows things to come and go in their
own time
the idea is to approach love in the
spirit of abundance abundance doesn't
tally up the bill abundance doesn't keep
score it's the nature of abundance to be
generous and it gives not because it
expects anything in return but because

[09:00]
expects anything in return but because
it kind of can't hold itself back the
sun doesn't feel cheated because its
gifts aren't returned in kind it doesn't
even really notice what we're doing with
its light and warmth it's too busy
radiating its refugence
again if you're not getting what you
want from a relationship just move on
and continue to shine when someone says
yes shine when someone says no shine
impartially and with indifference to
outcome
do this and you'll find it's a pathway
to spiritual Evolution because the more
you do this the more you'll discover
that you are the one that you've been
looking for
you don't get love you merely increase
your capacity to express it and it's in
the expression of love that you feel it
when people say that they feel love what
they're really feeling is their own love
leaving them
that's actually true of all emotions so
to get more love you actually have to

[10:00]
to get more love you actually have to
become more loving
and this is how you do that
