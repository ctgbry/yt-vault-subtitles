I'm Dr O'Brien taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is who has
more power in a relationship
power can be a touchy subject for folks
many people would prefer it didn't exist
at all which is just another way of
wishing that power imbalances didn't
exist in relationships however power is
a fact of life and that's not
necessarily a bad thing as without power
nothing would ever get done
now it would be far too simplistic to
argue that men have more power in
relationships or that women have more
power in relationships because the fact
of the matter is that it can go either
way and that's because it really depends
on the specific individuals involved
however I have three easy rules of thumb
that you can use to determine who has
more power in any given relationship
let's get right to it

[01:00]
let's get right to it
first a working definition of power very
simply power is the ability to get other
people to act in the service of your
goals
think about it the most powerful people
in the world do nothing for themselves
they have Cooks to cook for them
bodyguards to protect them agents to
represent them employees to work for
them they have the ability to make other
people move
that's power
so here's my first rule of thumb if you
want to know who has the most power in a
relationship or family system all you
have to do is observe who moves the
least
for instance in many families the infant
is the most powerful person in the
system you can't reason with it you
can't argue with it you can barely even
communicate with it it just lies there
and cries so everyone else has to move
to accommodate it it is pure emotion and
emotion is a form of power

[02:01]
emotion is a form of power
in fact being so emotional that you can
neither be consoled or reasoned with is
a strategy that many adults today have
failed to outgrow but we shouldn't
necessarily be surprised by that since
no one surrenders power unless they
absolutely have to in any case the
person who does less is usually more
powerful than the person who does more
but before I go any further if you're

consider sending this video to someone

Word of Mouth referrals like this that

you can also hit the super thanks button
and tip me in proportion to the value
you feel you derived from this video I
really appreciate your support
now here's another way to consider the
question
just like two people cannot like each
other exactly the same amount
which asymmetry gives rise to the

[03:00]
which asymmetry gives rise to the
balance of Attraction two people cannot
be committed to a relationship exactly
the same amount this is a hard fact of
life and a bitter pill to swallow we see
this everywhere but we would prefer not
to see it for instance you may not be
your best friends best friend
and your employer may not need you as
much as you need your employer
if you want to know who has more power
in a relationship you simply need to
consider who is less committed
than the other
I wish this weren't the case but it's
true
an easy way to tell who is less
committed than the other in any
relationship is to observe who issues
ultimatums to whom
a few weeks ago I met up with Logan Yuri
author of how not to die alone she's a
lovely person and I had a fantastic
conversation with her at one point in
the discussion we were talking about
marriage and she said to me behind every

[04:02]
marriage and she said to me behind every
proposal is an ultimatum
and we both laughed because I think we
could both acknowledge the truth in that
statement
now the point of an ultimatum is to
apply emotional pressure on the other
person to motivate behavior in
compliance with your agenda
so it's powerful in the sense of my
working definition of power getting
other people to act in the service of
your goals and it does this by forcing
the other person to move rule of thumb
one while simultaneously expressing low
commitment for the relationship rule of
thumb two
ultimatums require favorable power
imbalances this is why you never see
ultimatums among equals like could you
imagine if your buddy gave you an
ultimatum like hey man either we're
gonna hang out three nights a week and
drink beers or we are done because you

[05:00]
drink beers or we are done because you
are wasting my time like a real friend
would step up and know how to treat a
friend like how well would that go over
you'd probably think who the hell does
this person think he is
and you would never see ultimatums from
the less powerful party like imagine an
unarmed man demanding a group of
soldiers lay down their weapons or else
the soldiers would just laugh at him
ultimatums only work from the top down
and this leads me to my third rule of
thumb
in any given relationship if you want to
know who has more power just consider
who has more options than the other
if your employer has 10 other people
lined up for your job who might be
easier to work with then he's probably
not going to be very responsive to your
concerns or demands by the same token if
you are being actively recruited by a
dozen different companies you're
probably not going to do anything you

[06:00]
probably not going to do anything you
don't want at your current employment
optionality is power now the way
optionality is cultivated in the game of
romantic relationships differs between
men and women due to the fact that men
and women are selecting for different
things however in both cases the key
component is visibility
the way that women typically maintain
optionality is by being visibly
attractive no matter what she says the
real reason she's not giving up her
Instagram account with a hundred
thousand followers
is this it's a daily and visible
reminder to all involved that thousands
of men find her attractive
she may never step out of the
relationship but surrendering that
account would significantly diminish
your optionality which is a form of
power and power as previously noted is
never surrendered unless absolutely
necessary
on the other hand the way men typically
maintain optionality is by being visibly

[07:00]
maintain optionality is by being visibly
competent
this is part of the reason why women
find men in uniforms of all kind to be
so attractive the uniforms signify their
owner's particular skill and competence
to the world it's also why performing
artists like actors and musicians
generally have no trouble finding
willing Partners the cheering and
Applause they receive while they are up
on stage is more than enough social
proof of their competence and
desirability
so if a man is neither a performer nor a
uniformed professional it behooves him
to find some other stage whereupon he
can be visibly competent to improve his
optionality
so there you have it who has more power
in a relationship the answer is it
depends however you can potentially
answer that question in your own case by
observing who moves the least
who is less committed and who has more
options
on the balance of things these will

[08:01]
on the balance of things these will
indicate who is more powerful in any
given relationship
