I'm Dr Orion taraband and this is
psychack's Better Living Through
psychology and the topic of today's
short talk is dating is an extended
hiring process that's right dating is an
extended hiring process this is
important for both men and women to
understand as this will functionally
flip the script about what most people
believe is happening on a date among
other things this understanding should
help men assume greater confidence in
their role in the courtship process and
it should help women increase their
chances of actually getting what they
want sounds good right let's get to it
to begin with I want you to appreciate
the rather striking fact that to the
best of my knowledge there has never
been a culture
anywhere on Earth at any time in human
history that recognize the institution
of marriage and that expected the woman
to propose to the man
pretty wild huh
folks could argue that this was due to
the corruption of an oppressive

[01:00]
the corruption of an oppressive
patriarchy that robbed women of their
agency and choice however here we are
today with all of our enlightened views
on gender and Power in a day and age
when many young women are outperforming
young men and the expectation is still
that the man proposed to the woman
what does this mean
well it means that on a very fundamental
level
it is the man who offers a place in his
life to the woman not the other way
around
it is not the woman who offers a place
in her life to a man it is the man who
offers a place in his life to a woman
and since what is true about business is
generally true about relationships I'm
going to help you understand the
consequences of this fact through the
lens of the professional world
if we do so we can approach dating like
an extended hiring process in a hiring
process the power Dynamic is
asymmetrical
though both parties need to consent to
to do business with each other the one

[02:00]
to do business with each other the one
in a position to offer a job is always
more powerful than the one in a position
to accept it
so if men are ultimately expected to
offer a place in their lives to women
then they are in a position of an
employer with all the Privileges and
responsibilities that come with that
position
and if women are waiting for the
invitation to join the men then they are
in the position of employees with all
the Privileges and responsibilities that
come with that position one position is
not necessarily better than the other
just ask most employees who have been
promoted to upper management when they
were happiest with their work
but both come with prerogatives unique
to each
deep appreciation of this reality should
cause an adjustment in modern dating
behaviors in the first place it should
make men more confident because they are
acting from a position of power just
like I'm the CEO of Orion Corp I would
like you to consider that you are the

[03:01]
like you to consider that you are the
CEO of ucorp you are the one who
executes your lifestyle and this is both
a privilege and a responsibility just
like you cannot hire somebody if you
don't yet have an established company
you can't bring a woman into your life
if you don't yet have an established
lifestyle
extrapolating that lifestyle will take
time energy and money and this generally
needs to be accomplished before the
courtship can be started in Earnest the
Silver Lining is that since you are
taking the trouble to build the company
from the ground up it should be custom
tailored to your preferences and
specifications
now before I go any further if you're
liking what you're uh you're hearing
then please consider sending this video
to someone who might benefit from its
message because it's Word of Mouth
referrals like this that really help to
make the channel grow and you can also
hit the super thanks button that's the
three little dots in the lower right
hand corner and tip me in proportion to
the value that you feel that you've
derived from this episode

[04:01]
derived from this episode
thank you for your support makes all
this happen
so let's assume men that you've
completed this task you've gone through
the process of establishing your
lifestyle so you now have something into
which you can invite a woman
good
what happens next well when a company
wants to hire someone what does it do
put out a vague we're hiring notice
interview a host of random people and
then take the one with the prettiest
resume
of course not but that's more or less
what men do with respect to dating they
only have an obscure sense of what they
actually want a woman for date anyone
who will go out with them and then try
to lock down the prettiest one
and how's that working out for you Gents
so what do companies actually do well
well before they interview their very
first applicant they clearly define the
role for which they are hiring companies
hire a creative director or an executive
assistant or a senior researcher or an

[05:01]
assistant or a senior researcher or an
independent contributor Etc irrespective
of the details they hire for a specific
role
and that means they need to First
clarify the expectations for that role
they think what are the responsibilities
that we can reasonably expect this
person to discharge and what are the
compensations appropriate for the
successful dischargement of those
responsibilities
so man before you enter the sexual
Marketplace I'd like you to consider
what do you actually want a woman for
what role do you want her to play in
your life
and what are the Privileges and
responsibilities associated with that
role remember you're going to be
inviting her into your life so it's
important for you to consider where
exactly she's going to go and what
exactly she's going to be doing there
you want a mother for your children you
can hire for that position
you want an easy going Playmate you can
hire for that position
but any given applicant probably won't
be equally qualified for both positions

[06:02]
be equally qualified for both positions
this is because different skill sets are
relevant to different roles so guys once
you figure out what you want a woman for
once you decide what you want her to do
then you can reverse engineer the traits
skills and attributes that would be
necessary to successfully discharge the
role that you have created in your life
defining these prerequisites before you
interview will give you the criteria
with which to appropriately screen your
applicants want a mother for your
children then you probably want somebody
kind patient loving and Youthful want an
easy going Playmate then you should
consider someone fun sensual attractive
and independent
establishing these criteria ahead of
time will prevent you from hiring a
playmate when you really want a mother
and vice versa
it will also help you to focus on role
essential attributes and reduce the
likelihood that you might become misled
by role peripheral distractors

[07:01]
by role peripheral distractors
now once the role has been defined and
the criteria have been established men
are ready to enter into the sexual
Marketplace having completed these tasks
beforehand dating becomes something very
different that is dating becomes an
extended hiring process
it is the means by which men determine
whether a particular woman is a
qualified applicant for the position he
has created in his life
this is the real function of dating
and the idea is to collect data over
multiple time points and across multiple
contexts in the service of that
determination higher slow and Fire fast
is just as appropriate in the sexual
Marketplace as in the corporate
now as I said in the beginning of this
episode this understanding that dating
is really the process by which men
determine whether a particular woman is
qualified for the position he has
created in his life
should make men significantly more
confident in the sexual Marketplace

[08:01]
confident in the sexual Marketplace
why because this completely flips the
script
under which most men operate most men
approach dating as if the woman were
hiring
they get in front of a woman and their
attitude and their behavior basically
communicate
am I good enough to have sex with am I
good enough to have a relationship with
do you like me
my brother in Christ she is not going to
hire you
she is never going to get down on one
knee and offer you a lifetime of
provision and protection Hell she's
never even gonna ask you out for a drink
you are interviewing her my friend you
need to meditate on the fact that you
are doing her a favor
because you are giving her an
opportunity to demonstrate that she is a
qualified applicant for an enviable
position at an outstanding company do
you understand

[09:01]
you understand
do not surrender the power that
legitimately comes with that position
and the flip side of this understanding
is for women if you're not hiring
then stop trying to control the process
a lot of you are out there acting like
bosses while looking for a job
and it's not a good look
the applicant does not get to dictate
when and where and what and how
with respect to the interview process
the applicant does not get to create her
role and set her compensation the
applicant does not get to control when
she is hired and by whom so relax and
enjoy the process
unless you're applying for the role of
CEO bossy is probably not among the
essential attributes of that role no one
wants to work with someone like that
and of course if that doesn't work for
you remember you are supported
encouraged and incentivized by modern
society to found your own company and

[10:00]
society to found your own company and
hire as you see fit just keep in mind as
I discussed in the two body problem that
that route though an option for women
doesn't always go as planned
