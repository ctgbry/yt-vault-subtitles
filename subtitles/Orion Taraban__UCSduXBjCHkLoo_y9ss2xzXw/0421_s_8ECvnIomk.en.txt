I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is
psychack's Better Living Through
psychology and the topic of today's
short talk is what men don't understand
about female selection
so thanks to the internet there has been
an explosion of awareness on this topic
in recent years and this has afforded
the current generation a uniquely
privileged position to understand female
mating and dating Behavior more clearly
and precisely than ever before
the quantity and quality of information
available on the subject just weren't
available to men even 10 years ago and
while some of this information can be a
bitter pill to swallow I hold that it is
ultimately of benefit to both men and
women that it is now more widely known
one of the most important Concepts in
this cache of information is hypergamy
the tendency to mate and date up
to choose men who for example are taller
stronger richer and higher status

[01:01]
stronger richer and higher status
hypergamy influences almost every aspect
of female sexual selection and it has a
number of significant Downstream
consequences so it's really really
important to understand this concept
unfortunately there are two common ways
in which the concept is misunderstood by
men and I want to address these in
today's talk so let's get to it
the two misunderstandings roughly
correspond to the two general reactions
men seem to have in response to learning
about the reality of hypergamy
the first is the most prevalent as it
unfortunately corresponds to the more
common reaction of men
basically when a lot of men especially
young men learn about women's sexual
selection criteria
they get really discouraged
they hear that women are only interested
in the top percent of the top 10 percent
of men they consider well they weren't

[02:01]
of men they consider well they weren't
in the top 10 percent of men in high
school or in college or in young
adulthood and they inappropriately
conclude a that they could never enter
into those upper echelons or B that even
if they could the payoff wouldn't be
worth the time and effort required I.E
the juice isn't worth the squeeze they
look at themselves think well I don't
have anything a woman is really going to
want and conclude why bother
and on some level it's like fair enough
dating is not symmetrical men initiate
the vast majority of interactions so men
disproportionately experience more
rejection than women do on the front end
and women terminate the vast majority of
relationships so men disproportionately
experience more rejection than women do
on the back end and this rejection can
be painful on a number of different
dimensions
these men may be rationally concluding
that a high risk low reward Endeavor

[03:01]
that a high risk low reward Endeavor
doesn't make sense for them if we were
talking about investing their money we
would call this decision prudent
and no one would have a problem with it
on the other hand lots of people seem to
have a problem with the same decision
being made about women
these men need to grow up man up stop
sniveling and frankly fall in line
this is hardly fair and would likely
make a good topic for a future video
however my point here is that these men
misunderstand the payoff of hypergamy
after all the time and effort expended
to align with the criteria of hypergamy
the payoff is not that a woman has
ultimately provided security and
material resources or even that a man is
offered sex and a relationship
the payoff is the growth and prosperity
that redowned to the man as a result
what does this mean well a top 10
percent man can only indirectly benefit

[04:02]
percent man can only indirectly benefit
a woman and then only if she can acquire
and maintain access to the man
however a top 10 percent man directly
benefits himself
he directly benefits from being stronger
and wealthier and higher status these
things are primarily good for him and at
best only secondarily good for others
even if much of his wealth and Status
are stripped from him by a divorce or a
breakup which can certainly happen in
today's society he remains the source of
that value and he became the source of
that value in the transformational
process of becoming a top 10 percent man
so this is the first misunderstanding
about hypergamy that it primarily
benefits women it doesn't it primarily
benefits men and can only indirectly
benefit women namely if a man chooses to
bestow the benefit upon her

[05:00]
bestow the benefit upon her
now before I'm going any further if
you're liking what you're hearing please
consider sending this episode to someone
who might benefit from its message
because it's Word of Mouth referrals
like this that really help to make the
channel grow
you may also consider hitting the super
thanks button those three little dots in
the lower right hand corner and tip me
in proportion to the value you feel
you've received from this episode it's
your donations that make all this happen
and I really appreciate your support
now not all men get discouraged upon
learning about the realities of
hypergamy on the contrary a smaller
subset of men get fired up
these guys are energized by what they
see as a viable path forward they think
fantastic with this information I can
kind of hack the game I can analyze what
really works with respect to mating and
dating and I believe that I can bring
myself in alignment with female
selection preferences I can get rich I
can get fit I can get smooth let's go

[06:00]
can get fit I can get smooth let's go
out there and get this bread
and in many respects this is an Adaptive
response because as stated previously
all of these things benefit directly the
man in question however in my opinion
this is where men are often shall we say
deceived
because the fact of the matter is is
that women don't actually give sex in
relationships to men
simply as a consequence of men meeting
their selection criteria
the idea that doing Behavior X will
solve problem Y is a masculine
problem-solving strategy projected into
women
men hear that women want a guy with a
six pack and a six-figure income and
they think great if I get these things
if I'm finally what women want then that
means that women will reward me with sex
and relationships
it's the same mentality that believes
okay if I buy her a drink and listen to

[07:01]
okay if I buy her a drink and listen to
her problems and show my value then she
will reward me with sex at the end of
the date writ large
and the disappointing reality is that
this is not the case
sure all other things being equal a
woman is more likely to choose a guy
with a six pack and a six-figure income
over a guy that doesn't have those
things
but it's not true that the vast majority
of women will choose a guy just because
he has a six pack and a six-figure
income these things might make it easier
for a guy to get his foot in the door
but it's better to consider meeting
women's hypergamous criteria as a
necessary but insufficient condition of
sexual opportunity
unless you are like world famous women
aren't going to be lining up to date you
even if you have all of the things that
hypergamy says that women are looking
for a good looking brain surgeon can
drink at the bar by himself all night

[08:00]
drink at the bar by himself all night
and this is because despite the fact
that the man may have worked 10 to 20
years to meet women's hypergamous
criteria
he has to start from scratch with every
new woman he meets
like he could be a successful handsome
eligible bachelor who has worked hard
for years to earn his social proof and
status
and he will still have to start at
square one which for a lot of women
means convincing them that he's not a
serial killer
like
can you imagine a job interview 20 years
into your career in which the
interaction begins with the default
assumption that you are fraudulent
embezzler until proven otherwise and
this is what happens with women they
have to feel safe they have to feel
heard they have to feel like you're
attracted to more than their bodies Etc
and if you say one thing that they don't
like too early in the interaction poof
the opportunity vanishes in an instant
and while it's true that the more a

[09:00]
and while it's true that the more a
woman is attracted to you the easier
this process becomes you don't get to
bypass this process just because you've
got biceps in a bank account
indeed you have to begin with women
right where you would have if you hadn't
spent 10 or 20 years building your
status and lifestyle namely at zero
and if you spend all that time on your
abs and income and you never learned how
to seduce a woman
you're probably not going to get as far
as the guy who spent a year learning how
to seduce a woman and has neither the
ABS nor the income hmm
meeting women's hypergamous criteria
unfortunately is not the Silver Bullet
that many men hope it will be most of
these criteria are what I call
attraction proxies
the idea here is that you can have all
the markers of a high status man
and it's still not going to be easy with
women
you will still have to approach and make

[10:01]
you will still have to approach and make
an effort and seduce effectively
this doesn't change if you're in the top
ten percent it may change if you're in
the top .001 percent I'm not sure I'm
not there yet but it definitely doesn't
change in the top 10 percent
being a high value man does not lead to
effortless sexual opportunity
and that's a bitter pill to swallow
you could be a neurosurgeon underwear
model who makes seven figures a year in
shelters abandoned puppies and the woman
is still going to ask herself questions
like does he remember the day we met did
he open the door for me how do I feel
when I'm with him does he make me laugh
does he look at other girls well our
kids hands look funny
Etc behind the hypergamous criteria of
the female sex is an almost endless list
of personal criteria of an individual
woman
failure to meet any one of which is
subject to removing the sexual
opportunity no matter how many other
criteria are met

[11:00]
criteria are met
so this is the second misconception
about hypergamy meeting hypergamous
criteria does not guarantee sexual
opportunity
interestingly both of these
misconceptions tend to have the same
outcome namely they generally motivate
men to walk away from women and that's
certainly what we're seeing more and
more of today
