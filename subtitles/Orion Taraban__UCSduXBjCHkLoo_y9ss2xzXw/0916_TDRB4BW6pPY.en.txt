That's actually something that I've
discovered as a therapist. It's happened
many times in conversation with a
patient where I would give an insightful
intervention and it would just sort of
get brushed off or shrugged off, but
it's almost like it planted a seed and
then 2 or 3 months later the person
comes back to me and says, "You know
what? I was in the shower the other day
and I was thinking and they say exactly
the [ __ ] thing that I said 3 months
ago." And it's it's like it needed to
come from them. They needed to have time
to chew on it, to forget about it, to
remember it, to have themselves be the
source and origin of that insight.
That's the only way that it really
works. Yeah. When they think of it
themselves. And it doesn't matter if it
if it feels like it comes from me or if
it comes from them, like I don't need
the credit. But I do think that you need
to give people time to realize that
you're right sometimes because it can be
somewhat embarrassing in the moment to
acknowledge that another person might
have a perspective that is closer to the
truth or to reality than you or has a
point like that is on some level

[01:00]
point like that is on some level
difficult to save face for the
individual. And so when you work with
people you got to always give them a
chance to save face. It's really
important to give people outs so that it
doesn't escalate into conflict and
resistance, which is, you know, at odds
with what you want to do anyway.
