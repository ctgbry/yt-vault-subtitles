i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
you gotta feel it to heal it
this is a therapy saying you gotta feel
it to heal it so what's this all about
i first heard this phrase when i was
working in the context of addiction
drugs and alcohol are emotional numbing
agents
avoiding unpleasant emotions is one of
the primary reasons people use
substances of all kinds
the issue is not that drugs and alcohol
don't work in this respect but rather
they kind of work too well
it's almost like the introduction of the
substance
freezes a person's emotional maturation
at a given point in time
the person will continue to mature
biologically chronologically
but they're emotionally frozen at the
point in life when the drug or alcohol
was initially or heavily used
anyone who has had a relationship with

[01:01]
anyone who has had a relationship with
an alcohol or drug addict will attest to
this they may be dealing with somebody
who's 40 50 60 years old but who has the
emotional maturity of an eight or twelve
year old which is when they started
using or drinking
so
what happens when addicts make the
decision to abstain from their drug of
choice
well it's not like they haven't had
emotional experiences over the last
several years or the last several
decades
they just haven't processed them
the drug or alcohol has allowed them to
avoid dealing with that dimension of
life
in all but a superficial manner
these emotions are like frozen somewhere
beneath the threshold of awareness for
quite some time
abstaining from the drug of choice
causes the emotions to begin to thaw
and this can be a really uncomfortable
time for recovering addicts to pass
through
as they suddenly begin to experience

[02:01]
as they suddenly begin to experience
extremely intense apparently spontaneous
emotions
these emotions were triggered by events
that happened a long time ago in a place
far away but they haven't yet been
appropriately processed
and see since these emotions don't seem
to square with what's going on in the
here and now this can be a crazy making
experience
these folks feel like they're on an
emotional roller coaster and they don't
really understand where the hits are
coming from and the hits are coming hard
and fast
what i tell folks who are passing
through this moment to consider is that
the feeling
is the experience of the emotion
leaving the body
it's not entirely scientific but it does
seem to have some psychological truth to
it
you experience feelings as emotions
leave
and when you're done feeling
you find that the emotion is gone
so this feeling is actually an essential

[03:00]
so this feeling is actually an essential
step in the recovery process it's the
experience of those long frozen emotions
leaving the body
and this can be a useful image for
addicts or for any folks passing through
an emotionally difficult moment
with every feeling you experience you're
potentially reducing the emotional debt
that you have yet to pass through
and there's really no other way to pay
this outstanding balance you've got to
feel it to heal it
