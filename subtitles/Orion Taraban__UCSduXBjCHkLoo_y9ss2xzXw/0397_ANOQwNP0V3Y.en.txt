I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is men need
to have a plan with women
this is a very very important topic for
men it's probably the primary reason why
men more commonly than women end up in
relationships that don't serve them my
general orientation to the men that I
work with is that a man should clarify
his intentions with respect to Any Given
woman in his life before he interacts
with her the system for clarifying those
intentions is the subject for another
video and the man doesn't necessarily
have to be explicit in Sharing what
those intentions are but you the man
absolutely need to know what you want
from a woman before you engage with her
this allows you to have coherence with
respect to your words and actions and it
makes it much more likely that you will
get what you want from the interaction
the fact of the matter is that most men
don't have a plan with women Beyond

[01:00]
don't have a plan with women Beyond
getting laid
and just to be clear I don't have a
problem with that as an end goal but if
that is your end goal then you have to
treat her like a lover and not like a
girlfriend or a partner on the other
hand most women have all kinds of plans
for the future many of which you likely
know nothing about because they tend to
have relationship goals and those
relationship goals are often very long
term not always but often so we see this
huge asymmetry between men's short-term
goals of getting laid and women's
long-term goals of having relationships
listen carefully
if you do not have a plan for your life
then you are a part of someone else's
plan
and while that doesn't necessarily mean
that being a part of someone else's plan
will work out poorly for you I guarantee
that being a part of someone else's plan
will not be as beneficial to you as

[02:00]
will not be as beneficial to you as
creating your own plan will when you
create your own plan that plan will be
custom tailored to your needs and wants
and that only happens out of sheer dumb
luck if you're a part of someone else's
plan
so if men don't have plans with respect
to the women in their lives but the
women do
you can see how this could potentially
create some issues for both parties
further down the line
what typically happens is that the man
increasingly feels trapped in a
relationship he didn't explicitly
negotiate because he just sort of went
along with the woman's intentions and
further down the road when there is a
marriage or a mortgage or children isn't
really the time for a man to finally
come out and be honest about what he
needs and wants from the woman in his
life and this likely won't benefit the
woman or children if there are any

and tip me in proportion to the value
you feel you derive from this video I
appreciate your support
the way that this tends to happen is
through a phenomenon that I call
relationship creep
if a woman has long-term relationship
plans and it becomes clear that the man
doesn't the woman will begin to move the
relationship in subtle ways in the
direction of her goal and this usually
happens in very small behaviors the
stereotypical example is leaving a
toothbrush at your house it could look
like scheduling a dinner with your
parents or inviting you to a
get-together with her friends or
planning a romantic vacation for the two
of you
and again none of these is necessarily a
bad thing but if you don't actually want
a long-term relationship with that woman
you should kind of prevent her from
steering the ship in that direction

[04:02]
steering the ship in that direction
failing to do so means that you will
kind of slide into a long-term
commitment and this is very different
from entering into such a commitment
with purpose and intention which is what
I would recommend
in any case a lot of guys fall prey to
relationship creep and this is often
because well
there's nothing too objectionable about
a toothbrush is there
so it can feel hard for men to object to
relationship creep unreasonable grounds
he could also provoke an argument by
holding that boundary the potential
downside for relenting is low and the
potential downside of objecting is high
so a lot of men just don't think it's
worth it to say anything
it seems like such a minor thing
in isolation
however hundreds if not thousands of
these little concessions sure tend to
add up over the years
an airplane can be off by just one

[05:00]
an airplane can be off by just one
degree and miss its Mark by hundreds of
miles
indeed over time the plane can be
deviated off course to such a degree
that it will arrive at an entirely
antipodal destination
that's relationship creep in this way 10
years can go by and if he's not careful
a man can find himself living in a
situation that is almost unrecognizable
from the way he wanted to live
again this isn't necessarily a bad thing
and it's less likely to be a bad thing
if the woman is virtuous with high
integrity however it's definitely an
abdication of frame and is likely a Bad
Thing captains if you built the ship
then in the vast majority of situations
you should be at the helm
the antidote to relationship creep is
knowing what you want from women and
remaining unswervingly committed to your
purpose
doing so kind of allows the women who
come into your life the choice to either

[06:02]
come into your life the choice to either
opt in or opt out
and while this generally requires some
honest communication with the women in
your life it requires even more honesty
with yourself you need to know who you
are what works for you what doesn't work
for you what you want what you don't
want without that self-knowledge and
without the willingness to act in
alignment with that Knowledge from the
very beginning of the courtship process
you likely will not end up at your
intended Port remember men if you do not
have a plan you will be part of a
woman's plan
and that will only serve your best
interests out of sheer done luck
