I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is
understanding the symptom pool not a
very exciting title but a very
interesting episode now the symptom pool
might be the single most important
concept with respect to understanding
mental illness so if you think the
modern world is nuts and you're curious
to know how we got here then this
episode is for you all right to begin
with you have to understand that a
person who is suffering internally in a
non-visible way has a problem
this person needs to find ways to
communicate that suffering to other
people in a way that they can understand
that is likely going to produce the
level of care and concern appropriate to
that degree of suffering
now you might think well what's wrong
with using your words Orion
well think about it if I were to come up
to you and say I'm in a lot of pain and
I feel very confused my thoughts are so
chaotic I can barely make sense of them

[01:00]
chaotic I can barely make sense of them
and it's so intense that I don't think
how much longer I can take it
you actually might not take me too
seriously that's because my statement is
kind of paradoxical if I really were in
that much pain and if my thoughts really
were that chaotic could I really talk
about my situation in such a rational
cogent and sensible way the how of my
message would undermine the what of my
on the other hand if I were to say stop
practicing basic hygiene start spending
all day in bed and begin crying with no
apparent provocation would you really
believe me if I told you with my words I
feel perfectly fine never been better
probably not and that's because when the
how and the what of a message are
incongruent almost everyone gives
precedence to the how
so direct communication is useful to
securing
care and concern for certain degrees of
suffering but it doesn't work for more
elevated degrees of suffering

[02:00]
elevated degrees of suffering
the communication must be deviant enough
to Signal the presence of a significant
problem but often not so deviant as to
cause others to have the sufferer locked
up in a padded cell for his or her own
good
the idea here is that people need to
titrate their deviants from social norms
to Signal other people to render the
appropriate degree of care and concern
and the way that this is done is through
something called the symptom pool
the symptom pool is a collection of
constantly evolving culturally bound
communication strategies for expressing
different levels of suffering
everyone influences the symptom pool but
no one controls it what's more few
people consciously choose to manifest
these symptoms that is very few people
intentionally use these strategies
instrumentally we call these people
malingerers rather most people Implement
these strategies unconsciously which is
what is so fascinating sufferers are

[03:02]
what is so fascinating sufferers are
generally conscious of their symptoms
but they're not conscious of why these
particular symptoms manifested as
opposed to some other symptoms
the symptom pool is generally cultivated
unintentionally and unconsciously at the
population level and the symptoms
generally manifest unintentionally and
unconsciously at the individual level
now these communication strategies are
always connected to certain times and
places which is why we can kind of
consider almost every form of mental
illness to be a culturally bound
syndrome and this is also why we see for
lack of a better word fads with respect
to mental illness like some ways of
communicating distress come into favor
in certain times and places spread
wildly and then completely disappear
for example there have been almost no
cases of glove paralysis or
neuroesthesia or hysterical pregnancy
for quite some time despite the fact

[04:01]
for quite some time despite the fact
that all three of these conditions were
extremely common in the 19th century
and this is very strange of course
because if there were a clear biological
or genetic correlate for these sorts of
things well it's doubtful that those
correlates would have been so completely
weeded out of the gene pool over the
last 100 years even more perplexing is
the fact that say hysterical pregnancy
was almost never seen in Highly Educated
women
and neurosthesia was almost never seen
in the working class
how a presumably biologically determined
syndrome could have been influenced by
class and education is rather peculiar
isn't it but let's keep moving forward
now before I do that if you're liking
what you're hearing please consider
sending this episode to someone who
might benefit from its message because
it's Word of Mouth referrals like this
that really help to make the channel
grow you can also hit the thanks button
which is in the lower right hand corner
beneath this episode and tip me in
proportion to the value you feel you've
derived from this message I don't do

[05:01]
derived from this message I don't do
product placements or endorsements so
this helps me keep the lights on I
really appreciate your support thank you
okay so in any given time and place
individuals have an unconscious
understanding of how they need to behave
in order to communicate that they are
insufficient emotional pain to motivate
care and concern from others
but the thing is that we have to be very
careful about this for two reasons in
the first place we can inadvertently
introduce ideas into the symptom pool
that don't have to be there and this in
turn can unintentionally motivate people
to manifest these symptoms in ways that
we didn't intend
ironically one of the primary ways that
this is done is through awareness
campaigns
to illustrate how this works I'm going
to take an example from Ethan waters's
excellent book crazy like us the
globalization of the American psyche
it's very readable and highly relevant

[06:01]
it's very readable and highly relevant
with respect to recent goings on
the first chapter of this book looks at
the rise of anorexia in Hong Kong in the
90s now anorexia is a very serious
disorder most people don't know this but
it actually has one of the highest
fatality rates among all mental
illnesses higher even than depression so
it's something that needs to be taken
seriously it's also something that
functionally does not exist in the
developing World unfortunately there are
still people who are underfed and
malnourished but this is not because
they are intentionally depriving
themselves of food if there is food
available
anorexia is almost exclusively a
disorder of privilege affluence and
civilization
but where it exists it can create a lot
of Devastation and misery
so in the 1990s some well-meaning
psychiatrists from the West came to Hong
Kong on a mission
they had seen how dangerous and terrible
anorexia could be and they wanted to
spread awareness of this issue so that
it might be proactively prevented or at

[07:01]
it might be proactively prevented or at
least treated appropriately
and what these folks would say is
something like anorexia is a rare but
dangerous condition it generally affects
young people especially young educated
upper-class women perhaps you've heard
about it because celebrity X recently
confessed that she struggled it
struggled with it in her past in any
case this isn't something to be judged
it's something to be understood and
cared for and we're here to offer you
the tools to do just that
sounds reasonable enough right
and well-meaning newspapers and media
Outlets did their part to spread the
campaign of awareness far and wide what
a good deed
now what do you think happened
according to a newspaper at the time
anorexia which was previously
non-existent in Hong Kong saw a 2500
percent increase in the exact population
the psychiatrist indicated in just a few
short years
incredible like who could have predicted
that would happen

[08:00]
that would happen
now sometimes people respond to this by
saying okay well maybe the awareness
campaigns did their job Orion and they
brought a previously unrecognized
problem to light by making screening and
diagnosis more accurate and there may be
some truth to that perspective like I'm
sure that happens from time to time
however that can't possibly be the case
here by definition anorectics must be
more than 15 percent below the minimally
normal weight for their height and age
and that's just not something that could
have been hidden on that level
like oh this is anorexia I just thought
my daughter was starving thank you for
educating me on its proper name like
that almost certainly didn't happen
on the other hand would almost certainly
did happen is that you had a group of
respected authorities doctors in white
coats with all the paraphernalia of
Scientific Technology talking directly
to adolescents saying that there is a
rare read special condition that tends

[09:02]
rare read special condition that tends
to inflict young women of status and
privilege like celebrities whether you
are aware of it or not
part of what these psychiatrists were
doing was educating young girls in how
they can signal their membership in
certain classes of society using all
their power and authority these doctors
indelibly Associated a certain
communication strategy with a certain
segment of the population young female
high status in the symptom pool
they did this unconsciously and
unintentionally but they did so
nonetheless and while most of the girls
who subsequently suffered from anorexia
communicated their distress
unconsciously unintentionally their
suffering was real regardless
this is the first way we have to be
careful about the symptom pool
the second way has to do with secondary
gain
secondary gain is the positive side of
suffering or the benefits that accrue to

[10:00]
suffering or the benefits that accrue to
one's status as a victim
in this example the doctors were adamant
that these girls not be judged or
criticized rather they should be given
Special Care taken out of school if
necessary and healed with understanding
therapies these girls needed attention
and consideration and should be praised
for their courage and dedication for
overcoming this Dreadful disease
again I'm not saying that these girls in
Hong Kong consciously thought to
themselves okay I'm gonna starve myself
so people will pay attention to me and
see me as a courageous High status
victim
none of this is conscious that's the
amazing thing about the symptom pool all
of this occurs unconsciously both at the
population level and the individual
level
however by conducting their awareness
campaign in this manner psychiatrists
basically succeeded in significantly
spreading a mental illness that up until
then was kind of culturally bound to the
Civilized West and of course their

[11:02]
Civilized West and of course their
message was all the more impactful
because it targeted young people
Children and adolescents who all other
things being equal are the most
susceptible to arguments of authority
and the benefits of secondary gain
so this was just one example Waters
offers several other well-documented
examples in his book so check it out if
you're interested and this kind of thing
is by no means an historical artifact it
continues to go on in the present day on
some level it may be unavoidable however
it may also be mitigated ironically with
awareness about awareness its benefits
and its liabilities
