there was an experiment that was done
where normal people would wear these
glasses where because of the the way
that they were constructed in the visual
field left and right were switched and
so like I can see that my glass is here
on my left but if I were wearing my
glasses it would appear on my right and
so of course in the beginning everybody
was wearing the glasses they'd be
reaching for their cup of water over
here and be like oh where is it oh yeah
I'm wearing the glasses so it's actually
opposite direction of where it looks
like it is like if they wear those
glasses 24/7 after a few days they learn
and I wonder what would happen if they
wore those glasses for years yeah like
absolutely there would be some changes
in probably the visual processing center
of the brain where it's basically like I
don't know what's going on but based on
the new information we're getting left
and we got left and right mixed up and
so we need to switch this thing around
and so I think that if we experience
things in our mind in our Consciousness
long enough they obviously do create
changes in our brain but it's so hard to
know how that actually occurs I don't
know if anybody really understands that
