there are really two components to this
the first is to very deeply appreciate
the fundamental Law of Attraction which
is that people want what they want not
what wants them which suggests that you
cannot want someone into wanting you in
fact the more that you want someone
the more it reduces the likelihood that
they're going to want you back on some
level you're doing the wanting for both
of them
so this should be the framework which
will motivate you to do the second part
you'll understand that this is actually
in your best interests to stop this sort
of obsessive rumination and to actually
begin the process requires
consistent use of the block and replace
technique
the thoughts come up you say no I don't
want to think about that person no I
don't want to think about that right now
and you replace that thought with
something else entirely you might have
to do that 500 times a day but trust me
it gets easier
