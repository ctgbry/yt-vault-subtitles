let me talk about a distinct way in
which men snatched defeat in the first
weeks or months of dating remember when
I described the reproach them all stage
I noted that it's when the child hasn't
seen mommy in a while that it starts to
feel anxious and insecure and it's these
emotions that motivate the child to go
back to make sure mommy is still there
the important thing to appreciate here
is that if the child didn't feel anxious
or insecure the child wouldn't go
running back to Mommy so what does this
mean with respect to the courtship
process though it's weird to say the
anxiety the uncertainty the instability
these things are your friends because
it's these things like in the case of
the child that are going to motivate the
woman to return for her to come back she
kind of has to miss you to wonder about
you and she can't miss you or wonder
about you if a who don't allow her the
time and space to miss you and B if you
don't allow her to wonder about you
because you've already confessed your
feelings for her
