what is the one thing that most prevents
women from getting the relationships
they want with the men they want to have
them with it's very simple ladies in a
word women's greatest enemy is pride
everything you want with respect to men
is on the other side of that Pride I
alluded to this fact in my series how to
get any man you want let me tell you
ladies Pride is very cold company it
will not keep you warm at night and in
today's episode I'm going to be
discussing three of the main ways your
pride is keeping you single first and
foremost your pride tells you that you
are the prize and you are not at least
not after you turn 30 at 30 the average

the average woman's sexual Marketplace
value for the very first time and that
Gap only increases as time goes on
believing that you are the prize
intrinsically and not just the prize
relatively and temporarily is pride
