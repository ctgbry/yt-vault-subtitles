if I'm receiving attention from women
because I am a doctor or I am wealthy or
I am famous or I am high status then and
if I am significantly older and more
experienced in relationships then it
doesn't make sense that we would equally
share the the direction or the decision-
making of that relationship because I've
spent potentially years creating the
structure of my lifestyle before you the
woman even showed up so the person who
built the ship is generally in the best
position to helm it because they
actually created it you know plank by
plank they know it better than anybody
else this gives them I think legitimate
authority to direct the course of that
ship and of course the flip side of that
is that they're more responsible for the
ship as well CU you can't really have
power without responsibility at least
not legitimate power so the person who
built that structure should be empowered
to direct that structure and that person
who built that structure is also going
to be on the hook for addressing any
problems that come up within that
structure you can't have it both way is
