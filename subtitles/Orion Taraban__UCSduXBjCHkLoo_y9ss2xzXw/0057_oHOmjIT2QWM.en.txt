i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk is roads
only go where they go
i like to use this metaphor when i'm
dealing with the prospect of relapse
this could be relapse into a substance
use addiction but it can also be
relapsed into any other vice or bad
habit overeating procrastination
insecurity etc
basically it goes like this the moment
before a person decides to commit to a
relapse behavior
there are generally some thoughts that
are endorsed prior to that decision
and a very common such thought that
occurs prior to relapse is this time it
will be different
the circumstances are such that i
believe i can reasonably expect a
different outcome this time it will be
well
what if it isn't what if you've been
down that road before

[01:00]
down that road before
what if you've been down that road
before hundreds if not thousands of
times and what if you've been down that
road hundreds if not thousands of times
and it consistently and reliably took
you to the same destination
that snooping through your partner's
phone just made you jealous that one
drink turned into 20 that leaving your
house at that time made you late for the
meeting it's like how many times do you
really need to go down that road until
you're certain that it will only take
you to that destination
you've been down that road so many times
you know every house on that street
you know every brick in that pavement
this is because
roads only go where they go
roads are inflexible with respect to
their pathways to certain destinations
you can't take the same pathway and
expect to arrive at a different
destination
no one is confused about this fact of
reality with respect to actual roads
however many people are confused about
the fact that certain behaviors are just

[02:02]
the fact that certain behaviors are just
as inflexible for them
with respect to their pathways to
certain outcomes as roads are with
respect to their pathways to certain
destinations
i mean that's the definition of insanity
right doing something over and over
again and expecting a different result
and all this insanity can actually be
traced back to one problematic cognition
this one fleeting thought that typically
arises in the moment before relapse that
this time it will be different
no it's not
that road only goes where it goes my
friend
and when folks become increasingly
mindful of this cognition they can start
turning around
sooner
they don't have to go as far down the
road as they used to
and ultimately they can eventually avoid
that street altogether
favoring pathways that actually take
them to their desired destinations
