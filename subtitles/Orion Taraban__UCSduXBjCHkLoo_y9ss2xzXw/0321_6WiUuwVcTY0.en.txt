the easiest way to get women to respect
you more is to use one simple little
word I know you know what it is that
word is no
no thank you not interested no
you don't have to be rude you don't have
to be mean you don't have to be
aggressive and you don't have to be
manipulative you can use this word no
when you authentically are not
interested in doing something
and the reason why this increases
respect is that it communicates that you
are not
interested
in Seeking a woman's approval
and you are not afraid
of her potential displeasure
it is not possible to respect somebody
that you know is trying to win your
favor
it's not possible to respect somebody
that you know is afraid of your
displeasure
saying no when you mean it is the
easiest way to command respect
