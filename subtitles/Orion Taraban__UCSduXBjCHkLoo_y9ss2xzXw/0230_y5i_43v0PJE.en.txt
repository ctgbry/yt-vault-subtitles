i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to be extraordinary
in life
to be extraordinary is something that's
within everybody's reach
to understand how this is possible we
need only examine the mystery of the
word itself look at it
extraordinary extra
ordinary
an extraordinary person is more ordinary
than ordinary that's one way to
understand this word
and what does that mean look i've talked
to a lot of people in my life both
personally and professionally i've lived
on this planet for nearly 40 years and i
can tell you that one of the rarest
personal attributes in the world
is humility
what i am impressed with at this stage
of my life is not riches or fame or
beautiful women
many of the people i've worked for have
these things
and yet they still come to me for advice

[01:01]
and yet they still come to me for advice
on how to be happy you need to think
about that for a minute
what impresses me
is the ability to be content with very
little
what impresses me is the ability to live
at peace with yourself
and with those around you
what impresses me is the willingness to
put the needs of others ahead of your
own i know some people who can do these
things
they're better people than i am and i
look up to them and admire them
and what impresses me further about
these people is
is the extent to which they can do those
three things that i mentioned without
the recompense of praise or fame or
wealth
they seem amply rewarded by the
contentment that they enjoy
by the warm and loving relationships
that they experience with their friends
and family
and by the opportunity to serve their
fellow man
these are compensations that are worth
more than money precisely because they
can't be bought at any price

[02:00]
can't be bought at any price
you see
the whole world thinks they're above
average
and the whole world is clamoring to be
recognized for their talents and their
abilities and their efforts
we all start off thinking we're harry
potter
an undervalued exception who is destined
for great things
however
that's just not the reality
most of us will not have statues built
in our likenesses or millions of adoring
fans or a place in the enduring ark of
culture
but maybe greatness is not so much what
we do
as it is the way of being
that we embody when we show up to do it
and this is expressed in the zen koan
before enlightenment chop would carry
water
after enlightenment chop wood carry
water
maybe what's extraordinary is not so
much what we do
but how we go about doing it
and the higher we go the more we are
content with less
and it's this extra ordinariness that i

[03:02]
and it's this extra ordinariness that i
believe is within the reach of every
human being
