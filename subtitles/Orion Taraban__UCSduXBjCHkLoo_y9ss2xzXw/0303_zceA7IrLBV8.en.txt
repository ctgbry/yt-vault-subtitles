I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is neglected
kinds of love
space
so this is a continuation of my series
entitled neglected kinds of love in
which I look at the concept of Love
through a spiritual lens by examining
how the divine's relationship to the
created Universe reveals properties of
love and one such neglected property
that I'd like to discuss today is space
I'm going to argue that space is an
attribute of love a kind of loving but

usually when we think of loving we think
of closeness we think of togetherness we
think of merging with the loved one
however I would like to argue that space
that separation is also an attribute of

[01:01]
that separation is also an attribute of
love
space is the container of all that
exists from a purely physical
perspective space is the field in which
matter exists everything that exists
materially exists in space without the
container of space no life is possible
it would have no place to be so you can
see that space the field within which
life becomes possible is a form of
generosity it allows life to exist
therefore It's a Kind of Love
space is also useful for example it's
the empty spaces of a house that we live
in It's The Emptiness of the cup that
holds the drink we build structure but
we use emptiness without space there is
little that can be done space is also an
extremely important component of passion
and sexuality one way to extinguish a
fire is to smother it

[02:00]
fire is to smother it
space to sexuality is like heir to a
conflagration it's the element that
allows combustion to occur without it
there is no flame of passion
finally space implies freedom
it does nothing to impede the motion of
physical bodies through it
so we can see that there's a kind of
trust and respect in space it suggests
that you're allowed to go where your
motion naturally impels you to go
recognizing space as an attribute of
love is to understand that freedom of
movement is an essential component of
loving it deserves greater appreciation
in the collective consciousness what do
