first and foremost you have to
understand that after 50 pretty much
everyone that you might be dating is
going to have a purple heart that is to
say pretty much everyone will have been
wounded in battle and that's because
being wounded is the only legitimate
reason our culture accepts for being
unmarried like if you're unmarried at 50
and you've never been married people
will look at you like you fell from
outer space on the other hand if you're
unmarried at 50 because your exy cheated
on you took your house and alienated
your children or because you watched
your husband die of pancreatic cancer
over three agonizing and soulc crushing
years guess what no one is going to ship
you back to the front now whether if the
only socially acceptable way to be
unmarried is to be wounded this would
lead to people exaggerating their wounds
in order to escape the pressure and
Judgment of their friends and family is
for you to decide however we can
certainly maintain that people are
incentivized to do just that
