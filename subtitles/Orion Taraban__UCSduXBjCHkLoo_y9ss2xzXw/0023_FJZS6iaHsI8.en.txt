i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
subject of today's short talk
is redeeming the suffering of your past
suffering is the gift that nobody wants
and i would be remiss to encourage you
dear listener to go out
and seek suffering sufficient to the day
are the evils in it
suffering in some sense is unavoidable
we needn't
seek it out suffering tends to seek us
out
and we're all subject to passing through
moments of difficulty
and those moments can permanently color
the rest of our lives not always for the
better
however if you think about it we all
kind of have a
ambivalent relationship to this pain and
suffering
for example imagine i were to give you a
choice
you can either leave things as they are
or you could push this button it's kind
of a magical button

[01:01]
of a magical button
you could push this button and all the
painful experiences that you've ever had
will be as if they've never happened
would you push the button
you know i've yet to encounter someone
in a clinical setting
who would push the button and i talk to
a lot of people who on occasion
have suffered immensely and that
ambivalence is something like huh
i didn't really like that moment that
grief
that heartache that depression that dark
hopeless chapter in my life
i would never want to go back there and
that chapter in my life has in some way
irrevocably made me who i am today
and especially if on some level i really
like who i am today
i would be loathe to forego those
experiences in the past because i can
see them
in retrospect as a kind of necessary
precondition
to my present circumstances so most
people have this ambivalent
ambivalent relationship with their pain
and suffering we don't want it we don't

[02:00]
and suffering we don't want it we don't
go seeking it out
but we appreciate that it sort of makes
us who we are today
so the best way to redeem the suffering
of your life
is to love your present situation to
love who you are
now because your past suffering has made
you who you are
today to the extent that you believe
that what you have is valuable
and that you are participating fully in
the life that you've created yourself
you will feel as though your hardships
were ultimately worth it
and if you're not there yet focus on
doing that that's how you kind of get
over the suffering of your past
by learning how to love yourself now to
accept your current reality
and to work consistently towards
building the lifestyle that you can love
you redeem the suffering of your past
through
loving participation in your present
so those are my thoughts on the matter
