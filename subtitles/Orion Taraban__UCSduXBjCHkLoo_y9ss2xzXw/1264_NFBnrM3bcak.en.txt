I think acting has to do with being a
human. And acting means you take action.
It's like that's that's what we're here
to do. We're here to make choices. We
have to make decisions. We're not like
guided just by instincts. We're not we
have conscious minds. We can't be
passive. That's a choice as a human
being. So, we have to act and move
through the world. And we also have to
move through the world that is populated
by other people. Some of whom might want
the same things as us and are our
competitors or our friends. often they
can be the same people or they they're
indifferent to us or they they hate us
and they they see us as their rivals or
or they're envious. I mean, you have to
learn how to navigate what's going on
inside of other people because other
people are generally the best and the
worst thing that can happen to somebody.
You know, we don't really need to be
afraid of mudslides and tornadoes as
much anymore. We have to be more afraid
of other people. Other people could make
our lives very very good or they can
make our lives very very very bad. And
it's not like people are walking around
wearing signs that let you know which
one is which. In fact, the really bad

one is which. In fact, the really bad
ones often are very indistinguishable
from the ones that look very good. So,
everyone's an armchair psychologist.
They're trying to figure out what's
going on inside of the mind of that
person. Is he trustworthy? Is he safe?
Can does he have what I want? Can he
will he give it to me? What's the best
way to get what I want from this person?
When I talk like that, it it makes
people seem very self-interested, which
is, I think, the way that they are. Um,
a lot of people don't consciously move
through life thinking, how do I get what
I want from other people? But often that
means that they're just ineffective at
getting what they want.
