I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why women
don't apologize I am 40 years old and I
think I can count on one hand
the number of apologies I've received
from women in my life
and that does not mean that I've only
had relationships with honest
well-behaving high integrity women over
the past four decades what it does mean
is that women seem to find it very hard
to apologize for bad behavior and this
is too bad for two reasons in the first
place apologizing for something you did
wrong is like an interpersonal slam dunk
almost everybody will forgive you for
being wrong not everybody will forgive
you for being right
but almost everybody will forgive you
for being wrong especially if it means
that it makes the other person right and
in the second place apologies just seem
to matter more to men and using words to

[01:02]
to matter more to men and using words to
solve a relationship problem is actually
a very easy and inexpensive solution all
things being equal
so ladies one of the best ways to earn
respect and raise your estimation in
someone else's mind is to admit
wrongdoing when it's appropriate and of
course to not apologize where there was
no wrongdoing and the other person just
disagrees or disapproves of your actions
check out my episode if you've done
nothing wrong don't apologize for the
flip side of this talk

now the reason why it is so hard for
women to apologize
is that there seems to be a difference
in what men and women consider to be the
problem
from a man's perspective the problem is
some behavior for which he believes the
woman to be at fault and as a
consequence of that behavior he is now
angry and upset
the behavior is the problem and the
emotional response is the consequence
and in his mind the solution to this
problem is acknowledgment of fault and
behavioral change
and I don't think that's how a lot of
women see it from a woman's perspective
the problem is not the identified
Behavior the problem
is that the man is angry and upset
and as ridiculous as that might seem to
a man there's actually some validity to

[03:00]
a man there's actually some validity to
this perspective like in a court of law
a breach of contract by itself is
generally not actionable you have to
also prove that some harm resulted as a
consequence of the breach no harm no
foul so it's the harm the anger and
upset that is the foul from this
perspective and in her mind the solution
to this problem is changing the way he
feels
if she can succeed in modifying the
man's emotional response then on some
level that would solve the problem
and that's why you encounter the kind of
interpersonal strategies that you do
with women in relationships under these
circumstances rather than apologies and
accountability you typically see a
number of emotional coping strategies
like trying to cheer you up or making
your favorite meal or sending you a
funny meme or simply allowing enough
time to pass for everything to blow over
all of these are strategies to reduce

[04:01]
all of these are strategies to reduce
the man's felt experience of anger or
upset do you understand
women also notoriously use sex in this
manner
many years ago I was out for a drink
with a woman I was dating and she
decided to take something that I said
very much the wrong way she quickly
escalated and within seconds was crying
and critical and withdrawn it was fairly
early in the dating process so I was
taken aback by how quickly this had
escalated however as is my way I didn't
argue with her and gave her some time
and space to emotionally equilibrate
later that night rather than apologizing
for imputing to me something that I
didn't intend or owning up to the
disproportionate intensity of her
emotional reaction or even acknowledging
the episode at all she just came into
the room took off all her clothes and
kind of laid herself in front of me
the feeling I had was that she was
offering sex as a kind of peace offering

[05:01]
offering sex as a kind of peace offering
to assuage my hurt feelings rather than
apologizing for her bad behavior and in
that moment I unfortunately lost a lot
of respect for this person
because of what her behavior seemed to
imply that if I could be distracted with
a bit of sex then we could all just move
forward as if what just happened didn't
happen
and I got up and slept on the couch in
another room that's an example of how
women apologize with sex
so men if you're expecting an apology
from your woman
I would advise you not to hold your
breath on the other hand ladies I would
highly encourage you to consider
apologizing when appropriate why because
men respect people who take
responsibility for themselves and Men
very rarely receive apologies from women
so this is an easy way that costs you
nothing to quickly distinguish yourself

[06:02]
nothing to quickly distinguish yourself
from the vast majority of other women in
a positive manner in the mind of a
particular man
I guarantee that his estimation of you
will increase as a result
what do you think does this square with
your experience of things let me know in
