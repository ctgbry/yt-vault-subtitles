I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is how to
make friends as an adult
so this is an extremely important skill
the ability to make friends and it gets
harder to do as you age it's not always
easy to make friends in high school and
college but it will never be easier to
make friends than it is in high school
and college and this is because you are
more or less forced to spend a great
deal of time with people your own age
and you don't have a lot of other things
to do or a lot of other responsibilities
and so your free time defaults to your
cohort and For Better or For Worse these
folks that you become friends with in
high school or college tend to be your
foundational friends and you may stay
friends with them for the rest of your
lives as they say you can't make new old
friends
the issue is not so much that these
friends have falling outs though that
can happen but that they slowly become
less important as their lives diverge

[01:02]
less important as their lives diverge
and this is particularly true for men
maintaining their friendships is
something that women generally do better
than men not only because they seem to
enjoy emotional connection for its own
sake more than men do but because they
kind of play 4D chess with their social
relationships as well like a woman will
take a girlfriend out to lunch because
she thinks that if she allows her to
vent about her husband in two months
she'll be more likely to accept an
invitation to her baby shower something
like that women see how putting the time
in now might come in handy later and
they enjoy spending time unless
goal-oriented contexts
don't get me wrong I'm not saying that
men don't value their friends the
platonic relationship between two male
friends might be one of the strongest
and purest relationships on this planet
it's more like men are socially
incentivized and rewarded for

[02:00]
incentivized and rewarded for
prioritizing other things above their
friendships for instance my best friend
lives in the same metropolitan area that
I do
but I see him like twice a year
and that's not because I'm not making
the effort to get together
his story is that he spends half of his
Waking Life working
and the other half of his Waking Life
with his wife and kids
fortunately he seems mostly content with
his life however this is the story of
millions of men over time their friends
kind of become the 10th most important
thing in their lives which functionally
reduces them to insignificance and I
suppose this is fine as long as the man
is happy and as long as the situation
works
what can happen however is that a guy
can run into financial trouble maybe he
gets hurt maybe he loses his job and
that in turn destabilizes his
relationship which can lead to divorce
and just like that the two pillars of

[03:01]
and just like that the two pillars of
his life to which he has devoted the
last 20 years of his life work and
marriage can topple possibly even
through no fault of his own
and because his entire social network
was his colleagues and his wife's
friends these men can find themselves
desperate and alone
and this is one of the primary reasons
why suicide rates in men are so high
following a divorce the protective
factor of a support system is one of the
things that tends to make women more
resilient in the face of setbacks for
instance the demographic with the lowest
suicide rates historically has been
black women and this is not because
these folks tend to suffer fewer
hardships than others the general
consensus here is that their tight-knit
social networks can help them through
their darker moments in any case it's
important for men to actively maintain
their friendships throughout their

[04:00]
their friendships throughout their
lifespan but it can be hard if you only
depend on your old friends friends who
may have moved away and are now busy
with their careers and their families so
what do you do

now I have a Surefire way to make
friends as an adult if you follow this
advice I can almost guarantee that you
will have a few close friends in three
months time which is actually pretty
incredible
here's the hack to making friends as an
adult
the way to make friends as an adult is

[05:01]
the way to make friends as an adult is
to enroll in some kind of training or
certification program this could be a
200 hour yoga teacher training program
this could be a cordon bleu pastry chef
certification this could be a Wilderness
survival program it can really be
anything as long as it's connected to
some form of achievement
let me break down how this works
first of all the fastest way to build
relationships is to undergo a shared
trial
that's why the closest bestest buddies
in the world are war buddies it's the
guys that stand shoulder to shoulder
with you in the trenches with whom you
form deep and abiding friendships
undergoing a shared trial brings people
together as it functionally forces them
to lean on each other in order to
overcome the trial so by entering into a
period of apprenticeship where you will
be asked to perform a great deal in a
short amount of time you will be
undergoing a shared difficulty with your
fellow aspirins what's more these

[06:02]
fellow aspirins what's more these
programs tend to be very intensive and
this intensity works in your favor here
to make a friend you actually need to
spend time with the other person let's
say you try to make a buddy by going to
the Wednesday night Jiu Jitsu class at
the local Dojo every week in a year you
could have spent around 50 hours
together not bad
but if you were to enroll in some kind
of training camp you might be able to
spend a couple hundred hours together in
the span of a few months thus you could
accomplish in four months what might
otherwise have taken you four years
these programs offer a concentrated
opportunity to bond with other people
undergoing a shared trial in a shorter
amount of time allowing you to leave
with some close friends in a matter of
weeks instead of years
and because it's tied to some kind of
achievement or certification you're not
going to encounter the kind of flakiness
or non-investment that plagues casual

[07:01]
or non-investment that plagues casual
classes when there is an enrollment cost
and a personally relevant goal at stake
people tend to be much more committed
they show up regularly which is
important as you can't really build a
relationship with someone who comes and
goes and because there's a goal involved
these programs often attract a higher
caliber of person than those you might
find just hanging around at the local
pub
after all these are people who like you
are interested in some form of
self-development which is why they have
invested in a particular certification
program
so that's the easiest way to make
friends as an adult enroll in some kind
of intensive time limited program
connected to a form of achievement and
ideally this program should concern
itself with something you actually enjoy
like if you don't care about yoga don't
sign up for the yoga teacher training
program this is especially true for men
who tend to bond side by side as opposed

[08:01]
who tend to bond side by side as opposed
to face to face male bonding often
requires at least the pretext of an
activity even if it's just watching the
game
programs create a reason for men to get
together and connect so have fun what do
