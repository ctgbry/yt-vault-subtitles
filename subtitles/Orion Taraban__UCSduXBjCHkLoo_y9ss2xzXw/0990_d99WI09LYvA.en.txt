The idea I'm going to present to you
now, ladies and gentlemen, will help you
make sense of a great many interexual
relationships. It's going to sound a
little strange in the beginning, but
once you sit with it for a while, it
will explain much of what would
otherwise remain incomprehensible
about why certain men and women get and
stay together. Here it is. When it comes
to interexual relationships, a woman's
only true competition is not another
woman. It's not a man's friends or
family or hobbies or interests. A
woman's only true competition in a
relationship is a man's solitude. Let's
examine this further. When I say that a
woman's only true competition is a man's
solitude, it means that a man will
continue to choose a given relationship
as long as it continues to provide value
over and above what he can produce in
his own company. This one observation
explains a lot. For example, it explains

explains a lot. For example, it explains
why so many men get involved with
ratchet, low value women. Why do they do
this? Because they hate their own
solitude. This is not quite the same
thing as having low self-esteem,
whatever that means. It means they
cannot be with themselves. Their
thoughts are too loud. They find their
own presence boring and detestable. Like
school children who will jump at any
excuse, any distraction to not complete
their homework. Men who despise their
own solitude will latch onto the
slightest possibility of a relationship
with a woman almost irrespective of the
woman. It pulls him out of himself, a
self that he finds unbearable.
