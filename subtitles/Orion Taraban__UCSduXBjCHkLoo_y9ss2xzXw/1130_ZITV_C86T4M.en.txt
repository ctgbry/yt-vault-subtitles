In the context of dating, many people,
especially many young people, are
chasing the spark, which is essentially
another way of talking about the desire
to experience lirance, butterflies,
chemistry, vibing. By any other name,
the spark is a certain quickening in the
blood in the presence of a certain
someone. And since most people go to
relationships in order to feel, when
folks don't feel a spark by a certain
point in the courtship process, they're
often liable to move on to other
options, even in the absence of any
other liabilities.
And I'm of a mixed mind with respect to
this. On the one hand, I generally don't
think it's worth being in a sexual
relationship with someone you feel
nothing for, especially at the beginning
of a courtship. On the other hand,
however, true affection is only
cultivated over time, and that is way
more important to the success of a
long-term relationship than the fleeting

long-term relationship than the fleeting
feeling of lirance.
