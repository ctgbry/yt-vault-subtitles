hi everybody I'm Dr Orion taraban and
this is cycax Better Living Through
psychology and today we're going to be
doing something a little different as
you can tell this won't be a short talk
this will be a longer talk and it will
be a talk with somebody it will be a
discussion I'm very happy to say
um hopefully the first of many and today
I will be talking with my friend and
colleague Dr Sean Smith
Sean is a psychologist who works in
private practice in the state of
Colorado he also specializes in men's
Mental Health
and he is the author of several books
which I hope we can get to later I've
known Sean personally for a couple of
years and I I really respect his
perspective and I'm very excited to have
you on the show today Sean so thank you
for joining me
hey thanks for having me on it's it's an
honor to be the first interviewer
discussion you've had on your channel
and I think it sends a good positive
message to the world because by having
me on first you're telling the world

[01:00]
me on first you're telling the world
that you will literally literally talk
to anybody so that's a good message to
uh to put out there it's really not true
because the viewers might find this
interesting it's like I actually was a
fan of Sean many years ago and I came
upon his book and I reached out to him
and found some of his stuff on on
YouTube and I reached out to him cold
many years ago and he had the
the kindness to respond and we initiated
a
collegial relationship since then uh so
I I was kind of star struck by Sean when
I first encountered his stuff and
um it's really great that we've been
able to develop this relationship over
the years
yeah so what do you want to chat about
today Orion well I want to chat about
women and I want to chat about
relationships and I know those are two
of your favorite subjects and there are
two that get a lot of air time on my
channel as well
so I thought I would start by pitching
you a softball question that I already
know the answer to and then we'll get

[02:00]
know the answer to and then we'll get
into kind of maybe deeper waters but I
think it's an interesting question so
how how is dating
like the FBI
that's a uh you you pulled that out of
my book that the Tactical guide to women
I think
um
in the Tactical guide to women if people
don't know about it it's a it's a book
about relationships for men basically
it's about how to vet women that you're
bringing into your life and one of the
things I came across when I was writing
that book is the fact that the FBI at
least on their website at the time went
through the steps that they used to vet
agents and it's a very long process it
takes a couple of years and it happened
to be what I think about in terms of
vetting a potential partner if you're
looking for a long-term partner that you
want to build a shared Enterprise with
you need to invest that time to get to
know what they're really about and
that's what the FBI does they spend a

[03:00]
that's what the FBI does they spend a
lot of time watching people and that
that's part of vetting potential
Partners too
I mean it makes sense to me and this is
just a couple of years
for a career if you're vetting for a
potential long-term partner that's for
life that's that's an even bigger
commitment in my opinion than just
something that you're going to be doing
for money
indeed yeah as important as that is
um I often say on my channel that men
should exercise emotional discipline for
the first six months minimum and I get a
lot of pushback on six months and here
you are saying that it can take years to
adequately and appropriately vet a
potential partner
well here's the way I think about it you
know we go through if you're if you're
in a relationship a new romantic
relationship you go through this
infatuation phase and during this
infatuation phase of puppy love the
honeymoon phase whatever we want to call
it
men and women both go through a period
where their brain chemistry literally

[04:01]
where their brain chemistry literally
deviates from Baseline and there's a
study a few years ago where they looked
at serotonin signatures in
um cerebral spinal fluid I believe and
they actually notice that when people
are infatuated we're just seeing the
world differently we're not seeing
ourselves the same we're not seeing the
other person the same not only are we
not seeing them correctly or ourselves
correctly that correctly being the way
we normally see things but we're also
trying to present our best selves so
there's a lot of beer goggle beer
goggles going on while we're infatuated
with somebody and that period
according to the research can last
anywhere between 6 and 18 months some
people say it lasts longer some people
say it doesn't but
um my thought is that you don't really
see the other person clearly and you're
not allowing them to see you clearly
while you're in that infatuated stage
while your your brain chemistry is out
of whack and so
you don't really start getting to know

[05:00]
you don't really start getting to know
somebody on a meaningful level until
that period ends and that's when you can
really start
assessing the relationship because
that's when the real person shows up and
one of the ways to know that that's
ending is the person becomes more
three-dimensional to you so you're not
idealizing them and you're not being
idealized so much like all the little
things that used to be cute and Charming
maybe they start to get a little bit
irritating now so that there's two sides
to the coin when you when you've come
out of that infatuation phase you start
to see things more accurately so we're
talking years really if you want to if
you want to spend a year getting to know
somebody after the infatuation ends you
know that that's a big chunk of time
yeah and just to be more accurate when
it sounds like you're saying is not
simply that you're not seeing the other
person clearly during that time because
that could go pretty much on either side
of the fence it's that you're seeing the
other person as better than they are
right it doesn't seem like your mode
evaluation period people suffer from
this person that I'm dating and sleeping

[06:00]
this person that I'm dating and sleeping
with is is worse than they actually are
right the bias is always on one side
yeah okay
um I talk about this in my channel I
call it the crisis of disillusionment
and I think that most of that limerence
and that feeling is really just
projected fantasy we know next to
nothing about somebody except that we're
attracted to them in the very initial
stages of courtship and
I think the mind abhors a vacuum and it
tries to fill in the gaps in our
knowledge base with exactly what we
would want to find there so that we can
be more in alignment with our attraction
and what generally happens you know when
people talk about
getting over their exes and they're
they're coming to terms with like the
red flags that they saw but kind of
ignored earlier on in the dating process
it's like most of these
um these relationships that tend not to
work out there were I think a lot of
signs for for most people earlier on in

[07:01]
signs for for most people earlier on in
the in the relationship but people just
chose not to to look at them but I think
that if enough
accumulate over time or something really
jarring happens then the projected
fantasy shatters and that's the crisis
disillusionment and then you got to see
you get to see the person in front of
you kind of warts and all it's only then
that you actually get to decide if you
want to have a relationship with that
person because you actually weren't even
seeing who that person was up until that
point
and
that's an interesting
um fork in the road
for a lot of folks
yeah there's this term um confabulation
that clinicians use to describe somebody
when they are recalling something that
didn't happen and it's not that they're
lying so that this would happen for
example after a brain injury where the
brain parts of the brain are not
functioning well or certain types of
dementia and or you know alcohol
dementia that that sort of thing where
the brain is physically damaged and when

[08:01]
the brain is physically damaged and when
a person is trying to remember something
that happened in the memory the sequence
of events or some piece of History they
will fill in the blanks with something
that's plausible they don't know that
they're doing it and it's not
intentional they're not lying but this
term confabulation gets gets attached to
organic disorders and injuries of the
brain when really we're all doing it all
the time we're filling in blanks just
like you said and so when you're in that
infatuation stage you're feeling there's
a lot of question marks and you're
filling it in with what seems plausible
and also what is positively valenced
okay well let's talk about
traction then because it sounds like
people have a choice at that moment of
whether or not there's enough
there to continue to pursue a
relationship with the person after the
crisis of this delusionment or after the
limerence period
wears off
is is attraction a choice

[09:03]
that's an interesting question I'll give
you my thought I want to hear your
thought of it the um
the emotional side of the Mind
takes a split second to decide that it's
attracted to somebody
and it could it's it's the visual appeal
it's the scent it's the words it's it's
the whole package the whole presentation
and this is one of the problematic
things about Tinder is that so much of
that gets factored out you're only
seeing an image but
um the the emotional side of mind takes
almost no time to know that it's
attracted to somebody the rational side
takes a lot longer to assess the
situation and so I think that part of
what people are dealing with in the
dating realm is that
is that it takes so little time to
decide that you're attracted to somebody
and it takes so much time to decide if
that traction attraction is warranted so
I don't know if I'm really answering
your question as attraction a choice I
think there's an involuntary component

[10:00]
think there's an involuntary component
to it but I also think that um you can
choose to some degree
but I'm going to stop there I'll come
back to my other thought in a minute
what do you think so far I think you're
saying that attraction is is not a
choice
in the fact that the emotional mind can
decide within a split second whether or
not there's attraction it makes me
wonder whether you can be rationally
attracted to somebody that does not
sound hot that does not sound sexy to me
um I think you can rationally decide
whether this person might be a good
partner for you or a good husband or
wife or mother or father
um but rational attraction I think
sounds like a paradox to me or an
oxymoron
but I want to bring this up because it's
something that I see with the guys I
work with clinically and maybe you see
this too
um sometimes for whatever reason
men's attraction can be
pretty predictably biased towards women
who for whatever reason are just their
Kryptonite

[11:00]
Kryptonite
yes and when men become more aware of
their patterns of Attraction it can feel
like they're stuck between a really
bad choice where they can follow their
attraction which leads them to a
dumpster fire relationship as it has you
know dozens of times in the past or they
can move forward with a woman who
rationally sounds like it she might be a
good partner but leaves him feeling
completely I don't know bored or
uninterested
and that seems like a a really tough
decision for guys so if attraction is
not a choice are those guys doomed
well I'll give you framework one
framework to think about it but I want
to Riff Off something you said and
rationally attracted can you be
rationally attracted to somebody seems
implausible imagine trying to be
rationally horny for somebody that's
that's not going to work
it doesn't make sense but I think the

[12:02]
it doesn't make sense but I think the
way guys
approach relationships is so often from
a from a standpoint of desperation or if
it's not desperation it's at least I
have to take what I can get which is
maybe desperation light because that's
maybe been their experience however they
arrived at this point where they'll look
out on the landscape and they'll look at
all of the the possibilities and they'll
zero in on the hottest one and like you
said so often the hottest one to them is
their relationship Kryptonite
rather than a different way to approach
it and this is this is where um
cultural structures like religions come
in handy where if you change the
Paradigm a where you're not
looking out on the entire landscape and
choosing who's most attractive and this
this applies equally to women too that
you are clear on your own values and
you're clear on what you're building in
life and so you look at a smaller subset
you look at the the prospects that

[13:00]
you look at the the prospects that
actually align with what you're trying
to accomplish in life which is a much
smaller group it's not the entire
landscape it's a small group and then
you choose the the hottest one there and
this is someplace where um like I said
if you're part of a structured religion
this seems to be easier for for people
that have that structural framework
because everyone around them or at least
the prospects around them they basically
share the same structural framework the
same similar values and that sort of
thing so there somebody who is
a part of a religious community and I'm
not pushing religion I'm just using this
as an example that somebody who has that
structural framework they've already in
a sense if they buy into that structural
framework they've factored out everybody
else and so they're only looking at this
small group of people who would be a
group who would be a good fit for their
life and then they're choosing the most
attractive among that smaller pool
yeah well what about the rest of us who
don't have a tight-knit religious

[14:00]
don't have a tight-knit religious
community to rely on because I think
that's a diminishing number especially
young people in this country
yeah it's probably the majority of
people that don't have that type of a
framework
so and so my more difficult to find the
set of people who already seem to more
or less conform with your values and
direction in life and then choose among
them right yeah
and that's where I think yeah that's 100
correct and sounds like it's a case for
you certainly was a case for me it's the
case for most people but if you have the
sense of exactly what you're trying to
accomplish in life if you're if your
values are
buttoned down and you have a sense of
the purpose that you're moving toward in
life and you have a sense of what it is
that you the reason that you even want a
relationship
um then
the people that will fit within that
become more apparent to you and it
becomes more apparent who the people who
won't fit within your values your

[15:01]
won't fit within your values your
purpose your goals in life
okay well that sounds like frame that
sounds like a guy knows what he's about
he knows what his mission or purpose in
life is like he's potentially
extrapolated to some degree a lifestyle
for himself he knows what works he knows
what doesn't work for him he knows what
he wants he knows what he doesn't want
and then he's trying to find a fit which
on some level suggests that he's
inviting the woman into his frame into
his life into his lifestyle
and I think that's a really good way for
men to approach dating I think
especially younger guys in their 20s you
talked about the desperation
I think it could even be this sense of
um
women
almost like
as a savior like that a good woman will
like lift him out of his loneliness or
despair
or be his Muse or give him purpose have
you seen this John yeah
I one of my friends on Twitter actually

[16:01]
I one of my friends on Twitter actually
posted this yesterday he he posted about
being at a cafe or Diner or something
and that he was sitting next to a man
who was in his 60s and the Man in the
60s was explaining to the waitress that
his depression had finally lifted
because he finally found a girlfriend
who would who would date him
and and my friend's point was some guys
never learn and the lesson that I think
he my friend thought this guy should
have learned was that
the women are not the key to your during
your depression that's got to come from
you which I think is what you're saying
yeah I think that there's I think this
is part and parcel to idealizing or
romanticizing women or and or
relationships that it's my missing piece
or it will give me the reason to get out
of bed in the morning it will complete
me it will give me a sense of self I'll
feel like I'm a person of value because
this woman who I've invested with at
patina of even godliness who knows uh

[17:02]
patina of even godliness who knows uh
saintliness or virtue has deemed to
look upon me and in the context of that
I now feel like a man I now feel like I
can conquer the world
and I think what you're telling me is
that it makes more sense for guys to
kind of like
become men on their own terms and then
invite women into their lives further
down the road
you and I have a mutual friend
um mutual friend calling who talks about
external external sources of validation
Ken Curry so who I'm talking about he's
he talks about external sources of
validation and it's just it's a path to
destruction you can't have your source
of validation depending on the um the
moods of somebody else or the the you
know their approval for today it's got
to be that you're on your path and

[18:01]
to be that you're on your path and
someone else can join in they can walk
next to you if they want but they are
not the source of your sense of self
mm-hmm because if if you Outsource it to
them they can revoke it at a moment's
notice this poor guy at the diner the 60
year old guy girl's gonna break up with
him and he's gonna be right back where
he was feeling depressed
well does that suggest that men should
maybe wait longer to begin dating or or
potentially to get into long-term
relationships because I think it kind of
takes longer for men to get their feet
under them women have just shorter
timelines they always they mature faster
biologically they seem to mature faster
emotionally and they do have their
reproductive windows so they they're
kind of
they grow up a little bit faster than a
lot of guys
and if it would be good for the man to
know what his purpose is and to have his
lifestyle extrapolated and make it
easier to attract a woman who would
have goodness of fit with that purpose

[19:03]
have goodness of fit with that purpose
what do you think about the movement
that guys sort of like spend their 20s
grinding or getting their
their together
before they really maybe they're just
into examine women
yeah or serious relationships but maybe
there's something to the fact that I
don't know the exact numbers but it
seems to be across societies that men in
long-term relationships men tend to be a
little older than women something like
five years older on average maybe that's
too high maybe it's it's a little lower
than that but maybe there's something to
the fact that
men do take a little bit longer to get
their feet feet under them the
expectations are different from men you
are expected to go into society and
produce more than you consume if you're
going to carry a man card meaning you
need to
uh you need to be in a position where
you can provide if you're going to be
respected you need to be in a position
where you're contributing some to
something to society and women have
their expectations too but it's not that

[20:00]
their expectations too but it's not that
it's a little bit different and it takes
a while to establish that and so maybe
that's why we see an age difference in
long-term commitments let's talk about
this because that's certainly the
the cultural expectation for men or
let's say masculinity is to be the
provider protector
and one of the uh let's say one of the
promises of feminism was that it would
be good for men
because just like women might have been
restricted to caregiver nurturer roles
historically
which might have been restrictive or
repressive that men have also been
relegated to these restrictive and
potentially repressive social roles of
Provider protector and the promise of
feminism is that both men and women can
experiment with non-traditional gender
roles and
what do you think about that like would
that behoove a man to examine

[21:00]
that behoove a man to examine
which part of that the promise of
feminism as I understand it is that it
could be good for men too because men
like women have been restricted and or
repressed by their traditional gender
roles in this case being a provider
protector the other hand being let's say
a caregiver nurturer
and I would say that in the last
you know several decades women have
really run with
this sort of gender role Liberation and
they're doing very well socially like as
you know they're graduating high school
college postgraduate at a significantly
higher rate than men I think for the
first time in history women under 30 are
out earning men under 30.
they they seem to be thriving in a lot
of traditional metrics of success
whereas
I I'm not really seeing that when men
deviate from those traditional gender
roles that they flourish does that make
sense you know I'm not seeing that
either it's very easy for a feminists to

[22:00]
either it's very easy for a feminists to
say that a man should surrender that
that traditional masculinity and that he
should be more emotional and whatever
whatever they're saying at the at the
American Psychological Association about
the man box you know the man boxes this
idea that men are conditioned to be
stoic and and squash down their emotions
and and just be these hard-headed
knuckleheads
it's very easy number one to
straw man that and say that you know
there was this man box and and to
oversimplify what masculinity means
um as you're actually living your life
and it's very easy for a feminist to say
it would benefit men to give that up and
I'm not just talking about female
feminism I'm talking about male
feminists who burrow into a nice comfy
bureaucratic position and at a gender
studies department or the American
Psychological Association these guys are
just contemptible to me because what
they're saying is it's okay for you
Orion to go out and cry in public and it

[23:00]
Orion to go out and cry in public and it
is okay if you don't cry in public but
they're not going to pay the price for
you going out and crying in public
they're not going to pay the price for
you surrendering
your um your masculine desire to go out
and create something to use a little bit
of that aggressiveness that they're
always whining and complaining about to
build something in the world if you
don't do that you're the one who pays
the price you pay the price in Lost
um employment opportunities you pay
unless the price and loss mating
opportunities you pay the wise the price
in loss of prestige but the feminists
sitting over there writing the paper is
saying was is to your benefit to do this
I disagree
well we play devil's advocate here
because I can imagine that when women
first started entering into traditional
male roles in society that they got a
lot of pushback and it wasn't very easy
for them and maybe they
I would think they absolutely
experience discrimination and

[24:00]
experience discrimination and
all kinds of pressures to return to
their traditional generals
um so I believe that if a man publicly
invisibly deviates from
his masculine role he suffers social
consequences but my devil's advocate
position is well maybe that just means
that we need more awareness and
understanding just like maybe the men
needed about women entering into the
marketplace
it's possible but I think I'm skeptical
of The Devil's Advocate position because
what we're really talking about is
evolved adaptations from mating that are
200 000 years old and we know what women
well we have very strong evidence of
what women look for in men if and
evolutionary psychology does a pretty
good job of of explaining this that
women are looking for two things they
are looking for the ability to do
something in the world the ability to
provide and the willingness to stick

[25:01]
provide and the willingness to stick
around and actually invest in children
that's what women look for that's 200
000 years old and I think that's a
different variable than women going into
the workplace because if an attractive
woman goes into the workplace she's
still an attractive woman it's not like
men are not going to mate with her or
choose her just because she's standing
next to them at work and if anything
she's going to be fending them off even
more what we see when men relinquish the
masculine man need to go out and create
something is that
their opportunities diminish
tremendously
okay well then I understand that I agree
with that
um
you're you had a you seem to have a
particular
um bone to pick with male feminists and
I I find that phenomenon to be
interesting because it does sound from
this conversation so far I mean correct
me if I'm wrong that it doesn't seem
like feminism
[Music]
really advances

[26:01]
really advances
the
uh goals of men like it doesn't seem to
make them happy or it doesn't seem to to
get them better dating or mating options
why would a man become a feminist
I think it's a great mating strategy
because if you are that guy who can uh
it's like a dishonest signal in in the
animal kingdom where you have honest
signals of strength like a peacock's
Tales an honest signal of virility
because it takes resources to generate
that tail you can't fake it but there
are dishonest signals and uh dishonest
signals are lies essentially they're
they're the illusion of vigor and
vitality without it really being there
and I think that for a male feminist and
you know I know some guys are going to
hate me for this and I have to say right
out of the gate I don't care
um for um for a man to adopt a

[27:01]
um for um for a man to adopt a
feminist mindset and we should probably
Define feminism at some point because
we're talking about it as if we all
under we're working with a common
definition so let's define in a minute
but for a man to take on a feminist
mindset that is essentially anti-male
he is he's being sneaky he's saying look
at me ladies I'm on your side that guy
over there the guy that's working on the
the crane over there and actually in
building that building across the street
he's not on your side he's a brute he's
he probably voted for Trump you don't
want anything to do with that guy I'm
your guy I'm writing these papers about
how we all need to to take better care
of you that's that's kind of a sneaky
dishonest signal do you think these men
are conscious that this might be a
mating strategy
I think some probably are to some degree
and I will give many of them the benefit
of the doubt they've been many men
marinade or you know they're marinating
in this ideology from day one and maybe
they just can't see past it you know

[28:01]
they just can't see past it you know
because they're getting it from from
kindergarten all the way through college
if they go to college they're getting in
their entertainment they're getting it
from Marvel Comics you know they're
getting all the female empowerment stuff
which is fine it's not about being
anti-female
so maybe they just can't see past that
they've been told for for decades that
you're a good guy if you think this way
you're a bad guy if you think that way
that's really interesting what's coming
to mind is this
classic season of Survivor the TV show
I'm not a big fan of Survivor but I
think it's a fascinating game because
it's almost impossible to win
and in this classic season it was men
versus women
and the way it generally works in the
beginning is that there's all sorts of
like physical challenges
and based on which side wins the other
side gets weakened and I think through
the first maybe month of the season
it was absolute Massacre I don't think

[29:00]
it was absolute Massacre I don't think
the women had won a single challenge
versus the men and they were dwindling
and yet the winners of that season were
all women like the top three finishers
were women and I was like how is that
how did this happen because
the women could not out compete the men
at a single event
the way it happened is that the women
drove a wedge between the men
the women
began
uh
they went to some of the lower status
the lower performing men in the other
camp and said look
you guys are going to beat us but as
soon as we're gone who do you think is
next
you think you're going to beat these
Alphas
so you might think you're winning right
now and you feel really good but there's
no way that you're going to be
Mr Chad over there
and so basically the women succeeded in

[30:01]
and so basically the women succeeded in
negotiating a block with the lower
status men
at a strategic juncture of the season
and those that block succeeded in voting
out the highest status Alpha men who
were the most threatening to both the
women and the lower status men
and then as soon as they were gone
all of the lower status men were the
next ones to follow because the women
just voted them out
so it's fascinating isn't that isn't
that incredible I mean and the the
differences between the two camps were
so striking the men's Camp was running
like clockwork they had fire they had
shelter they were well fed the women
were shivering and wet and hungry
they didn't have the Survivor Survivor
skills to like
they were barely hanging on at some
point it would they they resorted to a
desperate strategy but it worked and I
think one of the

[31:00]
think one of the
uh so they they used fear to motivate
the lower status men against the higher
status men but I think they also used
the prospect of
I think they seduced them a little bit
too
so what the women lacked in physical
capability to mastering the environment
the men lacked in psychological ability
to recognize when
they were being plotted on and
manipulated yeah those those lower
status men were definitely I mean it was
very fascinating because one of the
strategies was to to play the the Damsel
in Distress and the women would come
over to the men's camp and say oh you
know we're so cold or so you guys are so
strong and you know all about fire like
couldn't you help us couldn't you just
spare the fire it costs you nothing you
know it's like really kind of yeah and
they're they're their competitors in
this season of survivors men versus
women so can you imagine a rival pulling
that card in like a sporting match or
something like that in a boxing match

[32:02]
but yes uh women are generally much more
Adept at let's say
emotional and psychological warfare than
men I made an episode about this that if
we had a no holds bar No Holds Barred
bar brawl between a man and a woman it
would be no contest I mean the vast
majority of men would just mop the floor
with a woman which is why we don't do
that it just seems like it's too unfair
of a fight
and to be fair that's generally not how
fighting occurs in most relationships
and the vast majority of relationships
is not a physical fight it's an
emotional or a verbal argument and the
vast majority of men are completely
outmatched completely outclassed by
women
they don't they don't know how to argue
like women do they don't know how to use
words to hurt in the same way that that
women do and that leaves them in a
significant disadvantage so I think that
it's really important for men to kind of
I mean there's this there's this trend

[33:00]
I mean there's this there's this trend
in in society like not be a harmless man
like to do you need to have strength you
need to have skills and a competent
strong man is
it's not a heart it's not a harmless man
he could cause harm he could also he
also has the power to do good
it's really the same power you know what
I'm saying you have to have power one
way or the other and I think it behooves
a lot of men to learn some of the tricks
of the trade when it comes to women so
that they kind of know how to
hold themselves in a fight
just like it I think it makes sense for
guys to to know how to like take a punch
or throw a punch it makes sense for guys
to know how to
how to recognize emotional manipulation
and how to
potentially
tolerate and resolve their own
discomfort that comes up in the presence
of a woman's distress
yeah you said so much good stuff there
particularly that last point maybe we

[34:00]
particularly that last point maybe we
come back to tolerating distress but you
know this stuff starts in childhood
where you can see boys and girls on the
playground and there have been studies
about this more boys are competitive
obviously and and there's a lot of
cooperation when boys are playing but
there's these little moments where the
competitiveness gets aggressive and what
you'll see is physical
physical attack physical conflict with
girls they're just as competitive but
what you tend to see with little girls
is reputation destruction and that kind
of psychological warfare and so they
started practicing their trade very
young and
um some just like some boys become very
good Fighters or very skilled Fighters I
should say some women become very
skilled at psychological warfare and I
think it's important to say that most
men most boys and men and most girls and
women are not interested in that level
of conflict they just kind of like get
along and live their life and enjoy
things but um

[35:02]
things but um
yeah and um I was also going to add that
you know I've worked with couples for a
lot of years and I've heard guys use
precisely the two words that you just
used they felt outclassed and outmatched
when they were having an argument they
just felt completely outmaneuvered
verbally when they were having an
argument so they're very much at a
disadvantage because they're not going
to get physically violent you know most
of the every guy I've worked with
they're not willing to get physically
violent and so women have this
tremendous psychological advantage
sometimes and I agree with you
completely that it really benefits us to
learn how to use words
I also think it's useful to approach
relationships from a universal
disarmament perspective so it's like as
a man if if we both recognize that my
physical strength is superior to you and
therefore it wouldn't necessarily be
fair to to to flex on you in that way so
I'm gonna I'm gonna disarm myself in
this way then maybe let's recognize that

[36:02]
this way then maybe let's recognize that
you the woman might have more
opportunity or or power or skill in
inflicting emotional harm on me so
I can't give up my gun if you keep yours
kind of a thing does that make sense
yeah yeah
um
interesting yeah you talk about
competitiveness and you also alluded to
the APA so let's just make That explicit
so can you share with us where that
reference is coming from
yeah that most people probably have at
least heard of it that the APA in 2019
came out with these guidelines for
working with boys and men and it was
there were some good things in in the
guidelines and clinical guidelines are a
set of um ideal practices for clinicians
and so the APA will come out with
guidelines clinical guidelines work with
depression and and pancreatic cancer you
know just all kinds of clinical
guidelines and every once in a while
they get very political with their
guidelines it's not it's not the usual

[37:00]
guidelines it's not it's not the usual
but the APA guidelines for working with
boys and men and then some guidelines
that came out the following year for
working with girls and women very
political they were feminist Dogma from
the ground up and and so let me let me
give you my sense of the definition of
feminism there's the feminist next door
who believes that feminism is about
equal opportunities and equal
responsibilities and and equal
protection of the law and all of that so
by that definition I I could be called a
feminist because I believe in in those
things but that's not the dogmatic
ideological feminism that is taught for
example in gender studies Department
it's not the feminism that informed the
APA guidelines this comes out of the
post-modernist agenda to pit groups
against each other and you know
everything is a power struggle and
everything is is has to be seen through
the lens of power dynamics and victims
and oppressors and so forth that that's
the feminism that I'm talking about
ideological angry it's not about

[38:02]
ideological angry it's not about
equality it's about advancing women
Beyond men because men have been the
oppressors supposedly for all these
centuries and now it's time for some
retribution and some kicking ass
yeah I would say that it's not relegated
to gender studies departments I've
worked with a number of young guys in
college and I think at least a few of
them have even dropped out and what I
often hear is if they're in any kind of
humanities based program generally
hasn't
infiltrated the hard Sciences but if
it's English or literature sociology
psychology
um
I've heard guys say that if they didn't
adequately self-flagellate they were
like socially ostracized and that the
classmates and the teachers were openly
hostile to and dismissive of their
perspectives simply because they're male
or a white male or a white straight male
the intersectionalism

[39:01]
the intersectionalism
very strange
and this is what happens
it's just explicitly sexist and racist
it is and this is where I have to walk
back my my previous aggravation with
male feminists because if that's what
you've been hearing your entire life
throughout your education that if you're
not sufficiently self-flagellating
you're a bad guy that's kind of it's
kind of hard not to buy into that after
years and Decades of it
but here okay so oh yeah let's let's
finish this conversation because we were
talking about the strategy of the sexual
strategy of male feminists and I talked
about this Survivor
we could see potentially parallels
between the lower status men and male
feminists
because maybe male feminists also see
that they couldn't otherwise
successfully compete on an open even
playing field with the higher status men
and so they might be pulled to throw
those men under the bus in the hopes

[40:01]
those men under the bus in the hopes
that once they're kind of out of the
picture or eliminated from the dating
Market
that the women will maintain with them
but in the Survivor episode it sure
didn't work out that way maybe they were
even led to believe that that was going
to happen by the women
but they were the first ones to go like
the women completely turned their backs
on them as soon as they successfully got
rid of the high status men who were the
real threat to both groups
so I don't know correct me if I'm wrong
but I I don't know if the male feminist
sexual strategy is all that successful
like our our male feminists swimming in
optionality
that's not that's not the true that's
not the impression that I get and so it
just sort of makes me wonder that if
that is a strategy even if it's been
taught to you from from a very young age
at what point do you sit you say hey if

[41:00]
at what point do you sit you say hey if
this isn't working
this isn't getting right and at
functionality I want it's not making me
happy or it's not convincing my life
this isn't working
right and presumably a male feminist
would be
uh dating female feminists I assume
because from what I've seen
um women who are more conservative
politically have no use for male
feminists
these women seem to find male feminists
repulsive and so presumably I'm speaking
in generality here but
um presumably
male feminists would be dating female
feminists and in my estimation
female feminists or in anybody of the
post-modernist critical studies ideology
anybody who really buys into it
um is not as well prepared for
relationships as they might otherwise be
and the reason I say that is because if

[42:00]
and the reason I say that is because if
you buy into
the critical theory feminism you know
the real ideological feminism not
equality not equal not feminism that
says we're all equal not that but the
actual ideological feminism then what
you're practicing over and over and over
again and this has been broken down
really nicely by people like Jonathan I
hate that
you're practicing a victim mindset
and you're practicing skills that don't
translate well to a relationship so if
you're dating someone who is a died in
the wall ideological feminist if you're
mandating this woman
and this woman has been conditioned to
believe that men are her constant
oppressors that she has really gotten
the short end of the stick you'll never
mind the guy across the street that's
building the building and the guy who
takes out her trash and the guy who
maintains her sewer and the guy who
keeps her electricity on never mind
those guys she's been taught that she
has been grossly mistreated by the
patriarchy well
if you're the closest man guess what's

[43:01]
if you're the closest man guess what's
going to happen she's going to see you
as her oppressor and if you also are
trying to believe that you're her
oppressor this is a horrible footing for
a relationship because you've got
somebody who's way up here being the the
righteous victim and this other person
who's way down here who is the nasty
oppressor and ironically the victim is
oppressing the oppressor and I'm not so
that's one reason is is that men should
really probably avoid dating doctrinaire
feminists um
that you are going to be seen as the
oppressor at some point but another
reason is just the fact that this kind
of ideology
and there are ideologies like this for
men too but this kind of ideology where
I'm rehearsing the the notion that I am
a victim
well what am I not doing while I'm
rehearsing that what I'm not doing is
learning how to give and take with other
human beings what I'm not doing is
learning how to have a healthy mutually
respectful relationship where we're on
equal footing I'm not practicing any of

[44:00]
equal footing I'm not practicing any of
that I'm just practicing my Victim
narrative
that's fascinating I'm in the Bay Area
and the Bay Area is sort of Ground Zero
for a lot of this stuff and I've talked
to a number of women personally who
completely believe that marriage in
particular was a repressive
institution where the women were the
property of the men and
marriage was an instrument of
patriarchal control
and they want to get married
which is very boggling how do you
suppose they reconcile that that's my
question to you because it's like I have
yet to encounter
I've encountered many women who
can say pretty much that perspective
verbatim on the institution of marriage
but I have yet to meet one who says I
refuse to get married on ideological
grounds

[45:02]
that just fascinates me
like the woman I'm I'm thinking of who
said almost those exact language I was
at her wedding like four years ago
I wonder if her husband so she's she's
dying to enter this patriarchal
oppressive Institution
it doesn't make sense to me
no well I guess one possibility is that
maybe she doesn't really believe it's
that patriarchal and oppressive
because if she actually thought she was
entering into bondage and I don't know
would she do it seems unlikely seems
unlikely to me too let's let's take
another attack
um which is have you are you familiar
with the old Greek play lisistrada
no man I went to public school tell me
about it tell me about Alyssa strata
Alyssa strata I think it was written by
Aristophanes he was a uh he wrote some

[46:00]
Aristophanes he was a uh he wrote some
comedies back in the day and this is a
very readable play
you know for ancient Greek Theater
and in summary the plot is that there's
a bunch of guys who are just interested
in going to war they're out all day
they're practicing their military
exercises they're always going out on
campaigns they're just thinking about
the next like thing that they can
conquer
and the women are pissed off because
they're just sort of left at home with
the kids they miss their husbands they
don't want to be in a state of Perpetual
conflict
what's that
can I ask a question are are they angry
because they want to go to war are they
angry because their men are gone and
they want their men home they want the
men at home and I I think it's from a
perspective of like I miss my husband
my husband should be spending time with
me and the family at home instead of
running around with his guy friends and
trying to kill and Conquer that's that's

[47:01]
trying to kill and Conquer that's that's
the perspective
okay and so the the women get together
and they sort of devise a plan
and the plan is that
and and they had to like swear a Blood
Oath because if anyone broke it the
entire strategy would fall apart and the
strategy was
no woman would have sex with her husband
until the husbands decided to stop the
current War
and that happens in like act one and the
next like three acts are like
at first the men sort of like laugh it
off haha yeah that woman will be running
back to me and my little man in a in a
week or two and that doesn't happen and
then you know the Men start to like
Weedle down certain women to try to
create some divisiveness in the group
and that doesn't work either and then
the men get angry and then the Men start
to plead and then the men eventually
agree and there's a victory and the men

[48:01]
agree and there's a victory and the men
decide yes this war was stupid women are
right we're gonna come home and uh the
women all their husbands so it's a
really interesting story
and I've experienced something akin to
Lisa strata while dating into the bay
area I have certainly met and dated
women who very explicitly
withheld sex or refused to date me
because I didn't agree completely with
their ideological perspectives
have you encountered that Sean
well I'm an old Mary guy but yeah I've
certainly heard it yeah
and it's easy for me to say from where I
sit because I have a good relationship a
great marriage with a wonderful woman
but you know my armchair assessment is
good you know make room for somebody to
actually appreciates you for sure no
real love lost there I I I'm thinking in

[49:00]
real love lost there I I I'm thinking in
particular of one woman who worked as a
librarian she works in the library
system and I have thousands of books I'm
an Avid Reader but she came over to my
house and she saw that most of my
authors were male
and she said she couldn't date me
anymore because I didn't read more
female authors than male authors my
rebuttal is I generally read more female
authors than people read authors because
I read so much
but it didn't make sense to me to choose
books that I was going to spend time
reading simply because of the gender of
the author I was going to read things
that were interesting to me because you
know it's my time and I should be able
to follow my own interests
um and not according to her not
according to her but I think she felt
very
um justified in doing that because I
think there is a strain of feminist
thought that says
that kind of has that list Estrada
approach which is we can't reinforce

[50:01]
men's disagreement with these ideologies
and the easiest way to not reinforce
that is to not have sex with them to not
date them to not give them opportunities
for dating and mating
yeah the the flaw in their reasoning is
that they're not in a small Society like
in a play they're in a big Society where
a lot of women vote for conservatives
um so they're competing with the women
who actually appreciate men who have you
know who aren't apologetic about their
masculinity
yeah now in the Bay Area maybe not so
much they may not be competing there may
not be a lot of competition
ideologically
um
yeah I would say that most people men
and women here are very left-leaning
and it can be shocking for people to
encounter somebody who doesn't
automatically parrot their beliefs
there's just sort of framework that

[51:00]
there's just sort of framework that
whoever you're talking to is on the far
left and we'll just sort of not an
agreement to whatever uh talking point
you bring up in conversation
this is what I want your perspective on
because you just mentioned that you have
a loving wife and you're an old married
guy and you seem very satisfied and
happy with your relationship and
I experience
a lot of men especially young men who
are very disillusioned about women and
the prospect of a long-term partner
and you often hear the phrase the juice
isn't worth the squeeze when it comes to
women
so I was wondering if if you could help
guys understand
what good they could potentially get out
of a loving marriage or long-term
partnership and how it might be worth
the risks associated with that endeavor
foreign
yeah it's a question I don't know if I'm

[52:01]
yeah it's a question I don't know if I'm
very good at answering I can talk about
what has what I have found useful about
is that I have always been just kind of
a relationship guy I enjoy being in a in
a relationship and
um wanted to have a small family and so
married a woman who also wanted a small
family and we didn't we didn't know
exactly where we were going when we got
married we had a good sense of where we
were going and so it's it's worked out
really well and
most of the guys
who say it works well will tell you that
they got lucky and they they found a
good woman and
um my response to that is no it's
sometimes it is a question of look you
know guys are guys are generally not
trained to choose how to choose
relationships I've asked hundreds of
guys who taught you how to choose
relationships who taught you out of that
women and the answer is invariably
nobody we got to figure it out on our
own and so for a lot of guys it is luck
that they just happen to be attracted to

[53:02]
that they just happen to be attracted to
somebody who turned out to be a very
good person but I don't think we need to
leave it up to luck I think if you know
where you're going you know what you
want then
we can develop skills as men for vetting
relationships and we can actually have
standards and this is a New Concept to a
lot of guys that you can actually have
standards in the women that you choose
and the relationships that you tolerate
and um that that's something that just
some guys have never really thought
about so I think I'm getting kind of far
afield from your question what what is
good about relationships
um
it just depends on what you want I'm I'm
a clinician which means I tend to think
about individuals versus researchers and
sociologists who think about groups you
know they think about force and I think
about trees and so when you say what's
good about a relationship well what does
this particular tree want maybe this
particular tree doesn't want a
relationship maybe maybe this tree just
wants a different kind of life but if
you want a relationship you better get

[54:00]
you want a relationship you better get
skilled at choosing that relationship
because even though you can divorce and
you can break up sometimes the
consequences follow you for a lifetime
it's not something you can easily step
away from Once you develop the
entanglements
okay I hear that
how would I respond
um I'm interested in the idea of
standards for men
because I can imagine a pushback
to that would be oh yeah that sounds
great Sean I'll have the high standards
on the two women who I have access to
and when I apply them I'm going to have
zero women so I just don't have the
luxury of Standards so how would you
respond to that
yeah that that's a tough one and I've
thought about that question for years
now because that is a real question that
you're surrounded by a handful of of
prospects and either they're of low
character or their High character but
the values don't match or for whatever
reason the relationship doesn't work and

[55:01]
reason the relationship doesn't work and
so you know the answer is sometimes it
really sucks that
if you're going to actually have
standards that you're factoring out a
lot of good people but what's your
alternative it's the alternative is well
I'm going to lower my standards and I'm
going to roll the dice and marry this
person who or you know connect with this
person develop some
entanglements like children and mortgage
and all these things with this person
who is of low character if that's your
alternative that's not a great
alternative to having standards and so
the answer is is not a very satisfying
one but I think the answer is that the
the more capable you are in the world
and the more resourceful and the more
accomplished and the more Prestige you
have
the more options you're going to have
and that's not a very satisfying answer
because there are a lot of guys out
there who are not doing particularly
well and it's not necessarily because
they haven't been trying maybe they've

[56:00]
they haven't been trying maybe they've
been trying their asses off or they're
actually doing things well but they're
in a position that isn't very
prestigious like maybe they're yeah they
have a small plumbing company or
something like that and they make decent
money and they're well established they
have good values but that's certainly
not a very prestigious job
no well it is to me because and probably
to you because we're men and we value
these things but it's not necessarily
what people you know people think of
when they think of prestige they think
of Bank president and so forth
um yeah I'm not knocking plumbers but
I'm saying that most women aren't
sending them yeah DMS when they find out
that they're plumbers
yeah they're sending a phone call when
their pipes are blocked but
um so to speak but yeah and that's where
um I think when you're thinking of
prestige and accomplishment in life it
that that plumber who's doing well
professionally he may not be presenting
well in his in his personal life you

[57:01]
well in his in his personal life you
know maybe he doesn't know how to dress
well maybe he doesn't know how to carry
himself well and these are skills that
are easily developed much more easily
than learning how to plumb pipes
learning how to dress yourself learning
how to conduct yourself yeah these
things can be mastered agreed
so uh
I get what you're saying about the
standards and optionality
here's something that I've seen as a
clinician and among my personal friends
and it's somewhat surprising
is that
I've seen guys get married to women that
I thought were not great matches for
them because they evinced something akin
to like a biological clock and it
usually happens around round numbers
they're like I'm 30 I need to settle
down or I'm 40 if I don't find somebody
soon it's going to be too late for me
which to my mind always seemed like such
a feminine perspective but I see it
fairly often with with guys like they

[58:00]
fairly often with with guys like they
seem to feel like they have to operate
under the same time pressure as women
have you noticed this
I haven't seen so much of it but I hear
what you're saying and I I believe that
you're seeing it
yeah and now that I think yeah I have
seen it out there and I agree with you
it's it's not
it's not a relationship it's not a
perspective that men need to take as
much as women it's it's very real for
women because they have a different
timeline as you've mentioned ours is
ours is a little more delayed
but it sounds like you're you're talking
about guys who get a little bit panicked
and so they they enter relationships
because they're anxious about not having
a relationship yeah I'm bringing it up
because it seems like it's just another
form of scarcity so there's a form of
scarcity like I don't have a lot of
options so I can't exercise adequate
standards but another form is I don't
have enough time so I can't really
afford to exercise adequate standards I
have to just I don't want to be the old
dad who's at the PTA meetings falling
asleep because you didn't have a nap
so I need to find somebody now

[59:02]
so I need to find somebody now
yeah
the old guy that didn't have a nap yeah
I've been guilty that once or twice but
um
yeah and I I think part of the answer to
that is
um getting your sense of value squared
away as early as you can as a man and as
tough as a man because you gotta you
gotta figure out what you're gonna do
with your life you know we wake up one
day as young men and suddenly the world
is expecting something of us and we
hadn't really we haven't really
bargained for that some of us some of us
were trained that we're going to need to
produce but some of us just wake up one
day and suddenly we're in the position
now we haven't really figured out where
we're going and the sooner you figure it
out
the less the chance that you're going to
be 30 or 40 or 50 and have this sense of
dread that kind of missing out on
something here that I wanted
I see this a lot like about
a quarter of my private practice clients
I would call like Failure to Launch
cases and they're generally guys in
their 20s who don't have a relationship

[1:00:02]
their 20s who don't have a relationship
don't really have career prospects
they're still living with their parents
they often don't see the point they they
seem all they believe that they're
already so far behind that it's like
there's no point in even trying to catch
up they have very pessimistic and
hopeless view of the future
um I'm sure you're seeing this more
why do you think that is what what's the
what's causing this because I don't
think this has ever been the case
in human history
yeah I don't know I wonder if it's been
the case
um it certainly has been the case at
some point in some place but I hear what
you're saying this is kind of a unique
thing at least in in our society of
American society this is new where we
have guys who are really struggling this
way and that's where I'm very conscious
in fact when I say when I talk to guys
about having standards that when that
guy hears me say have standards he's it
probably just evokes rage because he
probably hears me saying well just go
out and buy a Lamborghini well how you
know I got nothing going on here like

[1:01:00]
know I got nothing going on here like
that's that's a horrible thing for him
to hear but I think guys um
you know there there is tremendous
opportunity in this Society for guys who
really want to buckle down because and
this when you think about how I want to
say this because the expectations are so
well for men it's almost it's almost
like there's there's endless
opportunities for a guy who
is very smart and strategic about how
he's going to allocate his resources and
so maybe going and getting a degree in
sociology isn't the thing for a guy to
do these days but maybe starting a
plumbing company is and if he can build
other skills social skills on top of
that
um you know there's still there's no end
of opportunity out there and I'm not
sure what's causing
this hopelessness and this nihilism
among so many young men
yeah
because while the world is still
competitive
if so many men are struggling we could

[1:02:02]
if so many men are struggling we could
also make the argument that it has never
been easier in the history of mankind to
be an extraordinary man
yeah I think that's a much more eloquent
way of what I was stumbling around
trying to say a minute ago
but the guy who's depressed and really
that's a lot of times what we're talking
about is a guy ends up feeling depressed
and depressed as a non-specific symptom
right it's like having a fever we don't
know what depression means but if a
person if a guy is depressed as a result
of the sense that there's no way for him
to succeed
getting out of depression is tough
because what it takes is action and
depression steals your incentive your
your energy to go out and act and and so
pulling yourself at it you know I'm
talking to a clinician I know you know
but for anyone who doesn't it there's
this
it's tempting to say to somebody who's
depressed well you just need to get out
there and you just need to you know you
need to get up and put your shoes on and
just get out there tomorrow and that's

[1:03:01]
just get out there tomorrow and that's
easy to say but when you're in a
depressed state it's the hardest thing
in the world to do
and there's some truth to it I mean
there's there's the uh
absolutely there's the perspective that
if you simply relent to the behavioral
impulse
suggested by depression which is
inaction that the depression just gets
bigger and you're feeding it and
Marshall and talks about this in terms
of opposite action is that if you want
an emotion to diminish you have to be
willing to execute the behavior that's
diametrically opposed to the suggestion
of the emotion so if depression is
telling you to do nothing to be inactive
to withdraw to isolate on some level
even though it's very very hard and
extremely uncomfortable and it feels
very alien to you in that moment you
kind of have to force yourself to do the
opposite of all those things
and to be willing to abide in a state
where it feels inauthentic it feels
strange it feels alienating

[1:04:01]
strange it feels alienating
long enough for like the dissonance to
resolve
on the side of your action
because that's why opposite action works
for them I know you understand this but
like if if you're doing something at
odds with how you're feeling your mind
is like this doesn't make sense there's
dissonance there and ultimately it tends
to give precedence to collapsing on the
side of action because that's more of a
reliable predictor of how you should be
feeling is what you're doing and we see
that when we judge other people it's
like don't really focus on how they feel
don't really focus so much on what they
say but watch what they do that's a more
reliable predictor of of how they really
feel
and what's really going on absolutely
that's all very well said and Marshall
Linehan and dialectical behavior therapy
it's brilliant stuff I think everybody
should read it because it's got skills
for everybody so yeah well said well
speaking of things that I think

[1:05:00]
speaking of things that I think
everybody should read I think that every
man should read the Tactical guide to
women which you pitched yourself but I'm
going to pitch here uh I'm I'm not even
getting like an affiliate cut here I
just think that this is a fantastic book
I read it twice I've I've bought copies
for other people
I can't hold it up right now because my
copy is actually loaned out to somebody
else right now but I think it's a
fantastic book
and um
I think it's really really helpful
and it provides a clear and systematic
framework for guys to rationally examine
their their women in their lives and
it's the market
did not have an entry that did quite
that and I think your book does it very
well so thank you so much for writing
that appreciate it I hope that other
people will will check it out because it
definitely deserves to be read
I really appreciate that you got any
last words for us today
uh no I'm always bad with the last words
part
I should I should prepare a list of of

[1:06:01]
I should I should prepare a list of of
closing thoughts I think is there
anything else you want to pitch you want
us to know about
do you have a channel if someone wants
to get in touch with you how can they do
that anything like that I have a website
called ironshrink.com it's a Blog that I
occasionally post at pretty pretty
rarely but I'm also on Twitter at
ironshrink
and uh that's about it got another book
coming out September which will be a
follow-up to the Tactical guide to women
a little a little different angle on the
same question of how do you vet women in
relationships
very exciting I can't wait for that to
hit well thank you so much for
pretending like you haven't read it you
actually read ah I didn't enough you
were kind enough to read an early draft
so that I can make some necessary
changes you gave me some some
unbelievably useful feedback so when the
book comes out however good it is is 10
gooder because of of what she had to
offer there oh that's very sweet and as
I said it was uh it was an honor to read
your Advanced copy

[1:07:00]
your Advanced copy
um it's going to be a great book it's
going to help a lot of people
uh so thank you so much for
participating in this first experiment
we'll see how it goes uh and we'll talk
soon
all right thanks Ryan bye-bye
