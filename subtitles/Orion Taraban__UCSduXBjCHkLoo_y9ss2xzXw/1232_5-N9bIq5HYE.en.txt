I want to ask you cuz you said about the
ease of being a woman that's in her 20s
in the dating world and you said that
men who are younger tend to have it
harder
&gt;&gt; which obviously is so true because all
these stats show how little men actually
get matches on all these dating
profiles.
&gt;&gt; That's awful.
&gt;&gt; I want to ask you based on your
experience specifically focused on men
who are in these younger years. What is
the number one mistake? Uh I do think
that men on some level kind of have to
make a sacrifice of their 20s and they
have to devote them their energies and
their attention to building something uh
building their bodies, building their
business, building their lifestyle and
to give up trying to find your place in
[music] the world. This is an
interesting concept. It's one that I
believed when I was younger like I have
to find my place. Simone de Bobo talks
about this very persuasively is like the
world is always ever full. Like if I
wasn't here, if I was never born, you

wasn't here, if I was never born, you
two probably wouldn't be thinking
there's an Orion sized hole in the world
somewhere, you know, it would seem like
everything was was full and complete. No
matter if there's a billion people in
the world or 10 billion people in the
world, we don't miss that which has
never been.
&gt;&gt; So there's not like an empty space
that's just waiting for you to arrive.
And I used to think that when I was
younger, I bet a lot of guys do. It's
like, I need to find my scene, you know?
I need to find the right career. It's
like they're just waiting for me to to
show up. And it's like that doesn't
happen because the world is always ever
full. So the way to find your place in
the world is to build it for yourself.
And to build it among other people, the
best way to do that is to is to look
very closely at what people need and to
satisfy those needs.
