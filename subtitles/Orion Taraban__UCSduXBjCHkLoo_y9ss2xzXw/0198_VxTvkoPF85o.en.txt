i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
the worst thing to say
in a dating profile
this one is especially for the ladies
and be sure to listen until the end
where i'll reveal a better approach
ladies if you are straight and you're
looking to attract a man using a dating
app i'm going to ask you to seriously
consider steering clear of this phrase i
think i understand where you're coming
from by using it so bear with me i'll
explain why it's a bad idea in a moment
the phrase that i want you to consider
removing from your dating profile is
that you're looking for a serious
relationship
it's the serious relationship part
that's particularly problematic now i
get where you're coming from ladies
you've likely dated casually in the past
but now you're looking to settle down
get married start a family and you don't

[01:00]
get married start a family and you don't
want to waste your time in relationships
that are unlikely to take you to that
destination i understand that
but there are a few problems with
approaching dating in this way first and
foremost this is like the first
impression that you're giving men
and what does this phrase conjure up for
me personally the phrase serious
relationship makes me think that we're
going to have a lot of uncomfortable
conversations about improving our
communication and take out life
insurance policies
like a serious relationship does not
sound fun
it sounds well
serious
and it makes me think that i'm signing
up for a second unpaid job with lousy
benefits no thank you
look dating is supposed to be fun and
love is supposed to be playful and warm
a serious relationship does not
psychologically associate with any of
these things
it also only tends to attract the men
with no real options
think about it if i'm a guy who is

[02:01]
think about it if i'm a guy who is
attractive to many women
and has good optionality
why would i forego all that for a woman
i've never met who will only date me if
i tell her i want a wife and kids i mean
ladies you're just asking to be lied to
the man who would agree to that
honestly
likely has no better option
and is that the man you want a serious
relationship with anyway
here's the thing
you can't really expect this type of
relationship from the outset
a serious relationship is like a
marriage which is a commitment at least
theoretically for life
the closest analogs we have to this in
the professional arena
are a tenured professor or a partner in
a law firm
you don't just put in your linkedin
profile i'm looking for a tenured
professorship
you start out as an associate professor
and then you publish and teach and rise
in the ranks generally it takes 10 to 12

[03:01]
in the ranks generally it takes 10 to 12
years
to become a tenured professor
and that's just for the rest of your
career not even the rest of your life
same thing with being the partner of a
law firm you start out as an associate
and you pay your dues and you climb the
ladder it takes at least a decade to
arrive at the position of privilege and
security
marriage is no different
saying you want a serious relationship
on your initial application
sounds like you want to skip straight to
partner and professor it doesn't work
like that now relationships aren't all
fun and games
but you shouldn't lead with the serious
and effortful dimension of relationships
that's just poor advertising
it's counter-intuitive
but the best way to get into a long-term
relationship especially as a woman
is no different from the best way to
date casually
think about it
when have you got most emotionally
involved with someone
in in the beginning you probably thought

[04:02]
in in the beginning you probably thought
oh this is never going to be anything
serious so i'm just going to relax and
have fun take it easy spend some time
together and you know what
that's exactly the recipe for building
intimacy
and over time if you share the same
values and you continue to enjoy each
other's company that casual arrangement
can turn into a long-term relationship
of course it doesn't always but it's
actually your best bet
this is because the pressure is off and
people let their guard down which makes
building emotional connection easier
not looking for a relationship is a
trojan horse
for getting into a relationship
