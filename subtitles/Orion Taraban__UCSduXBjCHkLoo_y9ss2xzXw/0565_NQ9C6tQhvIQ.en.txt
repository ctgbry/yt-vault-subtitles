my model for love is the sun which just
gives it just shines and it's not
worried that this guy down here didn't
depreciate the sunshine today or that
this person's like well I never asked to
be born or to look at the Sun or it's
like the sun is so abundant in its own
effulgence that it just shines and it
doesn't even worry about how it's being
received if it's being ignored or
appreciated and I think that's the
humility of Love also which is Maybe
what warms the sun's heart you know pun
intended is that people down here are
just sort of carrying on with their
lives without really any consideration
for the sun because if we really stopped
for a moment and thought man all of life
would be extinct in the matter of days
if the sun just disappeared or stopped
shining like how much of our lives would
be devoted to like giving praise to the
Sun and appreciating the Sun and we
wouldn't be able to sit here and have a
conversation too busy' be too busy just
making sure that the sun was feeling
good about its sacrifice
