I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology on the
topic of today's short talk is why
successful men cheat this is a
fascinating question
because it does seem to be a rampant
phenomenon among successful men doesn't
it we see this behavior in presidents in
movie stars and world-class athletes and
billionaires
it just doesn't seem like a coincidence
that all these men who come from all
different walks of life and who attain
success in so many independent domains
of achievement
would just happen to manifest the same
behavior as especially given how
socially unacceptable the behavior is
I also don't think we can just call them
narcissists I'm sure some of them are
however in this case it would kind of be
affirming the consequence so maybe
there's something else in play here
and before I get into what that might be
please remember to like this video And

[01:01]
subscribe to this channel it takes less
than a second costs you nothing and it's
an easy way to get a hit of dopamine so
do the thing
on the surface
the cheating behavior of successful men
is entirely irrational
and why is that because in such cases
the risk reward profile is insanely High
a man might lose his fortune his career
his reputation his family and his social
opportunities
for a sexual escapade
I mean that's about as big a risk as a
man can take for potentially not a great
deal of pleasure
so it doesn't make rational sense that
successful men would risk it all just to
have an adventure
and these guys didn't arrive at the Apex
of their respective domains by being
irrational
my general rule of thumb is that most

[02:00]
my general rule of thumb is that most
people are mostly rational so if a
behavior looks irrational from the
outside that's usually due to the
interpretive frame through which we're
viewing it assuming is a person is
actually behaving rationally can allow
us to learn a lot about how the behavior
potentially makes sense
and the same is true here
cheating in successful men becomes
rational if we flip our understanding
it's not that these
these incests for the sake of an affair
it's that these men spent their lives
becoming successful in order to have the
affair to begin with
we can argue that the whole point of
their success of being the best in the
world in business and politics and
Athletics conscious or not
was to secure easier
access to more and more desirable women

[03:03]
access to more and more desirable women
that's why they work so hard
whether they were aware of it or not
a man would invent an eighth day of the
week if it meant he could get easier
access to more and more desirable women
now sometimes this is conscious like in
the movie Scarface first you get the
money then you get the power then you
get the women
we think it's ghost to say it out loud
but we all kind of know that it's true
at the very least we can all agree that
it's never the other way around like
first you get the women and then you get
the power and then you get the money
that statement makes no sense right
however in most cases this objective is
unconscious
couple this with the fact that men don't
really even begin to have good
optionality until they're in their 30s
and 40s
by which point most of them have already
gotten married
you have a recipe for infidelity

[04:01]
you have a recipe for infidelity
the desire coupled with the optionality
just makes for a Temptation larger than
many men can bear it's like the ring of
power even wholesome little Frodo gets
corrupted in the end
what you need to consider is that these
powerful successful men have actually
deferred their ratification for quite
some time sometimes decades in the
service of their Ambitions and
Excellence which is itself in the
service of better access to potential
mates
socially expecting a person to then
forego the sought after reward when it's
finally offered after years of deferment
is probably unreasonable
should these men never have gotten
married in the first place
potentially but people are complicated
and the reality is that sexual
exclusivity is just one aspect of most
marriages and it's generally not the
primary reason that is people don't get

[05:00]
primary reason that is people don't get
married to be sexually exclusive you can
do that without getting married they
typically get married to have children
and start a family in a protected way
throwing the baby out with the bath
water isn't always the best idea and of
course if we think this might be true
we should probably not be pressuring men
to get married which absolutely
continues to happen
Leo DiCaprio gets a lot of flack for
staying single and dating beautiful
women in his late 40s however if he had
gotten married he would have gotten even
more Flack if he cheated on his wife or
divorced her for a younger woman
the end goal of male ambition and drive
is to secure better and wider access to
women
it is what it is
and this of course is really only
possible because the outcomes of male
ambition and drive namely success and
Status happened to be
the general preferences of women
so it's a two-way street

[06:00]
so it's a two-way street
this is basically an evolutionary
argument which suggests that these roots
are very deep
and that's why the higher up the social
hierarchy you go the more you will see
this kind of behavior no matter what
hierarchy you look at
on some level it's the point the
hierarchies exist in the first place
and if we can leave aside any moral
judgments we might have
we should therefore expect to see this
behavior in successful and powerful men
in all walks of life in every domain of
Excellence which is of course what we do
in fact see
so let's not be so shocked when it
happens
what do you think
keep it respectful and let me know in
