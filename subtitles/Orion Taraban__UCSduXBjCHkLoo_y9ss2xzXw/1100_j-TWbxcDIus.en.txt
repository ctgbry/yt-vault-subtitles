When it comes to therapy, there's
certain things that maybe men don't want
to share with women. That's one idea.
And then the other idea is, you brought
this up before. I'm a therapist and I'm
trying to help a woman who's going
through a breakup. Her talking through
her feelings might legitimately be a way
to solve the problem of depression. But
for a man, it might be better for him to
go lift weights, for him to go do
something with his friends, for him to
go accomplish a goal with other men.
&gt;&gt; It's possible.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think in general women tend to
prefer emotional coping strategies and
men tend to prefer problem solving
strategies. That's why I've tended to
have more interest in my services when
they're branded as consultations than
therapy, especially in certain
demographics of men. Like black men do
not go to therapy like on a population
level, but they will go to seek out
coaching or consultation for instance.
So is this merely a marketing thing? Not
necessarily. Because as I talk about in
the fine print, a consultation is really
about timelmited actionoriented advice.
&gt;&gt; Uh the idea here is let's
collaboratively define the problem,

[01:00]
collaboratively define the problem,
propose some potential solutions and get
the out of my office and hopefully I
never see you again cuz they work. If
not, we can come back hopefully it moved
the ball down the field. We can see
where the new bottleneck is and iterate
until the problem is gone. And I think
that is a useful model for men and maybe
not as useful for women. BS.
