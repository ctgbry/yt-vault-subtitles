i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
dating hunting
versus fishing
all right so this is going to be an
introductory talk that will probably
require a few follow-up videos basically
there are two ways to date you can hunt
or you can fish
and it's important for men and women to
be able to do both however
the general rule of thumb is that the
higher your sexual marketplace value
the more hunting is a viable selection
strategy for you
and the lower your sexual marketplace
value
the more you'll have to rely on fishing
as a selection strategy now you can get
lots of good food from fishing so it's
not like hunting is necessarily better
than fishing it just requires a
different set of skills if you try to
fish like you hunt or vice versa you're
not going to have a lot of success so
what's the difference
in hunting you target one particular

[01:03]
in hunting you target one particular
prey
like when the lioness goes hunting there
is one particular gazelle that she
zeroes in on in the herd it could be any
gazelle but there is always one
particular gazelle that is targeted as
prey
translated into a dating strategy
hunting signals at a particular target
before the initial approach
a hunter says i have you in my sights
and i'm gonna get you i don't want
anybody else i want you
that's hunting
fishing
on the other hand is putting a net in
the water and bringing up lots of
options
when you go fishing you don't target a
particular fish you don't say i want to
catch that fish you put a line or even
better a net in the water and see what
bites
some of the fish you pull up are going
to be too small others are going to be
too stinky and some might not even be
fish at all you see what i'm saying but

[02:02]
fish at all you see what i'm saying but
from among that hall you get to choose
the best looking
tastiest options that you were able to
pull out the water you choose the best
from among what you were able to catch
in hunting
you go after what you want
and hope
they want you back in fishing
you choose who you want
from among those who already want you
makes sense
i'll talk more about how to do both in
future episodes
