in my teens and 20s I had a sixth sense
for women with whom I could have
spectacularly destructive relationships
I could walk into a room full of people
and like sniff out the women who would
be down to ride the roller coaster my
relationships were extremely passionate
and intense were characterized by brain
melting sexual chemistry and were
fundamentally unstable and destructive
however I would eventually get fed up
with the drama and when I did I sought
out a nice responsible emotionally
stable woman to date who absolutely
bored me to tears I did my best but I
could not drum up any authentic interest
in these women so we would inevitably
break up and I'd go back to find another
roller coaster eventually I got to the
place where I realized I had two equally
unattractive options either I could go
after what I was authentically attracted
to but was absolute poison for me or I
could resign myself to a decent woman
whom I felt nothing for if this is you
then have courage there is a way out of
this predicament
