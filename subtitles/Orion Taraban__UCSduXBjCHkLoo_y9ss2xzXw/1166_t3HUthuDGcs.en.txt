Have you ever wondered why it's almost
universally the female primate, whether
chimp or human, who makes more noise
during culation? It's almost as if, for
some strange reason, she's calling
attention to the fact that she's
currently on the business end of some
intense male interest. Now, why would a
female do that? Evolutionary psychology
has the answer to that brain buster.
Namely, because she's trying to ensure
that there isn't someone more suitable
around to mate with. If her cries
attract a bigger, stronger, healthier
male who succeeds in scaring off her
previous partner and picks up where he
left off, then the female has only
succeeded in improving her situation.
And if no other males in earshot dare
take up the challenge, then she can be
reasonably assured that her original
selection was correct. It's a no- lose
proposition for the female. Males, on
the other hand, tend to lower the volume

when attending to their monkey business,
as most of them would prefer not to
attract any undue attention, thereby
increasing the likelihood that they will
be the sole supplier to that company in
question. Now, it should go without
saying that neither males nor females
have any conscious intention of doing
any of this. But this behavior is a
little too aligned with each sex's
reproductive priorities to just be a
coincidence.
