i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
relationships and the concept of the
game
this is another continuation of my
episodes entitled life in the concept of
the game and the fundamental game of
human relationships so if you're new to
the channel you might want to start
there
look
if anything
with a goal and a set of rules is a game
then relationships are a game
why
because when you enter into a
relationship with another human being
you want something
that is your goal
it could be sex or money or friendship
or connection or competition or a loving
committed relationship or just a
companion to pass the time i'm not here
to judge but in every case you're going
to another person because you want
something from that person
and whether you like it or not there is
a set of rules associated with how to
attain that desired thing for instance
it would not be possible

[01:00]
it would not be possible
to win the game of a loving secure
family
if you were say an active abusive
alcoholic
if you sow chaos and destruction
you cannot create stable loving bonds
with others by definition it's just not
physically or should we say
psychologically possible
and if you can't act however you want to
get whatever you want then there must be
rules to getting what you want whether
you like it or not
so relationships are games because they
are goals plus rules
now when i talk about the game of
relationships or the game of attraction
the most common piece of negative
feedback i generally receive is
something like oh god i'm so tired of
game playing i just i'm just sick of it
it's so immature
it's like grow up it's a waste of my
time i don't play games and i don't
spend time with other people who play
games just be honest and straight up
what's so hard about that

[02:01]
what's so hard about that
okay
fair enough
but my point is that relationships are
inescapably games
because they are goals plus rules they
can't not be games
and this approach to relationships of
being forthright and sincere and direct
and authentic
is
a strategy
in the game of relationships
it's one way that people have developed
to get what they want from other people
it's kind of like you know certain car
dealerships that make a big point of
advertising they don't do negotiation
people are nervous about negotiating the
price of a car so we don't do that we
just put our best offer on the sticker
and what you see is what you get no
stress no pressure just straight talk
and fair dealing and that
is a strategy
to attract customers to buy cars and it
must work at least some of the time
otherwise that strategy wouldn't exist
as those dealerships would quickly go

[03:01]
as those dealerships would quickly go
out of business
now to say that car dealers are sincere
honest and authentic would be a little
disingenuous
they've adopted that strategy for a
reason
and we can see that it is a strategy
because we can imagine these dealers
like consciously choosing to do this
the issue is that in the game of
relationships
most people don't experience their
sincerity their authenticity their
honesty
as a strategy
because they don't think of these things
as something they've consciously chosen
to do in order to achieve a goal
but if it's the case that we're playing
games whether we're aware of them or not
then the things we do to obtain our
goals don't always have to be conscious
strategies
think about it
most of the things that we do
we don't really know why we do them
but if we were to examine that behavior
objectively we would generally discover
that we do them because they've been

[04:01]
that we do them because they've been
reinforced in some way in the past and
we believed they would be effective in
the present
but this belief and this reinforcement
more often than not occurs below the
threshold of awareness
our choices are not always conscious
but they are our choices
so what's the takeaway my point here is
that being honest and direct in
relationships doesn't mean you're not
playing games it means that you believe
that being honest and direct is your
best bet of getting what you want
which means that you're playing games as
much as the dishonest an indirect person
is
these are just two different ways of
going about getting what you want from
other people and in general
honesty and directness can be very good
strategies
in the game of human relationship
though other strategies have their place
in the game of please know as well and
if you want to learn more about those
strategies check out my episode on the
fundamental game of human relationships

[05:01]
fundamental game of human relationships
it all comes down to what you want and
i'm not here to judge or moralize and
say this is good and people should do
this and this is bad and people
shouldn't do that i'm going to tell you
how it is
and help you understand why people do
the things that they do
and one final word of advice
be cautious with anyone who insists a
little too loudly
that they don't play games
the lady often doth protest too much
