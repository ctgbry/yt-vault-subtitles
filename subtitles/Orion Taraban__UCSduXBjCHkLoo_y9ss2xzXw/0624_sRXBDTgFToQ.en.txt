I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is never
punish people for doing what you
want now you might be thinking Orion why
the [ __ ] would anybody punish somebody
for doing what they wanted well I'm here
to tell you that this unfortunate
decision occurs every single day and
today I'm going to explain why people do
this and what can be done
Instead This is a reality that I
encounter every week in my clinical
practice people aren't entirely
satisfied with their relationships and
they are attempting to influence their
Partners to change certain problematic
behaviors they want this person to do
more of certain things Andor less of
certain other things and in their minds
they kind of have an ideal template with
respect to what successful change is
supposed to look like now it's hard
enough to influence people to even make
an effort in the direction of doing what

[01:00]
an effort in the direction of doing what
you want especially if they are not
intrinsically motivated to do so and
this effort when it does occur is going
to feel very risky for the people in
question this is because they are likely
ambivalent about the change a part of
them might want to change and a part of
them might not want to change this means
that they might not really want to do
the thing but they might be willing to
kind of try for the sake of the
relationship what's more this might be
something that they've never done before
or haven't done in a very long time so
they may feel insecure or self-conscious
about the attempt in any case
ambivalence plus inexperience equals
emotional risk and this is why most
people frankly just won't even make the
effort and those that do in all
likelihood are going to fall far short
with respect to what you had envisioned
for the change and this is precisely
where people [ __ ] up if the other person

[02:00]
where people [ __ ] up if the other person
actually assumes the emotional risk and
makes an attempt to move in the
direction of your desired change then no
matter how fumbling or disappointing or
unsatisfying or imperfect their attempt
never ever ever punish them for their
effort if all you do in response to this
attempt is point out how far it falls
short of your ideal template then this
will likely be perceived as punitive to
the individual involved irrespective of
how softly you deliver your constructive
criticism and if you punish someone
despite their willingness to assume risk
and make an effort then good [ __ ]
luck ever trying to get that person to
make an effort again like seriously you
might never get another attempt out of
them
again if someone is willing to do
something that they've never done before
and might not entirely want to do just

[03:01]
and might not entirely want to do just
because you want them to do it then you
kind of have to expect that their
attempt will be somewhat awkward or
incompetent or hesitant or unsatisfying
that's to be expected my dudes the first
attempt might be five% of what you
ultimately imagine them capable of doing
however if you just focus on how poor
and unacceptable and problematic that 5%
still is I guarantee you'll never get to
10% and how you ever going to get to
100% if you can't even get to 10%
focusing on the 95% of what they're
expectedly still not doing right is
going to feel invalidating and
demotivating don't do this whenever
someone makes any kind of effort to move
in the direction of where you would like
them to go then you need to reward that
behavior no matter how rough or
unacceptable that effort might currently
be if it's moving in the right direction
ction it needs to be rewarded this is

[04:03]
ction it needs to be rewarded this is
the power of shaping guys now before I
go any further if you're liking what
you're hearing then please consider
sending this episode to someone who
might benefit from its message because
it's Word of Mouth referrals like this
that really helped to make the channel
grow I'm also proud to announce that my
book the value of others is now
available for pre-sale on Amazon I'm
also writing original content for my
free newsletter every week if you'd like

website finally please fill out an
inquiry form on my website if you're
interested in booking a paid
consultation links to everything in the
description okay let's get back to
it now have you ever been to
SeaWorld how do you think the trainers
got those Dolphins to jump in the air
and do like three back flips and hit a
beachball through a flaming hoop before
diving into a center of a whirl poool
Etc like do you think they did that on
the their first try you think a dolphin

[05:01]
the their first try you think a dolphin
just kind of spontaneously did that you
think it was a dolphin's idea to behave
that way and yet here we are what those
trainers were able to do was shape the
Dolphin's Behavior over time shaping is
a term from behavioral psychology it
means to reward successive
approximations of the target Behavior
I'll repeat that shaping means to reward
successive approximations of the target
behavior in this way you kind of create
a game of hot and cold with respect to
your reinforcement contingencies when
people get warmer that is when they move
in the direction of where you want them
to go you reward them and when people
get colder that is when they move not in
the direction of where you want them to
go you don't reward them notice I didn't
say you punish them you shouldn't do
that you just shouldn't reward them and
through shap in all kinds of living

[06:01]
through shap in all kinds of living
things can be helped to perform all
kinds of wonderful and amazing feats
irrespective of whether they comprehend
or can comprehend the ultimate purpose
of this process it's powerful stuff and
all that is required is the willingness
to reward successive approximations of
the target Behavior now this can take
months this can even take years but it
almost always works and it even works in
dependent of the awareness of both the
person doing the rewarding and the
person being rewarded that is neither
party needs to know that this is what
they're doing and in fact most people
shape other people's behavior
unconsciously and unintentionally which
is how they end up in Dysfunctional
interpersonal patterns that they didn't
consciously want so my perspective is
that shaping is going to happen anyway
so you might as well become aare aare of
the process and implement it

[07:02]
the process and implement it
intentionally and in this way people can
be supported to do all kinds of positive
things that a they might not ever
spontaneously do themselves B they may
not entirely want to do and C might be
for their own benefit like if a person
can be shaped to be a better partner for
their partner how is that not mutually
beneficial in the majority of cases it's
a win-win situation
now you'll encounter backsliding
throughout the shaping process however
it's essential that this backsliding not
be actively punished just remove the
reward and replace it with a neutral
non-reinforcing response and when they
once again start to move in the
direction you want them to go just
reinstate the reinforcement the idea is
to reward moving an inch as opposed to
punish just moving an inch because let
me tell you punishing people for making

[08:00]
me tell you punishing people for making
an effort is one of the shest ways to
[ __ ] people up psychologically like the
people who are punished for doing what
they are supposed to do can become
villainous not a good idea it's also
incredibly counterproductive with
respect to your chosen goals it's like
fool me once shame on you fool me twice
you ain't gonna fool me again so if you
want to influence your partner to do
what you want them to do then you're
going to have to be patient you're going
to have to be kind and you're going to
have to be generous and if you can't be
those things for whatever reason you
probably shouldn't try to influence
their behavior because you're probably
just going to [ __ ] it up and make it
harder for everybody it's very difficult
to change a pre-existing Habit in some
cases it's actually a better idea to
just break up and start over with
someone who is naturally closer to the
behavior you have in mind than to try to
shape a pre-existing partner in the
direction of that goal if that behavior
is that important to you the process is

[09:02]
is that important to you the process is
going to take time and energy and
resources but if you don't want to break
up then you have to kind of be available
for the Long Haul and to be willing to
help your partner through encouragement
and validation and acknowledgement and
praise to become who you'd prefer them
to be what do you think does this fit
