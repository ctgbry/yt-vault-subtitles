This is interesting. So, one of the
reasons why I got into psychology is
because I was helped very much by my own
therapy in my 20s. And I'd seen a few
people in my early 20s. And I think the
best that I could say for them is they
didn't make me worse. Though maybe a
couple of them did, like I actually
ended up not as good as when I started.
But when I found somebody that I felt
could really help me, and I felt that
from the very first session, I worked
with him for like seven years. And he
was a Yungian dream analyst. So every
hour we would get together and I'd tell
him some background of my life and then
I tell him a recent dream and we would
analyze that together. In the beginning
he would analyze it and as I got more
advanced we would analyze it together.
And because that was really my model for
effective and successful therapy. I
thought that I was going to be like him.
And so the first couple years when I was
in grad school starting my internships I
I was doing my best to sort of channel
my own therapist because it's a very
strange profession David. It's not like
it's very rare for therapists to know if
they're actually any good. You
don't get to see what anybody else does

don't get to see what anybody else does
like by definition because of the
confidential nature of the work. So I
think it's also very easy for people to
to think that they're doing a great job
and maybe they're they're not because
what's the point of comparison? What's
the feedback?
