I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is fully
half full
so I coined this phrase to describe the
practice of contentment contentment is
the heart of Happiness most people are
trying to be happy if you want to be
happy you must cultivate the practice of
contentment you can't have the one
without the other
now contentment isn't easy but it's
actually very simple
and thank God for that it's because of
this Simplicity that contentment is
actually available to all of us
regardless of our circumstances it would
be quite a tragedy quite an oversight in
the millions of years of human evolution
if our contentment were dependent on
external circumstances given how unfair
the distribution of resources across the
face of the planet is
so fortunately that's not the case
contentment is available to all of us
independent and irrespective of these

[01:02]
independent and irrespective of these
circumstances
now before I explain what the practice
of contentment entails please be sure to
like this episode And subscribe to this
channel it takes less than a second
costs you nothing and it's just as
simple as contentment so do the thing
all right so contentment is basically
the practice of turning toward the
present moment and accepting it as
enough accepting it as sufficient
that's it that's the practice of
contentment now this definition is tough
to swallow for a lot of people and these
folks say to me but Orion my present
moment is not enough that's the problem
I'm broke I'm lonely I'm miserable and
I'm afraid that if I were to take your
advice and accept my present moment as
enough I would become complacent and
unwilling to do the work to make my

[02:01]
unwilling to do the work to make my
present moment better
okay fair enough so how do we handle
this objection personally I believe that
contentment is not antithetical to
having goals if you're dissatisfied with
being broke you have a goal you want to
make money if you're dissatisfied with
being lonely you have a goal you want a
relationship if you're dissatisfied with
being miserable you have a goal you want
to be
filled these are great goals to have
but here's the thing having a goal and
working towards it is actually
independent of accepting where you are
in the process of attaining that goal
which can be sufficient to the present
moment
let's make this concrete with a specific
example
this glass here
has some water in it
The Optimist would say that it's half
full and the pessimist would say that
it's half empty so

[03:01]
it's half empty so
who is correct well kind of neither one
of them is correct because both of them
are comparing this reality that is
actually present in front of them the
glass that has got some water in it to
an abstraction that doesn't actually
exist an abstraction that only exists as
an idea in their own minds
The Optimist is comparing this reality
to An Empty Glass which isn't actually
there
this basis of comparison is inherent in
the language half full
and this comparison Alters his
perception of reality
on the other hand the pessimist is
comparing this reality to a full glass
which also isn't actually there and the
basis of this comparison is also
inherent in his language half empty
and this comparison Alters his
perception of reality neither is
actually seeing reality clearly but the
Distortion is so close to perception
that most people don't notice it

[04:01]
that most people don't notice it
the practice of contentment is to kind
of see the glass
as fully half full
it is full and complete in its halfness
and incompleteness
a perfect description as even the
concept of halfness refers to wholeness
but hopefully you get the idea
and even if you add more water or take
some water away the glass is still fully
and completely itself at every step of
the process it's always whole even as it
increases its volume
it's only not whole in comparison to an
abstraction that exists in your own mind
the more that we can see things as they
are not as they could be or should be or
might be the more that we see that the
present moment is actually enough
it's full
that's the incredible thing about

[05:00]
that's the incredible thing about
reality you can't add to it
and you can't take anything from it it
is inviolably whole at every moment
throughout eternity
and the more we perceive reality the
more we can also participate in that
wholeness which facilitates the practice
of contentment which itself is one of
the primary components of human
happiness
hopefully that makes sense what do you
think how do you practice contentment
