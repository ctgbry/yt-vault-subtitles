i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks better living through psychology
and the topic of today's short talk is
how to overcome your hesitation
so i work with a number of clients who
work in sales and i was speaking with
one of them the other day and he used a
phrase that caught my attention he the
phrase was
eat the frog
i had never heard that before and it was
obviously very evocative so i asked him
what it meant
and he said okay
imagine i put a frog on a plate and
asked you to eat it
the longer you look at that frog
the longer you hesitate the longer you
procrastinate the more disgusting and
slimy and gross that frog will become
and the harder it will be for you to eat
it
so
knowing this if someone puts a frog on
your plate your best bet is to eat that
frog as quickly as possible
now he told me that this was something
that he was taught in the context of
cold calling which is an activity that

cold calling which is an activity that
most people approach with some degree of
reluctance the idea here is that the
moment you think about making the call
that's the moment that the frog is put
on your plate and so your best move is
to pick up the phone
and gobble it down as quickly as
possible
i love this metaphor because you can use
it in all kinds of different situations
you can use this in dating and pickup
you see somebody you're attracted to eat
the frog and go up and talk to them
you can use this in developing a new
habit you're thinking of working out eat
the frog and do 20 push-ups you can do
this in doing your chores you notice the
sink full of dishes eat the frog and get
your hands wet get going before you give
doubt enough time to enter your mind and
avoid the issue through action
sometimes you just gotta eat the frog
