But I think mostly the guys I talk to
are having trouble finding a woman that
they want to have a long-term
relationship with or more commonly now
older guys who are having marital
difficulties and wanting to see if they
could potentially turn things around. I
personally struggle to know how to help
people who just can't get their foot in
the door with women because sometimes I
meet these guys are actually great.
They've got good job. There's nothing
wrong with them on paper. There's
actually really good guys. It's just
that they just for some reason can't get
their foot in the door with a lot of
women. So I struggle to help those men
if I'm being totally honest. I don't
know what what do you usually tell these
men? Well to I tell them the part that
women always leave out. So there has to
be some sort of attraction problem. And
I try to get them to understand that it
might be a marketing issue. It's like
let's assume that you're actually a
fantastic product. You're a great guy
and any woman would be lucky to have
you. Probably not true but we can start
with that premise. It's like but people
aren't buying. Why is it an awareness
issue? Do people don't not know that
your product exists? Like, is it a
branding? Are you communicating with

branding? Are you communicating with
your style, with your presence, with
your tone, like kind of the lifestyle
and the the relationship that you're
potentially offering? Like, these are
behaviors. These are ways of presenting
yourself to the world. And it's not a
personal thing. We can tweak some of
those things as long as you're not
identified with them. And we'll keep
playing with the knobs until we see some
more interest in success from the
opposite
