I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax
Better Living Through psychology and the
topic of today's short talk is why I
talk about sex and money
the fact that I devote so many episodes
to these two topics might be curious to
some of you after all isn't this psychax
Better Living Through psychology and
aren't I a psychologist shouldn't I be
talking about like mindfulness and
depression or something why do I talk so
much about sex and money
aren't these superficial things what do
they really have to do with psychology
and self-fulfillment
clear question and I will attempt to
answer it in today's episode but before
I get into it please remember to like

all right so there are two answers to
this question so be sure to watch the
very end because they are radically
different from each other but both kind
of important so in the first place I
talk about sex and money because a lot
of the problems that humans are subject
to experiencing anxieties depressions
neuroses of all kinds can actually be
solved
when people start to get what they want
for instance a man who feels like he
cannot have the kind of relationship he
would like with a woman is going to have
a hard time feeling confident or
maintaining a certain level of
self-esteem or achieving a certain
degree of satisfaction in his life he's
also likely going to be feeling lonely
angry and hopeless
by the same token a woman who's always
worried about money is going to be
subject to all kinds of anxieties and
uncertainties about the future she's
going to be counting every dollar which
is kind of a mean and undignified way to

[02:01]
is kind of a mean and undignified way to
live to be honest and she's also likely
going to feel envious depressed and
resentful
if you do not have enough love sex or
money in your life it's really hard to
thrive
so helping people get access
to Sex and Money serves to resolve a lot
of so-called mental illnesses a lot of
mental illness is actually due to being
low in a status hierarchy this has been
well documented in primate societies
which tend to have very rigid
hierarchical structures the lower down a
primate is in the social hierarchy the
more he tends to exhibit signs
emblematic of depression neuroses and
behavioral abnormalities and when that
same primate is elevated in the social
hierarchy for whatever reason a lot of
these signs and symptoms tend to
disappear
they're not really due to
neurotransmitters or genetics they're
due to the awareness on some level that

[03:01]
due to the awareness on some level that
they're at the bottom of the ladder
so if folks can find a way to elevate
themselves within their social
hierarchies then this by itself will do
much to treat a lot of clinical
syndromes so that's one reason
now the second reason is a bit more high
level and here it is
I talk a lot about sex and money because
I want to help people understand that at
the highest levels of existence
these things are really not that
important
money does not actually solve all your
problems having access to all the sex in
the world will not make you happy
the issue is that until you actually
have a lot of money and until you
actually have a lot of access to sex and
relationships
you're gonna think I'm full of [ __ ]
and for good reason it would sort of be
like listening to a billionaire say
money isn't everything
it's pretty easy to roll your eyes at

[04:02]
it's pretty easy to roll your eyes at
such a statement like yeah yeah easy for
you to say buddy
until you actually have a lot of money
and a lot of access to sex and
relationships the vast majority of
people are going to continue to believe
that these things have the capacity to
fulfill them on a deep level
and the fact of the matter is the
billionaire is Right money isn't
everything the player is Right sleeping
with thousands of women isn't fulfilling
but you kind of need to have a lot of
money and a lot of sex to get to that
point
otherwise you're just gonna think it's
[ __ ]
so by helping people get better access
to sex and relationships by helping
people earn more money and Achieve at a
higher level I'm actually working to
facilitate their disappointment with
these things
and the only way to really do that is to
help people get them
so that they can realize for themselves

[05:00]
so that they can realize for themselves
that they're not all they're cracked up
to be until that happens they will
continue to hope vainly that they are
capable of providing more than they can
and ideally you want to accelerate this
disappointment process as quickly as
possible those who chase money their
entire lives only to realize that 70 how
much they missed out on are actually
tragic figures
their disappointment came too late
So to avoid this let's get really good
really fast at getting access to sex and
relationships let's get really good
really fast at making money and
achieving highly that way we can see
things for what they really are no more
no less don't get me wrong I Am pro
money and I love sex I have a very
healthy drive for these things
but I also don't allow myself to pretend
that they can offer me more than they
can
and this understanding allows me to look

[06:00]
and this understanding allows me to look
for the truly important things in life
in more appropriate places
what do you think how has disappointment
