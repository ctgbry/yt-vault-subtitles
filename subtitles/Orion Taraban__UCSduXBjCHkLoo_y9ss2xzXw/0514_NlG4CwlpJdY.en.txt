this is going to sound depressing but
the only way people really get what they
want in romantic relationships is by
playing games I mean they literally call
Men's ability to get sex from women game
and as I discussed in a recent episode
women need game too and they need game
to get a committed relationship if you
were to strip away all of the games all
that would remain would be the
negotiation of an explicit value
proposition which is precisely what
happens in arranged marriages it would
feel like a business deal which is
probably not inaccurate most people
especially most women don't want their
relationships to feel that way they want
them to feel organic and emotional and
non-transactional people want to feel
like their partners are giving them what
they want because they want to do it not
because of what they're getting in
return so make the proposition too
explicit and it not only breaks the
magic spell it might also highlight a
pretty large value discrepancy between
the two parties again I don't play games
is a lie and you should be very cautious
about moving forward with anybody who
has the audacity to claim that they
don't
