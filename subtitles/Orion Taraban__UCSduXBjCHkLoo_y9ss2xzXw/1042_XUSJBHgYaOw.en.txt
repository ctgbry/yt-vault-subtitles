I do think though, especially in the
20s, the average woman has a higher
sexual marketplace value than the
average man. So, she has more points on
the scoreboard as it were. So, she tends

might need to make something happen. I
make the argument in the book that it's
not inherent to the gender. It's not
always that women are saying no, no, no,
and men are always yes, yes, yes. It has
to do with who has um more options and
who has a greater value within the
sexual marketplace. And just like when
in a game of soccer, when one team is up
many points, they switch to defense and
the other team that's down switches to a
more aggressive offense. If for whatever
reason in the next half that gets
switched around, you see the same
strategy being adopted by the different
team. So it's not really inherent to the
team, it's inherent to the balance of
power that's revealed by the scorecard
as it were. So you can certainly see

because who knows who they're dealing
