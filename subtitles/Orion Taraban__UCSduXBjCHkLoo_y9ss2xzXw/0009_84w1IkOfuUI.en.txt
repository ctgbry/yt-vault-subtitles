i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych
hacks
better living through psychology and the
topic of today's short discussion
is progress demands
extraordinary effort extraordinary
effort ordinary effort
doesn't contribute to progress this is
just sort of in the fabric of reality
this the chips are kind of stacked
against us you can see this
if you just look at things on a purely
physical plane is that
entropy increases within closed systems
as a function of time which basically
disorder
mounts if you don't clean your house it
will eventually become dusty
disorganized and it will deteriorate
over time
if you don't attend to your physical
health
it will degrade and decompensate
over time if we do
nothing things get worse if we do
and on some level i think this is

[01:02]
and on some level i think this is
was kind of woven into the fact the
fabric of reality so
it gives us the necessity to to have
something to do
because if we do nothing we suffer and
the pain accumulates
but here's the thing if we just do um
what we need to if we just make an
ordinary effort that's sufficient for
maintenance that's sufficient to prevent
decay that doesn't mean progress
you have to work just to maintain the
status quo
okay so if you're just putting in an
ordinary amount of effort
you certainly can't reasonably expect
that you're going to see
much if any significant progress in your
life
because that ordinary effort is going
towards the maintenance of the status
quo
to undo the entropy of decay associated
with the fabric of reality
okay so if we want to actually
move beyond what we currently have we

[02:00]
move beyond what we currently have we
have to go beyond the effort
needed for maintenance and that's also
painful
so the the gates on either side of the
status quo are pain
if we do nothing and our status quo
decompensates
that's painful if we want to make an
extraordinary effort
and and make progress in a certain
domain of our life
that's also associated with pain the
pain of growth
i mean you can think about it from a
purely physical perspective to build a
muscle
it's painful why because you're actually
kind of like tearing on a microscopic
level the muscle
so that it will the body will build it
back stronger
so that's that's what muscle fatigue is
it's the sensation
of muscles being being strained and
damaged
so that the body will build them back
stronger
so if you want to make ex progress in
your life
then be prepared to make a an
extraordinary effort
and extraordinary is defined by what

[03:01]
and extraordinary is defined by what
your ordinary
is if your ordinary is
you know it's down here extraordinary is
up here if your name is up here
extraordinary is up here so you set like
a homeostatic
thermometer what your baseline ordinary
is and if you want to
improve from there you're going to have
to put in more effort
than is associated with pure maintenance
